We want to get you the best game possible so for the final push: ALL BACKERS GET ALL PLANNED (& unannounced) REWARDS if we reach $30,000!  UNLOCKED!!\nThis means EVERYONE gets:\nUpgraded to the full core game of 80 Invention Cards!\nUpgraded core game to include 300 Hilarious Pitch Prompt Cards!\nWith Massive Gratitude - Stacy  \nWHAT THE WHAT?! is a 3-10 person party game where players compete to invent outrageous new uses for genuine old time inventions.\nFeaturing audacious attempts, fantastic fails and clever contraptions from the world's patent archives.\nThere are Self Saluting Hats, Rocking Chair Bathtubs, Flying Machines and a few that would likely kill you.\nResearchers from the Smithsonian and White House Historical Association have spent hours curating 100 inventions from circa 1581 to today. \nWe brought this game to Kickstarter because its curious community rises up to support the bold, outlandish creators today. We believe many of you would have backed these incredible inventions.\nWhether it was a lack of access to funding, cultural constraints or an inability to share their message widely, the majority of these inventions, never got past the patent or prototype stage. With your help we can now bring them to life!\nOur beautifully illustrated Digital Booklet deep dives into the journey and motivations of some of the Inventors who, in our opinion, didn't fail, but inspire us with their try. \nMore exciting Stretch Goals planned! Become a backer to help unlock! \nTo unlock voting for which Illustration Card makes it to the final deck go to each social channel and follow us!  Once we hit our goals voting begins! \n\nThese are shipping estimates. Shipping will be added after the campaign in the pledge manager. The game is being manufactured in China and then shipped to the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia for fulfillment. There's currently a bottleneck in shipping containers driving overseas shipping costs way up. We'll keep all the backers in the loop as we learn more. Thanks for understanding. We are working hard to ship you these games at the lowest possible cost!\n Europe Zone 1: Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands\n Europe Zone 2: Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus (South), Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland\n Asia Zone 0: China, Hong Kong, Macao\n Asia Zone 1:  Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam\nDue to shipping fees and logistics, we are not able to ship to the following geographies at this time: Brazil, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Russia, Ukraine, Middle East, North Korea, Africa, South America.\n\nVAT - Because of the new laws and changes happening in some parts of the world, VAT will be added in the pledge manager. Depending on where backers are from, we will be collecting the appropriate VAT percentage based off of the total cost of the pledge. For the EU, UK, USA, Canada, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, we plan to ship from within these zones, meaning backers shouldn't incur customs charges.\n\nBailey Katz, Paul Katz, Leona & Ronald Katz, Jody Katz, Olivia Pritikin, Ben Pritikin, Joel Pritikin, Marty Shapiro, Shapiro Family, Elizabeth Umanzor, Betty Sosa, Carlos Pantano, Egerman/Nemoy Family, Audpop, Paige Williams, Yarrow Kraner, Tanya Thompson, Mary Couzin, Ramy Badie, Lynn Casey, Anita Landgraf, Tony Serebriany, Josh West, Hosanna Fox, Peyton Lovett, Britt Lovett, Lainie Etzioni, Mary Anne Richman, Carly McGinnis, Daniel Selleck, Jennifer Giambrone, Peggy Brown, David Begler, Devi Brown, Scout Willis, Will Christiansen, Scott Vierick, Dina Ramse, Kobi Yamada, Emily Chang, Lindsey Henn, Leslie Pierson, USM Family, Hatch Family, Sherre Hirsch, Reproject Team, AdMagic & Blackbox Team.\n This project is promoted by Jellop,  the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,400+ successful  Kickstarter projects with over $500M raised in total.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nThanks for checking out our Campaign! The following is meant to set expectations as it relates to this project and Kickstarter's terms of use. It outlines what you can count on from us as a creator as well as some of your responsibilities as a backer. By pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, content of the rewards, and the project are subject to change.\n\nYou are responsible for confirming your pledge, address, and other information required to ship your rewards to you in a timely manner. Until you confirm your pledge, we have no way of identifying which rewards you want to receive or where you wish to receive them. If you do not confirm your rewards in the pledge manager within 3 months of the conclusion of the campaign, you agree that Well Why Not Media has fulfilled its obligations to you in full for payment received. We are a small company and must have a fair timeframe in which to fulfill the games and shipping. \n\nWe work with world-class shipping partners, but they are only as good as the information they are provided. It is your responsibility to monitor the project's status and update your address as needed prior to fulfillment. The best way to monitor the project's status is to read our Kickstarter Updates. Should you provide an incorrect or out-of-date address, you will be responsible for costs incurred if a reshipment or reroute is needed.\n\nThat said, even with world-class partners and correct addresses, shipments are sometimes damaged or lost. If a part of your order, other than a game box, is damaged, we will provide free replacement parts for as long as we have them available. If a shipment is not marked as delivered, we will cover the cost of a reshipment. Additionally, we will cover the cost of 1 re-shipment for any lost or stolen package within 2 weeks of the package being marked as delivered and after our shipping partners conduct an investigation with the carrier.\n\nOur sincere goal is for you to be the first in the world to play our games. As such, we will not sell What the What?! game at any convention or on our webstore until we have delivered games to a majority of our Backers. Additionally, we will not release What the What?! game to retail until 30 days after the majority of fulfillment in a given country is complete. We are so grateful to you, our backers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith over 6 years of growing my first card game I co-created called Not Parent Approved from a friends and family Kickstarter to becoming a best seller card game on Amazon, I understand what it takes to bring this game to market. Production of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straight forward product to make. The biggest challenge would actually be if you blow us out of water. But we are ready to do this!\n\nWe are using the incredible game veterans at AdMagic to print the game- the ones that handled the scale, quality and professionalism of Exploding Kittens, Cards Against Humanity and many more to Kickstarter backers. The awesome teams at Blackbox will fulfill and send out the games to you once they are printed.\n\nWe recognize that COVID or shipping issues cause some logistic challenges. We are committed to keeping you updated!

In case of them not being active, they must be carried in the Item Bag taking up one space.\nThe player that uses more than one spell must choose which one to use when their action is performed.\nSkills\nBefore performing any action, the player must decide whether to use or not the Skill.\nThe Skill, just like Spells, will cost Power and the player will benefit from its stats when attacking.\nElite and Boss Skills\nThe deck corresponding to the enemy is prepared.\nA card is revealed each turn of the enemy and that card\u2019s action is performed.\nIf the Skill persists through various turns, the card is put aside, placing Time markers each turn of the enemy until the effect disappears.\n\n\nAs promised on the campaign comments, here is a video of the game captured on TableTop Simulator (TTS). Due to the current Co-VID situation, inviting unvaccinated people from outside JanduSoft, and without an antigen or PCR test would be irresponsible on our part, so that is why we decided to record the game using TTS instead of our printed prototype.\n\nInitially, our idea was having this video uploaded a couple of days ago, but we had an issue with OBS and we did not record the correct audio output, so the only voice in the video was that of the host of the game, and not the four invited players. So last night we gathered four players that worked with us on another playing test session, and this is the game we have uploaded.\nTablet Top Simulator gameplay of MiniQuest Adventures\nTake a look at the video here.\n\nOnce again, since this project has escalated so much, we didn\u2019t have time to script the TTS because it was not our priority, and the game is in a non updated version that we use for testing.\n\nNonetheless, we considered that it would be good to share this TTS game with our community so you can give us all the feedback you can. So the game will be available on the TTS workshop. (An early version, without the extras we have added throughout the campaign). If someone is interested in scripting it, please contact us. \n\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures on Tabletop Simulator\nPlay MiniQuest Adventures here\nThis is not the final version, and has been cut by hand, so we can assure you that although it looks good, the final product will be much better. The colors might be different to the final ones since the prototype has been printed in matte, and the final version will be printed in glossy paper.\nWhen we have the final prototype in our hands we will post an update on the campaign to show the difference in the current finishes and the final ones, and also show you the size of the game inside the box-\nA lot of things inside the box\nTypical game setup\nPLAY\n\n*Handcrafting the prototype tokens\nDiscover the Heroes\n\n\nMartina is a Human Sorceress that takes advantage of her great power to cast devastating spells.\nHer innate ability will allow her to recover power as long as there are enemies nearby.\nDurlan is a relentless Explorer Elf that will take advantage of his movement to get out of harm's way when convenient.\nHis innate ability will allow him to deal deadly blows to his enemies.\nFaenala is a Dwarf Paladin that will do all it takes to protect her companions.\nHer innate ability will allow her to charge at her enemies although wearing a crude and heavy armor.\nRalen is a combat-skilled Human Barbarian seeking glory for his tribe.\nHis innate ability will all allow him to strike multiple enemies with a single attack.\n\n\nIf you like what you see, tell people about it!\nSpreading the word about the game is the best way to help it achieve the kind of success needed for me to produce more material and products for it. \n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\nBecome a Fan on BoardGameGeek \n Retweet & Like on Twitter \n Share & Like on Facebook \n Like & Comment on Instagram \nWe're happy to be working with Backerkit again as our pledge manager to help with your pledge and process accurate shipping fees.

The sleeves that come with the game are not only essential for gameplay, they also help increase the lifespan of the cards. Canvas was designed with expansions in mind, so that Canvas: Reflections and future expansions will not require unnecessary duplicate printing of base game components.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur manufacturer, PandaGM, will produce replacement components so that damaged or missing pieces can be replaced with a small shipment instead of a second copy of the game, saving gas and materials. Canvas components are stored in reusable storage bags. The box efficiently holds all game pieces and add-ons without wasted space from a plastic insert.\nSustainable materials\nThe box and punchboard are made from 30% recycled materials for the ideal blend of durability and sustainability. The cards are made with materials from FSC certified sources. Components are printed with eco-friendly water-based ink and varnish. Our premium components are made from wood instead of plastic. The packing cartons are 100% recycled paper pulp.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPandaGM recycles all plastic and paper waste. The factory is fully air-conditioned for worker comfort and has passed ISO worker health and safety standards, is BSCI social compliance certified, and follows the OHSAS requirements for occupational health and safety.

Everdell is easy to learn, yet offers satisfying strategic depth and endless replayability.\n\nWill the sun shine brightest on your city?\nArtist impression of prototype components. Final version subject to updates.\n\nNew to Everdell?\nCheck out this great How to Play video from Watch it Played!\nWithin the charming valley of Everdell, beneath the boughs of towering trees, among meandering streams and mossy hollows, a civilization of forest critters is thriving and expanding... Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Just pledge for the Kickstarter Edition (or, if you're feeling swaggy, the Collector's Edition) and you too can join the ranks of Red Dragon Inn fans around the world!\n\nFarai is a high-ranking cleric of the Great Temple, but his first love is brewing. His brewery and tasting room, The Harmonious Cup, is a part of the Great Temple and not only brews the sacramental wine, but also helps pay for the temple's many charitable works!\nSamantha runs The Scurvy Dog, a feisty tavern down by the docks. Fights break out there so frequently that Samantha decided to start taking bets on their results. Her quick wits and business savvy have turned her \"low class\" establishment into a bustling destination!\nLucky owns a \"booze cart\" that travels around town selling spirits and avoiding trouble with the city guard. She sources her alcohol in various... \"creative\" ways. Whenever some ale is approaching its expiration date, Lucky is there. Whenever a barrel of Dwarven Firewater falls off the back of a warehouse, Lucky is there. Whenever a local thief needs an item fenced, Lucky is there. (But that's the part of her business she doesn't want you to know about!)\nA highly skilled barista and baker, Phyll runs Startusk's, a coffee shop just across from the main entrance to the Mages' Collegium. Many Greyporters thought that it would be folly to open a shop that only serves snacks, high-end drinks and potions, but the line out the door every morning proves those naysayers wrong.\nNerodia is the clever and devious proprietor of The Black Dragon Depths, the tavern catering to the baddies and their henchfolk.

We know how to run a Kickstarter project, and when there are problems, we fix them. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delays that could come here are a) if we notice something really bad in final playtest that we didn't see before, or b) one of our artists gets hit by a bus or something.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise, such as global pandemics. 2020 gave us even more insight into the various things that can go wrong here, so we're facing 2021 even stronger than before.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Once games are manufactured, they need to be shipped from China to regional fulfillment partners, then from those fulfillment partners to you. Things can sometimes go very wrong in that seemingly-simple process. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Alien Invasion Delay: Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our stated delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur games have long lifespans.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

To date, we\u2019ve raised enough as a company to donate over 60,000 games to kids. This campaign will help give even more! \nThe Newest Expansion to Nemo's War is Here! Featuring...\n A COMPREHENSIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL & BETWEEN VOYAGES GUIDE: The new Operations Manual shows how to run the ship turn-by-turn and includes many useful appendices at the end, while the new Between Voyages Guide features instruction for setup, ending the game, scoring, epilogues, variants, and more!\n\n A NEW 2-PLAYER VERSUS VARIANT: Joining the riveting solo and cooperative modes where players command the Nautilus, in this game variant one player will play as the Imperialists, bent on its defeat. Includes special cards and 2 Imperial Squadron Miniatures!  \n\n A NEW CHARACTER TILE: Entering our story is Nemo\u2019s son, Nadeen Dakkar, who crosses paths with his father after hearing news of mysterious events at sea!\n\n NEW FINALE CARDS: Spice up your endings with The Trap, Imperialists\u2019 Catspaw, Scientific Espionage, and The Kraken! \n\n NEW STERN MOTIVES, ADDITIONAL NAUTILUS UPGRADES, AND EVEN MORE TOKENS & MARKERS! \nBrave the hazards of the seas, combat vessels around the globe, incite uprisings, chronicle amazing wonders, find mysterious treasures -- your quest knows no bounds in this Ultimate Edition. Combining all expansion content, including the Journey\u2019s End Expansion, both new and returning players will be able to experience everything Nemo\u2019s War has to offer. Play solitaire, cooperatively, or competitively; the choice is yours!\n\nEach turn, you must address the seas\u2019 challenges in a grand adventure, confront the growing pressure of the Imperialist powers\u2019 navies, undertake Actions with the Nautilus and her crew \u2013 all while maintaining Captain Nemo\u2019s spirit to continue.  The Turn Sequence is as follows:\n\nBegin each turn in the Event Phase by flipping an event, Test, or other card from the Adventure Deck. Favorably resolving Tests, and using resources to manipulate your die rolls in this pursuit, will be critical to securing a victory no matter what your motive is.\nRoll high, captains, but be careful: your mission ends in Defeat if you deplete a Ship Resource. Developing an understanding of the probabilities, risks, and rewards for each Test and to what degree will ultimately be the reason for your mission\u2019s success or failure.\nNext is the Placement Phase, where you roll the dice for this round\u2019s Oceans for Ship token placement based on the game\u2019s current Act and your Notoriety. Strategic choices about where to place your ships, what we call \u201cpainting the board,\u201d will be crucial to your plans! Which Oceans to populate (and, through combat, denude) is the vital strategic chess game you are playing with the Imperialist powers who oppose you.\n You also receive the Differential Roll result of the two (selected) white dice rolled in Action Points for that turn. If the two (selected) white dice are doubles, a Lull Turn takes place..\n  Now it\u2019s time to act! During the Action Phase, you spend your Action Points to Move, Attack, Search for Treasure, Incite Uprisings, and more, all to advance Nemo\u2019s goals.\nAlways remember: you are questing for the greatest number of Victory Points (VPs) that you can acquire, as modified by Captain Nemo\u2019s Motive, while avoiding the many ways to suffer defeat. BVPs are earned in several ways (e.g., sinking enemy ships, passing TEST Events, collecting Treasures, inciting oppressed peoples, making scientific discoveries, etc), so choose your actions wisely each turn, and beware: \n Your mission ends in Defeat if your adventures gain too much notoriety, as you become an international Pariah to be hunted down mercilessly.\n\nRepeat these Phases until the game ends with your early defeat or you reveal the Final\u00e9 card that ultimately instructs you: \u201cThe game ends!\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, read the epilogue to your voyage in the Between Voyages Guide. Your level of victory and motive will change the story of your Journey\u2019s End.\n\nHere's a Preview and How to Play video for The Ultimate Edition from the Game Boy Geek:\nYou can also check out this How to Play from Meeple University with designer & developer Alan Emrich!

If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific local taxes, or other charges.

Shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager.\nWe are only shipping to the following countries, due to shipping uncertainties and restrictions:\nIf you back this campaign and request fulfillment to somewhere outside of these countries, we will cancel your order and refund your pledge per our Refund Policy (90% of the total you pledged).\n\nWe do anticipate that these products will be available through our online stores around the world so if you cannot participate in this campaign, you should be able to order them through those in the future.\n\nTaxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies!

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nThe Game of Deep Space Adventure\nThe second game in the Escape the Dark series, Escape the Dark Sector is a simple, sci-fi adventure game for 1 to 4 players with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation. It takes just a few minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and each mission is randomly generated so no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nAlong the way, the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, traps, and terrors. From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, with each challenge represented by a large, lavishly illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of tactical dice combat and timely use of item cards to complete them.\nThe goal of the game is to recover your starship by completing every chapter in the mission deck and defeating the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.\nRead:\n\"A blast from start to finish - 5/5\u201d -WhatCulture\n\"An awesome box full of Space Drama!

Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to a chunky, metal, 'Acting Captain' token. \nNo space crew would be complete without an android or Cyborg. At this level of funding a new android member of the crew along with their crew die will be added to the contents of The Collector's Box.\nAn app to track the health of crew members, replacing the medical records/health trackers with app featuring atmospheric sound and animation to compliment the tabletop experience. This will be free to all backers of this campaign, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items - we're learned the hard way that software takes a LONG time to get right. You can check out what we're doing with the Castle app here. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign - we've learned the hard way that software takes a LONG time to get right. \nHow does it work?\nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply add-up the value of all the add-ons you want and then pledge that amount on top of the cost of your chosen pledge. At the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to see exactly how much you pledged, add more funds if you wish, and then browse the following items in your own time to select exactly which ones you want to get.\nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the estimates shown on the charts in our Shipping section. We'll calculate your shipping total in Backerkit at the end of the campaign (based on the total weight of your order).\nImportant note: \nMany of the items in this section are already available for immediate shipping on our website (excluding bundles). If you order these items as add-ons they will ship with your pledge rewards when this campaign fulfils in 2021 so that everything arrives together. \nAdd-ons for Escape the Dark Sector\nPlanning on getting a Level 4 or Level 5 pledge?

This perfect family game is packed with choices that will keep your brain running at full steam.\nThe core of the game lies in completing puzzles with pieces. Completed puzzles give you points as well as extra pieces to use. The more pieces you have, the more difficult (and valuable!) puzzles you may try to complete.\nYou start the game with just two little pieces, and on your turn, you can do three actions (you may do the same action repeatedly):\nTake a new puzzle\nGet a new small piece or upgrade a piece that you have\nPlace a piece on your puzzle\nMaster action (only once every round) \u2014 put a piece on all your puzzles!\nOptimize your actions so that your engine grows rather than runs out of steam. Quick development is crucial since once players have taken all the valuable (black) puzzles, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. \nWith the Finesse expansion, you can complete goals on Finesse tiles to earn Credits. You can then spend the Credits to do extra actions.\nThe Ghost Piece expansion adds 24 new puzzles with unique shapes and new reward mechanics. There are also 3 new types of level-5 pieces, the Ghost Pieces. This expansion enhances the replayability of Project L and opens new strategic options for you to explore.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to get the Add-ons? To get the add-ons, click on the Manage your pledge button. Then, click on Change your pledge and increase your pledge amount by the total cost of the add-ons you want. You will be able to select the add-ons you have pledged for in the pledge manager when the campaign ends.\n\nThe Boardcubator Ambassador Program is our way of thanking all the wonderful people in our community who stayed with us throughout the campaigns and whose support and help keep us moving forward. It\u2019s because of your continuous involvement and interest in our games that we amass enough energy and motivation to push our projects further ahead. As a thank you, we\u2019re including a special promo pack in all our Kickstarter campaigns that our ambassadors get for free!\nYou will automatically receive Project L: Finesse Ambassador Pack for free if:\nYou have pledged during the first 72 hours of the campaign,\nYou have supported any of our previous Kickstarter campaigns, or\nYou were subscribed to our newsletter before this Kickstarter campaign launched.\n\n  Looking back to the original campaign in 2018, Project L went a long way. Two years ago, thanks to the support of all the amazing backers, we've fully unlocked all Stretch Goals that allowed us to produce the game in a shape and quality we had never dreamed of. There's not much that could be added or upgraded \u2014 just look at what the backers and reviewers say!\nWhen it comes to the Finesse expansion, we had no other option than to follow the quality of Project L & Ghost Piece (not that we wouldn't like that), so Finesse is already coming to Kickstarter in a super-maximized mode.\nWe prefer to not add anything superficial, untested, or not fitting the content that's been originally planned for the game. And since mostly everything has been already added to the game, the inevitable result is that this campaign is Stretch Goal free.\nOn the other hand, the journey towards making Project L a reality has been so exciting that we just love the idea of sharing it with you in full detail (in even more detail than that the backers of the original campaign remember!). To accomplish that, we\u2019ve prepared a series of behind-the-scenes stories as well as making-of interviews.\nStay tuned for the project updates!\nSince the original campaign from 2018, we\u2019ve partnered with Paul Grogan from Gaming Rules!, a professional rulebook writer & editor, to enhance and streamline the way you can learn to play Project L. Furthermore, focusing on the feedback we\u2019ve received since the first version of the game, we\u2019ve also perfected the rules in terms of game mechanics\u2014mostly concerning the player actions and endgame. \nCheck out the Revised Rules 2.0 (WIP).\nPrinted Revised Rulebook (2.0):\n comes automatically with all pledge levels! So, if you're a backer of the original campaign and are now pledging for the Returning Backer rewards (just the Finesse expansion), you'll receive the physical revised rulebook 2.0 as well.\nincludes the rules of Project L (base game) and all expansions in a single book.\nincludes updated player aids,\nis printed on premium soft-touch paper (that you know from the original campaign).\nis available in English only (see below for more details).\nWe're proud to announce that Asmodee will localize and manufacture Project L (base game) and also distribute it in retail.\nIf you're interested in a localized retail version of the base game, get in touch with your local branch of Asmodee for details about if/when they are releasing Project L in your country and/or language. Since the localization is now in the hands of Asmodee, we're no longer allowed to produce non-English versions of the game.\nPlease note, however, that the retail version by Asmodee and this Kickstarter version by Boardcubator are two separate product lines run by two separate companies. While there's a good chance that the content of one will be compatible with the other, we cannot guarantee that.\nShipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager.\nFriendly Shipping \u2014 We offer friendly shipping to the EU, US, UK, Canada, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Macao, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Backers from these regions won't spend additional money on customs or other import fees. Based on any given region, we will either ship your reward directly from within the country or will fully cover all potential import fees you might get charged for. \nAdditional Copy Shipping Discount \u2014 If you're interested in getting an additional copy of Project L or one of the expansion, you will spare on shipping for the subsequent copy thanks to reduced rates.

Rulebooks, game boxes, player aids, and puzzle boards have scratch resistant varnish or lamination that ensures that these components will last a long time under frequent use. Based on hundreds of rounds of playtesting, we have gradually improved the technological aspect of puzzle boards into their current 5-layer structure.\n\nThe base game is readily expandable without the need to make any component changes or upgrades to the base game that would require releasing a new version of the game. All expansions of the game can be mixed together.\nReusability and recyclability\nGiven the durability and material quality of the components in the game, Project L will last a long time before it starts showing signs of use or general material deterioration.

Controlled by a mysterious individual, these elongated worms tirelessly dig underground tunnels, causing swathes of territory to sink into the bowels of the earth. \nAfter years of helplessness, the Protectorate finally found a defense against this scourge in the Necrodruids \u2013 men and women who rejected the sacred principles of the Druidic Order to draw upon blood and forbidden incantations. The Necrodruids used their blood rituals to create monstrous plant-creatures capable of combating the Burrowers.\nIn the Citadels, the Necrodruids\u2019 power centers, YOU grow and tend to the abominations developed within, whose seeds are then spread all over the world to protect the territory against the Burrowers. Working as a slave-gardener, you wish that a fatal accident or death by exhaustion would relieve you of your endless toil.\nThe world has clearly changed since the days of your forefathers. The Collapsing Lands are choked in gloom and dust belched up by the Burrowers. The horrific plant-creatures that were created to protect you have spread, sometimes out of control, and are now just as much of a threat to humanity as the Burrowers.\nOn a cold morning bathed in pale light, you awaken for another long day of hard labor in the sacred grove, unaware that this will be your last day at the Citadel and that the course of history is about to change...\n\nSolo or cooperative game for up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure per Threat.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where you are the hero!\nNo die rolls: the more energy you spend, the more you increase your chances of success, but the faster you burn out!\nLive a different adventure every time; there are countless surprises and the game remembers your choices!\nEarn new skills, unlock bonuses, construct buildings: your decisions determine your path. Choose your destiny!\nIn The 7th Citadel, you face a Threat which will inevitably come down on you (unless you perish before you get there!).\nEach Threat comes in the form of a booklet with several scenarios that follow one another, until the final scenario where you either win the game or succumb to the Threat.\nUnlike most board games, you will experience an adventure over time, but rest assured, a simple save system allows you to pause your game at any time to resume it later.\nYou are a slave-gardener, captive of The 7th Citadel for several years now.\nYou start the game by choosing one of the available characters. Each character has an optional quest and a personal Action Deck.\nCasek, female (front) and male (back) version of a playable character\nCasek's personal quest\nAs your adventure progresses, you will choose new skills to create the character YOU want to play. Far from the usual archetypes of warrior, mage, and healer, you will have the freedom to develop your character as you choose.\nAre you more into Cunning or Arcana?\nWhether you want to play a teenage arcane master with a slingshot, an eloquent adventurer who can sneak through the shadows, or an elderly swordsman who summons creatures to assist him in battle, the choice is yours!\nYou progress in the adventure by exploring the Collapsing Lands (the game board, made up of numbered cards).\nHere you undertake actions that usually result in taking numbered cards from the Adventure Deck to progress through the adventure. These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card.

Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 20 years, in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign.

To date, we have delivered rewards to over 60,000 backers around the world.\n\nWe have accumulated experience and selected our partners (manufacturer, logistics, distribution centers) among the best in the world, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this project and ensure its follow-up (communication with the community, after-sales service) with the same professionalism that we have shown so far.\n\nThe main risk factor, which can never be excluded given the complexity of such a project and the potential number of backers, lies in a possible delay in delivery.\n\nCOMMITMENTS\n\nBecause you place your trust in us and allow us, through your support, to bring our project to life, we are keen to clarify our commitments to you.\n\nTo this end, we commit ourselves, as we have always done, to:\n\n1. not launch a new Kickstarter campaign until we have delivered the previous one.\n2. do everything possible to guarantee the sustainability of our company through sound management: control of its workforce, its operating costs and investments.\n3. ensure continuity as far as possible in the event of force majeure\n4. keep you informed with regular updates about the project until its delivery.\n\nWe would like to thank all our backers for the trust and support they have shown us since 2015!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\nIf the refund is requested more than 15 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 15% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Kickstarter.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll payments (pledged on Kickstarter and/or in the pledge manager) will be made in \u20acuros. Any costs shown in $ will be based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign (1$ = \u20ac0.85), the levy of your pledges and the pledge manager will be entirely in \u20acuros.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that you are responsible for providing correct address information, and ensuring that this address is deliverable by normal methods.

She finds inspiration in their imagination, and the dreamlike palette and lively brushwork that combine to create a wonderful atmosphere of enchantment. She believes that they sought to transport us to different worlds and fantastic places though their works. In her own work, known for its beautiful, enigmatic figures and lively creatures, Annie strives to depict this same transportive effect to the viewer. Her work is an exploration of the small hidden worlds that exist in our own backyards and the drama that unfolds with their unseen inhabitants. The secrets that are waiting to be discovered, and the mystery in a hidden moment of time. Annie exhibits her work in galleries and has done notable publishing work for clients such as Disney, Hasbro, Wizards of the Coast, Easton press, Netflix and more. Her work is found in private collections all over the world.\nGallery Gerard\nAnnie Stegg Illustration\nAnnie Stegg Fine Art (Facebook)\nAnnie Stegg Gerard (Instagram)\nShipping for this project's rewards will be collected afterwards via our Pledge Manager tool. We will do an Update when the tool is ready with exact shipping costs. This price will include all shipping, VAT, and customs and will include a subsidy from Forbidden Games that will cover a portion of these costs.\nBased on current rates, the cost/estimate of shipping a single copy of Lizard Wizard will be as follows: \n $10 in the USA \n $16 in the EU \n $16 in the UK* (*subject to Brexit) - We are looking into more info on Brexit - updates coming soon on possible options/solutions should this happen.\n Canada & China - we expect these to fall in the $20 - $25 range\n Oceania - (AUS/NZ/PHIL/JPN etc) - we expect these to fall in the $30 - $40 range\n Other countries prices will vary from $35 - $55 depending on your location (most will fall in the $35 - $45 range, but the high cost to some destinations is outside our control)\nAdditional games ordered will ship immediately after the campaign ends (no waiting), and will have similar first item pricing, and reduced costs for additional items*\n*subject to supply in your shipping area.\nExample: A Lizard Wizard pledge to the USA, and 3 additional items from the sale we estimate would look like: $10 for the first item sent, and $5 each additional item on the immediate shipping, and $10 for the Lizard Wizard shipment later. \nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Russia, Africa, South America, Mexico, or the Middle East due to high postage prices, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company. We continue to work with different fulfillment centers all over the world to ensure better and more affordable delivery each campaign but none will guarantee delivery to these countries.\nPLEASE NOTE THESE ARE JUST ESTIMATES.\nOur EU backers will see their rewards shipped from our EU fulfillment center on our first Wave of shipping. If you do not fill in your survey by the Wave 1 deadline (which will be sent in an update) we may have to send your reward from a different hub unless stock remains in the EU. We will try to fill all Wave 2 EU requests from our EU hub until stock is gone, but to ensure your reward ships to you from our EU center, please fill in your survey and Pledge Manager ASAP. All UK shipments are subject to Brexit effects.\nWe will be sending you all an invite to our Pledge Manager tool after the campaign ends and will do an update announcing its launch as well as when it locks down.

You can assume that we are hard at work making this project awesome!\nShipping: Shipping will be collected after the campaign via our Pledge Manager.

You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The Pledge Manager tool is a 3rd party product that we use to manage orders outside of Kickstarter.\nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nAs always, AEG does not make any profit on shipping & handling fees.

Shipping & handling for the order will be calculated at checkout. You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc. We won't try to figure out a break point where the shipping \"resets\" for a 2nd outer carton (or cartons); we'll just subsidize any marginal cost changes if the order is too big for one outer carton.\nEstimating additional shipping for Add-ons:\nGenerally speaking we are able to put Add-on components into the same master carton as the base Reward in your Pledge which makes them less expensive to ship than they would be if shipped individually. When you build your order in the Pledge Manager the system will generate a shipping & handling cost based on the weight, size, and taxes due for your order. Add-ons typically add a few dollars in shipping & handling cost, add-ons of whole games add about 50% of the base shipping cost.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\n\n                                      United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union + Norway and Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days).

AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited.

So it's no surprise that the construction of the station was riddled with problems. Funding cuts, shifting geopolitical climates, engineering setbacks - these were all just part of the job.

This spacewalk was supposed to be the final step, but a couple of faulty power cables forced the astronauts to abort. Of the six cables needed, two would not fully attach to the facility.

Just like us, the ISS crew had reason to celebrate the beginning of 2021.

The most recent event, on September 22nd, required a coordinated thruster burn by both US and Russian astronauts to ensure their safety.

As a company, we try to cater to the needs of gamers that want unique dice to suit their individuality.\nOne thing that always disappointed me though was that I could never find attractive eye-catching dice for when playing in non-English languages. Robin's Nerd Supplies is hoping to change that with the Talis Evolvere line. Talis Evolvere will include dice in a variety of languages and styles.

Player's take turns adding or swapping parts to their blade, putting up protection with shields, playing game changing gadgets, and attacking an opponent!

It will include three distinct themes:\nDeep Space (Sci Fi Themed)\nFaraway Land (Fantasy Themed)\nKickstarter Forge (Crowdfunding Themed)\nThe Kickstarter Forge theme will include blades that fans and backers of Reforge envisioned and our artist, Sam, made a reality! This continues my mission of getting the community involved with the creation of my games. Three of the blades in the final version of Reforge (The Narwhal, The Written Word, The Anthology) were actually conceived by Kickstarter backers!\nBy popular demand, we have added d12 blades! Forge even farther with these overpowered weapons of destruction! Oh, and did someone say gadgets? We've got some of the craziest gadgets ever in this expansion that are sure to shake up games. Details on all of the cards are below!\nStretch Goals!\nAnd how! I wanted to make this campaign more engaging to backers, so I upped the ante on stretch goals! Through these goals we will be able to add more blades and gadgets to the expansion pack, as well as create the super special Spirit Expansion! \nThe Spirit Expansion?!\nThe stretch goal of $9,000 will fund a smaller expansion that will add an entirely new gameplay mechanic to Reforge. The Spirit Expansion will let players who have fallen in battle continue to affect the course of the game! These special cards will be kept in a small deck separate from the Armory. When a player is defeated, they draw 3 and can use them whenever they want for the rest of the game! Help or hinder players that have helped or hindered you. I'm really excited about this expansion, so I hope we make it this far!

The production of Reforge last year took a little longer than expected and shipped in January, 2020 rather than the planned date of December, 2019.

Due to the different printer, the cards will have slight variation in shape and material. This works out well due to the nature of The Spirit Expansion - it will be kept completely separate from your current Reforge cards and even has a cool new backing.\nPlayers who have fallen in battle will now have the opportunity to change the course of the battle! The Spirit Expansion includes 15 brand new cards, each with a different effect that can be used on surviving players. When a player is defeated, they will draw 1-3 cards (depending on the number of remaining players) that can be used at any time for the remainder of the game.

Randomly generated levels and encounters make every playthrough a unique experience!\n A Thematic Roguelike Experience - An engaging game profoundly inspired by roguelikes and old-school dungeon crawlers. Every floor is randomly laid out, each game plays out differently, and of course, death is final.\nMinimal Setup - This game takes seconds to set up and makes for quick, tense dungeon romps.\nMake Choices - Will you spend your coins at the Merchant's stall for some health points, or choose to fight the Skeleton Soldier for some much-needed experience points before facing greater odds? Many more dilemmas await you!\nNew Co-op Mode - You can now enlist a fellow friend to help you out on the quest to retrieve the Og's Blood!\nBetter than Ever - Manipulations have been streamlined, the difficulty has been balanced, and new unique cards make for unexpected encounters.\nNew Characters  - Will you conjure powerful potions as the Mage, or play as the sneaky Rogue with deadly hands? Each Character comes with unique skills!   \nIf you want to pledge for additional content, you can see all the details in Add-ons and Shipping sections below.\n\n If you want to receive the Old Gods expansion with your additional copy of Mini Rogue, you can look to the Shipping section of this page (there is an explanation about how to add additional pledges like Leather Armor, Chainmail or Plate Armor).

This bonus goal has been unlocked! \nMy co-designer, Randy Scheunemann, and I set out to create a variety of dice games that offer interesting choices and give players some control over how the game plays out. Yes, even the randomness of dice games can include meaningful choices!\nWe spent months working with this goal in mind, we designed a ton of different games, and then we ultimately narrowed it all down to 26 that we feel are the best of the bunch. Those games are all featured in our book, Random Fun Generator \u2014 A Collection of Dice Games, which will be offered in an upcoming Kickstarter campaign from Steve Jackson Games.\nOne of those games, Liquid Courage, was designed specifically for Atlas Games, with the awesome custom dice from Dice Miner in mind, and we hope you enjoy it! \n\u2014 Sam Mitschke / Chief Creative Officer / Steve Jackson Games \nWe'll alert Dice Miner backers about the Random Fun Generator Kickstarter when it goes  live, but you can also monitor dice.sjgames.com, where the book will feature prominently when it launches. We're extremely happy to feature Liquid Courage as a stretch goal for Dice Miner backers.\nLiquid Courage is best played with six tunnel dice per player, but we're unlocking it with the fifth backer pack tunnel die because backers can still play it easily by using the 27 tunnel dice form their copies of Dice Miner.

(We understand that a Standard Edition pledge plus a deluxe dice set costs about the same as a Deluxe Edition pledge. It reflects what the dice cost, and the fact that you wind up with 120 dice instead of only 60.) Includes a Deluxe Edition dice bag.\nStandard Dice Set \u2014 $14. Available to everyone, added by popular demand. This is a full set of the sixty dice that come in the Standard Edition. Includes a Standard Edition dice bag.\nStandard-to-Deluxe Upgrade \u2014 $18. Available to backers at the \"Standard Group\" pledge level only. Each of these add-ons upgrades one of the five Standard Edition games that are part of that pledge level to a Deluxe Edition game.

We\u2019d call your attention especially to the backer updates for Magical Kitties Save the Day, to give you a sense of how we handle things and what we do when the unexpected arises. Past our previous Kickstarters, Atlas Games has been publishing tabletop games and making good on our promises for 30 years.\n\nAs a game, Dice Miner is complete. Its rules have been extensively tested, its components have been modeled, the art is all finished (with the exception of any new art required by unlocked stretch goals), and the graphic design is nearly done. We expect that Dice Miner will go to press before this campaign is over.\n\nAt the same time: Yes, indeed, many things seem very uncertain these days. There are definitely risks that COVID-19 will disrupt our supply chain or affect our staff members.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition.

The focus of this book by Deep Dungeon Games is the ground on which we stand - the earth itself and all the wonders it contains.\nThe Mineralogy Manual has been designed to be extremely easy to learn and use for any tabletop role-playing game, or the foundation for any type of fiction. It can be a fun addition to your long-running game or the start of a brand new short adventure. The book will come alive in your mind's eye through its beautiful and professional illustrations.\nThe Mineralogy Manual also includes a set of five complete adventures (using the 5th Edition ruleset), designed from the ground up to showcase the different aspects of the mineral and elemental resources showcased in the book. This provides an excellent introduction to many different systems and can act as the perfect starting point for a whole earthen or Dwarven campaign. These adventures are ready to run as soon as you get the book, including everything you\u2019ll need to craft your versions of named metal swords, armor, and other earthen devices.\nThe NPC cards from the Decks of Casual Characters offer a perfect complement to your copy of the book.\nThe book is expected to contain a whopping 400 to 450 pages. The exact number will depend on how many of the stretch goals are met since each will add significant text and imagery to the book. You really will get your money's worth! The Mineralogy Manual is filled to the brim, including sections on fantasy elements, minerals, ores, mines, mining companies, and even a fully developed Dwarven language.\nThe tome cards from the Deck of the Arbitrary Athenaeum offer a perfect complement to your copy of the book. Deal your player\u2019s real books from your world as they find new and exciting tales within them.\nThe book can be obtained as either a Digital or a Physical copy, with some tiers getting both versions. The Digital copy is DRM and watermark-free; the Physical copy is a hardcover 8.5\"x11\" book.\nIn the hope of giving you a bit of a summary, The Mineralogy Manual contains the following features, sections, and content to kickstart your underground adventure:\n Treasures of the Earth including 50 Elements, 40 types of Minerals, 30 types of Rocks and 20 types of Ores.\n The Crafting of the Earth including 20 varieties of Gemstones, 20 varieties of Crystals, and 20 types of Metals in all of its forms.\n Hollowing of the Earth including Magic Ley Lines, 10 fully detailed Mines, and 100 Non-Player Characters to fill up your fantasy mines.\n Children of the Earth, featuring 2,000 ready-to-use words in the Dwarven Language, 4 Dwarven Clans, 4 Dwarven Cities, 5 Earthen Dungeons, and 10 individual Natural Locations.\nAs the Kickstarter progresses, we will be adding the current goal and all the achieved goals right here! This is so you as the backer will have an easy time checking up on the progress and what goodies are next.\nThanks for checking out the Kickstarter. You can click here to download a free sample of Dwarven Dice Games and the Dwarven Inspired 5e Character Sheet! Thank you for spending the time and checking out the project! \nAll the features in this section comprise the entire earthen world and the treasures it holds. While some of these are rare, chaotic, or dangerous, they still mix and mold to make up all of the substances in the material realms. Everything comes from the true treasures of the earth and this chapter covers these treasures in their purest, raw forms. Gemstones, crystals, and rare metal ingots would never have been able to form without the true treasures below.\nElements are the source: the building blocks of all minerals, rocks, and everything else from the earth.\n Blighted Elements consist of Clode, Dune, Anima, and Conquitus. In most locations of the realms, it is thought these elements come from another universe or dimension where the laws of physics are slightly different, allowing them to be stable.\n Chaos Elements consist of Kindra, Granius, Halos, Aquifis, Vitae, Soros, and Thun. In most locations in the realms, they are rarely found due to their volatile nature with their own counter elements.\n Dwarven Elements consist of Claire, Fulg, Galvan, Fara, Flaris, Obasus, Lustrous, Thawe, Halo, Pulvi, Flaik, Scaldor, and Ragnis. Unlike chain metals, these metals are more often found in minerals than they are naturally.\n Foundation Elements consist of Coles, Magmith, Avalan, Lutum, Hydrox, Mores, Vox, Bron, Theron, and Monsoo. These elements are the most plentiful in the realms and mostly located in the ground.\n Rune Elements consist of Precipise, Eros, and Adum, and though found in many forms they are among the rarest. They are found naturally but more often take the form of minerals, crystals, and gemstones.\n Chain Metal Elements consist of Aflyx, Striutrium, Lobrese, Mashiydian, Espum, Nustum, and Lathian. These metals are found in minerals and rocks like many others but trace their origin back to the times of creation.\n Unseen Elements consist of Oxyn, Mistrath, Soleis, Lux and Disaris. They exist everywhere in the realms but are invisible to the eye, mingling to form the air that fills our lungs.\nMinerals are compounds that can be divided into their constituent elements.\n Wizard Minerals are unique in several ways. The most notable is that these minerals typically need to be removed from the earth using magical means.\n Apothecary Minerals typically require chemicals for both identifying the mineral and to make removal from the earth easier.\n Devotion Minerals contain a variety of gemstones, particularly rare ones. Unlike the majority of minerals, which can only form a single gemstone, devotion minerals produce many different gemstones of different colors, varieties, sizes, and rarities.\n Primal Minerals are the purest state of basic energies of the material plane in physical form. These minerals are some of the strongest for pure arcane, divine, and primordial magics.\n Blacksmithing Minerals produce a certain amount of utility for the crafting of weapons, armor, or other metallic wonders, and are the most ore-producing minerals across the realms.\n Noble Minerals are often associated with the other chain metal elements and have connections with coinage, riches, and many of the noble families. These minerals can be found in all levels of the earth in its tarnished form.\nRocks are generally composed of an assemblage of minerals and occur in three different forms or varieties.\n Primordial Rocks are formed from the elemental forces and deities primarily through wind, water, fire, and the earth; they comprise most of the surface of the realms.\n Mistral Rocks were once Primordial Rocks that were forever changed by the magic of the realms into totally new forms.\n Geoaegis Rocks were once Primordial or Mistral rocks that were broken apart by time and elemental forces, and then later reformed by the same forces into layers or clusters of different types of rocks.\nOre is defined as an economic concentration of minerals. The richness of ores can be vastly different, depending on the minerals and elements involved.\n Trace Ores contain tiny amounts of many different minerals; the percentages of these minerals can vary from piece to piece.\n Affix Ores have elements and minerals that are often used in a recipe or formula to make alloys, potions, and other complex items.\n True Ores are composed heavily of one type of mineral or element and are often the most sought-after for their overall purity.\nAs the individuals in our fantasy worlds go on about their routines, they use natural resources from the earth in their everyday lives. It is important to consider the form of that earthen resource and that the characters interact and craft with the resources everyday. Though most blacksmiths and jewelers would love to work exclusively with precious metals and gems, there is often much more involved when crafting with earthen materials. This chapter provides you with gemstones, crystals, and metals to fully immerse you and your characters in your fantasy worlds.  \nGemstones of the realms are found in many shapes and varieties. They form most commonly in the rocks and minerals that have undergone powerful elemental changes. A gemstone typically comes in one of three different forms.\n Precious Gemstones are highly sought-after, as there are only 6 varieties of gemstone known to exist that can claim the true title of \u2018precious\u2019.\n Semi-Precious Gemstones are basically every other gemstone that isn\u2019t classified as a true precious gemstone, with the exception of...\n Magical Gemstones, which are rare and form only near the primal and magical Ley Lines deep in the earth. One may have a magical gemstone and not even be aware.\nCrystals are beautiful, solid, often shiny earthen structures that are extremely geometric and semi-translucent in their natural shape.\n Bonding Crystals tend to bond with one if a certain spell or ritual is performed. This bonding takes a variety of forms depending on its origins, but the boons the crystals can bring are highly sought-after by Geomancers.\n Dwarven Crystals are valuable for the great boon they provide to metal crafting. Geomancers and blacksmiths use them to form Anethum and Thentine alloys.\n Mystic Crystals are formed due to their close proximity to the magical Ley Lines of the realms. The majority of these crystals possess a large amount of unspent arcane energy and are used as a spell focus and for spell crafting, enchanting, and soul magics.\n Force Crystals have close ties to the primordial magic from the time of creation. The majority of them have been trapped within the earth for untold years.\nMetals are found in ores, rich minerals, and rocks and must be extracted to form ingots which can later be crafted into items, weapons or tools. Metals can also be combined into alloys which make an overall stronger metal.\n Pure Metals can be found in nature but generally must be extracted or combined from minerals and ores.\n Anethum is an alloy that requires crystals to be combined with the metal.\n Thentine requires the combinations of crystals, metals, and magical gemstones to makes a most unique alloy for metalworking.\nWhen searching for valuable minerals, the traditional prospector relies primarily on the direct observation of minerals in outcrops, sediments, and soil. The modern prospector also employs a combination of geologic, geophysical, and geomancy tools to provide indirect indications for good locations to begin hollowing the earth.\nThe Ley Lines are magical, mystical alignments within the earth that connect other planes to the material realms. Many of the arcane mystics who study the art of Geomancy believe that these lines carry positive or negative energy.  This section of the book will cover what they are and how to add them to your world with ease.\nMany new Dwarven strongholds and landlocked cities of the realms are founded near substantial deposits of minerals or gems. This section contains rules for establishing and operating mines. It is presumed that most existing strongholds are built around profitable and extensive ones.\nEvery mine needs individuals to work them, manage them, and protect them. This section provides a massively detailed list of 100 NPCs to be used in the mines from this book or plugged into your existing worlds.\nWhile every race can trace its origin to the elements of the realms, there are certain races, monsters, and creatures that are more closely tied to the underground regions. Not all the children of the earth have legs and arms like the majority of the creatures. The children of the earth can also take the form of the beautiful creations of landforms, mountains, and more. This chapter will break down the environments, those monsters within them, where they exist, and so much more further detailed below.\nMany races in a fantasy setting have a form of communication that is common among them and their societies. This section of the book will break down the phonology, morphology, syntax, word construction, and alphabet of the original language of the Dwarves. It will also contain an easy to use phrasebook and dictionary containing 2,000 words ready-to-use by those who should know the language.\nThis section examines the lifestyle of the Dwarves, the organization of their clans, and the dwarven family, the smallest unit of dwarf social organization. The clans are the basis of dwarf society. A few dwarves follow professions that set them apart, but they are still influenced by mainstream Dwarf society, its values, and structures.\nMost Dwarves choose life underground, and while it is unusual for them to live in a surface settlement unless events force them upwards, it is not impossible. The origins of these cities spring from the unique world view of the many clans that spent thousands of years living underground.\nThis section includes a variety of dungeons from the different clans in the book and will explore the different elements of fire, ice, earth, and disease. \n Dungeon One: A Return to Mullodar \u2013 The Dwarven clans have come together in hopes of regaining the four long-lost relics of their ancient stronghold. Can the party clear this deadly dungeon of pestilence and disease and return the Dwarven relics to their rightful homes? \n Dungeon Two: The Pit of Gnawed Bones \u2013 The rise of new and powerful Trolls within the Copper Mountains has seen the local Dwarven and Halfing communities under attack. Thrown in the deep end of an immense set of caves, the party will fight their way back to the light.\n Dungeon Three: Qannesdam \u2013 The fires of Mount Blackpeak have gone cold, the Ashfoot clan's livelihood placed on the line. To restart the fiery core that beats within the mountain, the party will have to face the heat and flames of the isle of Qannesdam and return with an Elemental Heart of Fire.\n Dungeon Four: Mesmerizing Ice Vault \u2013 Deep within the heart of the Ridgeline Mountains lays the tomb of Kyvierrun, The Ice Scaled. Or so it has long been told. But with the beating crashes of the Frosthammer Dwarves' iron picks, this mighty Dragon has awoken. \n Dungeon Five: The Skyfall Tradition \u2013 The Skyfall clan lays open for the taking, the decade-long rule of Lunac Skyfall coming to an end. From the list of contenders, a new chieftain will arise. Can an influential party change the course of history for a clan on the verge of a new beginning?\nThis section includes 10 individual, unique locations that are highly adaptable to any campaign and can form a unique variety of terrains and environments. Game Masters can add these into their worlds with very little effort as we provide the environment, important locations, flora and fauna, inhabitants, dangers, a battle map, and more, all ready for adventuring.\nWe've prepared several sample pages that will give you an idea of the contents present in the book as well as the general layout. These were created from a first draft to give you an understanding of what the pages will look like; actual layout, fonts, and text will likely change by the final release to improve the overall quality of the manual.\n CLICK HERE FOR SAMPLE PAGES \nA lot of work has gone into creating and compiling the massive amount of information and gameplay we're packing into The Mineralogy Manual. Once we finish up this Kickstarter there will still be much to do, including editing, layout, proofing, finalization, printing and shipping. Here's our timeline for the project.\n Click here for the rewards spreadsheet version created by K Wirick \n  All content forThe Mineralogy Manual has been completely written and the majority of the illustrations are complete.\nFrom the get-go, we pledged that this book must be visually stunning. That means not only the artwork but the layout and presentation as well. This process usually takes 2 to 3 months, and our editor for the majority of our books has made his career in the realm of editing.\nThe general layout has already been defined as you can see in the sample pages; the trick is to make the final version of the book follow that guideline and still be visually dynamic to convey the look and feel of the book's theme.\nThe content of the manual is ready, so the funding will go entirely to paying our talented artists, securing additional artwork, editing, and stretch goal content. We've already gone through the book a few times to rehash and check the content and playability; the final edit will make everything shine and ensure the best quality possible. We have always found the value in paying for professional layout editing so that the book looks as good as possible, and to pay for a proper test print of the physical books to make sure everything looks exactly as we've envisioned. Funds will also go towards final playtesting after stretch goal additions, to ensure the best quality and balance of all the different systems.\nThe funding goal is average (when compared to similar Kickstarter projects). We're going about this slightly differently from our previous projects because, instead of unlocking tiny stretch goals and slowly building content, we're going to make the book as beautiful and content-heavy as possible from the get-go. The goal is to fill this book with as much world-building as we can and get it out to as many people as possible.\nAs many of our previous backers know, Deep Dungeon Games is no stranger to Kickstarter campaigns. After nearly 12 successful campaigns and thousands of happy customers, we are confident in our ability to tackle both the creation and production of new products and bring them to fulfillment.\nThe printing will commence after everyone has had a chance to view the digital version and confirm that the content turned out as expected. Additionally, this will put hundreds of eyes on the copy and layout to help us catch any fixes or errors before committing to printing. This ensures a better overall product.\nThe cost of shipping will be collected during the survey periods. We hope to keep costs down and will ship EU-friendly to all our friends and backers across the pond.\nWhen the Kickstarter reaches its funding goal, copyediting and layout will start immediately, and fulfilling all rewards will be the highest priority. Additionally, any work for stretch goals will be ongoing during the campaign. Depending on how the Kickstarter turns out we may extend the timeline of the overall project.\nThe PDFs will be the first item to be sent out as soon as the final layout and editing are complete, plus any other digital content. We have estimated the release of the book in October 2020, but are aware that delays may happen, especially depending on the Stretch Goals that can be unlocked.\n Mid May - Kickstarter launches. \n Mid June - Kickstarter completes. \n Early -July - Funds from the Project arrive and are distributed. \n Mid August - All initial content created for Kickstarter sent for editing and layout. \n Early -September - Any additional changes, edits, or new art (including unlocked Stretch Goals) will be complete by this time for final editing and layout. \nEarly October- Final PDF complete and sent to Backers, and sample prints of Hardcover Books ordered.\n Late October - Books arrive and all shipping completed by end of month. \nAgain, this is an estimated timeline and hiccups do happen. We will keep you updated on our progress and any changes through Kickstarter updates. We will also be editing the Kickstarter Page so you can always check the latest status there.\nAs detailed in the Project Section, all base content in The Mineralogy Manual has already been written, so these Stretch Goals are planned to bring more content into the book.\nAll backers that pledge $15 or more will benefit from every single stretch goal attained; there are no pledge-specific stretch goals. This is to make sure that everyone, regardless of the amount of their support, can enjoy the same full experience while using the book.  \nNew Chapter - locked \u274c \n A new chapter named Organizations of the Earth will be added to The Mineralogy Manual. This introduces three fascinating new guilds who pursue crafting and creation with the primary components included in this book. Your character can join one or more of these guilds and gain certain benefits, advantages, and loyalties due to this joining. Also in this chapter, we will be adding sections like religious organizations, geopolitical organizations, secret organizations, and more!\n The focus of Deep Dungeon Games is to create content focused on availability and world-building for tabletop games. It is extremely challenging to create content for every fantasy tabletop game, but we attempt to hit as many as we can. In addition, authors and other writers will find that a lot of our content can inspire a creative landscape, world, or even characters for their writings, and with everything we create, the hope is that you will be inspired to read, play, and enjoy fantasy.\nHobie Hill - A creator and content writer who has written 10 popular fantasy tabletop supplements and is the driving creative force behind Deep Dungeon Games.\nDaniel James - A specialist in dungeon writing, campaigns, and everything in between. Over five years of experience writing campaigns and producing content for tabletop games.\nElizabeth Fowler - A character design specialist with years of creative writing experience. She has many years of experience and adopts individuals from real life to create truly unique characters.\nMark Adams - An elementary teacher who lived abroad in Japan and is a language specialist with a unique ability to adapt the realistic aspects of languages into usable fantasy languages.\nAshten Delgado - A passionate player and creative content writer.\nTeresa Guido - A well-known artist in all Deep Dungeon Games projects who attacks every project with enthusiasm and joy.\nDeryl Arrazaq - A Concept Artist/Illustrator with years of experience in fantasy illustrations.\nRevis A. - A freelance designer for 4 years with clients ranging from local bands to famous pastry makers, with which he developed a vast variety of expertise in different fields of graphic design and illustration.\nOnedaygm - A professional graphic designer and a full-time freelance artist with 8+ years of experience.\nR. Lee Brown - Editor/Story Doctor for over 30 years who first played \u2018that game\u2019 back in the 1980s and has now polished and done graphic layout for several DDG projects.\nWe are forever grateful for your support and cannot wait to see the new tabletop games, accessories, and content we will create for us all to enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs many of our previous backers know, Deep Dungeon Games is no stranger to Kickstarter campaigns. After nearly 12 successful campaigns and thousands of happy customers, we are confident in our ability to tackle both the creation and production of new products.\n\nHowever, after the unforeseen circumstances in 2020 that have affected many of us, we have found that we have also been impacted. This has left us without the ability to attend and bring in revenue through conventions and events. While we have not experienced any delays in previous Kickstarter projects, we have had to reassess our situation. As such, this has given us a reason to push projects up on the timeline, however, this does not cause any delays in our current projects. We want to ensure everyone that everything is on schedule, other than the usual minor delays that happen in every project. \n\nThe support of this project not only grants you the ability to access the content, but you are also supporting a small veteran-owned gaming company that is trying to stay busy during these trying times. This will be our last project this year until we have sent out 100% of some of our other existing projects. \n\nIn spite of all this, we are very aware that game development, and the production of creatively intense projects, is an unpredictable process. Complications, changes, and similar struggles are an ever-present reality, and we won\u2019t pretend otherwise. Trouble may still arise as we continue the creation of this unique new supplement. If delays seem likely, we assure you that we will be open, honest, and swift in our communication of these delays to you. If immediate updates are not necessary, we will be sure to communicate any and all progress in our project updates made every other week.\n\nAny stated dates are goals presented as realistically as possible, at the time they are given. Should the project change during the course of its development, dates will change accordingly. We hold very strongly to the principle that quality comes first, and a delayed game is better than a rushed one that is on time. We want you to be satisfied with every product you receive from us and will do what is necessary to ensure the highest quality possible. Should delays or other changes ever prove necessary, we ask for your patience and understanding as you embark on another exciting adventure with us.\n\nFor production, we're using a proven manufacturer with amazing turnaround time and great product quality. Their facility will handle everything from the printing, cutting, quality assurance, and shipping directly to our front doorstep.\n\nOur artist has a proven track record of beautiful work and a quick turnaround time; this is the single longest part of our production process. We receive consistently amazing artwork on a daily basis with 1-2 finished art pieces delivered every day. We have already included the estimated 25 days of additional artwork in the project, so we expect no delays as we move forward.\n\nAs with our last books, final packaging will be completed directly at the manufacturer; however, final shipping to customers will be going through our hands. We have learned to plan carefully, price as exactly as possible, and remove as much of the time-consuming hands-on process as possible. That's why we'll just be printing labels and shipping pre-boxed decks!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Visitor", "descp": "If you don't have the funds to back this project right now but you still want to get your hands on The Minerology Manual later, simply pledge $1!

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nIn Tiny Epic Pirates: Curse of Amdiak, rumors of the unthinkable are spreading quickly around the islands. Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates. It will share the same width and height as well.

Our goal is to deliver the game in Q1 2021. Note this is an estimation and some things (like COVID-19) might be out of our control. However, we will do our best to deliver the game to you in time!\nGroup Pledges\nBecause each game box is so large and heavy, there is little to none savings to be had shipping multiple games to the same location.

Email us for a confirmation and for any questions: kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com. \nRetailer\nRetailers should be able to receive the same Kickstarter extras as other backers. That means retailers will also get an extra discount and have the option to get the Deluxe version (not available for retail after the campaign) and the Kickstarter exclusive story. For more information see here. If you're an interested retailer, pledge at the Trader level (\u20ac110). This is for the minimum of 2 cases, which is a total of 4 games of the retail version. After the campaign, you will be redirected to a special pledge manager where you can also upgrade your pledge to the Deluxe version and/or order more copies.

We're still astonished by all their enduring, wonderfull support and for making our lives so much easier!\nTerms and conditions\nThe following terms and conditions apply when you pledge to one of our games.\nREFUND POLICY The Kickstarter terms allow you to get a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Black Box Adventures and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost (due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Black Box Adventures).\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge (and shipping).\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. If not, we will replace any missing or damaged items. Replacements for minor cosmetic damage to external boxes will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We will use a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several mails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to fulfill your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT  Due to ongoing testing and developing and potential improvements suggested by the factory, the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Black Box Adventures will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. If major changes have to be made, Black Box Adventures wil inform the backers about the changes and the reasons for such changes.\nOTHER LANGUAGE EDITIONS  The Spanish and French translation will be handled by 2 Tomatoes. The Dutch translation will be handled by Black Box Adventures. For specific questions or problems concerning the translation copies (also after the campaign) you can contact the responsible company. The other language editions will be available in all countries during the Kickstarter. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project and we're partnering up with a few other experienced companies. However, we rely on our suppliers just as you rely on us, and hope for a relationship of mutual understanding.\n\nWe've worked with different manufacturers in the past and don't work any more with those not living up to our expectations. That's why we choose a new manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \nSome events may be out of our reach. One such event is COVID-19. To take such events into account we've talked with the manufacturer and gave ourselves some more time to deliver the game. We would love to tell you your game will arrive earlier, instead of the other way around...\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. After production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We'll also be subsidizing a portion of the shipping cost for all pledges to keep your costs down. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfillment process. For more information see terms & conditions above.\n\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount. VAT varies between 17% and 25% with most countries at 20% and above. The total amount is calculated on the amount paid for the game and the shipping. We have taken these costs into account so you will not need to worry about them. It is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions might incur import duties.\n\nAdventures in Neverland has been developed over 5 years, with numerous play-testers and groups in different countries. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter (and COVID-19) to test the final content and to blind test the rulebook.\n \nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece, drooling with flavor by itself. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers. Together Adventures in Neverland will be a unique game, dedicated to J.M. Barrie's legacy!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nAll of our games are made with longevity in mind. We use high-quality components for all of our pieces. Short of losing pieces (which we typically replace for only shipping costs), our games should last you for decades to come.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll of our fulfillment and logistics are arranged to limit the number of miles/stops each game travels, by using multiple distribution hubs dispersed on different continents.

For this campaign only, we are including a printed rulebook in French for backers in French speaking areas. \n\nPledging for this Campaign\nShipping is charge during the campaign. To see shipping rates to your country, please click on the pledge level.\nProduction is planned for Q1 2021, with shipping projected for April.\nProducts marked as Exclusive will be reserved for direct sales from Queen Games only. After fulfilling the campaign, and as supplies last, remaining items may be sold at conventions, as part of future campaigns, or on our e-commerce portals. They will not receive a general retail release. \nWe are using Crowd Ox to help manage our campaigns. After the campaign, you will receive an email to  confirm your shipment details and add-on extra copies of products if you would like. More information will be provided after the campaign closes.  \nShogun Upgrade Kit\n3-D Buildings: 3D plastic shrines, temples, and fortresses (previously cardboard tokens).\nArmies: Miniature meeples (previously cubes). These have been included in previous Shogun Big Box Kickstarter campaigns, and have been tested to work in the cube tower. Please note we are not able to sell the upgrade kit without them.\nTokens and Revolt Markers: Plastic bits with heat-transferred image (previously wood or cardboard tokens). Please note these are the some tokens that have recently been seen in the very popular Board Game Geek \"GeekUp\" kits.\nMetal Coins: Custom designed metal coins. The design for the coins is still a work in progress, but they will most likely be printed in Europe, and we are striving to have the best quality metal coins we can. \nWallenstein Upgrade Kit\n3-D Buildings: 3D palaces, churches, and trading posts (previously cardboard tokens).\nArmies: Miniature meeples (previously cubes).\nCoats of Arms: Acrylic with printed image (previously wooden tokens)\nRevolt markers: Plastic bits with heat-transferred image (previously wooden tokens). Please note these are the some tokens that have recently been seen in the very popular Board Game Geek \"GeekUp\" kits.\nBonus Tiles: Acrylic tiles with printed image (previously cardboard tiles).  \n\nQueen Games Cube Tower Games: Hybrid Euro/Conflict Games\nDirk Henn designed Wallenstein in 2002 and it was an instant success with strategy gamers everywhere. The central feature was the Cube Tower which was used for combat resolution. Cubes in a battle are put into the tower, and what comes out eliminates in a 1-to-1 fashion until only one army is left. Some of your cubes might get stuck in the tower, but don't worry, they will come out later and provide you an unexpected advantage. The cube tower draws a middle line between deterministic and dice based combat, allowing for randomness in battles (for excitement), but more even odds across the course of the game. Plus, it is a lot of fun to dump a handful of cubes into the tower!\nThe Cube Tower games pairs this mechanism with area majority scoring for buildings which are built around the map and pre-programmed turns. There are 10 actions each year, and at the start of a year the order of these actions are shuffled and the first 5 revealed. You will need to choose which provinces that you control will perform  the various actions, such as launching attacks or taxing, from the start, much like a commander planning an upcoming campaign. The blend of Euro mechanics with an area-majority conflict game makes Shogun and Wallenstein unique hybrids between Euro games and conflict games. \n\nWallenstein was followed by Shogun which a new theme, new mechanics, and a new map that challenged players in different ways.\nFor More Info, click on the picture or the links below, or scroll to the bottom of the page. \n  Game Rules in Various Languages\nGames Rules in Various Languages \nWallenstein\nThe goal of the game is to earn points by controlling counties which have the three different buildings on them. At the end of the year, whomever own the most of each building type in the different regions of the map will receive the most points (with second and third place scoring as well). In addition to building infrastructure to score points, you must also feed your peasants or they will revolt. Revolting peasants can lose you armies and possibly the county. \nShogun\nIn Shogun, each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his empire and secure points. Castles, temples, and theaters replace the infrastructure of Wallenstein (as rice replaces wheat), creating a thematic experience for players who wish to move their exploits east to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nProduction and Delivery\n\n                     Production for both the upgraded components and Big Boxes is planned for Q1 of 2021. We plan on producing all items, including the metal coins, in Europe to help ensure high quality and a fast turnaround between product and fulfillment. There is typically only a short delay between the end of production and when we can start the fulfillment process. \nPledges to the US will most likely be sent via container to a fulfillment center. Please note that all shipping projections are our best estimates only, and not guarantees.\nWe offer \"friendly\" shipping to a number of zones around the world, including the United States, Canada, the UK, the European Union, and Australia/New Zealand.

In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\nQueen Games assumes responsibility for shipping your pledge to the address provided in the pledge manager and guaranteeing delivery either to that address via our original carrier, or its transfer to your local post service. If the package is successfully delivered to the correct address, or handed over to your local post service, our obligation will be considered complete, and we may not be able to provide a replacement if the package is not picked up or is lost by the local post. Failure to complete the survey by the fulfillment date could also result in a non-delivery of the product.\nPost Campaign Communication\n\n     We will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions. Please note that, since we do not have a full time employee dedicated to Kickstarter alone, we may not be able to actively monitor the comments after the campaign closes.

We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\nRETURNED PRODUCTS If you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY Surveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months.

We typically manufacture our components in the EU, which we feel offers us the highest quality and simplified logistics (not to mention the opportunity to support our local and adjacent economies). After the various types of components are produced they are transported to a single facility, compiled into the final product, and sent to our logistics partner in the Netherlands or our HQ in Germany for distribution. However, several of the parts for this product are types we have never made before, and we have determined that we will need to manufacture these specific parts in Asia.

Sharing news of the campaign Nets you guys even more free stuff and attracts new backers! \n Pictura - BoardGameGeek page \nHGG Facebook page\nPictura Facebook post\nPictura Tweet\n HGG Instagram page\n   You can read more about Vernissage here.\n You can read more about Crystal Palace here.\nAn easy to learn, hard to master set collection game with a wealth of strategic possibilities.\nGorgeously illustrated with over 200 unique designs.\n Featuring 180 historical works of art, each with accurate information about the painting and where it is currently exhibited. \nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 20-30 min per player.\nIn Museum: Pictura, players take on the role of aspiring museum curators! Their goal: to acquire the most Prestige points in order to make their establishment the greatest in the world.\nThis is done primarily by assembling Collections of some of history\u2019s greatest paintings. The larger these Collections grow, the more points they\u2019re worth when organising Temporary Exhibitions, as well as at the end of the game. But that\u2019s not all. Savvy curators will also need to navigate the upper echelons of society, attracting wealthy patrons, exploiting the ever-changing art market and calling in favours where necessary...\nPainting cards are the main component of the game. Each of the 180 cards represents a historical masterpiece, along with the following information:\nThese cards are shuffled together at the start of the game and split into multiple decks in order to form the Art Market.\nThe structure of a turn in Museum: Pictura is simple yet players will regularly find themselves confronted with important choices that will determine how their strategy (and Prestige) evolves over the course of a game.\n\nAcquisition phase\nThe player\u2019s turn starts with the Acquisition phase where new Painting cards are acquired from the Art Market by drawing two cards from any of the decks.\nThe player must then exchange a Painting card from their hand with one of the four International Museums on the central board. In Pictura, Painting cards have no fixed value. Just like in the real world of art, the value of a piece is subjective and can depend on changing fashions and opinions, which is where Trend cards come in. These are used in multiple instances throughout the game, but in this case each of the four museums is attributed their own Trend card randomly during setup. This card represents what kind of Paintings that establishment is looking for.\nTrend cards assign a value -in Prestige points- to a certain Period (header colour), Style (icon) and Artist (number). When exchanging paintings you place a Painting card from your hand into an International Museum of your choice before taking another one from them. If you give them a Painting card with criteria present on their Trend card, you\u2019ll gain Prestige. If you take a painting card with one of those criteria though, you\u2019ll lose Prestige points.\nOnce the active player has performed their mandatory exchange, each of the other players may also exchange a card if they so wish.\nIt\u2019s up to players to navigate this constantly changing pool of available Painting cards, exchanging paintings so as to strike a balance between gaining Prestige and acquiring paintings that best suit their strategy.\n\nAction Phase\nOnce they have acquired their new cards, players may perform one of these three actions:\nExhibit Paintings\nThe core of Museum: Pictura, and your main source of Prestige, are the Collections of paintings that you\u2019ll be building within the halls of your establishment.\nEach player has their own Museum board, onto which they\u2019ll be arranging their Painting cards. In order to exhibit a card, you simply discard any other card from your hand to pay for it. Discarded cards can be recovered by performing an Inventory action. However, cards in your Discard pile can be taken by other players, so pay attention to what you discard!\nExhibited cards can then be arranged to form collections of Periods or Styles. The bigger these collections get, the more Prestige points they\u2019re worth.\n\nExhibiting a card into your museum doesn\u2019t earn points. However, there is a Public Trend card that changes each round and represents the public\u2019s current preference. If you exhibit a card with one of the criteria shown on that Trend card, you will gain Prestige points!\n\nPerform an Inventory\nIf your Hand is getting a little sparse, you may decide to perform an Inventory during your turn instead of placing cards. This allows you to take cards back from your Discard pile into your Hand. This is great way to replenish your Hand and prevent your opponents from getting your discarded cards!\n\nIt also allows you to draw a Favour card and refresh the Patron cards currently on the board.\nEven though this action doesn\u2019t (directly) earn you any Prestige, it is great for managing your Discard pile and getting back into the game with fresh resources.\n\nOrganise a Temporary Exhibition\nThe final type of action a player can take is to organise a Temporary Exhibition. In Pictura, your museum is always open to the public but you can organise special events, galas and private viewings which take the form of Temporary Exhibitions. When you perform this action you get to score one of your current collections. This will earn you Prestige as well as the advantages of one of six bonus abilities shown on your player board which can come into effect during or at the end of the game.\nHowever, each player can only do a Temporary Exhibition for each Period or Style once during the game. Additionally, the first player to organise an event for a Period or Style scores bonus Prestige points to represent their visitors\u2019 enthusiasm for something new! The next person to organise an Exhibition on that theme still scores that collection but gains no bonus points. However, after the second one, the public will lose interest and no more Temporary Exhibitions of that type can be organised.\nThis lends a timing element to these events - they can represent a lot of Prestige points but waiting until your collections reach optimal sizes could leave you without a public that\u2019s interested in them!\n\nFree actions\nOn top of performing one of the three mandatory actions, a player can also perform the following free actions during their turn:\nCall in a Favour\nFavour cards are one shot ability cards with a variety of effects. You start the game with one and can play one during each of your turns. More Favour cards can be acquired by gaining more Prestige, as well as performing other actions.\n\n Acquire new Patrons \nDuring a game of Museum: Pictura, you\u2019ll be able to gain additional Prestige by attracting the attention of influential Patrons! The Patron board will show what they\u2019re looking for. If you have the Paintings requested by one of these Patron cards exhibited in your Museum, they\u2019ll reward you!\n\nOnce they\u2019ve performed their actions, the turn is passed to the next player and so on and so forth until someone reaches 50 or more prestige points.\nThe end of the game is set off when any player reaches 50 or more Prestige. They finish their turn and then each other player has one more turn before moving on to final scoring.\nTo the Prestige they\u2019ve earned during the game players will also be adding the values of the collection in their museums, bonuses from their personal Trend cards which are chosen at the start of the game as well as points from your temporary Exhibitions and rewards for filling out your galleries.\nPlayers will also lose points if they have too many cards in their Discard pile, so managing it correctly during the game is important.\nThe player with the most Prestige points at the end of the game, wins!\nYou can find the full rulebook here\nWe also have a rules and playthrough video:\nPictura is part of the Museum \u201crange\u201d. Despite having certain mechanics and contents that harken back to its predecessor in a recognisable way, it has always been designed to be its own game with the goal of providing a fresh new set collection experience and not simply being an \u201cimproved\u201d or \u201cmore recent\u201d version of the original game.\nTherefore, despite its familiar appearance there are some significant differences from the original. You may have picked up on some of them whilst reading through this page but if you\u2019d like to know about all the new elements, then we\u2019ve prepared a video just for you!\n Don\u2019t have time to watch the video? Here are the main differences in a nutshell:\n-          The cards: Painting cards in Pictura work differently to the Object cards in the original Museum. They don\u2019t have individual values, so to place a card in your museum, you simply discard any other card, 1 for 1.\n-          Scoring Points: The way you score points during the game is completely different. In Pictura, you have a far greater variety of ways to score (and lose!) points during the game, from following Trend cards to organising Temporary Exhibitions and attracting Patrons. This gives you a lot more opportunities to consider during the game.\n-          The importance of timing: Although the original Museum had a certain element of timing to it, choosing the right time to perform certain actions in Museum: Pictura is incredibly important! Organising a Temporary Exhibition at the perfect moment can truly be a game changer. Keeping an eye on a fellow curator whose score is creeping perilously close to 50 is crucial too\u2026\n-          Optimising your Collections: Thanks to Temporary Exhibitions and your personal Trend card, it\u2019s possible to score a Collection more than once in Museum: Pictura. You\u2019ll need to plan your collections carefully to squeeze out every last Prestige point from the cards you place!\n-          Managing your Discard: In Museum: Pictura, managing your Discard is more important than ever before! Contrary to the first game, once a card has been discarded, performing an Inventory is the only way to get it back. On top of that, every card in your discard will lose you points at the end of the game, which can add up to a lot if you don\u2019t stay on top of it!\n English\nFrench\nGerman\nSpanish\n\nPictura has been in development since early 2019. After a studious research phase spent identifying all the paintings we wanted to have appear in the game we began testing the game extensively as the mammoth task of illustrating all the game\u2019s contents got underway.\nFast forward to 2020 and we have a game that is fully illustrated and tested. All other content shown during this campaign is also basically finished, some graphic and balancing tasks outstanding.\nApart from making some material upgrades, we\u2019ll be using the same manufacturer as the first Museum. With them having handled the original game, the pre-production and manufacturing Pictura should be a very smooth process.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to keep the costs as low as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nThe chart above shows the estimated cost of shipping the game to your region for each of the pledge levels. Please note that ordering multiple copies will increase these costs. For regions 1, 2 and 3 the shipping cost of each additional copy should be about 30-50% the first. \nFor RoW orders with multiple copies or particularly large orders in the other regions we will have to use particular courier services that willbe more expensive than usual. If this concerns you and you would like a more accurate quote of your shipping  you can message us and we will endeavor to provide you with one ASAP. \nNote that these costs are barring any unforeseen circumstances outside of our control. \nExact costs will be indicated during the pledge manager phase but we are confident that the numbers shown here are a very good estimation of the maximum final price.\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by March 2021. This may seem like a long time given the advanced state of the game, however, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\n\"Friendly Shipping\" means that you'll pay no import tax in Europe, the US & Canada.

From that portal leaps Pooky's evil doppelganger, ready to wreak havoc in our heroes' beloved tavern!\nUnlike his kinder, gentler (although still somewhat chaotic) namesake, this Pooky is evil right to the core. Our heroes will have their hands full with this harmful little bunny and his otherworldly doppelgangers.\nEvil Pooky is the 50th character in our long-running Red Dragon Inn series, so we've really pulled out all the stops for this one. The retail version of this game has a bunch of great stuff, and the editions you can get through this campaign just get better from there!\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a game for 2 or more players with each player taking on the role of a heroic adventurer (or sometimes a dastardly villain) in a wild free-for-all party at a fantasy tavern. Brawl, drink and gamble the night away to prove your mettle and be the last player standing at the end of an evening of bad decision making. Will you be able to outplay your opponents? Or will you wake up the next morning with a throbbing headache, a bit less gold in your pocket, and a horse awkwardly nudging you out of his stall?\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn. And if you're new to the game, we have two pledge levels just for you: the Newcomer Edition and the Newcomer Collector's Edition. These include the new Evil Pooky product, the original Pooky, and the original Red Dragon Inn game. With either of the Newcomer editions, you will have everything you need for a six player game!\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. Here are the editions available through this campaign:\nThe basic edition contains (of course) the Evil Pooky character deck and side deck, plus his Boss Battle deck (he is a villain, after all - check out the Boss Battle rules on page 13 of this document). It also contains a complete 30-card Drink Deck with some old classics from the history of RDI, plus eight new ones. It also contains two promo Prize Cards for use in the Prize Variant we introduced a couple of years ago. (Stay tuned for the update about these!)\nAnd as a fun bonus, we've also decided to include something a little zany: Epic Pooky - a Boss Battle deck for the original Pooky! Yes, now you can play Pooky himself as the Boss in a Boss Battle! You could even play Epic Pooky vs Boss Evil Pooky in a Boss Showdown Royale!\nAs with most of our campaigns, all content in this game is unlocked on day 1. No need to hit a bunch of arbitrary stretch goals to get the game to have a good contents list - it already has that. However, to keep engagement high, we will be doing a bunch of updates with drink card reveals, so stay tuned!\nFor the Collector's Edition, we're going super heavy on the pimped-out swag.\nFirst, there are two additional brand-new promo Prize Cards for use in the Prize Variant. (Again, to be revealed later!)\nNext, some plastic bits. Have you ever wanted fancier, more tactile Fortitude and Alcohol Content Markers? Us too. This project will have them - molded plastic pieces sized to the numbers on your player mats! The Collector's Edition comes with 6 of each, and you can add more packs of 6 of each to your pledge by overpledging $12 per extra pack you'd like. \nBase diameter approx. half an inch\nIn addition, there will also be a plastic Pooky Mood Marker!\nApprox. 1 inch tall\nSo you get all of this:\nCrude rendering of awesome plastic bits!\nBut, you may be asking, what good is a plastic marker if you don't have the original Pooky deck? Well, the Collector's Edition will include a holographic foil reprint of the original Pooky deck. Pooky has always been a fan favorite, so we decided to swag out his deck. And while we're on the subject of holographic foil cards...\n... ALL cards in the Collector's Edition will come in BOTH holographic foil and non-foil versions. Yes, you read that correctly. ALL of them. The Evil Pooky character deck, the Evil Pooky Boss deck, the original Pooky deck, the Boss deck for original Pooky, the Drink deck, the promo cards, everything. So now you can blind your opponents not only with the brilliance of your plays, but also with the shininess of your cards!\n(Note that adding non-foil versions was a change that we made post-launch, so we are not allowed to change the items listed in the pledge level. Please see our update for more information.)\nThere are two pledge levels for folks new to The Red Dragon Inn: the Newcomer Edition and the Newcomer Collector's Edition. The Newcomer Edition is the Retail Edition, plus a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game, plus a copy of the original Pooky expansion. The Newcomer Collector's Edition is the Collector's Edition, plus a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game. (Remember, the Collector's Edition already includes the original Pooky!)\nThe Newcomer Editions give you everything you need for a game of up to six players, so either one is a perfect entry-level pledge if you'd like to dip your toe into the RDI waters!\nIf you'd like to go \"Red Dragon All In\", we have just the pledge level for you. The Ultimate Edition starts with the pimped-out Collector's Edition and adds all of the other RDI games as well. You get RDI 1-7, all of the RDI: Allies, the Smorgasbox, Battle for Greyport and its Pirates expansion, and even our Pathfinder supplement, The Red Dragon Inn Guide to Inns and Taverns.\nYes, you get all 50 RDI characters with the Ultimate Edition. But that's not all!\nFrom our merch store, you'll get a metal coin set, plus your choice of any character t-shirt.\nFinally, the ultimate piece of our Ultimate Edition is 20 copies, plus an art print, of a drink or prize card of your own design! You design a card, we art it, and you get copies to distribute to all of your RDI-playing friends!\n Backers from the US: Packages will be shipped from within the US. If you would like additional copies of the game added to your reward, simply over-pledge in $25 or $57 increments for each extra copy of Evil Pooky you want to add to your rewards. You can add any number of additional copies to your rewards and you need only pay shipping once.\n International Backers: Where possible, we will try to use regional shipping options. However, where that is not possible you may be responsible for your country's import duties or fees. Note that this includes Canada. We do not guarantee \"friendly\" shipping to any country other than the US for this project.\nFurthermore, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign. Backers will not have the opportunity to upgrade their pledge level after the end of the campaign and should pledge what they want during the funding period. Backers will receive a survey via Kickstarter to provide their shipping information a few weeks before we begin the fulfillment process. It is your responsibility to fill out this Kickstarter survey in a timely fashion if you want to receive your rewards by our predicted delivery date.\nFinally, if you would like to review the SlugFest Games Kickstarter Policy, you can find it on our website here.\nAs with most of our campaigns, we are not using a post-campaign pledge manager. However, if you want to pick up another RDI game to go with the cool stuff in this product, you can head to our web store,  where you can pick up any of our products without having to wait for your backer rewards to ship! During the campaign, we are offering free US shipping on all of our games, as well as our fancy metal coin sets. (Sorry, but our other specialty merch still requires shipping charges!)\nIf you'd like to try Evil Pooky or some of our upcoming semi-sorta-secret stuff, then you should join the SlugFest Games Digital Play Test Community today! All you need to participate is a microphone for chat, Discord and Tabletop Simulator. We host daily sessions and would love to see you come by and give our stuff a test drive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe pride ourselves in our ability to deliver a quality product on time, and we stand by our track record of doing so. We know how to run a Kickstarter project, and when there are problems, we fix them. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delay that could come here is if we notice something really bad in playtest that we didn't see before.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise, such as the situation happening right now with the spread of the Coronavirus.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Sometimes your stuff just goes missing and we have to print everything all over again. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns much to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our suggested delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retail Edition", "descp": "Get the basic version of the game.

This has allowed for a lucrative industry: Dino Ranching! \nIndependent ranchers have begun farming dinosaurs to sell to the highest bidders for use in their high thrill theme parks. \nYou are one of those ranchers. Do you have what it takes to out ranch your opponents and operate the most successful dinosaur farm!?\nTiny Epic Dinosaurs is a 45 minute, 1-4 player game of dinosaur ranching, worker-placement and resource management. It features classic euro game mechanics with unique twists that portray the dangers of farming these prehistoric beasts.\nIn Tiny Epic Dinosaurs, players control a team of ranchers and will be acquiring, breeding and selling dinosaurs. The game is played over 6 rounds. With each round consisting of several short phases.\nIn phase one, players will harvest the resources from their farm that are not being consumed by their dinosaurs.\nIn phase two, players will put their ranchers to work. This phase has ranchers wrangling and buying new dinosaurs to farm, improving their farm\u2019s security and supplies, vying for high dollar contracts, and researching technologies and unique dinosaur breeds. These unique dinosaur breeds introduce a large variety of special benefits players can utilize to separate themselves from their competition.\nIn phase three, ranchers return to finish their day\u2019s work at the farm.\nIn phase four, players arrange their ranch, making sure their ranch is suitable for the types and quantities of dinosaurs they have.\nPhase five is the feeding phase, and every dinosaur MUST be fed. Dinosaurs that don\u2019t eat will escape, posing a grave threat to your enclosures\u2019 security and your other dinosaurs.\nPhase six is for breeding. For each pair of matching dinosaurs you have properly enclosed, you\u2019ll welcome a new dinosaur to your farm!\nAt the end of the game, players will receive victory points for each dinosaur they have, public and private contracts they acquired and for their research developments. The player with the most victory points, wins the game.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nThis image reflects unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Laboratory Mini Expansion\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion introduces certain rewards to players during play, like extra dinosaurs, resources, or research cards. To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats. \nDuring setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.\nThe Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

The two expansions are designed and developed and require a last round of playtesting before being complete. We've got one of the most dedicated and talented teams around, and we are more than confident that everything will be complete ready for a timely transition to the next stage of the process as well as being great fun!\n\n*Artworking*\nAll art assets and all design assets required for the core game are complete, with the majority already ready for print. There's still a couple of bits left for the expansions, and a few sculpts left, all of which is scheduled for completion before the end of the campaign. Diana, Marco, Tim, and Tom are fast, effective and professional and are all dedicated to making this their best project yet on budget and on time.\n\n*Pledge Management*\nAfter the campaign is complete we will launch the backer survey, or 'Pledge Manager'. This will be using the service pledgemanager.com\nThe Sub Terra II PM page is already in progress, with completion in the next week or so, meaning it'll be ready almost immediately after completion of the campaign. We will leave the PM open until we begin freighting goods around the world from the factory in China. With any complex software platform, there's always the chance of something going wrong or someone making a mistake. We've used this platform for 4 years now, and have direct communication on a daily basis with the PM team to fix bugs on the fly.\n\n*Print Preparation*\nAll files for the core game without any stretch goals applied are complete and ready for print. expansion and upgrade pack packaging is laid out and ready for final assets. Artwork required is minimal and all print assets are laid out ready for final assets where needed to minimise turnaround time to print.\nThe ITB team will be visiting Longpack in Shanghai for a site inspection and print preparation session for one to two weeks to ensure the print goes to plan, on time.\n\n*Mass Manufacture*\nLongpack games are our manufacturing partner for Sub Terra II and the reprint of Sub Terra. Longpack is an incredibly well-respected printing company based in Shanghai who we've worked with on NewSpeak, Crypt X, and now Sub Terra. They are driven, professional, honest and effective. Importantly they are realistic and open about timelines, giving us the information we need to communicate with you on changes to plans. Mass manufacture of board games is really complex and can be delayed as a result of suppliers, other production projects, machinery breakdown or anything else that can affect a large company like Longpack.\nWe've made sure that all the stretch goals are pre-planned, costed, communicated with the factory and worked out production-wise to ensure there are no snags.\n\n*Freight & Fulfilment*\nInternational freight can have a deep impact on the timeline, as there are so many factors that determine how long it takes a shipment to get from the factory. We've selected the best logistics partners in the world, who are both knowledgeable about the tabletop industry as well as professional and experienced in international logistics. We have predeveloped plans for freight around the world, with estimates of the proportion of total print to each region to make planning for partners easier. Fulfillment has been planned out with packaging and labeling to be complete by the end of the campaign. Fulfillment planning has taken into account all pledge options, shipping regions, and possible stretch goals' impact on size and weight.\n\n*After-Campaign Care*\nWe now have a productivity platform that integrates all support emails, accounts emails, project mail, social media and more - meaning we can be far, far quicker and more comprehensive in responding to backer queries and issues. We will also be looking to hire a new customer service assistant as a full-time member of the ITB team should we reach a sufficient number of backers to warrant it, to allow for seamless service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a329 or more", "title": "Explorer", "descp": "The Sub Terra II Core Game, with all Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["977 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "Seasoned Explorer", "descp": "The full Sub Terra II gameplay experience with core game, both expansions and Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,083 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a399 or more", "title": "Expedition Leader", "descp": "The fully expanded and equipped Sub Terra II set, with core game, both expansions and all upgrade packs, as well as Kickstarter promos.\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Upgrade Pack\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["955 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3119 or more", "title": "Grizzled Archaeologist", "descp": "The Sub Terra gameplay set\nAll original Sub Terra gameplay content\nAll Sub Terra II gameplay content\n*Sub Terra: Incubation, the new ST1 expansion also available as an add-on\"\nINCLUDES:\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Edition\nSub Terra II: Typhaon Wakes Expansion\nSub Terra II: Arima's Light Expansion\nSub Terra II Kickstarter Exclusives\nSub Terra\nSub Terra: Extraction\nSub Terra: Annihilation\nSub Terra: Investigation\nSub Terra: Incubation", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["170 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3199 or more", "title": "Legendary Archaeologist", "descp": "The entire Sub Terra adventure, from cave to temple.

The other is a fearsome werewolf, who is both a formidable villain and a literal party animal.\nPresenting: The Red Dragon Inn Allies: Piper vs Ripsnarl!\nYou've seen these two tangle in Battle for Greyport, our cooperative deckbuilding game, but now they're coming to the tavern to join the party as our 48th and 49th characters for The Red Dragon Inn!\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a game for 2 or more with each player taking on the role of a heroic adventurer (or sometimes a dastardly villain) in a wild free-for-all party at a fantasy tavern. Brawl, drink and gamble the night away to prove your mettle and be the last player standing at the end of an evening of bad decision making. Will you be able to outplay each of your opponents? Or will you wake up the next morning with a throbbing headache, a bit less gold in your pocket, and a horse awkwardly nudging you out of his stall?\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn. And if you're new to the game, we have two pledge levels just for you: the Newcomer Edition, which includes a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game, and the Newcomer Collector's Edition, which includes all the fancy swag plus the original Red Dragon Inn game. If you get one of the Newcomer Editions, you will have everything you need for a game of up to six players!\nAnd so, without further, ado...\nHere's what you get in the Retail Edition:\nIn the Collector's Edition, you get several new bits of promo content, including two new Drink Cards, a new Prize Card and a second new Prize \"Card\" made out of metal! Expect more details about the promo content in a campaign update.\nAnd all of the content for this game is unlocked on day one of the campaign - no need to submit your pledge and then leaving the actual game's contents up to the mercy of the fickle Stretch Goal Deities.\nWe have some very important information for backers regarding shipping options for the various Pledge Levels. This info is divided into two broad categories of backers:\n Backers from the US: Packages will be shipped from within the US. If you would like additional copies of the game added to your reward, simply over-pledge in $25 or $45 increments for each extra copy of Piper vs. Ripsnarl  you want to add to your rewards. You can add any number of additional copies to your rewards and you need only pay shipping once.\n International Backers: Where possible, we will try to use regional shipping options. However, where that is not possible you may be responsible for your country's import duties or fees. Note that this includes Canada. We do not guarantee \"friendly\" shipping to any country other than the US for this project.\nFurthermore, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign. Backers will not have the opportunity to upgrade their pledge level after the end of the campaign and should pledge what they want during the funding period. Backers will receive a survey via Kickstarter to provide their  shipping information a few weeks before we begin the fulfillment  process. It is the backer's responsibility to fill out this Kickstarter survey in a timely fashion if they want to receive their rewards by our predicted delivery date.\nFinally, if you would like to review the SlugFest Games Kickstarter Policy, you can find it on our website here. \nAs with most of our campaigns, we are not using a post-campaign pledge manager, and we are not offering add-ons. However, if you want to pick up another RDI game to go with the cool stuff in this product, you can head to our web store, where you can pick up any of our products without having to wait for your allies to ship! During the campaign, we are offering free US shipping on all of our games, as well as our fancy metal coin sets. (Sorry, but our other merch still requires shipping charges!)\n\nWe've done substantial playtesting on all of the stuff in this product, but if you'd like to try one of the new characters or have a look at some of our upcoming semi-sorta-secret stuff, then you should join the SlugFest Games Digital Play Test Community today! All you need to participate is a microphone for chat over Discord and Tabletop Simulator. We host daily sessions and would love to see you come by and give our stuff a test drive.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe pride ourselves in our ability to deliver a quality product on time, and we stand by our track record of doing so. However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is nearly done! The only delay that could come here is if we notice something bad that we didn't see before.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have a great relationship with our manufacturers and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Sometimes your stuff just goes missing and we have to print everything all over again. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Customs Delay: We have no control over the border policies of any country we import games into (including the US). Sometimes games get held up at a border - sometimes for a bafflingly long time.\n\n5. Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns much to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our suggested delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Retail Edition", "descp": "Get your copy of the latest expansion!

Each episode is a self contained short story set in the near future.\nEpisode 5 will focus on an environmental theme. With the living conditions of our planet in an increasingly poor state, the Silent Eye team have developed the next episode to reflect on a disturbing vision of the future, if we as a species continue acting as we are.\nAt the same time, we feel this is a strong episode narrative which confronts the issue, without ever becoming a \"message\" story. This episode doesn't preach to anyone, or pointing the finger of blame.\nThis story addresses the dilemma we face as a species. Aside from that, it's a very personal, emotional tale about a woman (RASHA), who is a wife and a mother of 2 small children.\nTo help save the planet, she faces the horrifying prospect of losing her future with her family. And this story is about her coming to terms with the sacrifice she is asked to make.\nBut there is still a chance she may escape the Sleep House... \nWhat is Silent Eye?\nSilent Eye is a science fiction TV show shot with smartphones. Each episode contains a new story with new characters. The series is currently available via Amazon in the USA, UK and Germany.  \nIn the last 4 weeks, Silent Eye has been watched on Amazon Prime for 1.7 million minutes.

Designed by the legendary Richard H. Berg, Mark Simonitch, and John B. Firer, Successors brings you the  best of this kind of game: tense and ruthless gameplay in a world of ever-changing alliances. \nThe development team at PHALANX has given this game a careful, meticulous update. It is now more accessible and easier to play. It contains gorgeous miniatures. It has received new, stunning art. It is even better than it used to be.\nJoin us to publish the Fourth Edition of this splendid game together!\n What do the players say? \nWhat\u2019s in the box?\nDuring the campaign we have unlocked 26 stretch goals. All of these items will be added to each SUCCESSORS game for free! \nOther pledge levels\n20th Anniversary Edition of Mark Simonitch\u2019s Hannibal & Hamilcar, winner of the Golden Geek award for the Best Wargame of 2018, sold out early this year. The game is going to be reprinted in 2020 in an updated version, containing a bigger box and rewritten rules. There will be also available an upgrade pack for the owners of the previous edition. These items are available for pre-order during this Kickstarter campaign. \nIf you already own Hannibal & Hamilcar, consider choosing the \u00a380 pledge to get the Upgrade Pack.\nIf you do not own Hannibal & Hamilcar, choose the \u00a3130 pledge to get the bundle of the best ancient war games ever published! \nPlease note that \u00a380 and \u00a3130 pledges are English edition only. But you will be able to choose French or Spanish edition of Hannibal & Hamilcar as an add-on to your SUCCESSORS Pledge in the pledge manager.  \nSUCCESSORS \nImmerse yourself in one of the best multiplayer strategy games ever published. Take part in the conflict between the titular diadochi \u2013 Successors \u2013 to the legacy and empire of Alexander the Great. Clash with your former brothers in arms turned enemies to gain control of provinces in order to increase the number of your Victory Points or pull appropriate strings to secure the Legitimacy Points (e.g., by providing Alexander\u2019s tomb with a suitable resting place). But beware, too many Victory Points with respect to other players and you will end up having the esteem of a Usurper who could be attacked freely by everyone. Therefore, choose your strategy wisely. It sometimes is more profitable to bide your time because every aspect of the game is intertwined and the sudden turn of events may surprise you with the most unfortunate outcome. For instance, you might be forced to take sides with someone who stabbed you in the back a couple of rounds earlier. However, as they must have said even in 4th Century B.C., the end justifies the means. Especially, when succession is at stake. \nThe fourth edition of this card-driven, point-to-point movement strategy is undergoing  a plethora of upgrades that will make it stand out among similarly themed games. It also pays homage to its past editions released by Avalon Hill and GMT Games, respectively. A new, improved layout of the board, charts, and cards, a rewritten and updated rulebook, an introduction to historical scenarios that streamline the gameplay and shorten game sessions, etc. The icing on the cake is its graphic design \u2013 a state-of-the-art map board based on an original art by Mark Simonitch, over 60 outstanding illustrations inspired by historical sources, and 12 large 40 mm plastic leader miniatures. All of these make the game a pleasure to watch and even more pleasurable to play. \nSo prepare your armies to buckle down, sharpen the blade of your tactical sixth sense, and whet your appetite for claiming your right to Alexander\u2019s throne, for Heaven cannot brook two Suns, nor Earth two masters. There can only be one true Successor! \nReviews\nGame Rules\nPlease click here to read the rulebook (beta version).\nWhy pledge now?\nTo save 20% off the MSRP!

This combination drives your hero's strengths, weaknesses, and defines your special abilities. We've build a bunch of unique choices for you, so no two games will ever play the same.\nYou'll work together to gather Platinum, Gold, Ravager Crystals, and Power Ups in order to advance your hero's strength while the Ravager wipes out crucial locations on the board.

Check out our Stretch Goals section below for more information on the added content.\n\nThe World\nNomadic legends speak of a great worm slumbering beneath the sands, stoking the fiery heat of the desert. Tales were told how the beast would awaken when the desert grew too cool, emerging from its slumber to bake the world above. For centuries the desert has grown and extended, proving, say the tribesmen, that the Ravager grows stronger.

These digital chapter books present new, augmented rules to play through an entire multi-session campaign using the same heroes! \nYou\u2019ll use specific map tiles and play through a ton of new content in these choose-your-own adventure scenarios. Players are presented with several \u201cWhat do you do\u201d choice branches throughout the course of play.

For more info on Campaign Mode, check out this update.\nKlik\u2019s Madness follows the rise and fall of Goblin Emperor Klik as hordes of goblins become better organized under his command, raiding and pillaging the Runecrest Valley. Your heroes will have the opportunity to save NPC\u2019s, earn new campaign items, get captured in Under Valley, witness Klik\u2019s transformation into an Undead Lieutenant working for the Dead King and much more! \nIn the Fall of the Ancients, the heroes will attempt to keep Hathowyr and Urgos' mind safe from the Magi's influence. They'll work for Elowen the Dryad, moving through the forest to stop Adrimon in her tracks. You may come face to face with Sarthowyr the dark dryad, and a cult of humans who feel Adrimon is a goddess. The story can unfold in a myriad of ways, and we can't wait for you to get your hands on it! \nIn Noko's Ritual, our heroes will find themselves unwittingly woven into the terrible plans of Emperor Noko, who works to summon the Ravager of Shurax. The heroes will begin the campaign working as guards for the City-State of Tarri and will unknowingly aid the tyrant in gathering the resources he needs to perform the ritual. Early in the story the heroes may uncover the terrible truth, and will gain the option to continue to help Noko, or to devise a plan of their own to stop him- possibly preventing the Ravager from even being summoned! \nAre you ready for this new way to play through HEXplore It content? \nExpansion\nExpansion Highlights:\n A new Play Style: the Ravager vs. All: Like our previous Volumes, the SoS Expansion allows you to play as the Villain against the other heroes.

You\u2019ll choose how to ruin the map, and will have an entire card deck to yourself. You\u2019ll also have access to powerful Rituals, which you can perform by expending your Ritual Points. You\u2019ll be forced to react to them, and better yet, force them to react to YOU! There are several ways to play as the Ravager, which means no two games facing off against the heroes will be the same.\n New Bosses: There are four new bosses that appear in the Sands of Shurax Expansion box. These bosses each have unique reveal triggers.\n Traits: Traits give your hero a distinguishing quality that you gain at the beginning of the game. Check out our video about Traits here. \n HEXclusive Heroes: We're offering more HEXclusive Roles and Races. These heroes are more powerful than our normal heroes. They are perfect for solo play, or can be used in small groups to up the ante and increase the Difficulty of your game. We hope you enjoy them as much as we do!\n The Black Pyramid: HEXplore It's very first Maze! \nThe Black Pyramid: Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the Sands of Shurax Expansion is the inclusion of the Black Pyramid. We've built the Black Pyramid to be its own play-style. You can go through the entire game, gathering power, facing new threats, terrifying versions of the Bosses, and perhaps most importantly, uncover epic new gear! The Black Pyramid is laden with traps and secrets chambers, so beware adventurers! \nFamiliar Mechanics: Here are just a few of the familiar mechanics you'll find in SoS that also appear in previous volumes.\nNew Mechanics: Sands of Shurax is no mere reskin of our previous volumes. Here are just a few of the new mechanics we've implemented which makes the Sands of Shurax entirely unique! Check out our videos page for more information on these.\nNew Game Locations: There are several new location types in the Sands of Shurax. Caravansaries are locations where the heroes can purchase low-value goods and join a Caravan. The heroes can heal Energy and refill their food stores while in an Oasis.\nUnlike Quests or Destinations (introduced in Volumes I and II), Missions are not tied to specific locations on the map. Instead, Mission locations are grouped into three terrain categories: Desert, Highland, and Silt Sea. Heroes may go to any Mission location that matches the terrain type to attempt to complete the Mission there.\nArenas & Scarabs: We\u2019ve built in 2 new mini-games into HEXplore It: the Sands of Shurax. The heroes can now earn fame and fortune in gladiatorial arenas and can gamble away their fortune playing Scarabs. For more info on each system works, check out our videos page.\nThe Wastes & Caravans: The Wastes is an area at the center of the board that is separated from the four quadrants and the other HEXtiles. This simulates a great distance between the City-States. To cross from one section to another, the heroes will need to travel with Caravans (or find the Magic Carpet!). Work with Caravan Masters to move into and out of the Wastes. Each journey will present unique challenges, risks, and rewards. Check out our videos on the Wastes for more info.\nRemnants & Mutations: Remnants are 3-hex map tiles that are placed on the board when the Ravager disappears back under the earth, leaving huge Crystal Towers in its wake. Crystal Towers are dangerous places where heroes become Irradiated and gain Mutations. Mutations reduce your maximum Energy ranks, but also grant special bonuses and increase the Power Up reward you receive for a particular stat.\nBoth the heroes and their opponents can gain Mutations, but Opponent Mutations function a little differently than Hero Mutations. Check out our Mutation video below for more info on these. \nThe City-States & Reputation: In the Sands of Shurax, your heroes will gain Reputation, which is a bit like their alignment. The four Reputation regions are: Righteous, Rebellious, Cruel, and Corrupt. \nThe City States are each aligned with two of the four Reputation regions.  You\u2019ll earn rewards for interacting with City-States whose Reputation matches your own, and  encounter dangerous scenarios when interacting in a City-State whose Reputation does not. Each City-State gives the heroes access to a new way to gain power.\nThe heroes can also find work in each of the City-States, spending time to earn both Gold and Reputation. Earn more Gold based on your Role type in certain locations. For instance, Strikers earn more Gold while Employed in Tarri, while Healers earn more Gold while Employed in Phorora.\nHeal the sick and help the poor in Phorora.\nBecome a street hand, helping merchants or picking pockets in Dria.\nBecome soulless guards of Emperor Noko, patrolling the streets of Tarri.\nPerform for the wealthy in Nemsynet\u2019s smoky gambling dens.\nWe've built in systems to prevent an entire game being spent in a City-State, however clever heroes can find ways to focus play there, instead of in the Wastes. Check out our video below for more info on the City-States.\nNew Opponent Subtypes: We're introducing a few new subtypes of opponents in the Sands of Shurax. Our heroes will now face Swarms and Hordes, opponents which have a new Vital called Outlast. Your normal attacks are largely ineffective against them. \nIn addition to Swarms and Hordes, we're also unveiling Titanic opponents. The Ravager is our first. These foes have more than one Health stat. Some opponents can even Mutate to gain the Titanic subtype. For more information on these new systems, click the video link below.\nRule book\nA beta version of the HEXplore It app is now available for download for both Android and Apple users. Check it out:\niOS users, click here to install.\nAndroid users, click here to install.\nWe are excited to announce that a new print cycle for both previous Volumes and their Expansions has been unlocked.

Here are some things our previous backers are saying about Volumes I and II:\nCheck out our hero randomizer on our website. Click away to create your next hero!\nDual Games - Play more than one Volume at a time.\nIf you have the Valley of the Dead King or the Forests of Adrimon, you can play along with Sands of Shurax in one session. You'll have two main bosses on the board (aside from the other 18!), both main bosses will be gaining power, and depending on how your game progresses, one or the other will take the upper hand.\nImagine if the Dead King came to control an undead version of the Ravager, or perhaps just as bad, Adrimon mindwiped the Ravager!  You'll need to defeat both in order to win this game. Your group will have access to all content that both games offer:  \nVisit several new game locations.\nComplete Quests, Destinations, or Missions.\nGain new items and build Relics.\nAcquire Gold, Platinum or Nature's Essence in order to gain powerful treasures. \nAttempt to destroy up to 18 more bosses! \nPower Up your heroes in an epic way using this play style. \nAll cards are marked for easy storage after play.\nSample Volume I and II Dual Game setup\nWhat are add ons? Add ons are items that we're selling apart from the pledge levels shown on the right sidebar. If you're interested in any of the below items, simply add up the cost of all add ons that you'd like to grab, and increase your pledge amount by the result. Add on's can also be added after the campaign ends in our Pledge Manager.\nAvailable Add Ons\nDice (choose from four types)\nDice Bags (choose from two types)\nLiving Card Decks (all 3 Volumes are available)\nHEXplore It Hero Chest\nVolume I: The Valley of the Dead King - 2nd Edition (Core + Expansion)\nVolume II: The Forests of Adrimon (Core + Expansion)\nVolume III: The Sands of Shurax\nDice & Dice Bags\n*These highlighted sets can improve your play experience for the Sands of Shurax.

Find the 36 Living Cards from our Living Card Campaign, as well as 24 new Peril cards which are played in an entirely unique way. Peril cards become an optional draw when the group rolls a hex on the Circumstance for the turn. When you roll a hex, you may choose to draw from the Circumstance deck normally or from the Peril deck. If you do, the revealed Peril card will have you play a specific set of two or more cards.\nThe HEXplore It Hero Chest: We\u2019re now releasing a premium storage box for the HEXplore It system. This box has three independent containers inside. It will hold all Roles, Races, Traits, and Legendary cards that we\u2019re planning to release in the HEXplore It gaming line, and it comes with a bunch of extra content! \nPoll: Take our poll to choose how you'd like to see the Hero Chest textured.\nPrevious Volumes & Expansions: We are excited to announce that we have unlocked a new print cycle for both of our previous volumes.

The above table shows our estimated shipping costs. The right column displays the amount of shipping cost that is added to your pledge at checkout.\nTariff Disclaimer: Due to the uncertainty of the current administration as it relates to tariffs, these shipping costs are subject to change. Our promise to you is that we\u2019ll only change our pricing structure if we\u2019re forced into that situation. Thankfully, tariffs were not enacted earlier in 2019; we\u2019re simply adding this disclaimer to be transparent with you. If you\u2019re unaware of how tariffs can affect the board game industry, check out this article: https://www.polygon.com/2019/6/5/18652411/trump-china-tariff-board-games. \nFlat Kickstarter Shipping Rates: One thing you'll find about our campaign, we're locking in our shipping prices based on the structure shown above. You won't pay any additional shipping costs for more content! Pay the shipping cost once, and load up on multiple products to lock in the best pricing. This pricing is only available for our Kickstarter backers only!\nTimeline\nOur first campaign delivered on time, and our second campaign delivered 3 months later than we had promised. This is largely due to the fact that we created 3 new boxes and remastered a fourth (volume 1 core). We are confident the time frame shown above (delivery to backers August of 2020) will be met or exceeded.\nOur Manufacturing Partner: We expect to team with Panda Manufacturing to produce the products found in Volume III. We're extremely happy with the quality of the components found in each of our previous volumes and are excited to work with them once again. \nOur Pledge Manager Partner:  Once again we're partnering with the helpful and somewhat ferocious gnomes at Pledge Manager to ensure your experience is a great one. You'll be able to alter your order and manage all add ons in our Pledge Manager shortly after the campaign ends.\nWe wanted to take a moment to say thank you, and to tell you a little about our company. We are a small team who greatly desires to bring you all fun and fulfilling content that can be used in a multitude of ways (even ways we haven\u2019t dreamed up of yet!).\nThe HEXplore It line was developed because there is a sort of fierce enjoyment that comes from telling a great story. The kind of story that evolves and changes because of the people telling it.\nWe are not a large company, and we rely on Kickstarter because we need your help and support to make these games a reality. Thank you for your consideration!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 3rd Kickstarter campaign in the HEXplore It series.

In After the Empire, you'll be recruiting refugees, gathering resources and fortifying your defenses in order to prepare for assault after assault of invaders seeking to sack your castle and take its riches. \n Cost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic pieces and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.    \nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \n Delivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.   (Please note: Because of unexpected delays and other unforseen issues, we reserve the right to sell the game at major conventions, even if they have not been delivered yet).  The reason for this is that conventions are among the best form of marketing and therefore necessary to give the game the best chance for success.  One guarantee we will give is that if we do release anywhere before the backers receive theirs it will be at a price that is higher (usually significantly) than what was offered in the campaign.)  \n\nThe fine print stuff:\nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% more or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.  \nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to buying our company \"team building\" yacht.  \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

It combines the fun of crafting a unique blade with the polyhedral dice combat of D&D! Players start the game with a lowly wooden grip and Adventurer blade and compete on the tabletop battlefield to forge more powerful weapons with a plethora of grips, guards, and blades to power up their attack and defense, all while utilizing gadgets and shields to turn the tides of battle in their favor. The last player standing wins! For more detailed rules, scroll down a bit or watch our video! \nThe detailed rules and a printable PDF version of the rules can be found here!\nPhoto from demo event at Cool Comics & Games in Cape Coral, FL.\nAll 56 unique cards included in Reforge.\nHere's how they fit together during a game.\nHere's the layout with a four player game.\nWhere did the idea come from?\nThe idea for Reforge came to me (Stephen) in a dream early 2019 that involved a card game where you build swords. I immediately started writing down what I saw in my dream and built off of that. The game mechanics came after as I experimented with custom made cards. After working tirelessly for a couple months, I had a product that I was happy to show to the world! After doing some conventions and demos, I'm really looking forward to getting the game into peoples hands!\nI work full time in a hospital, but have always wanted to create. I haven't stopped since this idea came to me, and I don't intend to until it is realized!\nAbout the team!\nThe team for Reforge includes game designer Stephen Royka and artist Sam Donez (Twixxo). After being best friends since high school, we decided to make something awesome together! Reforge is the result of decades of love for gaming and cartoon art.\n I (Stephen) love videogames, with my favorites being Okami, Resident Evil 4, Hollow Knight, and Bloodborne to name a few. I work as an ultrasound tech to pay for my love of game design. I'm hoping to be able to transition into working full time on card game design for my new company Secret Boss Games someday! \nSam is an artist by hobby and trade. While he kicks ass at cartoon art, his real focus is 3D environmental design. Check out his stuff on his website, Art By Twixxo!\nWhy the $6,000 goal?\nThe initial goal is primarily to cover production costs for game and shipping costs from the factory. We are trying to keep this goal as low as possible because we really want this to get made. From the quotes we've gotten, it's looking like this will just be enough to cover all those costs. We have put tons of time, money, and effort into this project and want nothing more than to see it become a reality that people love!\nAnd what about that $8,000 stretch goal? (Reduced from $10,000!)\nIf we hit that response, then every copy of Reforge purchased on the Kickstarter will include four sets of polyhedral dice! You need dice to play the game, but we have a solution just in case we don't reach that stretch goal. A webapp will be available for free that acts as a companion for Reforge to keep track of health and roll attack die! The app is currently in development, but a preview of its functionality can be seen here. We really want to ship the game with dice for a complete experience (and we know most people would prefer the feel of real dice!) so we really hope we can reach this goal!\nWe recently received new quotes from manufacturing facilities, so we will be able to bring Reforge to everyone with dice if we reach our stretch goal of $8,000!\nCheck below for info on gameplay, rewards, and more!\n For more of the nitty gritty details for the rules, check out the complete rule list here!\nThank you to all the generous Tier 7 backers! Here are the Final Blades that they came up with that will be included in every copy of Reforge!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately, the project is already completed!

Shaking a hot chocolate will result in a quicker, smoother and more delicious hot chocolate with the added benefit of a little theatre. \nThe secret to a great hot chocolate is the formation of an emulsion between the chocolate and hot liquid. If you fail to create an emulsion, you will find your hot chocolate is weak, has poor texture and typically will have pieces of chocolate sitting at the bottom of the cup. \nAs artisan chocolatiers, we knew that to form an emulsion we had to create friction to bind the chocolate and hot liquid together. When we looked at stirring the chocolate and hot liquid together we found that not enough friction was being created to bind the two together. \nThe Challenge:\nWhen we started shaking a hot chocolate, we saw that it created an emulsion very quickly, however we also found that the shakers would explode resulting in chocolate all over our kitchen. \nThe Solution:\nWe discovered that when a hot liquid is shaken, the air trapped in the shaker warms due to the hot liquid and expands in volume. This means that a pressure is created when shaking a hot liquid. \nIf the shaker does not have anyway of accommodating that pressure, it will result in a hot chocolate explosion. Upon understanding this, we decided to try to develop an expanding shaker that would accommodate this pressure. We achieved this with our innovative popping lid. \nOther features of the Hot Chocolate Shaker include: Double Walled Beaker, Tritan Shatterproof BPA Free Plastic, Dishwasher Safe, Microwave Safe, Made in the UK, Recyclable.\nHot Chocolate Shaker Features\nHow to Use The Shaker:\n1. Reset the Shaker:\nResetting the shaker lid is the most important part of using the shaker. To reset the shaker, simply push the popping lid so it is in the 'Down' position. The clip below shows how this is done.\nPLAY\n\n2. Filling & Shaking:\nOnce you have the lid ready in the Reset position. Simply follow the below steps for deliciously smooth hot chocolate in seconds. The great thing about the shaker, is you can use solid pieces of chocolate, you don't need to use powders or flakes, you can simply chop up your favourite chocolate bar and shake!\nHow to use the Hot Chocolate Shaker\nThe Journey:\nThe Hot Chocolate Shaker journey started two years ago when we first came up with the idea. \nWe have had the tooling designed and made and run first offs, we are now looking to place our first order.\nYour Support:\nWe feel that we have created a truly innovative product that looks set to shake up the hot chocolate market, \nIn order to bring this product to market we need to hit a minimum quantity of shakers and that\u2019s where you come in. By supporting us, you will be pre-buying one of our rewards, which will allow us to place our first Hot Chocolate Shaker order. \nAs a thank you for supporting us, our rewards are all at greatly reduced prices \u2013 up to 60% in some cases. \nThe Timeline:\nWe hope to be sending the shakers in September 2019, if not sooner. \nIf we can fund this project and hit our target we can go to production very quickly. \nA Vehicle For Creativity:\nOne of the most exciting aspects of the Hot Chocolate Shaker is that since we have been using it, our creativity for hot chocolate has expanded enormously. \nWe believe our product is versatile and unique as it enables you to use\n- different types of hot liquids (milk, dairy alternatives or even just water).\n- to serve the product hot or cold.\n- different infusions and alcohols.\n- different chocolate types, origins and percentages.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have spent a large amount of time developing a product we are truly proud of.

Unleash a Flying, Flipping, Spinning Kick on your opponents, but be careful to hang onto a Block or two for when they try to do the same to you!\nAs SlugFest's first published game, Kung Fu Fighting has always held a special place in our hearts and the hearts of our longtime fans. This exciting card game hit a really good sweet spot as a quick and light game that still had some interesting choices and lots of silly, over-the-top cinematic Kung Fu moments.\nA typically over-the-top attack.\nSo after it was out of print we tried to Kickstart a totally new edition: fancy art, overhauled mechanics, higher production value, etc. Response was overwhelmingly meh.\nSince that failed project, we've thought a lot about this game, and we still get occasional requests for reprints. After the success of our low-key print-on-demand version of En Garde Reforged, we decided we should do the same thing for Kung Fu Fighting.\nWe are very much using the KISS principle for this project: Keep It Simple, SlugFest! Rather than redoing everything (art, mechanics, etc.), we are simply creating a lightly-updated set of cards with the original art and mechanics and sending that off to our friends at DriveThruCards for printing.\nHowever, as with the En Garde Reforged campaign, we have one stretch goal. If we pass $30k, we will do a manufacturing print run of the game instead. It will still be the lightly-updated original game, however. (For our previous Kung Fu Fighting campaign we underestimated the amount of love that was out there for the original version!)\nAs with our En Garde Reforged campaign, we can offer you the game right now, in a very functional, if minimalist way. Our colleagues at DriveThruCards do great, reliable work and are ready to publish this game through their print-on-demand services. In essence, your  pledge of support is a pre-order for the new print-on-demand version of the game, consisting of:\n Kung Fu Fighting deck\n More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play\n6 mini-player mats\n2 large plastic deck boxes (the game is too big for just one!)\nThe rules will be available online and you will need to supply 6 objects to use as Chi Tokens  (which conveniently fit in the deck boxes!).\nIf demand for the game is high enough, then instead of offering a minimalist print-on-demand version of the game, we will manufacture a full production run of the game! Allow us to introduce you to our one and only over-funding milestone: the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal!\nAs you can see, we do not have an all-or-nothing initial funding level. We can create and deliver the print-on-demand version of the game with even just a single backer. What this Kickstarter campaign is all about, however, is whether or not we can get enough folks interested in the game to elevate it to the next level, taking it from print-on-demand to full  manufacturing. Therefore, there are no nickel and dime micro-upgrades with dozens of micro-goals like you might expect from traditional board game campaigns. We only need one, all-or-nothing stretch goal: If we can raise $30,000 everyone's rewards upgrade for free, becoming a manufactured version of Kung Fu Fighting with all the bells and whistles, including:\n Kung Fu Fighting deck\n More Kung Fu Fighting expansion, including extra cards for the base game, Archetype cards and cards for Team play\n6 full-size player mats\n6 Chi Markers\n1 Game Box with Cover Art\nRules\nThis upgrade includes all the usual micro-goals you usually see from  other campaigns: improved box, glossy rules, token upgrades, etc. Best  of all, even if we don\u2019t hit the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, everyone will still be getting a great game (and, as a consolation prize, they'll be getting it way ahead of schedule)!\nThe unique nature of this campaign has some big ramifications on the estimated delivery date for the rewards. If we do not reach the Kung Fu Master Stretch Goal, we will ship rewards as soon as the campaign funds become available. Therefore, we actually have two estimated  delivery dates:\nIf we receive <$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by August 2019.\nIf we receive >$30,000 of funding, rewards will be shipped out by February 2020.\nBecause we can only list one estimated delivery date on the pledge levels we can offer, we opted to use the farthest out date.\nBackers are required to fulfill all of their regional obligations for import. Unfortunately, there is no region-friendly shipping for this project.\nIn addition, we should note here that we will not be using a pledge manager for this project.\nInterested in picking up some of our other games?

We are offering two different versions of the rewards depending on whether or not we hit our stretch goal.

One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes,  who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side  takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to  achieve their objectives.\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a mission which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game,  number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to  achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing  sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game.  The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards... everything the  heroes need to play a mission. The villain box contains the miniatures,  tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the  fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals you have unlocked during the first campaign.\n This pledge level allows you to pick and choose what you want, and then decide on your pledge level \u20ac total.

This is a great starting point for you, and if you\u2019re curious about the journey so far you can view our previous campaign here.\nWherever you hail from, step aboard with us now as we launch the series into the farthest reaches of space\u2026\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  is a simple, sci-fi adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling, and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes about 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nOver the course of three acts the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, from cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete the challenges before them.\nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the mission deck, and then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive. If any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122 is inspired by classic sci-fi books, films, and TV programmes, including Alien, the original Star Wars trilogy, and Star Trek: The Next Generation to name a few \u2013 and of course, this being part of the Escape the Dark\u2122 series, it also has its roots in the classic adventure experiences of the Fighting Fantasy gamebooks and the Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. \nEscape the Dark Sector\u2122  has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is a step-by-step overview, or scroll down for a gameplay video. If you\u2019re interested in learning more you can read a very early draft of the rule book here. \nKeen to know what it's like to play Escape the Dark Sector? \nSit back and enjoy this demo game with the team at On Tabletop: \nAt its core, Escape the Dark Sector\u2122 utilities the same narrative game engine as Castle, but adds several new features that make it a different experience altogether: \n A 3-Act Adventure: The chapter cards which make up the mission deck are divided into three acts, each getting progressively more challenging as the mission goes on and each also offering different item drop-rates and a different ratio of encounter types - allowing for a new layer of decision making and strategy. \n Thrilling Ranged Combat: From lowly Slug-pistols to formidable Beam-emitters, a ranged combat system has been designed from the ground up to add thrilling firefights to the adventure. But even with an array of weaponry at your disposal, teamwork remains vital to mission success. \n Tactical Combat Actions: As the game\u2019s intense firefights play out, the highly-trained crew have a wide selection of tactical options at their disposal - including Shoot, Charge, Take Cover, Flank, Ambush, Treat Wounds, and Reload. Forming a robust plan of attack is essential to taking down tough enemies. \n Cybernetic Implants: Each member of the crew is fitted with a interchangeable neural-augmentation chip, giving them a unique enhancement to call upon during the adventure - from pain inhibitors to advanced-reflexes. Players will have the option to switch these out, either to swap with another member of the crew or to replace them with upgrades found along the way  - but doing so incurs an HP penalty! \nYou can find more information about these and other features of the game, in our early draft rulebook here. \nHere's an interview with co-designer Thomas Pike, talking in more detail about some of the game's features: \nSince the game is still in development, the exact contents may vary from that shown here.\n What makes the ESCAPE THE DARK\u2122 series different?\n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic sci-fi mission. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes less than 5 mins to set up and around 45 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a the group a choice, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - Many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxom heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You'll be part of something big \u2013 With a wide range of Escape the Dark products already released, a wealth of adventure awaits you. Join our ever-growing community of players! \nWe have organised our pledge levels and add-ons to allow every possible combination of rewards.\nAt each pledge level, on top of the pledge itself, a shipping charge will apply based on your location. We've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum. See the Shipping section for details.\n LEVEL 1: \u00a330.00\n(RRP \u00a334.99) \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section.\n LEVEL 2: \u00a335.00\n(RRP \u00a341.97) \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nOne pack of A6 Clear Matte Sleeves\nOne pack of A8 Clear Matte Sleeves\nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \n LEVEL 3: \u00a355.00\n(RRP \u00a361.94)\nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nFour Crew Terminal Playmats\nOne Mission Playmat \nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \n LEVEL 4: \u00a360.00\n(RRP \u00a368.92)\nOur top level pledge, the complete package with a large discount for the ultimate Escape the Dark Sector experience! \nIncludes: \nOne copy of Escape the Dark Sector\nOne pack of A6 Clear Matte Sleeves\nOne pack of A8 Clear Matte Sleeves\nFour Crew Terminal Playmats\nOne Mission Playmat \nAny digital stretch goals unlocked during the campaign\nAn invitation to our pledge manager after the campaign, where you can purchase items from our add-ons section. \nOur \u00a316k funding goal will cover the manufacturing and associated logistical costs of this campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer our backers the following freebies and upgrades: \nPlease note: All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP.\nUNLOCKED! \nAt this level of funding, we'll commission an Original Soundtrack to perfectly accompany gameplay -  composed and performed by Alex Crispin.\n All backers will get the MP3 files delivered to them free of charge via Backerkit when the campaign delivers, and physical copies of the soundtrack on vinyl will be unlocked as an optional add-on.\nUNLOCKED!   \nAt this level of funding, we'll commission two books by Thomas Paul Pike: \nMission Log - a collection of interconnected short fiction, delving into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and of course offering what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nDeath in Deep Space - adds contextual death scenes to gameplay.  No matter which chapter, item or boss brings about your untimely death, simply flip to the corresponding page for full immersion into the final events of the mission.  \nAll backers will get a free PDF of each of these books delivered to them via Backerkit, and physical copies of the books will be unlocked as an optional add-on. \n UNLOCKED!    \nAt this level of funding, we'll produce a range of T-shirts for Escape the Dark Sector, available to all backers as a optional add-on. \n At this level of funding, we'll produce a companion app for Escape the Dark Sector. Free to download when it launches, and compatible with both iOS and Android devices. \nSimple, elegant and atmospheric, it will be designed to be used on the tabletop alongside the physical game to do things like: \nTrack Crew HP, play the soundtrack, display pages from Death in Deep Space, and offer searchable rules and FAQ. \nThis will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. \nWhile the best way to experience Escape the Dark Sector will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny making a digital version does sound fun. If we raise a million pounds, we'll take the plunge into computer games. \nThis will be free to all backers, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nHow does it work? \nTo include add-ons in your pledge, simply increase your pledge amount by the total value of all the add-ons you want. \nAt the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to select exactly which items you want to put your pledged amount towards. \nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the base level shown on the charts in our Shipping section. We'll calculate your new shipping total in Backerkit at the end of the campaign (based on your location and the total weight of your order). \n In case you want more than one, we're offering additional copies of the main game. \nLuxurious card sleeves specially designed to protect your Escape the Dark Sector collection. \n There are sleeves for both sizes of cards: A6 (large) and A8 (small). One pack of each is enough to completely sleeve the game.\nTake your game to the next level of desirability with our beautifully illustrated neoprene playmats - transforming your play area into a computer terminal. Each mat serves one member of the crew. \nThere is a lot going on in the mission area during a game of Escape the Dark Sector. Add a bit of 'mission control' to your experience with this evocative playmat.  \nA soundtrack specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay, housed in a luxurious sleeve. A must for collectors. \nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the Dark Sector with Mission Log - a collection of short fiction penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. Delve into the background stories of the crew and their ill-fated mission, and learn what little is known about the game's vile adversaries.\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with Death in Deep Space, containing a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game capable of killing you, and of course for the bosses too.\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding page and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Sector?\nIf you choose to pledge for the Join the Crew add-on, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw an exclusive crew portrait - of you! \nHow it works: \nPick the crew member you'd like to become, then take a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines (we'll send these out after the campaign).We do the rest. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. The cards will be produced to full game specification, and will be fully playable when paired with the die of your chosen character. \nImagine the satisfaction when you Escape the Dark Sector personally!\nEscape the Dark Castle Bundles\nIf you missed out on our first game, this is the perfect chance to catch up, and save money while you're at it.

We want to assure you that we worked hard for this KS to be a success: we contacted professionals to guarantee the highest possible quality throughout the planning, production and shipment phases. Of course, unexpected events can happen in every project, but we can ensure you that we have made all the possible, foreseeable arrangements to minimize their possible impact. The estimated date of arrival of \u201cCleopatra and the Society of Architects: Deluxe Edition\u201d is March 2020, but keep in mind that this is just approximate and that we will do everything in our power to release it earlier. As soon as the game is ready, we will ship it to all the backers: keep in mind, though, that, due to international shipping logistics, backers from some regions might receive their rewards before. We will do everything we can to make sure you will get the best possible experience and to deserve your trust.

With the successful execution of our first 49 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \n Kodama 3D was designed by the talented Erica Hayes-Bouyouris (Bosk) and Daryl Andrews (Sagrada, City of Gears, Bosk). This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \n Kodama 3D is a three-dimensional tree building game with tactical movement that has beautiful table presence.\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $24 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just four easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing!\n Step 4: Shortly after the projects ends on June 6th, we will send you a link to our pledge manager. This is where we will get your shipping information and which language versions of the game you would like to receive.\nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family.

To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below: \nFor the US, Canada, UK and the EU we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.   \nIf you would like extra copies, please see the chart below which includes shipping for your region.  \nWe are excited to offer retailer packages for Brick and Mortar stores. For more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com. \nOur plan is to have Kodama 3D available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out around the time of Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time.

It's a simple-to-play tabletop game where a party of 1-4 players explores the ever-changing catacombs in a quest to find the Ring of Creation before escaping with their lives and their loot.\nBut can you trust your fellow adventurers? As you embark on your adventure and set foot in the dungeon, you are all loyal to the quest and each other. But once the Ring is discovered it will cast a shadow of doubt and deceit over those who seek to steal it. You may decide that being a lone wolf is a far smarter choice than loyalty, even if it means the death of your former companions.  \nYou will encounter monsters, find treasure and use items to stay alive and hopefully escape with the Ring before the dungeon seals itself shut, imprisoning for all eternity anyone who remains.\nThe game has a simple but clever mechanic; great for young and/or new gamers to learn fast and take  part while still giving more experienced gamers a satisfying time at the table. The game takes 20-60 minutes and changes every time you play. \n\u201cKeep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\u201d\nPlaytesting BOD at our games club was received with great enthusiasm, even before the beer started flowing!\nHit points... \nPlay alone or with up to four players\nWork as a team or turn on your fellow adventurers\nDelve deeper and deeper into the dungeon to find the Ring\nDefeat monsters and receive loot\nCollect spells, potions, weapons and armour\nUse bows and spells to fight from afar or get up close with your trusty weapon to defeat the dwellers that lurk below\nSimple set up and easy to play\nLightning fast combat, simple but rewarding\nBroad appeal across different ages and experience\nSmall, lightweight and great for holidays, travel or gaming clubs\nCreated with a simple black, white and red design so as to fuel your own imagination and encourage roleplaying\nEverything an adventurer needs... in a bag\nGameplay\nThe object of the game is to get in, get the Ring of Creation, and get out.\nPlayers take turns to move their character deeper into the dungeon, fighting monsters and gaining weapons, armour, potions and spells that will aid them in discovering the Ring and escaping the dungeon. As soon as any character reaches the exit with the Ring, the dungeon seals itself shut forever, along with any adventurers still inside. \nEvery game is different, every turn a challenge!\nWork as a cooperative party but watch your back!\nMany players prefer the loyal approach, working together and helping each other towards shared success. But once the Ring is revealed it can play on the weak-minded. Will you stick together, fight back to back and drink to a successful alliance in the tavern that night, or will you attempt to escape alone, slaying any who stand in your way?\nAllegiances can be made and broken, lies and mistrust become the new enemies, and no-one will truly know who is for or against them until they emerge alive into the sunlight once more.  \nOne ring to woo them all, but be careful: it may sow discord and death among the players\nHeroes, monsters and loot\nThe characters are based on the classic adventure types : dwarf, elf, human and healer. All character cards have a male/female version. We will produce more add-ons and characters in the future.  \nFill your backpacks with items and weapons\nThe dungeon is packed with monsters, each hell-bent on slaying the characters who dare enter their domain. Monsters are drawn randomly from the Monster Bag and remain in the dungeon until killed. From goblins to trolls, zombies to snakes, mad monks to the legendary red dragon... you'd better hope that you've found the famed Dragon Lance when you meet her!\nPlayers also receive items from the Loot Bag, providing weapons, armour, spells, potions and magic items to aid them in their quest.\nAnd... action!\nPlayers roll a dice to determine the number of Action Points (APs) for their turn. They then use their APs to explore a new dungeon space, move or use items in any combination until all their APs are used up.\nExploring the dungeon\nDungeon tiles are drawn from the pile. They are laid so that an open edge joins another, creating a logical path through the dungeon. Every game is different. Finding your way in is easy; getting out is a different matter - avoiding or slaying more monsters, finding the safest and quickest route, and oftentimes doing battle with your former comrades to survive and escape.\nBuild your dungeon as you play, find the ring and escape!\nCombat\nCombat is quick and dirty with a simple but rewarding mechanic, pitting a character's armour and items against its opponent's. Fighting is played out simultaneously, reducing health with each roll until one or other of the combatants is dead or the character escapes. Defeat a monster and the character gets an item from the Loot Bag. Lose and your character drops all its items and is sent back to the entrance, losing one of its three lives. Lose all three lives and your game is over. You have failed in your quest.\nRange weapons allow you to fight from afar. But beware, monsters will give chase and hunt you down. \nMake those ranged weapons count or these monsters will be upon you!\nCombat is quick and deadly!\nSolo game\nBag of Dungeon can be played solo. You can control up to four characters but you only get one life each. Try an easier version with all four characters or test your luck and skill by taking a lone adventurer into the darkness of the dungeon. \nPlaytesting the game\nThe game prototype has been reprinted and tested many times with young and older experienced players and has been received with great enthusiasm:\n\"It started as a simple adventure with a friendly group of dungeoneers, until one player decided to take the Ring for himself and leave the rest of us to die. Then things got really interesting, and the whole game went up a gear.\" Russ, Playtester \nWe have ironed out all the dead ends, slow downs and game breakers and streamlined the game play to give a slick hour of hacking, slaying, chasing, lying and dying.\nGame design\nBag of Dungeon is designed to be the kind of retro gaming experience that takes a nostalgic trip down memory alley, but we also wanted to introduce the popular contemporary mechanics of traitors and back-stabbing. The distinctive black, white and red visual style is a modern take on simple cards and cardboard counters that typified game production of the 1980s. As we launch new expansions, cards and counters, the Bag of Dungeon family will have a distinctive and instantly recognisable identity. \nYour backpack space is limited so choose your items carefully!\nGame contents\nBag of Dungeon comes in a printed cotton bag, and contains:\n1 Monster Bag and 1 Loot Bag\n40 floor tiles\n30 monster tiles\n40 item tiles\n8 double-sided character cards with backpacks (male and female)\n2 limited edition Kickstarter only, double-sided character cards (minotaur and hobbit)\n16 coloured cubes\n4 coloured meeples\n2 six sided dice \n1 metal Ring of Creation\n1 large cotton bag\nAll comes in a fancy and original printed box for storage and stacking\nKeep BOD in the box for easy storage or just take the bag with you on your travels\nBag of Dungeon: everything you need to go adventuring... in a bag!\nOfficial BOD dice tower reward!!!\nIf you like the clickety-clack of dice during your game, the BOD dice tower is a must reward. You will not only receive the full boxed BOD game but also an exclusive branded wooden dice tower bearing the Bag of Dungeon logo. The dice tower comes flat packed but is easily slotted together (no glue needed) to make a towering must-have for your new game.\nBehold! The BOD wooden dice tower, an exclusive Kickstarter reward\nBranded with the BOD dragon logo, the tower is easy to build, needs no glue and folds flat for easy travel\nStretch goal!\nThis is what you're going to receive in every game box if we achieve a campaign total of \u00a328,000.\nThe Dragon Scrolls: get 'em while they're hot!\n11 (not 10), new challenges and quests to add to your BoD world!\nJoin us on our adventure\nIf you'd like to help us make Bag of Dungeon a must have item for gaming shelves around the world, please pledge your support, join the party and grab yourself some lovely loot.\nIf you have any questions please get in touch.\nNote: The game shown is a prototype. Some illustrations, stats or floor tiles may change slightly. We have everything in place to start printing, production schedule poised for action, parts sourced and everything costed down to the last copper piece. \nWe are equipped and ready to go forth and conquer!\nWhen will I get my loot?\nWe plan to deliver all pledge rewards anywhere in the world within two months of hitting our funding goal. We'll keep you posted regularly on progress and production milestones.\nYou'll also be able to contact us direct during production if you have any questions.\nAbout the designer... \nTim Sharville is a freelance game designer and illustrator. He has been working in print design and branding for many years and attended the London College of Printing for art and design. He runs a small independent design company called Gunpowder Studios (but basically he's an inventor who plays too many board games;)\nThanks to everyone from the gaming and kickstarter community for your support so far. What a loyal bunch you are!\nFinally thanks to my very special gaming friends for all your help and support on BOD, Andy, Russ (the mechanic), Julian, Mick (the monk) for working out the numbers, and especially brother Paul for proof reading and editing the game over and over again and letting me play his copy of Tunnels and Trolls back in 1983.\nNote: Bag of Dungeon is in prototype form only (we have had a small number printed for testing) and it's not for sale anywhere in the world yet. If we get funded it will literally Kickstart us for the first time ever into production, which is very exciting!\nAbout the printer\nLudo Fact are a well established game printing company based in Germany.

This includes Fred's own request for PPE - a Pint and a Pickled Egg - and Freda's - Pretty Pink Earrings - both of which seem to be doing the trick. \nFred and Freda have also been tested for coronavirus. The results were interesting. Fred's results initially came back positive, but a time-lapse recording from the electron microscope showed the virus entering his system, taking one look at its new home and deciding to leave immediately. More bizarre was Freda's test which showed the virus actively being chased from her system by a group of angry T cells armed with what looked like tiny cast-iron frying pans.

We have great faith in our erstwhile postal assistant who, despite his many anti-social difficulties, means well and is very devoted to the project (although we don't think offering to fight anyone who makes a negative comment is necessarily the best way to deal with criticism, hence the course).

We unlocked the Alternate Finale Pack #1 for all Career backers!\nHostage Negotiator: Career is the grand finale to the Hostage Negotiator product line... taking the experience to heights you won't believe!\nYou've graduated the academy. And now it is time to prove yourself. Can you hold up to the stresses of multiple hostage negotiations? Not to mention the stresses of your career and personal life? Only one way to find out...\nThe all-in Commissioner (Plus Mat) pledge show here. Click to see in full glory.\nHostage Negotiator: Career requires most of the existing Hostage Negotiator content, and frankly, it is best if you own it all.  But don't worry, if you are missing something you'll be able to fill in the gaps by adding those products to your pledge. \nAnd if you are new? You have the option of backing for the Lieutenant level which is the minimum required to be able to play HN: Career or what we highly recommend, which is to back at the Commissioner Level for everything in the entire line at an incredible price.\nContents and/or counts are subject to change before final production\n This summary will explain how HN: Career works. It assumes you already know how to play Hostage Negotiator. If you don't, that's ok and we have included some helpful videos down below that will show you everything you need to know!\nHN Career is a system that turns your Hostage Negotiator experience into a connected, epic, 10 year campaign. You will experience more than just the tense moments of your negotiations. You'll also experience the key events in the days between them. A campaign will generally take a total of 4-6 hours of game time and the system is completely replayable and the events of the campaign and which Abductors you face will be different each time!\nEach campaign round is ONE YEAR of your Career. Many things can happen in a year as you will soon find out. Here we have a look at the Career sheet. \n As you can see, you will be tracking several stats. You can mark these with pieces while you play, and then circle where you are at the end of your session to save your game. You'll also be recording the results of your negotiations and some key stats from each of them.\nEach year in your Career consists of 4 phases: \n1. The Stressor Event phase\nThroughout the course of your career, some events will cause you to add a Stressor Card to the Stressor Deck. In this phase, you will draw one Stressor Card at random from the Stressor Deck and resolve it. If there are no cards in the deck, you just move on to the next phase. These cards have a similar format to the Career and Personal event cards which you'll see examples of below.\n2. The Career Event phase\nIn the Career Event phase, you will resolve a Career Card for the year you are in. Most years have 5 different Career Cards, so every Career you play will have many different events! These events will relate more to your career.\n You will be presented with a narrative event and then be given a choice. Choose wisely as your choice will have meaningful impacts on your career!\nWhen you have made your choice, take the Red Decoder and place it over the text on that side of the card to find out the results of your choice. Then you will apply them as indicated.\n For example, in this case, you would increase Personal Stress by 1 and add a random \"Cigarettes\" Stressor card to the Stressor Deck.\nLastly, you will flip the Career card over and read the Crisis! segment of the card. Usually, this will result in you getting called to the scene of a negotiation and playing a round of Hostage Negotiator against one of the Abductors. You'll usually draw from the Campaign Abductor deck to see which Abductor you will be facing.\n3. The Negotiation phase\nThe Negotiation phase is where you will play a game of Hostage Negotiator against the Abductor randomly chosen from the Campaign Abductor Deck. Make sure you apply any effects from other cards that may effect how the negotiation is set-up. Then you'll play out your negotiation.\nWhen the negotiation ends, record your results on the Career Sheet. What happens in your negotiations could effect things later on!\n4. The Personal Event phase\nIn the Personal Event phase, you will resolve a Personal Card. These are not specific to year like the Career cards. There are 25 different Personal Cards, so you will have a variety of different events each campaign. These events will relate more to your personal life.\nAgain you will be given a narrative event and a choice and will apply the results of your choice. \nFinally, apply the Negotiation Impacts at the bottom of the Personal card. These impacts will vary based on your success or failure in the negotiation. \nAnd that would conclude 1 Full Year of Hostage Negotiator Career! You could stop and save, or immediately move on to the next year! I wonder what will happen with that Stressor...\nWhat else can happen? Tell me more!\nThe answer to that is A LOT! Here are a few more things you can expect to see in the game. \nStress Checks\nDuring the game you may be asked to make a \"Career Stress Check\" or a \"Personal Stress Check\".  When this happens you will roll a die and compare it to the stress level. If the roll is higher than your stress level you pass the check, if not, it is failed.   \n Merit Checks, Rolling for Promotion, and Rank\nAs your career progresses you may get a chance to be promoted! When this happens you will make a Merit Check. To pass the check and get promoted you need to roll lower than your merit level.   When you get promoted, your Rank will increase. \nAt the beginning of the game you will start as an Officer. As your career progresses, you could achieve a rank as high as Captain. Each time your rank increases you will get... oh wait, can't tell you that. But obviously, getting promoted is GOOD and you will be happy!\nRewards\nYou will earn rewards as you play. These are different things that will give you benefits. Maybe a promotion, some vacation time, or maybe an Advanced Skill! Advanced Skills will direct you to open a special box or envelope that comes with your game. What could be inside???? \nTraits\nAs you progress, your personality will be formed through your decisions and your skill as a negotiator. You will gain traits based on your decisions. Some may be good, some not so good. What kind of negotiator and person will you be? \nHow does it end?\nThe campaign will usually end after your 10th year although it can end before that with a shameful retirement if you lose too many hostages. If you make it through year 10, you will then play a special end game finale. A climax to your career that can end in a variety of different ways. All of them dramatic. \nWe are very excited to offer the final 2 Abductor Packs. One of the new packs is from a veteran game designer, T.C. Petty III and developed by Mikolaj Laczynski. The other is from a new designer and our very own, Shaun Varsos and developed by A.J. Porfirio. These packs, like the others, add a new scenario with new mechanisms and challenges.  All packs are compatible with Hostage Negotiator, Crime Wave, and Career.\n *Please note while we have previously outsourced production of the custom meeples with Meeple Source, for this campaign all of our custom meeples will be produced from our own manufacturer.\nRETAILER PLEDGE\nWe welcome pledges from Retailers. Due to the extensiveness of this product line and quantity of different products offered, we ask that you contact us directly through the Kickstarter Messaging system to inquire about retailer pricing.\nVERY IMPORTANT! You MUST own or purchase: Hostage Negotiator (base game), Hostage Negotiator: Crime Wave, and at least 7 Abductor Packs (but the more the better).\nPictured is the minimum needed to play Hostage Negotiator: Career.\nThese products are completely optional, but can add to the experience: Demand Pack #1, All Negotiator Cards, and the custom meeples. If you are starting now and back at the Commissioner Level, don't worry! Your package will come with all of these! \nOther Optional products available as add-on only: 2019 Dice Tower Negotiator Cards and 2019 Secret Cabal - Year 0 Career Card. These are special promos that are add ons only regardless of what level you pledge for.\nOnly need certain items? Check out the add-ons section below!\nBecause Hostage Negotiator Career is so unique and requires BOTH previous base games, but also expansion packs, it is fairly likely that many of you will need add-ons. To pledge for add-ons, you just need to add additional $ equal to the amount for the items you want and need. You can do this now, on KS (it helps reach Stretch Goals!) or in our post campaign pledge manager, you will be able to make your selections and finalize your add-on choices. \nHere are all of the Add-Ons and their cost:\nFor example, Mary has everything except for Abductor Packs 2 & 3 and the new stuff (Career and APs 9&10). She backs at the $40 level for the new stuff, but she needs to add $5 for pack #2 and $5 for pack #3. She also wants the custom game mat which is $20. So she clicks \"manage your pledge\" and adds $30 to bring her total pledge to $70 before shipping is applied. \nStretch goals achieved and yet to come are shown below!\nWe ship from within the USA, Canada, Asia, Australia, and the European Union. Shipping will be charged after the campaign and will be based on weight and destination. Here are some range estimates for some popular locations. We strive to keep shipping costs as low as possible.\nWatch it Played presents - How to Play Hostage Negotiator\nRahdo Runs Through Hostage Negotiator\nMaybe you are wondering \"Why no videos on the Career Expansion?\" \nHere is why:\n1) We feel very strongly about keeping the game content and surprises of HN: Career a secret to be discovered by each player upon release. Only a select handful of internal parties and trusted playtesters have experienced the Career Expansion as a prototype. Although it is not \"legacy\" per se and can be replayed over and over, it has some \"legacy-like\" elements to it that we don't want spoiled! :)\n2) Secondly, the Career expansion provides content that \"surrounds\" and \"enhances\" the experience of Hostage Negotiator. So if you don't think you will like Hostage Negotiator based on the videos above, then the Career expansion probably isn't going to change that.\nHowever, because we want you to have a little bit of a taste of what is to come, as part of this Kickstarter we will host a \"mini 3 year campaign\" and if you own HN and/or Crime Wave (both are available now from your local game store or online from our website at vanrydergames.com!), YOU can play along at home!\nFree to play throughout this Kickstarter!\nWe are supporting a mini-Career campaign during this Kickstarter that will allow YOU to play along with a short 3-year career that will take place throughout the KS campaign! You will be able to experience what the Career expansion will be like by playing along! This is completely free to play (however you must own HN and/or CrimeWave at minimum) and you are under no obligation to back the Career project or do anything else to play along. Having said that, we greatly appreciate any social media shares and any other discussing of the campaign you might feel inclined to do!\nSo, let\u2019s jump in shall we? Oh, one thing to note real quick. This mini-campaign is completely made up and none of the cards or story events in this mini-campaign are actually in the Career Expansion. The campaign sheet, Officer rank card, rules, and overall structure are, however, exactly the same as what you will find in Career. \n First things first, go ahead and print this Career Sheet.  \n Set your starting stress levels on the shaded areas, you can circle with a pencil or use a game piece of your choice to track your stats. Go ahead and write your name on your business card as well, so we can get your badge and credentials processed, Officer! Speaking of Officer, here is your Rank Card.  \n Now let\u2019s begin! It is Year 1\u2026 \nThe first Phase of each year is The Stressor Event phase. In Year 1, you won\u2019t have any Stressors yet so we can skip right on through this for now.\nPhase 2 is The Career Event phase. So we have to draw a Career Event card and resolve it. It will be one of several for each given year of the campaign, that you will draw one from at random.  \nIn some years, you will add new Campaign Abductor cards to the Campaign Abductor deck before resolving the event. In Year 1, you will add the following Abductors to the deck: Arkayne (HN base), Donna (HN base), Edward (HN base), Lijah (HNCW), Seaver (AP6). If you don't own all of these abductors right now, don't worry. Just use what you have.\n Let's take a look at the event...  \nDon't worry about finding a red viewfinder, just make your choice and we will reveal the resolutions below!\nIt really is quite simple\u2026 read the text of the event. You have 2 choices. Go ahead and make your choice now\u2026 you might want to consider how your choice could impact your stress levels and your life in general. \nGot it? Ok well let\u2019s take a look at the results\u2026 to do so, we\u2019ll hold our red viewfinder over the choice we made and resolve it. \nIf you decided to \"Check the Bulletin Board for Anything of Interest\" read the resolution below. Otherwise, scroll past the first one for the resolution to \"Head Outside for A Smoke\". \n+1 CS means you need to increase your Career Stress. Note that higher stress is NOT a good thing. \n +1 PS means you need to increase your Personal Stress. Note that higher stress is NOT a good thing. Additionally, you have gained a Stressor. When this happens, we find the Stressor Cards labeled \"Cigarettes\", shuffle them and put one at random in the Active Stressor Deck. This is the first Stressor you've gotten, so it is the first card in that deck.  \nThis is not a real Stressor in the game\nWhatever you chose, go ahead and adjust the stat on your Career Sheet! If a Stressor was gained, that card was added to the Stressor Deck. One Stressor from the deck will be resolved in the first phase of each Year!\nFinally, let\u2019s take a look at the CRISIS! Section of the Career Event card by flipping it upside down\u2026 \nThe Crisis section is resolved last in Phase 2\nIt looks like you have a job to do! When your Career starts, only certain Abductors can show up when you draw one at random from the Campaign Abductor Deck.  Now you would draw one to see who you will be playing against in phase 3, the Negotiation Phase. Since this mini-campaign is presented remotely go ahead and select a random abductor from those in the deck (Arkayne, Donna, Edward, Lijah, or Seavers) by a random method of your choice. \nIt is now Phase 3 - The Negotiation Phase. Set up and play a game of Hostage Negotiator against the abductor you chose at random. When you are finished, mark the results on your Career Sheet! \nThis campaign has continued in the first update of this Kickstarter!

Communication is of the utmost importance to us. Please ask any and all questions and we will answer as quickly as possible. \n2.

Any request for refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and administrative expenses. Please note that, anyone that does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund for any reason, including the assessment of additional shipping fees for expenses related to the delinquency of the survey information.\n\nAbandoned Pledges \n\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time.

We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them.

These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nPromo items from this project will be available in the future from all the partners participating in this project, and from all the partners not participating. There is nothing in this project that is exclusive to pledging for this project. Each partner that makes Terraforming Mars will determine how they will distribute promos in their languages after the project ends.  \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the biggest and most strategic expansion for the best selling tile placement and card drafting game, Terraforming Mars.  The base game of Terraforming Mars is required to use this expansion. For more information about Terraforming Mars: Turmoil, we encourage you to read our draft rulebook here.\nIf you are not familiar with Terraforming Mars, we suggest that you watch this great video to learn the rules. You can also read the complete game rules here.\nPlease note that Terraforming Mars: Turmoil should be considered an EXPERT expansion. This expansion adds a distinct, new level of play as players vie for control of the Terraforming Council, as well as plan for the Global Events.  This expansion will appeal to those who want to play a more expansive game of Terraforming Mars.\nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the 49th project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 48 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil was designed by the talented Jacob Fryxelius, and developed by the Fryxelius brothers of FryxGames. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nTerraforming Mars: Turmoil is the fifth expansion that takes players back to Mars for the struggle to control and progress human society. \nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories. \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $34 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just four easy steps: \n Step 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \n Step 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \n Step 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing!\n Step 4: Shortly after the projects ends on May 5th, we will send you a link to our pledge manager. This is where we will get your shipping information and which language versions of the game you would like to receive.\nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family. Also, be sure to like Stronghold Games on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for real-time updates about this project and more!  \nStronghold Games is excited to offer retailer packages on the English Language editions of Turmoil for Brick and Mortar stores. Many of our partners are also offering retailer packages for their language editions as well.\nFor more information, please email us at: retailers@indieboardsandcards.com or contact your local language partner directly.\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping and sales taxes are very expensive and is a cost we all need to share. To offset this, while remaining fiscally responsible, we have included a discount on ALL shipping and taxes, but there is no free shipping. Shipping & Taxes charges will be added after Kickstarter ends, every backer will be responsible for paying these fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please see shipping & taxes chart below: \nFor the US, Canada, UK, EU, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and Korea we have included applicable taxes, your rewards will be sent Duty Free from within your region \u2013 there will not be any additional customs charge. Outside of the US, Canada, UK and the EU, we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a pledge nor will we pay those fees. In case a package is returned or destroyed due to non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled. \nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nMeeple BR Jogos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand. \n MARS ATTACKS: (Pledge $34 or more) One copy of Terraforming Mars: Turmoil including all of the milestones from this campaign.

That means you\u2019ll be able to manage your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want after the project closes, along with during the campaign. We will post an update to notify backers when the pledge manager email is being sent out. At that time, you\u2019ll need to manage your pledge and enter your shipping address and complete your order. You will be able to select the language for your games in the pledge manager.\nOur plan is to have Terraforming Mars: Turmoil available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out around the time of Essen, it may be the case that we have games at Essen before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \nTurmoil and all the milestones will be available in Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Stronghold Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 49th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games.

Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Terraforming Mars: Turmoil will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Stronghold Games, Indie Boards and Cards, & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nStronghold Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia and all other countries not listed below.\nMINDOK has full responsibility for rewards sent to the Czech Republic and Slovakia.\nMaldito has full responsibility for rewards sent to Spain, Mexico, and Latin America except Brazil.\nIntrafin has full responsibility for rewards sent to France, Belgium, The Netherlands and Swizterland.\nGhenos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Italy.\nBR Jugos has full responsibility for rewards sent to Portugal and Brazil.\nReflexshop has full responsibility for rewards sent to Hungary.\nFryxGames has full responsibility for rewards sent to the EU countries not listed above & Norway.\nKorea Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Korea.\nArclight has full responsibility for rewards sent to Japan.\nSiam Board Games has full responsibility for rewards sent to Thailand.\n\nART ASSETS\nSome of the cards shown have not been finalized.

Players control this party of heroes as they fight their way to one of the possible escape routes out of the city. During the night they face restless hordes of zombies, while during the day they recover, move, or search for useful items and survivors.    \n\nREPLAYABILITY: 9 characters for 465 possible parties, 3 difficulty levels, 2 campaigns with 8 overall finales, 6 scenarios and 8 finales playable as scenarios, 16 bosses = over 450 hours of gameplay! Stretch goals not counted...\n\n\n CHARACTERS GAMEPLAY\nDuring the day, at first they move together as a group through the sinking city towards the finales locations, then each one spends the remaining hours in preparation for the night: building barricades, recovering from wounds, searching for items and survivors, or using his unique day ability. During the night, they face hordes of Infected and Boss: they have few actions to perform and their unique ability to survive behind the refuge barricades in a fast and furious firefight. Only by close cooperation they could have a chance to stand until the sunlight, when the horde retreats! If they\u2019re attacked, they accumulate stress until becoming terrified! And if one gets too much stress.. that\u2019s game over! Be ready to face the most stressful game ever! \nBOSS GAMEPLAY\nThe Boss lead the horde of Infected during the night. Each one of them has powerful unique abilities that combine creating some very nasty situation to face. If you manage to kill them, you\u2019ll get powerful rewards, but you need to carefully cooperate with you team mates to survive!     \nCARDS GAMEPLAY\nNightmare cards are used in two ways: at the center of the card is portrayed a random event that will affect your day, while at the four corners there are boxes used for randomization. Item and weapons can be collected in two ways: by actively looking for them during the day or by killing a Boss. Items and weapons can be persistent bonuses or just one shot items, some will affect the day, while others will help you during the night. All of them can be sacrificed to save you from an attack.  Boss tarots are used to discover the dreadful enemies you\u2019ll face at night and to remind you of those you could not kill, because they will hunt you every night after.  \n SCENARIOS\nThe 2nd Edition includes awesome new scenarios that will allow you to face totally new challenges! Some of the features that you will find in the scenarios are tutorial scenario, shorter & harder games, traitor mechanics, scalability (variable number of characters, one character for each player), competitive game, more dexterity game and night-only scenarios! Finales also can be played as stand-alone scenarios! \nPILE OF CORPSES GAMEPLAY\nIn Carnival Zombie combat, you know exactly what you get when you pull the trigger: no dice is rolled. But when you shoot zombie, you cannot be totally sure that they will stay down.  \nSo you have to pick up the cubes you just eliminated with firepower and drop them upon the Pile of Corpses tile. Those falling will rise again, still charging at you: the more you shoot, the more difficult the drop!    \n TERRAINS: OBSTACLES AND FORTIFICATIONS GAMEPLAY\nYou have to choose wisely where to face the night: the presence of fortifications will help you keeping at bay the horde, but you have also to be careful of the terrain, because the infected will take advantage from it to draw near more easily: you have to adapt your strategy to the environment! \n\n SURVIVORS GAMEPLAY\nYou can find survivors while scavenging for items. They will follow you and help you  during the night: although they\u2019re not fighters, they can be precious allies in the times of need!\nThe DELUXE box will be available only during the KICKSTARTER campaign. It adds to the base box a double-sided game board and tons of new contents! \n\n MEDIOLANUM gameplay\nFight your way into Mediolanum! Avoid Founderings or the Leviathan will show himself to unleash the horde upon you! Battle difficult increases as you move closer to the center, but there it\u2019s easier to find the clues to descover the combintation needed to destroy the beast and run away from the city in 3 new unique finales with Leonardo Da Vinci\u2019s machinery fleeing the horde, the boss or the Leviathan itself!    \n \u00dcBER WEAPONS GAMEPLAY\n\u00dcber weapons have to be searched for during the day and recovered on the city map. Once you acquire them, they can be deployed during the night and used to unleash powerful abilities upon the incoming horde. Be sure to pull the trigger at the right time because Carnival Zombie is absolutely unforgiving.   \nWe have a lot of new content that we would like to make: we need your help! \nIf we reach 1,000 LIKES on our FACEBOOK page, every backer will get 6 new object cards! \nARTWORK pledge notes\nYou will get one of the original pencil drawings made by Jocularis for Carnival Zombie. There are just 24 of these and they\u2019re all different. Since they are unique, the first person to pledge will choose first, then the second person to pledge will choose next, and so on. \n\nTOURIST pledge notes\nScientific evidence shows that the Zombie Apocalypse is a reality: it could come from rage virus, neurotoxins, spontaneous neurogenesis, nanobots or creepy fungus parasite brainwashing you. Anyway, we know for sure that the most likely origin will be the  huge undead leviathan awakening beneath Venice or Milan. So what if Zombie Apocalypse hits just when you\u2019re in Venice or Milan? Wouldn\u2019t you like to have the best chances of survival? And wouldn\u2019t your chances be higher if you could face the Infected with those that foresaw such Apocalypse and portrayed it into a boardgame? If you plan to visit Venice or Milan anytime soon, be wise: insure your life by purchasing the Tourist Pledge! By pledging for Tourist, we will be with you in Venice or Milan at a specific date and you will have the best chances of survival just in case the Zombie Apocalypse hits that very day! We will guide you outside the city to safety, ensuring that no harm comes to you: by pledging for Tourist, you\u2019re pledging for you own life at a very discounted price! \nBy the way, if no Leviathan awakes freeing us from all \u201cfight for your life\u201d stuff, at least 2 of us will still meet up with you in Venice or Milan. \nWe will meet at around 09:00 AM and will hang out with you until as late as 17:00 PM. \nWe will visit some Carnival Zombie-related sites or some creepy unacknowledged locations: a Master graduate in History and a Master graduate in Art will show you things unknown to the most! \nYou will be our guest for lunch in a traditional tavern;\nIf you like the idea, we will playtest one of our games still under development with you (otherwise we could move on to our \u201ccreepy unacknowledged location\u201d tour);\nWe could also share with you our experiences here at ALBE PAVO and possibly give you some advice for your own projects, if you have any. \nYou will also have an exclusive original artwork made by Jocularis. \nCARNIVAL ZOMBIE was released by ALBE PAVO in 2013 and sold out in just 3 months.The 1st Edition received acclaim from reviewers and players alike. \nThe game is already completed as this campaign takes place.

In this expansion, Fall of the Spire, your characters will continue the adventure through a series of stories in their quest to rid the land of evil. Advanced combat, and Town Events will make even the return trip to civilization more perilous. In addition, the Creature Crate, a Kickstarter Bonus, allows you to store all the miniatures from this campaign and previous ones!\nOver 7,200 backers helped to make this game a reality. If you already own the core game, but are ready to delve deeper into the darkness, the \u201cSquire\u201d pledge level contains six full-length stories, and the \u201cExecutioner\u201d has both the expansion and the new miniatures along with a Kickstarter bonus full game storage solution!Delve deeper below for more details!\n To see every thing that comes in the Folklore: The Affliction, The Dark Tales, The Spire, and the Creature Crate take a look at our graphic here.\n You have traveled the dangerous byways of Kremel, and finally walk past the gates of the town at twilight. Once eager to see so many people bustling in the streets, you have grown jaded and keep an eye out for pickpockets. Beneath the buildings, stone and wood edifices, you notice the layers of dust and grime, and a deepening of the shadows...  \n A shopkeeper waves in recognition as you walk through the town, and looks to you in hopes of news from the outside world. But you have a darker destination in mind, and no time to spare. You nod back, and take to the rooftops, and later descend to the sewers, where you hope to find the missing piece that will take you to the one place that will doom or save this land...the Dark Spire.\n The Characters \nMeet the new characters in Fall of the Spire. Each brings new skills and abilities to the game.\nThe Warlord\nThe Huntress\n\nThe Viper Maiden\n\nThe Gentleman\n The Foes and Afflictions \nThe Woodmother is a KS Bonus mini.\nThe Lich is a Kickstarter Bonus\n A variety of evil waits for you at every turn. Foes can be found in skirmishes and encounters, while Afflictions, the puppet masters of Kremel, have grand designs on taking over this land.\n\n\n\n\n New Advanced Combat! \nOur advanced combat system adds a ton of awesome effects, choice and strategy to Folklore combat, such as the new Initiative Track as well as Initiative cards, Monster AI and Charge-Up powers! The Initiative cards give modifiers, bonus actions and special abilities or attacks to the characters and creatures who can take advantage of their position on the Initiative Track.  That\u2019s not all, each Initiative card scales to adjust the effect and gameplay specifically for 2 players games, 3-4 player games and 5 player games!\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nAt the start of a fight, characters and creatures will roll for Initiative then place their minis or markers on the track according to their result (which can change based on bonuses from items, powers, artifacts, etc). Then, two Initiative cards are drawn, one for the characters and one for the creatures and each card is randomly assigned a slot on the Track.  The Initiative cards give a potential bonus or combat effect to either the character or foe in the indicated location. A character may spend power points to move up or down on the Track to take advantage of these power slots and the creatures can do the same! \nThe entire advanced combat system is fully backwards compatible and can be used for ANY Folklore game such as the Core set or Dark Tales, not just the Fall of the Spire expansion!\nThat\u2019s not all...Beware the Charge-up powers and effects that creatures will gain when in the heat of battle.  For every successful hit an enemy scores, they gain a charge counter, triggering a special AI, move, effect or ability on that creature as soon as 3 charges are scored. \nThe Story\nUsing the narrative created by Twin Fire Games as your GM guide, follow the 6 new stories to see where each adventure takes you as you level up, gather supplies and move onward into certain danger! This next installation of stories added to your gaming library will allow you to journey further into the world of Folklore!\n The Events \n The event decks add to the experience and depth of gameplay with small moments and longer side quests that can be integrated into the story or used on their own as you travel the world. If you do survive the Road and Off Road Event cards, there are always Rumor cards to send you down side paths that entice you to greater danger, and now Town Events will make even the return trip to civilization more perilous.\nThe Maps\n The Maps: Stunning artwork by Henning Ludvigsen brings to life new encounters on rooftops and underground to use alongside the well travelled paths in Kremel for dungeon crawls and combat with unearthly monsters! \nFall of the Spire\nAll this and more awaits you in the Fall of the Spire expansion!

Now in the past I\u2019ve been really critical of games that try to be both an RPG and a board game, because normally I find they do neither of them very well; this is an amazing exception to that rule.\u201d  ~ Robert Geistlinger, The Dice Tower, The Blue Player \n\"This game is essentially an entire role playing game boiled down\u2026 easy to visualize and easy to play.

So much story, character development, choices, thought out missions, side quests during a specific mission... it pretty much kills every other ameritrashy campaign game I\u2019ve tried thus far. We had a total blast with it. \u201d ~Jamie, Secret Cabal\nIt fits in that dungeon crawler category... but it's much more than that... I love this game.

But this is a new day, and there are new gamers out there who we hope to invite into the fold. The point of Folklore is be an immersive gaming experience that is accessible to everyone! We have worked hard to make our gameplay fun and friendly for every gamer and we carry that through to our community and even our Kickstarter stretch goals. To help reach out to the community, here\u2019s what we have planned:\n\nIf we get 100 additional people signed up to our newsletter during the campaign, we will add 10 more Item cards in Fall of the Spire. UNLOCKED! \n If we get 4,250 followers on our Facebook page during the campaign, we will add 10 more Town Event cards in Fall of the Spire.  UNLOCKED! \nIf we get 3,050 followers on our Twitter page during the campaign, we will add 10 more Town Event cards in Fall of the Spire. UNLOCKED! \nIf we get 550 followers on our Instagram page during the campaign, we will add 10 more Town Event cards in Fall of the Spire.  UNLOCKED! \nIf the Folklore Community page reaches 2,400 members during the campaign, we will add 3 more Militia Companions in Fall of the Spire. UNLOCKED! \n If we get up to 50 comments on this BGG thread during the campaign, we will add 3 more Animal Companions to Fall of the Spire!   UNLOCKED! \n If we reach 925 likes on our Folklore: the Affliction BGG page during the campaign, we will add 15 Rumor Cards featuring special guests to the Creature Crate! UNLOCKED! \n With 14 successful Kickstarters under our belt, we have learned a lot about what it takes to get our games into your hands. One of the biggest things is how variable the cost of shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after this Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through the pledge manager system once this Kickstarter has concluded.  \nThere are two reasons we do this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate for shipping costs.

Presenting - The Red Dragon Inn Smorgasbox!\nBut first, let's also introduce the game to the folks who are new to the series...\nThe Red Dragon Inn is a game for 2 or more players where each player takes on the role of a heroic adventurer (or sometimes a dastardly villain) in a wild free-for-all party in a fantasy  tavern. Brawl, drink and gamble the night away to prove your mettle and be the last player standing at the end of an evening of bad decision making. Will you be able to outplay each of your opponents? Or will you wake up the next morning with a throbbing headache, a bit less gold in your pocket, and a horse awkwardly nudging you out of his stall?\nIf this is your first time joining us, we suggest you check out our introduction to The Red Dragon Inn series.\nThis campaign includes a Newcomer Edition, where you can get the Smorgasbox along with a copy of the original Red Dragon Inn game. The Newcomer Edition includes everything you need for a game of up to 5 players!\nWe're using the phrase \"a little something for everyone\" to describe this product, because it was designed from the ground up to be our response to a bunch of recent customer requests. Let's have a look at all the cool stuff that's in the box!\nWe start off, of course, with a new RDI character - our 47th, but who's counting? Roxana is the head chef at our beloved tavern. And she's called an \"adventurous chef\" for two reasons. First, she is no stranger to experimentation in the kitchen, preparing such ambitious dishes as Spatchcocked Cockatrice and Fire Salamander Flamb\u00e9.\nSecond, she knows how to hold her own in a tavern full of adventurers, where things can get rather dangerous at a moment's notice!\nWe like to think of Roxana as the fifth member of the Tavern Crew from RDI 7, but she's an excellent addition to the party even if you happen to have skipped the Tavern Crew set from last year. We'll have more information about Roxana in the updates, where we'll give details about how she actually plays.\nAnd as an added bonus, The Smorgasbox includes not just an RDI deck for Roxana, but also a Battle for Greyport deck!\nWe think Roxana is super fun to play in both games, and we think you'll agree!\nBack in 2010, we published a game called The Red Dragon Inn: Gambling? I'm In!, which answered the question \"what games are our heroes actually playing when they have a round of gambling?\" The Gambling, I'm In product included a 90-card deck we called the Rogues and Warriors Deck, plus a bunch of different games you could play with that deck and/or some d6's. Each of the games is a standalone gambling game suitable for a fantasy-themed dealer's choice \"poker\" night. In addition, most of the games include rules for playing within a game of RDI, replacing a normal gambling round with that game!\nGambling, I'm In was a successful product, but it's been out of print for a while now, and we've gotten some requests for a reprint. So, here it is! The Smorgasbox includes a brand new Rogues and Warriors Deck, beautifully redrawn by our staff artist Erin Wong.\nThe new rulebook will include all of the previous games, plus five brand new ones, including the winner of our Gambling, I'm In game design contest: Dragon Hunt by David DeLauder, plus honorable mentions Streets of Greyport by Todd Christopherson, and Rank and Class by Jay Anderson!\nNote: to play Gambling, I'm In games standalone, you'll need to provide some kind of betting tokens such as poker chips or cardboard coins from a certain tavern game. In addition, some of the games require d6's, which do not come in the Kickstarter Editions or the Newcomer Edition. (But some d6's DO come in the Collector's Editions - see below!)\nLast year we released our Munchkin crossover product, The Red Dragon Inn Allies: Spyke and Flower, and we made the product a little different from our other two-player sets. We released it as a two-player standalone RDI expansion, with a drink deck and everything two players needed to play. However, not everyone likes two-player RDI as much as we do, so we created Otto, the automated third player!\nOtto uses a ten-card deck and two separate Fortitude/Alcohol tracks. On his turn, he flips a card and causes something to happen to one or both of the other players. He also flips a card if it's his turn in a round of gambling, or if something would affect him. At the end of Otto's turn, he drinks from the drink deck. Otto can't lose the game, but if you make him \"pass out\" on the track closest to you, you get a small bonus - either 1 Gold from the Inn or 2 cards from your character deck.\nAt the beginning of the game, you build Otto's ten-card deck by choosing two of his five-card \"factions\" and shuffling them together. The original Otto included Warrior, Rogue, Cleric and Wizard factions. The Smorgasbox includes four new factions: Bard, Witchdoctor, Tinkerer and Paladin, so shuffle up some new Otto combos and have fun!\nTo learn more about how Otto works, check out our how-to-play video!\n(Note: The Smorgasbox contains everything you need to play Otto, even if you don't have Spyke and Flower. You'll just be playing with four different factions, and since a game with Otto only uses two factions anyway, it works fine!)\nWe're trying something a little different for this campaign. We're including fancy metal components from our friends at Campaign Coins in every Kickstarter pledge level, not just the fancy high-end pledge levels. The metal components this time around will be skeletal finger tokens for use with The Lich King, released in late 2017 in our product Red Dragon Inn: Allies - Adonis vs. The Lich King.\nCampaign Coins is already working on a prototype, and we hope to have images to show you before the end of this campaign.\nIncluding these components in every Kickstarter edition is our way of saying thanks to our dedicated fans who keep enthusiastically playing our game!\nThis may make us sound like salespeople on the Home Shopping Network, but here goes. Ahem...\nBut wait! There's MORE!\nThe Smorgasbox also includes a whole bunch of new promo cards, including several new ones and a few reprints of hard-to-get ones. The Kickstarter Edition (and the retail edition) will include 5 promo drinks and 2 prize cards. The Collector's Edition will include those 7 cards, plus 6 more promo drinks and 1 more prize card.\n(Kickstarter Edition reprints: Pretentious Wine, Timewarp Tonic. Collector's Edition reprints: Eve's Mystery Mead, Golden Stout, Whitehawk's Special Reserve, Prognosticating Punch, Hair of the Dwarf, Monster Attack - \"roll a d6\" version.)\nAdventurers Wanted, one of the new Prize Cards, will be in every edition of The Smorgasbox!\nAnd if that still isn't enough, the Collector's Edition also includes 30 custom d6's! Several of the games in Gambling? I'm In! require dice. Normally, players are required to provide their own, but if you get the Collector's Edition, you won't need to worry about that particular component, since you'll get 5 d6's in each of 6 different colors, with different designs drawn by artist Megan Langan.\nA common complaint we've heard over the past year or so is that our card-sleeving uberfans are now out of room in their Character Trove. This presented a bit of a dilemma for us, since a product that only came in a new storage box might be perceived as overkill for our non-sleeving fans.\nKickstarter to the rescue!\nAs you may have already seen in the pledge levels, we're offering five different versions of this product:\nSo there's a perfect product for you here, regardless of what kind of an RDI fan you are, and regardless of whether or not you've gone \"all in\" on the franchise.\nDisclaimer: there will not be any Eco or Collector's Editions sold in stores. The retail version of this game will be the same as the Kickstarter Edition (in the Battle-for-Greyport-sized box), but without the metal Lich King tokens.\nSome details on shipping:\n Backers from the US and Canada: Shipping will be US and Canada \"friendly\" and will ship from within your country. If you would like additional copies of the game added to your reward, simply over-pledge the base amount for the additional game(s) you wish to add. You can add any number of additional copies to your rewards and you need only pay shipping once.\n International Backers: Where possible, we will try to use regional shipping options. However, customs-free \"friendly\" shipping is not available for backers outside the US and Canada. Backers are responsible for any tariffs or customs fees incurred by their shipment.\nFurthermore, we want to make it absolutely clear that there will be no pledge manager for this campaign. Backers will not have the opportunity to upgrade their pledge level after the end of the campaign and should pledge for what they want during the funding period. Backers will receive a survey via Kickstarter to provide their shipping information a few weeks before we begin the fulfillment process. It is the backer's responsibility to fill out this Kickstarter survey in a timely fashion if they want to receive their rewards by our predicted delivery date.\nFinally, if you would like to review the SlugFest Games Kickstarter Policy, you can find it on our website here. \nAs with most of our campaigns, we are not using a post-campaign pledge manager, and we are not offering add-ons. However, if you want to pick up another RDI game to go with the cool stuff in this product, you can head to our web store, where you can pick up any of our products without having to wait for your Smorgasbox to ship! During the campaign, we are offering free US shipping on all of our games.\nWe've done substantial playtesting on all of the stuff in this product, but if you'd like to try Roxana or have a look at some of our upcoming semi-sorta-secret stuff, then you should join the SlugFest Games Digital Play Test Community today! All you need to participate is a microphone for chat over Discord and Tabletop Simulator. We host daily sessions and would love to see you come by and give our stuff a test drive.\nThanks for reading this far! We'd love to have you follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and/or our mailing list.\nIn addition, there is a post now up on our Facebook page announcing the launch of this campaign (THIS ONE), and if you comment on that post, you could win a prize!\nHere's how it works: reply to our post announcing this campaign on Facebook with the following: \"I'm [YourFavoriteRDICharacter], and I'm excited about The Red Dragon Inn Smorgasbox!\" Of course, replace [YourFavoriteRDICharacter] with your actual favorite RDI character! On the last day of the campaign, we will select one commenter at random to receive a Collector's Edition of the Smorgasbox!\n\n\n\n(Munchkin, the Munchkin characters, and the pyramid logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Steve Jackson Games Incorporated, used under license by SlugFest Games.

However, here's a list of things you should know that could possibly go wrong:\n\n1. Development Delay: Development on this project is done! The only delay that could come here is if we notice something bad that we didn't see before.\n\n2. Manufacturing Delay: We have worked with our manufacturer for a very long time now. We have a great relationship with them and they work hard to get us our stuff on schedule. However, as always, unforeseen problems can arise.\n\n3. Shipping Delay: Sometimes your stuff just goes missing and we have to print everything all over again. True story: an entire shipping container of our games was stolen back in July of 2012. Seriously.\n\n4. Extraterrestrials could invade and enslave us to their will, and they may not be tabletop gamers.\n\nThe good news is that this is not our first rodeo by a LONG shot. We have launched and delivered on multiple campaigns much to the satisfaction of our backers. We have padded our promised delivery date with all of the realistic delays in mind so you can confidently expect your game to arrive by our suggested delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Eco-Kickstarter Edition", "descp": "Get the KS edition of this expansion with minimal packaging.

It all fits back into the box! \nTiny Epic Tactics achieves endless layers of strategy and fun through utilizing a simple combat system with variable player powers and 3D terrain! \nNesting inside the game box are 5 smaller boxes and a map/scroll. Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across. \nConquer your opponents in tactical combat where every calculated move matters... or journey across the land and through the caves in a grand cooperative/solo adventure! \nIn competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes and different types of heroes have different ways of attacking.\nVictory points are awarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play.\nGaining control of these areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered. \nTiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes).\nThe goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many heroes you kept alive. \nYour team will consist of 4 heroes, regardless of mode you are playing. You will have one Fighter, one Wizard, one Rogue and one Beast! Each type offer different strengths and abilities.\nFighters are strong and versatile. With lots of hit points and a strong melee attack, they are a great unit to lead the battle. While their missile range is short, it proves useful when moving into position. Their special powers reinforce their ability to stand their ground or to unleash high damage in short range combat scenarios. \nWizards are powerful and resourceful. Their high damage output at long ranges can make them among the most lethal opponents on the field. However, their low hit points make them a target. If one gets caught without an escape plan, they won't be around much longer. Their special powers range from support to multiple-target attacks.\nRogues are swift and cunning. They offer good mobility combined with long range missile attacks. This makes them particularly useful in softening enemy units while bouncing from one control area to another. Their special powers range from weakening enemy units to reinforcing their pesky maneuvers.\nBeasts are relentless and reliable. They have good movement, high hit points and strong melee damage. This combination makes them an army of one. You'll be tempted to send them to one control area and the rest of your team to another. However, they lack any sort of ranged attack and their special powers typically benefit nearby teammates. So you'll want to weigh your options tactically. \nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Lanterns Mini Expansion\nThe Lanterns mini expansion adds a 'pick up and deliver' like mechanism to Tiny Epic Tactics furthering the options and replayability of the game. During the game's setup, each village is given an unlit lantern (backside of token). When a player sends one of their heroes through a portal (cave) they come out with a torch. A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game. \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \nThe Maps Expansion is a set of box covers and scrolls. It includes everything needed to convert the 6 Evergreen Woodlands boxes into 2 different settings: the Winter Highlands and the Savage Wastelands. \nThe Maps Expansion is usable with ALL play modes. These are NOT just aesthetic changes! These change the gameplay drastically. Each map takes a different approach to where control areas are placed, how much space is between the control areas and what terrain surrounds them. This requires a different strategy on how to approach and defend the control areas resulting in a very different experience!\nNote: dungeon interiors will remain the same.\nCheck out the images and video below for a closer look at these alternative settings. \nMaps Expansion Includes:\n1 Winter Highlands Map Scroll\n 6 Winter Highlands Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Savage Wasteland Map Scroll\n 6 Savage Wasteland Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Reinforced Envelope\nThe box covers are constructed of thick premium cardstock and can be flattened after use for easy storage.\nManually add $12 to your pledge, or select the specific reward tier, if you'd like the Maps Expansion to ship with your copy of Tiny Epic Tactics.\nCheck out the video below for a rotating view of all 3 maps.\nPLAY\n\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! \nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

If you would like the signature, please add $25 to your pledge.\n\nA note about shipping: We work with numerous partners to ship our games all over the world in an effort to provide affordable shipping and avoid V.A.T. fees. However, because we ship Kickstarter pledges out along with retail versions of the game, in some rare cases the game may end up in local stores, or at conventions, before it arrives to you. While this isn't preferable, it does happen. Usually, the difference in time between deliveries isn't vast, and we hope the Kickstarter exclusive extras make up for any frustration in waiting. \nA note about ADD-ONS shipping: We estimate that each add-on purchased outside of a bundle will cost about an addition $5 in shipping for EU, USA, and Ca. Aus, Asia, and RotW should expect around $8.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIDW Games has successfully Kickstarted 8 campaigns and has already fulfilled 7 of those campaigns. Our only outstanding campaign is Nickelodeon Splat Attack, which is on track to deliver in February.\n\nIDW Games, a division of IDW Publishing, has been publishing games into retail via standard distribution channels for over 5 years.\n\nAll of our games are manufactured in China, and as such there are a few issues that could potentially slow the delivery of our campaign. The most common issues are production delays due to plastic quality, shipping delays due to vessel schedules and weather, and customs clearance when the goods come into America. There is always the potential that one of these things could cause a delay in the delivery of pledges of this campaign to backers. When these types of delays do affect campaigns, we're quick to update backers with the current situation.\n\nFinally, while it's unfortunate, it isn't uncommon for first printing of games, whether they're Kickstarted or not, to have small typos and print errors. While we work hard to avoid those, there's always a chance they may come up. In the past, we've reprinted and replaced cards with errors at our cost, but we may not always be able to provide that service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 125 or more", "title": "Change is Constant Bundle", "descp": "Get the Change is Constant bundle, which includes TMNT Adventures: Change is Constant, The Stan Sakai Character Box, and the Loner Raph Alt Sculpt and 3 additional Raph hero dice.

Its co-founders are Will Hindmarch and Jeff Tidball. This is their seventh Gameplaywright release. \nFeaturing interior figures by Keith Curtis, editing by Renee Knipe and Colleen Riley, cover design by Will Hindmarch, and interior layout by Alex Mayo and Jeff Tidball.\nWe think every store in the world that sells board games can sell Meeples Together.\nWe\u2019re positive that we won\u2019t reach every gamer, aficionado, critic, and game designer in the world in the 30 short days this Kickstarter runs. For the 20 years after that, we hope game stores will continue to sell Meeples Together to people who love cooperative games.  If you have a store, our \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier is for you.\nThis campaign is retail-friendly because:\n* The price is the price. What it costs to back the campaign is also the MSRP we\u2019ll put on the back.\n* Your customers get everything. We\u2019ll give you access to the digital edition so you can pass it along to your customers who buy physical copies of Meeples Together from you.\n* We won\u2019t tie up your capital. You'll choose your quantity and pay the balance \u2014 with your pledge counted as a credit \u2014 the month before we ship. You\u2019ll even be able to add other Gameplaywright titles like Friendly Local Game Store and The White Box.\n* You\u2019ll get the discount you expect. Your discount is 50%, with shipping pegged closely to our actual cost.\n* You\u2019ll get it before your competitors. We'll ship to retail backers at least four weeks before we ship to general distribution.\n* You\u2019ll have long-term access. Through Gameplaywright\u2019s distribution partnership with Atlas Games, physical editions of Meeples Together will be available through distribution, so you can make it available for years to come.\nRetail backers must be established, brick-and-mortar, retail game stores. \nThe Gameplaywright titles offered in our \u201cPlus,\u201d \u201cDesigner,\u201d and \"Everything\" tiers are described briefly below. Also described are titles that will be available as add-on purchases via BackerKit, after the campaign ends.\nThe White Box is a game design workshop in a box, a 208-page book of 25 essays about how to design and publish tabletop games, and a kit of more than 400 generic components \u2014 cubes, meeples, dice, chips, punchboard \u2014 to get you started right away. ($29.95 as an add-on)\nThe White Box Essays is the book from The White Box. It's not available on its own as a physical edition, but its digital editions are part of the Digital Designer pledge level. ($7.95 as an add-on)\nThings We Think About Games collects bite-sized thoughts about games. It spans the breadth of games and the depths of gaming, offering insights about collecting, playing, critiquing, designing, and publishing. ($19.95 as an add-on)\nThe Bones: Us and Our Dice gathers writing about fandom and family \u2014 about gamers, camaraderie, and memories \u2014 and ties them together where they meet: our dice. Contributors include Wil Wheaton, Keith Baker, John Kovalic, Ken Hite, and Chuck Wendig. ($18.95 as an add-on)\nFriendly Local Game Store is a book about how to earn a middle-class income opening your own game store and creating a community for gamers. It\u2019s written by Gary L. Ray, author of Quest for Fun, the go-to blog for all things FLGS. ($24.95 add-on)\nHamlet\u2019s Hit Points presents the beat system, a toolkit for storytelling in RPGs \u2014 and any other form \u2014 by classifying story beats and letting you track their ups and down from hope to fear and back. Includes full-length analyses of Hamlet, Dr. No, and Casablanca. ($19.95 add-on)\nBeating the Story expands the story beat system by defining different types of beat-to-beat transitions, and providing practical guidance on topics like conceiving your story, creating its hero, mapping its beats, writing drafts, revising, and even editing the work of others. Includes extended analyses of Maupassant\u2019s \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d the Mad Men episode \u201cHave a Seat, Shut the Door,\u201d the X-Files episode \u201cHome,\u201d and a scene from The Color Purple. ($19.95 add-on)\nShipping charges for all \"Print\" tiers and the \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier will be collected after the Kickstarter concludes using BackerKit, a post-campaign pledge manager. \nThis is likely to help us to generally reduce the costs of shipping by allowing us to add more international fulfillment hubs based on demand. It also keeps your money in your pocket longer.\nWe\u2019ve estimated the following shipping costs by region and tier.\nUnited States (including Puerto Rico) Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $3-4\nPrint Plus: $6-7\nPrint Designer: $12-15\nEverything in Print: $12-15\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nCanada Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $10-12\nPrint Plus: $12-15\nPrint Designer: $15-20\nEverything in Print: $15-20\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEurope Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAustralia and New Zealand Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEverywhere Else Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $20-30\nPrint Plus: $30-40\nPrint Designer: $35-50\nEverything in Print: $40-60\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAs you can see, shipping physical objects around the world is expensive. We don\u2019t like it any more than you do.\nWe won\u2019t profit from the shipping costs for the various tiers of this campaign. Rather, we\u2019ll wind up modestly subsidizing shipping to most destinations. After re-shipping lost and stolen packages, we\u2019ll spend a little bit more. This is what we expect, and it\u2019s fine with us.\nPlease expect that shipping charges will increase if you respond to the pledge manager after shipping has begun. Make sure your inbox is set to receive backer updates, and look for them after the campaign ends.\nTo avoid shipping charges, consider the digital tiers. You can also wait until Meeples Together\u2019s public release, anticipated for April, 2019. If you buy the book in a store, you won\u2019t pay shipping charges. Other online merchants\u2019 shipping prices vary; you\u2019ll know better than we will what you might expect to pay in the future.\nThere isn\u2019t another scheduled opportunity to get digital editions free with printed editions. This isn\u2019t an option we routinely offer at Gameplaywright via any of our distribution channels, including direct sales. So if you want digital and physical editions together for one price, now\u2019s your chance.\nFor customs purposes, assume the worst case scenario that your rewards will ship from the United States. We are not willing to fraudulently claim that campaign rewards are gifts in order to help avoid duties. If the campaign does well, the possibility exists for fulfillment from within Canada, the European Union, and Australia. That said: It\u2019s a possibility, not a guarantee. If backing at physical levels is contingent on fulfillment from within your local region, we recommend backing at a digital tier now to get access to the post-campaign pledge manager, when you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your pledge if you wish.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is already done and through its first round of editing.

I'm Alex and I run this fine establishment. Please, take a look around and let me know if I can help you find anything. What's that? A Spellbook of Necromancy? Um.. Aisle 5 next to the cookbooks. If you get to the owlbear you've gone too far. He's tame, but don't look him in the eye. Tends to challenge customers to the death and all that. \nOh! Before you wander off, please gaze upon our newest product - The Tome of Holding!  What's it do?  Well, it's an ordinary book, as you can plainly see. But behold - wonders abound inside! Room enough to hold all of your weaponry, gold pieces, and anything else you may desire!  If the cover is not to your liking, my hedge wizard can fix that up for you...\nAll of the manufacturing happens in my basement woodshop where I maniacally whip two carving demons (CNC routers) to do my bidding.  They were designed and built a few years ago for the RPG Coasters campaign.  Regular maintenance has kept them humming along producing parts going on 3 years. \nAside from the tools controlled by computers, I employ a number of hand tools to ensure that each piece is finished to the best quality. \nThere are three coats of finish on the Tomes. A base thin poly for moisture protection, an oil blend that helps the detail in the artwork pop, then a light sanding and a final clear lacquer spray so it feels good to the touch.\nThe only part that will limit shipping, besides my throughput, is the artwork. Tomes with no artwork will be the first to ship out (Tier 1) as I can work on these and build up stock during the campaign. From there I'll go down the backer list numerically and build everyone's Tome who has artwork ready. \nI plan to beat the delivery date of next summer in most cases and to give regular updates as to the status of things. \nI ship everything via the USPS. Most of the continental states receive shipments in two days but if you're on the outskirts, it will be three.\n For other countries, it can take up to two weeks for delivery.  \nWHO'S DOING ALL THIS?\nArtwork - Dan Warren\nIf you have been playing video games, reading comic books, or been on Kickstarter for a while you will have most likely seen Dan's work before. His latest campaign, Steve Lichman Vol II, kind of went crazy. He and I have been working together for quite a few years now and have a great working relationship; primarily, trying to filter my ideas through his pen and come out with something awesome. \nEverything Else - Alex Ingram\nI've been working in engineering and design positions for about 15 years now and use my woodshop in my spare time to chase the American dream.  \nIdeally one day I will be able to put an addition on the house and expand the woodshop into its own wing of Ingram Manor and out of my basement.\nIf you want to know anything else, just ask and I'll give it a good FAQing. \nReviews", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks of this project are minimal.

My wife needs to be on the clock so to speak during the day and I can work on my \"day job\" more during the evenings.  So that means I end up having to tackle the child more during the day and do the day job more in the evenings when I'd usually be doing a lot of shop work.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Fighters and Clerics meanwhile both love heavy armor! You'll need to draft carefully to be sure that you have just the right items for the hero that enters your shop! \nSell equipment to your hero so that they'll be ready to battle with the current monster! If your hero is successful, you earn STARS, which are worth points at the end of the game! You can think of them like positive Yelp ratings.\n\nBut in every round that the heroes fail to defeat the monster it attacks the town, stealing your money or damaging your store! Each of the game's 12 different monsters have unique abilities!  \nOver time you\u2019ll encounter new heroes and monsters, all while upgrading your shop and hiring employees with unique abilities. Once three monsters have been defeated, the town is saved and the shop with the most money and prestige wins the game! \nHopefully that\u2019ll be you. \n If you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here or by clicking the link above! You can also watch Shut Up and Sit Down's review which gives a lovely overview of the game!\nYou can also watch the stream we did with Penny Arcade where we play a full game ofBargain Questusing the Advanced 2-player variant! (The video is quite long but that's mostly because we were goofing around. An average game takes between 30-60 minutes.) \n Here's an awesome video overview by LonelyManBGs \nThe Black Market Expansion brings Bargain Quest to the seedy criminal underworld. With new heroes like the Shaman, and the Bravo, along with cunning employees like the Loan Shark and the Henchman. It's a dangerous town, and you'll have to use all of your cunning and wits if you mean to make a profit out here! \nMost importantly however, this expansion introduces a new Upgrade to Bargain Quest: TheBlack Market Upgrade\nThis Upgrade functions similarly like the Display and Storage Upgrades in the original game, however the cost to gain this upgrade is not coins, but *stars* which means you'll need to spend your hard earned reputation before you'll be able to make the connections you'll need to access the Black Market Deck!\nDuring the Supply Step, a player with the Black Market Upgrade gains cards from the Black Market Deck, which contains a variety of strange and powerful artifacts! \nThe Black Market can be a bit unpredictable. Its items range from the incredibly powerful, to the expensive, but useless, to the outright weird. You'll want to keep the best equipment you find for yourself, and leave your opponents with less favorable options. Play your cards right and you'll be the next Capitalist Kingpin.\nWe'll reveal more of the Black Market's secrets in future updates so stay tuned!\nFor this project we have decided not to include any Stretch Goals. We've very carefully designed and tested exactly the product that we'd like to produce and we feel it would be an unnecessary risk to artificially lock these features behind arbitrary funding goals.\nThat being said, we do have a number of bonus packs that we've made with the help of some incredibly cool friends and collaborators.\nWe'll be doing timed reveals for these packs as the campaign progresses, \n \nThe first pack: The Table Titans Pack has been revealed as of Campaign Funding! Featuring characters from the hit webcomic series. \n \nThe second pack has now been revealed as the 8-Bit Theater Pack! Featuring the iconic heroes and items from the classic webcomic by Brian Clevinger!\nFinally in our final week, the third pack: Acquisitions Incorporated has been revealed! Featuring characters, and items from Penny Arcade's amazing world. \n\nThese packs are not stretch goals as they are guaranteed to be available once the campaign is funded. However we'd like to reveal them over time so that they can each get the attention they deserve as we've worked very hard to make each pack unique and exciting.\nThese packs are available at the Deluxe and Just the New Stuff pledge tiers and will also be available individually as addons. Each pack contains 12 brand new cards featuring new heroes, items, and employees! \n  \nThe Golem is a unique promo hero that's a FREE bonus to all backers!

In February 2017, over a thousand backers brought this adventure game to life. Later, after the backers received their copies and the game released to retail venues, it sold out of our warehouses within 9 days. This new campaign provided us with the opportunity to fund the game's second printing... and a whole lot more!  \n      Dungeon Alliance is a deck-building, dungeon-crawling miniatures adventure game that allows players to send 1 - 4 different teams of adventurers into perilous dungeons in search of experience and treasure. There are options for competitive, cooperative, and solo play!\nAt the start of the game, each player drafts his or her own team of four heroes and uses tactical movement and cardplay to overcome the dungeon's monsters and acquire treasures. Rival teams may compete with one another to slay monsters, or even battle one another for complete domination.\n\"Dungeon Alliance\" Base Game\nDungeon Alliance may be played with or without player-vs-player combat at the players' discretion.\n    Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n    Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n    To unlock the official Dungeon Alliance Companion App, please help us unlock the Digital Stretch Goals below by sharing our Kickstarter campaign on Social Media:\n1200 Total Likes on the Quixotic Games Facebook Page\n100 Total Shares of our latest Dungeon Alliance Facebook Post (Achieved)\n1000 Total Followers on our Quixotic Games Twitter Account\n100 Total Retweets of our latest Dungeon Alliance Tweet (Achieved)\n  Unlocked!\n  Unlocked!\n  Locked!\n    The Dungeon Alliance: Champions expansion was introduced during the first Dungeon Alliance Kickstarter, but the retail version has not been released until now.\nThis expansion adds four new heroes complete with their hero cards, starting deck cards, and miniatures. The expansion also includes 8 new upgrade cards, as well as the Deck of Many Treasures that allows you to \"dig deeper\" into Treasure Chests for greater rewards.\nThe Deep Dungeon Final Enemy Room allows adventurers to venture into the dungeon's lowest depths to face their most powerful adversaries, and players can even confront the majestic Titan for the ultimate confrontation!\n\"Dungeon Alliance: Champions\" Expansion\n    Our new Adventure Packs now allow players to experience story-based adventures during their campaigns!\nEach Adventure Pack includes approximately 40 - 60 cards, 1 - 3 punchboard sheets , and 1 rules booklet. Each Adventure Pack adds a new narrative story arc to the game, and each alliance can choose the ways in which it wishes to engage each particular story arc.\nThese packs are a non-linear way to add story content over the course of an entire campaign (solo, cooperative, or competitive) and should keep the game challenging as the heroes spend Campaign Points between adventures.\nCheck out the video below for an in-depth look at the new Adventure Packs:\nThe Adventure Packs will not be available for regular retail sale, and besides the Kickstarter, they will only be available at conventions and as promo packs sold online on our website or at the BGG store. The Adventure Packs will normally cost $15 each online, and they will not be available for purchase until 6 months after the backers receive their copies. As the KS campaign reaches stretch goals, more Adventure Packs will be added to backers at no additional cost.\nAdventure Pack I: The Lost Alliance\nSomething terrible has befallen the alliance of Tay the Summoner, Mitra the Trickster, Vrakh the Hunter, and Shoktor the Transmuter. They entered the Slayer's Dungeon weeks ago, and have not been heard from since. Your party now dares to enter the same dungeon. Will your team aid the Lost Alliance, or will you seal their fate once and for all?\nAdventure Pack II: War in the Deep\nFor centuries, the Subterranean Realms have supported an uneasy truce among the Empire of the Dark Elves, the Dominion of the Trolls, and the Kingdom of the Dwarves. Now some mysterious force has destroyed that truce, and open war has spilled into the lands above and below. Will your alliance discover a way to end the War in the Deep, or will you exploit the conflict to further your own ends?\nAdventure Pack III: The Gilded Prison\nMryth the Gold Dragon awoke from a dream where he had reformed all the wicked creatures in the universe, thereby abolishing evil for all time. Determined to see his dream come true, Mryth constructed a majestic fortress where he trapped thousands of monsters with the hope of rehabilitating them. But sometimes dreams turn into nightmares. When the dragon's Gilded Prison is breached, will your alliance help him restore order, or will you add to the chaos?\nAdventure Pack IV: The Titan Awakens\nThe Titan has presented a threat to adventurers in the King's land for centuries. But he was not always a godlike being. Travel through the Void to an ancient time to witness the rise of this mighty entity. Will you be able to discover the hidden secrets of your world when you behold the age when The Titan Awakens?\n    Complete Set of Painted Miniatures\nThis set includes the 21 painted miniatures that were available during the first Kickstarter Campaign. The set includes painted versions of all characters in the Dungeon Alliance base game and the Dungeon Alliance: Champions expansion.\n  You may add double-sided rubber playmats to your pledge that include a printed version of the dungeon frame for each configuration of players (Solo, 2, 3, or 4 players). \nPlayers may purchase the playmats separately (1 & 2 Player / 3 & 4 Player) or together as a set.\nDungeon Frame Playmat (Solo)\n  Dungeon Frame Playmat (3 Players)\n        In addition to the packages shown above, you can add the following items to your pledge.

The games will ship from our warehouses in the U.S. and Germany in order to avoid customs charges for our customers in the European Union. We will be shipping to our customers in Canada using USPS, as this helped our backers avoid brokerage fees during the first campaign.\nShipping Rates: $25 - $180 Pledge Levels\nWe are absorbing a significant portion of the shipping costs for our games, but due to the high costs of international taxes and shipping, we must charge some shipping fees outside of the U.S. for these packages. For each country listed below, the rate of shipping reflects the weight of the package. In general, packages that include the \"Dungeon Alliance\" base game will require the higher shipping rate.\nUnited States: Free Shipping\nGermany: $5 - $10\nAustria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, Slovenia, Switzerland, United Kingdom: $10- $15\nHungary, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden: $20- $25\nRest of the World: $30 - $40\nShipping Rates: $250 - $540 Pledge Levels\nOur Masters of the Dungeon ($250) package is for verified brick and mortar retail stores.\nUnited States: Free Shipping\nCanada / European Union: $30\nRest of the World: $60\nOur Monstrous Horde ($540) package ships anywhere in the world, and incurs no additional shipping charges.\nIntro Video Credits\nFilmed and Edited by Inside the Box\n  youtube.com/c/wedelvedeeply\nMusic:\nHero Theme by MK2\nExciting Trailer by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100494\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/\nArt Credits\nGraphic Design: Chechu Nieto\nLead Artists: Radial Studio, Biagio D'Alessandro\nArtists: William E.

Printing games involves acquiring quotations in advance for production, sculpting, tooling, and shipping, which we have already acquired. \n\nThere may be unforeseen issues that arise during the printing and shipping process, whether through production errors or shipping delays. We have 12 years of experience working with printers and resolving these sorts of issues, so we are fully prepared to face such difficulties if they arise.\n\nFor board games, a publisher on Kickstarter must also carefully calculate the shipping costs from the warehouse to the individual customers, or else they will face the possibility that they have not raised enough money to cover these expenses. We have made these calculations for shipping to our customers throughout the world.\n\nIn addition, in order for the game to be \"EU friendly,\" we will be shipping copies to our customers in the European Union from our printer's headquarters in Germany.

In other words, it's not spaceships, light sabres or Blade Runner style cityscapes.\nWhat's the money for?\nBullet holes. Next.\nWhat? Oh ok...\nFor this film, one of our main costs will be prosthetic make up. A couple of our characters get body wounds from bullets. Whoever does our makeup needs a few quid to buy supplies to make them look realistic.\nYou Have Been Chosen\nThis was the first in our Silent Eye series. The film starred Zoe Cunningham as Fiona, an indecisive office worker who downloads an app to make all her life decisions for her (on condition she agrees to follow every instruction).\nThe film was shot in February and March 2018, with a budget of \u00a30, and premiered at the Mobile Motion Film Festival in June.\nUnique Reward\nFor this campaign, I'm giving away my shooting copy of the You Have Been Chosen screenplay, complete with scribbled notes )and even a bit of fake blood from on set).

Or play as the Police - armed with a battalion of equipment and vehicles, and the city itself - working to catch the Driver before she escapes.\nCompletely asymmetric - each side plays completely different, with different abilities and victory conditions\nA unique experience each game - the city will look completely different every time you play\nSetup in 3 minutes - build the city as you play\nUse natural obstacles - the game respects the physical boundaries of your play space - the edge of the table is a cliff, the drinking glass is a lake - use these to your advantage\nEasy to learn - check out the rules or watch a brief how-to-play overview\nFantastic new art - from acclaimed illustrator, Ryan Goldsberry, set in the Burgle Brothers' universe\nPull crazy stunts - swing a handbrake turn, drive on 2 wheels, slam on the gas, or fly over an improvised ramp - all to get away from the police\nUnleash the (police) force - set up barricades, dispatch squad cars, police motorcycles, armored cars, or the unstoppable police helicopter - to ensure the driver doesn't get away\nStrategic Gameplay - Whether playing as the Driver or the Police, you'll need more than your tricks and equipment to win - you'll need to outwit and outmaneuver your opponent at every turn\nGetaway Driver is for 2 players aged 12 and up and takes 30-45 minutes to play\nThere's a lot of game, but it's all designed to fit in a portable 4\" x 6\" game box.\n                                                          See below for Rahdo's full review.\n                             Click here for Geek Dad's full preview\nClick here for Ant Lab's full playthrough and preview\nClick here for Undead Viking's full preview\n  Click here for Meeple Mountain's full preview\nClick here for Edo's full preview\n  Click here for Eric's full preview\nGetaway Driver is a tense and strategic game. Each turn, the Police secretly build out the city and move their vehicles, working to corner the Driver and steer them towards the areas of the city that expand the police force. The Driver burns through their stunt cards, picking up stashes along the way. If the last city tile is placed, the Driver escapes out of town. However, if the police increase the pursuit meter to its final space, the Driver is caught.\nFor a quick rundown of the rules, check out the video below.\nFor a deeper dive, take a look at the game rules.\nEach card and tile will feature brand new art from Ryan Goldsberry, helping immerse you into a world of crazy car stunts and overpowered police vehicles.\nJeff Beck is the designer of Hardback and Word Domination, and also contributed to the 3rd Edition of Wok Star. Jeff received his first moving violation at the age of 16. He's pretty sure the car was not moving.\nRyan Goldsberry is the artist behind games like Paperback, Word Domination, Hardback, Burgle Bros, Fugitive, Now Boarding and others. On his first date with his wife, Ryan ran a red light and had a head-on collision. Amazingly, she still married him.\nHelp guide the development of this game.

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nEscape the Dark Castle is a simple, fantasy adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.      \nPlayers take the roles of prisoners on a quest to Escape the Dark Castle, and must work together to overcome its many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card. \nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete challenges. \nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nAfter our first campaign in 2017, we released Escape the Dark Castle along with the first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight. Now we're back with a selection of new expansions and add-ons to further expand and deepen your adventures. \nThis game has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within 5 minutes. Click here for a quick overview, and you can read the full rules here. You can also watch one of the many gameplay videos in our Reviews section below. \n READ:\n                                              WATCH:\nBeasts of War (full playthrough)\nPaul Darcy (6 short play episodes)\nFor Chits & Giggles (full play & review)\nUnfiltered Gamer (review)\nUser Gameplay (contains strong language)\n   Beyond Solitaire (how to play solo)\nBestplay (review)\n         LISTEN: \n     So far, the Escape the Dark Castle range includes the following (and both are available as add-ons when you back this campaign):\nEscape the Dark Castle\nAdventure Pack 1 - Cult of the Death Knight\nThis Kickstarter campaign is for three new expansions: \nAdventure Pack 2 - Scourge of the Undead Queen\nAdventure Pack 3 - Blight of the Plague Lord\nThe Collector's Box\nGorging on the castle\u2019s unending supply of tortured souls, the Undead Queen calls to her service the corpses, skeletons, and spirits of the depths. If a prisoner should fall at the hands of her inexhaustible armies, all that awaits is an eternity of agonising undeath\u2026\nContains:  \n1 New Boss: The Undead Queen, a foul necromancer bent on enslaving your soul\n15 New Chapters: The Undead Queen\u2019s terrifying forces, and new castle locations \n3 Companion Characters: Vital allies to accompany the prisoners and assist in their escape \n3 Companion Trigger Cards: Event cards which signify the arrival of a Companion\n3 Companion Dice: Used to carry out Companion actions and special abilities\n2 New Items: Each a powerful relic for the prisoners to discover \n1 New Item Dice: Used to apply the powers of a relic\nNew Mechanic\nThis Adventure Pack introduces a new mechanic to the system - Companions. These characters can appear during a quest and join-up with the prisoners to assist in their escape. Fans of roleplaying games will know them by the term NPCs (non-player characters). Players will now encounter event cards in the item deck which trigger the arrival of one of the Companions. Each Companion has a unique mixture of traits and a special ability. They are powerful allies but their presence may be fleeting, so prisoners must choose carefully how and when to call on them. \nIn the most confined, twisting passageways; in the vaulted eaves of the highest towers; in the fetid air drawn sharply into your panicked lungs \u2013 there will you find his creation. For he is the Plague Lord, emanator of an all-encompassing evil. A monstrous mass of weeping pustules, it would be his most perverse pleasure to watch as you slowly succumb to the agonising torment of the Black Death...\nContains:  \n1 New Boss: The Plague Lord, only growing stronger the more infected he becomes  \n15 New Chapters: The Plague Lord\u2019s deranged followers, and new castle locations  \n3 New Characters: Versatile new prisoners ready to join the quest  \n3 Character Dice: Representing the new prisoner\u2019s endowment of skills  \n5 New Items: Vital new equipment for prisoners to discover in the depths\n1 Plague Dice: Used to control the contraction and spread of this vile disease\nNew Mechanic\nThis Adventure Pack introduces a new mechanic to the system - Plague. As if the horrors, traps, and challenges of the Dark Castle were not already enough to haunt the prisoner\u2019s every waking thought, there is now a new kind of threat to contend with. As they explore the labyrinthine castle passages, players can now encounter Carriers, plague-infected lunatics bent on spreading the disease. Certain interactions with Carriers can cause prisoners to contract, spread, and even succumb entirely to this rampant atrocity, adding a new dimension and weight to the game\u2019s risk-reward decisions.\nAn expansion in its own right, the Collector\u2019s Box contains a wealth of new, fan-driven game content for Escape the Dark Castle while also providing stylish and practical storage for your entire collection.\n(not final design, some items shown are sold seperately)\nContains:  \n6 New Boss Cards: An array of powerful new foes, each with a unique and devious mechanic\n12 Special Ability Cards: Unlock the prisoner's talents as they reach new heights of heroism\n2 New Start Cards: Now you\u2019ll never know exactly how your adventure will begin\n2 Epilogue Cards: Whether you escape or not, get complete narrative closure to every quest\n4 Health Trackers with Cubes: An optional alternative to the scorepad & pencil system\n1 Dice Bag: Store all the game\u2019s beautiful dice in one satisfying pouch\n1 \u201cFirst Player\u201d Card: Used to help keep track of who is taking the lead each chapter\n1 Icon Chart: A handy reference to help new players remember what everything means\n(not final design, some items shown are sold seperately)\nStorage for your entire collection, now and in the future\nWith it\u2019s sturdy, matt black box and minimal spot UV detailing, the imposing exterior of the Collector\u2019s Box hides an elegant organiser within. Now you can store every item in your Escape the Dark Castle collection in one box with ease.  \nThe custom insert lets you arrange your cards by set, type, or however you see fit, simply slipping them into the rows of card dividers \u2013 sleeved or unsleeved. Not only is this immensely satisfying, it also cuts down on card handling time during setup - just slide out the desired modules and your tailored game can be set up in moments. \nThe larger cavity is molded to securely hold all your rulebooks, scorepads, pencils & cubes, with extra space set aside to store all the great products offered in this Kickstarter (see the Add-ons section further down the page). We\u2019ve even included space for several more expansions, so future releases will fit right in.\nWe have organised our pledge levels and add-ons to allow every possible combination of rewards.\nAt each pledge level, a shipping charge will apply based on your location, but we've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum.

One pack of each is enough to completely sleeve the main game (including the contents of the Kickstarter upgrade kit). To sleeve expansions, you'll need additional packs. \nA6 Clear Sleeves - \u00a35.00\nA8 Clear Sleeves - \u00a33.00\nEscape the Dark Castle Playmats - \u00a35.00\nTake your game to the next level of desirability with our beautifully illustrated neoprene playmats.

What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Castle?\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\"You fall to the ground exhausted and delirious. There was no heroic battle, no valiant climax - just too much strain on a body and mind not fit to bear it. Eventually you rise, weak and jabbering with madness, destined to wander the castle in a state of physical and mental ruin, unrecognisable to any who once knew you...\"\nThis is a printed, perfect bound softback book, and includes a free PDF version. The Death Book is designed to fit perfectly into the Collectors Box.\nOriginal Soundtrack - \u00a35.00\nWhether you prefer your atmospheric dungeon-synth on cassette or MP3, you simply haven't played Escape the Dark Castle until you've played it to this!\n\nThis atmospheric soundtrack was specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay. \n(not final design)\nContains: \nOver 45 mins of atmospheric music on limited edition Cassette, and the MP3 files to download. \nBecome a Prisoner - \u00a365.00\nBack by popular demand, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw your exclusive prisoner portrait, fully playable using the dice of whichever core game character you choose to become. \n\nWill you be the Abbot, Tailor, Mason? Choose from any prisoner released to date. Imagine the satisfaction when you Escape the Dark Castle personally!\nHow it works: \nPick the character you'd like to become, then send us a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. \nOur \u00a325k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs of this ambitious campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following freebies and upgrades: \n(All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the Escape the Dark Castle Original Soundtrack MP3 files to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the new and improved Tales from the Dark book PDF file to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get The Death Book PDF file to download free of charge.\nNaturally, the sleeves will be high quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard material to a matt finish. \nOur books will be a classy production, but if we reach this level of funding it will open up some more luxurious options and finishes to make the print editions of Both Tales from the Dark and The Death Book that little bit more special. \n At this level of funding we'd like to replace the Health Tracker cubes in the Collector's Box with something more thematic. Little skulls perhaps...\nThe Collectors Box includes a 'first player' card we refer to as the 'torch'. Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to an object as standard. \nIf you thought the Golden Axe was legendary, wait until you see what is perhaps the most influential relic the gaming world has even known - The Living Stone! We'll add this item card and its custom dice to the Collector's Box as standard. \nEscape the Dark Castle lends itself well to a tasteful companion app, to track health and play the soundtrack to augment the play experience. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Castle will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign.\nAfter an impeccable performance handling our first campaign, we'll once again be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.  \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge.  \nThe following base level shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level:\nPlease note: Ordering add-ons may increase your shipping charge above the price shown below. You final shipping total will be calculated in Backerit at the end of the campaign, and any excess must be paid before shipping can take place. \nAre you a journalist or content creator?

The themes of life and death are represented with the motif of Thorns and Roses. Thorns embodies the pain of loss and death found in these works, while the Roses the sweetness of love and life.\nThe decks feature four of Shakespeare's best known works: Hamlet, Romeo & Juliet, Macbeth and King Lear. The Roses deck interprets these characters with an item of significance while the Thorns deck depicts their method of death (it's a lot of deaths.)\nThorns and Roses - Roses Deck\nThorns and Roses - Thorns Deck\nTwo separate card back designs\nA close up of the difference between the Queen of Hearts\nHamlet - Roses Edition\nHamlet - Thorns Edition\nRomeo & Juliet - Roses Edition\nRomeo & Juliet - Thorns Edition\nMacbeth - Roses Edition\nMacbeth - Thorns Edition\nKing Lear - Roses Edition\nKing Lear - Thorns Edition\nNumbered Cards - Roses Edition\nNumbered Cards - Thorns Edition\nThe Fool (Jokers) - Roses Edition\nThe Fool (Jokers) - Thorns Edition\nPlaying cards traditionally feature jesters as the jokers, so it made perfect sense to feature the Shakespearean Fool.

(Check the \u201cWhy Kickstarter Exclusive?\u201d section for details)\nTraduction de la page en fran\u00e7ais\nEnglish and French (printed copies) - Spanish, German (as PDF downloads)\nNew to Kickstarter?\nHere is a guide to guide you through all the steps from pledging on Kickstarter to getting your game!\nThe Base Game Pledge for the core boxes gives you a complete game experience with dozens of stretch goal extras for even more replay value.\nHowever, the Batman universe is so vast that we couldn\u2019t fit all of it into the core boxes.\nThe expansions listed below all add new miniatures, new gameplay, new game boards, new scenarios, or a mix of all of these. They expand your gameplay options to give you even more great content.\nHere is the complete list of all the optional buys available and their price:\nIf you're interested in purchasing any of these optional buys, please click the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button on the Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles Kickstarter page, and add the amount of the items that you would like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage. We will sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you a link to our pledge manager.\nClick on the picture to learn more about the Villain Campaign Pack\n                      The mini-campaign takes place on the four maps of the base box(es). You will play as Bane and some of the worst criminals of Gotham City he has allied with. Bane\u2019s plan is to use them to take over the city and break its protector, the Dark Knight. Also, and this is very important, you will require a copy of the Versus Mode add on to play these scenarios.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Wayne Manor Expansion\n This expansion includes 2 game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes 3 scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne Manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc. This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!\nClick on the picture for more details about the Arkham Asylum expansion\n                                                  This expansion includes 2 game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with 3 scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can\u2019t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won\u2019t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.\nClick on the picture for more details about the Versus Mode expansion\n                                                     Good versus evil. Light versus darkness. Heroes versus villains. Opposition is the core of the Batman universe. Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.\nTo represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more \u201cskirmish\u201d feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.\nThis expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero\u2019s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes\u2019 side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain\u2019s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.\nThis expansion includes the Batmobile and three scenarios: one for the Bank map, from the base game, one for the Batcave map from the Wayne Manor expansion, and one for the Jokerland map from the Arkham Asylum expansion. The Batmobile is played by the heroes, but does not function independently as a hero. Heroes will control it through a special tile which allows them to create shortcuts by destroying walls or to neutralize hordes of villains.\nBatman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is a scenario-based miniatures board game where 2 to 4 players control the Dark Knight and his allies in their never-ending battle against crime through an asymmetrical and open game system.\nEach game involves an action-packed fight where two sides face off. One of the players assumes the role of the Villain and controls the most notorious criminals of Gotham City. The remaining players take control of the Heroes, who must work together as a team to foil the Villain\u2019s plots. Each side takes turns, pitting their strategies against each other in order to achieve their objectives.\nThe heroes and the villain playing one of the 20 scenarios of the base game\nEach game of Batman\u2122: Gotham City Chronicles is played according to a scenario which describes the plot, location of the action, setup of the game, number of turns, and the specific objectives each side is trying to achieve in order to win the game.\nThe game involves two opposing sides: the heroes and the villain. We wanted to represent that dynamic up front by making it obvious from the art on the boxes. That's right, boxes, because one box will not be enough to fit everything you will get.\nBut this separation has another purpose: it eases the setup of the game. The hero box contains the hero boards, screens, cards...everything the heroes need to play a scenario. The villain box contains the miniatures, tiles, dice, and everything needed to prepare the command board for the fight to come. These 2 boxes will constitute the core game, which include all the base offerings plus all the Stretch Goals we're hoping will be unlocked during the campaign.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download the WIP rulebook.\nClick on the picture to download a scenario\n                                   Cliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un sc\u00e9nario\nEach player on the heroes' side controls one or many characters.\nAt the beginning of a scenario, the players may choose which hero they want to play from a large roster.

The more actions they perform, the more exhausted they become.\nBut when a hero gets wounded, they must transfer energy cubes from their fatigue zone to their wound zone, diminishing their capacity to perform actions in future rounds.\nThe double-thickness bat-tablet with the energy zones\nTo better understand how a hero board works, please watch the following 3 videos from Wayne Entertainment:\nA hero can also carry equipment cards, placed next to their hero board. These cards grant bonuses to the hero when performing actions but have a weight that might slow down the hero or reduce their skills.\nEquipment cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nFinally, some heroes of the bat-family have access to the latest innovations from Wayne Enterprises and can have bat-gadgets. These bat-gadgets also grant bonuses but do not have a weight as they fit into their utility belt.\nBat-Gadgets cards (size: 42 x 63mm)\nA hero setup\nFacing the heroes is one player: the villain.

They may activate up to 2 tiles per turn by spending energy cubes. But unlike the heroes, these cubes only represent the villain's ability to activate tiles, as each character they control has their own life point count.\nPlastic sample of the command board\nClose-up of the plastic sample of the command board\nTo better understand how the command board works, please watch the following video series from Wayne Entertainment:\nAll miniatures presented in this campaign will be of high-quality plastic, pre-assembled, and shipped unpainted.\nSCALE\nThe scale of our miniatures is 35mm from feet to eyes. This large scale allows us to create highly detailed miniatures, with dynamic poses that are easier to paint.\nBut some of our models are even bigger, like the hulking Bane, towering Clayface, and the gigantic T-Rex!\nFrom left to right: the gigantic T-Rex, Clayface, Killer Croc, Bane, and Montoya\nTHE BASES\nAs you may have noticed in the images above, the bases of our figures are no longer plain. Indeed, we are moving the quality of our miniatures one step further by offering textured bases so your figures look even better on the game board. Instead of having one base for all your miniatures, we have created 5 different bases of 30mm that will be used for \"human-sized\" figures. Larger miniatures like Killer Croc will have a 45mm textured base and unconventionally large characters like Clayface will be placed on a 60mm textured base.\nA 3D render of the five 30mm bases\nOUR EXPERIENCE\nThis is our third Kickstarter project that features hundreds of miniatures. We have gained a lot of experience crafting these kinds of complex miniatures from the sculpting stage to the final model you will have in your hands. With Mythic Battles: Pantheon we actually set a new standard by using ABS (a harder plastic compared to the standard PCV) for thin sections (such as knives and ankles) and straight components (such as swords).\nAs you can see on these production plastic samples, the spears are perfectly straight, as they are made of ABS hard plastic.\nThis experience allows us to offer very high-quality miniatures without bendy parts, that are regarded as the best available.  \nAdventure mode by Beasts of War (EN):\nLet's play! by Beasts of War (EN):\nHow to play by Barry Doublet (EN):\nDe l'explication par Trictrac (FR) :\n De la partie par Trictrac (FR) :\n Learn to Play: Kickstarter Overview (EN):\n Learn to Play: Conan VS Batman (EN):\n The Dice Tower plays (EN):\nAll pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language of your game during the Pledge Manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne. Attention cependant : seules les r\u00e8gles et les sc\u00e9narios seront traduits en fran\u00e7ais. Le reste du mat\u00e9riel contient relativement peu de texte : le nom des cartes d'\u00e9quipement et le nom des personnages resteront en anglais. Par exemple, Gueule d'Argile s\u2019appellera Clayface.\nWe will offer translations in German and Spanish, available to download as PDF when the game will be delivered. However, only the rules and scenarios will be translated. The rest of the components contain relatively little text: the name of the asset cards and the name of the characters will remain in English. For example, Clay Maw will be called Clayface.\nFor a very simple reason: the game contains a lot of work and high-quality components on top of the cost of the Batman license.\nTo be able to offer you this game at a reasonable price, we had to cut our margins as low as possible. We cut them so much, in fact, that we cannot reduce them any further. Therefore, if we were to sell this game to a distributor, who then would sell it to retailers, the final price of the base game for you gamers would be multiplied by 2.5. That would be more than $350 for the base game only!\nWe talk from experience as we offered Conan, our first Kickstarter project, through retail a few years back, and it turns out, that we had to lower our selling price to the distributor so much that we did not make any money on this. And you will understand that this is not a very good business model for a company.\nBased on our Conan and Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in China (Asia, Pacific and Japan backers), USA (USA), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and France (EU backers and the rest of the world). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $20-$25 to most states.\nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nEUROPE: $20-25 to France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands. $25-35 to Spain, UK, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, Czech Republic and to most other countries.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nBRAZIL: $120-130 to Brazil (including customs and tax fees)\nASIA: $27 to China and Hong Kong. $40 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia. $50-55 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $50-55 to Morocco, $80-85 to South Africa, $140-145 to most other countries.\nDOM-TOM: $60-65 to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally, and to the following countries:\nCuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea and Syria.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

Players start with a hand of Up Quarks, Down Quarks and Photon (Gamma Ray) cards, which they use to form protons, neutrons, and electrons. Players combine these subatomic particles to either build available Elements or buy even more powerful cards for their deck.\n   Game Setup\nEach player begins with a weak deck of Up Quarks, Down Quarks and Photon (Gamma Ray) Cards.\nPlayers start with a hand of 5 cards. They use their Up Quarks and Down Quarks to create Protons and Neutrons, and use their Photo (Gamma Ray) cards to create Electrons. \nThey can either use these Subatomic Particles to either:  \n(1) Purchase Subatomic Particle cards that get mixed into a player's starter deck, making it more powerful, like this... \n(2) Build up the atom on their player mat (in order to claim Element Cards, which are what score them points) like this... \nWhen a player claims an Element, they also place two Goal Markers on the board, competing over control for additional end game points. The catch is, you can only place those Goal Markers only on End Goals that do NOT match the Element you just built. \nSo, if you built a Helium, you can place a marker on any End Goal spot except Helium. At the end of the game, you'll get points for End Goals based on the Elements you built during the game IF you have the most or second most Goal Markers on any given End Goal.\nPlayer can also remove weaker cards from their deck (cull their deck) by Annihilating cards from their hand for a cost of 2 energy, like this...\n         Play through the fundamentals of chemistry with Ion and Covalence AND Subatomic!

For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! However, due to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

It is stored in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy.\nSo why the old drawing? Why are we using Leonardo da Vinci?\nWe wanted to make something that was fun and had a little history involved. Not so much you were worried about a pop quiz later, but enough that it might stick with you. Also, the game is about the math of the body in motion, the art of form and its relationship with the world around us.... And the guy you are trying to stick with a sword...\nWe could not think of anybody we would rather pay homage to, the image is public domain, but we still want to pay attention and respect to one of the people that inspired us. Yes I know we say this every time, but the guy was seriously awesome, it is only honest to pay homage each time...\nThis is our fourth deck, and one we have been looking forward to doing\u2026\nWe are still very proud of our successful Kickstarters, English Longsword, French Rapier and Scottish Claymore! We are still just a little gaming company run out of our house, but it is a real joy to share gaming ideas & creative Geekery with all our fellow gamers out there. So thanks for letting us fulfill a dream! I will try to keep this short so we can get on with our lives, so here we go!\nA Blast from the past!\nfor those of you looking to see gameplay watch a video of a us play the original game from the first kickstarter. it will show you how easy the gameplay is!\nGameplay Video\nA link to a sample of the rules! Fast and Easy Read!\nLexiconsPlayInstructionsV01-2.pdf\nWhat is different with the new deck?\nThe system is the same, the rules are the same, but the style of fighting with the Japanese Katana is an art form. We are spending time with an Iaido dojo so that we are not just \u201cmaking a guess\u201d at the form and technique. We can not show the true depth and nature of any martial styling in a card game, but we can show respect while translating what we can.\nSo the new deck beats the old decks, right?\nSometimes, if you play it right. We have tested all decks in many variations, they both have the same chance to win. Again its all how you figure out your opponent. Each deck has strengths and weaknesses. This is a really big sharp object, but it moves a little slower then the previous weapons. So more planning and a lot more hoping your opponent stands still.\nCan I mix the new deck with the old ones?\nThere are rules for carrying more than one weapon to the fight. It is very simple to switch weapons, but also very dangerous. Just like real dueling. That is something that will be easily explained in an update. Can you bring more than one weapon to a fight, and switch, yes, can you use them at the SAME time, no. Not yet anyway.\nWe have new artists, and we are really proud of their work!\nWe have been proud of every artist that has worked on our previous decks, and it has given us the excuse to work with a lot of amazing talent.\nThe artist for our two starting heroes and one of our special cards is Taylor Fischer, an amazing artist who helped us get this kickstarter in motion and we hope to have more work in the future from her. Give her a look!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TaylorFischer/posts\nWe looked around to find another great artist and we found a few great ones. The artist that will be taking care of us on this Noble illustration and playmat illustration is the talented and outstanding William O\u2019Brien! We really are pumped! You have to check out his work! I can not say enough about it!\nhttp://willobrienart.daportfolio.com/\nhttps://willobrien.deviantart.com/\nSoundtracks!\nWe have a new member of the creative team and she is a genius. She has given us a great price on composing music, so we are going with a Theme song for each noble and hero! If you pledge at the $50.00 or more pledge you get a copy of it! It will be about 2 minutes long and each noble or hero will get to input the kind of direction they wish it to go. She does not disappoint! We will put a music link up soon!\nA Magical Companion!\nHey that Fairy Companion Card, she looks familiar?\n  http://yayahan.com/\nYes! This year we have the honor of officially working with Yaya Han! It was for our Lexicons of Dueling Sidhe court LARP. Her Absinthe Fairy Cosplay was amazing and we made arrangements to have an illustration done for her of it. She has allowed us to share this card with our Kickstarters! It is a very cool companion card! She was a super great person to work with and we recommend supporting her directly in any way! Every $25 and up Pledge gets a copy!\nIf only there was a playmat choice to go with the card!\nAs you wish...a limit piece we had done for her by a most excellent artist\nLeslie Casilli\nThis playmat is an approved and official limited run!\nNew hero cards and Companion cards?\nWe continue to add some cards that you can play pickup games or adventures. Heroes take the place of status cards when played as a single (like a Noble for those honored few). Companions can be played as an additional character to accompany a hero or status card in pickup games. We will be posting more samples soon! We will have more art up soon! New Mat? Art to follow! It will be amazing as always!\nStretch Goals the first few!\nFREE DECK!\nYou got it! At one dollar over our goal every pledge of $25 or more gets the choice of 1 deck from our Rapier or Claymore sets (sorry we are too low inventory to make a promise for the longsword), or if you just in the mood 1 more Katana Deck! After that, if you would Like to purchase further decks they will be $15 each, with no extra shipping charges!\n  Playmats can be purchased as an add on! Only $25! Picture above is for position only, the final will be super amazing!\nEvery Pledge from $25 and up now gets the theme CD for free! You can play to the sound of the Samurai Pavilion and Hero Pledges.\nWhat does the playmat look like?\nWe are working with Will O'brien to make a really cool one of our hero in battle, but it is a new illustration and I would rather awesome then rushed. I am proud to say our playmats have never disappointed. So we beg your patience and trust on this one. But until then, one of the options will be:\nI looked, this kickstarter is a higher cost then the last one?\nWe have tweaked and pinched to keep the price low and the rewards high. We put everything we can in to each pledge, so we promise you a great reward. We put what we get from you into what we send. Some costs went up that is all. We really are proud of what we have to offer for the cost.

However, not many have tried to make a full 90 minute movie with one and get it into cinemas.\nBut that's what we have challenged ourselves to achieve.\nAnd it won't be easy.\nWe're being ambitious and not setting our story in one location. We're going to shoot in many locations across one of the biggest cities in the world - London.\nThis is a tough challenge. We'll have to employ every guerrilla filmmaking tactic we can come up with to get our story in \"the can\" (or portable hard drive, most likely).\nBefore we can start this challenge, we need some funds. We'll have to keep our actors and small crew alive with food and travel costs. There'll be some small bits of equipment needed. Some locations will need hiring.\nWhen I shot my first film, I had only a camcorder, 1 professional light, 1 mic and recorder. I could fit everything I needed to shoot the film in 2 sports holdalls. This meant the whole production could arrive at the location by bus or train.\nBut that time I had a year to shoot, filming as and when I could arrange everyone and the location. This time, I'll only have 3 weeks.\nIf you join us, you'll get to follow along on this crazy against-the-odds adventure. Can we get locations? Will the actors show up? Can I handle the pressure of shooting with limited funds and a tiny crew?\nA down-on-his-luck band manager tries to save a young singer from the man encouraging her seemingly fatal addiction to drugs and alcohol.\nSynopsis  \nJoe is a once-successful rock guitarist whose famous rock star dad died too young. He\u2019s now managing a girl post-punk band in London, but is almost out of funds. To add to his troubles, the lead singer (Nicki) is addicted to drugs, alcohol and a young guy named Coriolano. When she's too wasted to perform and the record label walks away, her dad (a wealthy golf club owner) demands Joe employ a local thug-for-hire to scare Coriolano away.\nBody & Soul is a drama-thriller set in the London music scene. It's about ordinary people trying to make it against the odds, in a tough and ruthless business. Ordinary folk trying to be extraordinary. People like me and you, reaching for the stars. They serve you coffee in the day, write lyrics in their breaks, play music when they can. And dream.\nInspiration\nSome years ago, I was in a band like many others. Writing and recording songs in our living room, playing in grimy small venues around London and sending off demo tapes to managers and labels. Our high point was a Melody Maker \"Single of the Week\" in January 1993 accompanied by some plays on BBC Radio 1.\nI've had a dream to make a film about this world. A 'behind the scenes' glimpse (but by no means definitive), and without the usual glossy facade presented via film and other media.\nAs a filmmaker, what excites me about new technology is the opportunities it opens up to us as storytellers. The new wave of experimental filmmakers during the 1950s and 60s came after the development of lightweight cameras to be used for filming in combat situations during WW2. And now, with high definition cameras in everyone\u2019s pockets, we find ourselves with the opportunity to experiment once again.\nWe want to experiment and push smartphone filmmaking to its limits.\nThe smartphone camera is now the camera of the people, for the people. They are \u201cmobile\u201d cameras, designed for spontaneity. So, we\u2019ll use them that way, and aim to create a film with a natural energy and a raw dramatic power.\nWe will use the smartphone cameras to create a naturalistic feel. We'll aim to explore new ways to be creative when shooting a narrative movie; to push smartphone film making to its limits.\nThis film is by its nature a risk. Because if filmmakers can\u2019t take risks, the art-form itself becomes stale. By supporting this campaign, you will play your part in keeping the movie business fresh and innovative.\nNEW: Cinema 5D Article about Body&Soul.\n\"All power to this film. This is going to inspire a lot of people who don\u2019t have 50k for an Alexa or RED rig, or even $3,000 to kit a DSLR/DSLRM, to get out there and just create, and not be inhibited by that \u201cIQ Wall\u201d.\"\nWe plan to premiere Body&Soul at the Mobile Motion Film Festival - on the big screen in Zurich, Switzerland - in 2019.\nPrevious Films\nMy previous films Third Contact and Kosmos were shot on micro budgets. Together they've been viewed over 1 million times on YouTube and are now collecting more viewing minutes over on Amazon.\n  After playing Philip Huyt in Kosmos, Jeff is back on board to star in Body & Soul as a down-on-his-luck band manager.\nIn 1994 Jeff starred in the French cult hit Giorgino, directed by Laurent Boutonnat.\nAs a studio guitarist, Jeff has played on some of the highest-selling albums in French history and as lead guitarist performed on some of the largest grossing tours in Europe. Jeff has produced some twenty albums gaining top 20 in Germany, France and Italy.\nYet to cast...\nOther roles are yet to be filled, including the following:\nNICKI HARDING: Female. Mid 20s. Lead singer of a girl rock band. A huge talent, currently wasted - in both senses of the word. Fighting addiction to alcohol, drugs and a parasitic boyfriend.\nROB BYALL: Male. Late 20s. Geeky, knowledgeable A&R scout for a medium sized record label. Once had ambitions to be a musician but fell into a comfortable, regular-waged role instead.  \nPEGGY: Female. 30s. Drummer with enough basic skills to punch a crunching rhythm on a post-punk song. Quietly gets on with her job without complaining.\nSOFIA: Female. Late 20s. Flamboyant post-punk rock guitarist and singer with attitude and stage charisma. Not afraid of confrontation.\nJOANNA: Female. Mid 20s. Bass guitarist and singer. Sees the band as an escape route out of her mundane existence as a coffee shop barista. Ambitious and determined.\nDAVID: Male, 50s, grey-greying hair. Recording studio owner. His days of hedonism are in the past. He just wants a quiet life and to get paid.\nCORIOLANO: Male. Mid 20s. Good looking London boy. Nicki\u2019s partner in love and addiction. Always looking for ways to score the next fix. His parents are not of British descent - perhaps Turkish or South European.\nMR TONY PITT: Male. Mid 40s. An imposing man from a working class area north of London. Earns occasional extra money scaring people for clients.\nCLARK: Male, late 30s. A golf club employee. Can follow simple orders and always sticks to his task.\nJOHN HARDING: Male. Mid 60s. Nicki\u2019s dad and golf club owner. Big, imposing, north London or Essex, self-made.\nMARK, OLLY, PHIL, LARRY: Male. Middle-aged golf club members. They hang out with their rich friend John Harding, drink his beer and amuse each other.\nCAFE WAITRESS: Female. 40s. Waitress and pushy mother with a musically talented son.\nDRUNK BANKER: Male, 20s. So drunk he can hardly stand. Makes a fool of himself.\nMALCOLM: Male. 50s. A bookish publishing company exec with glasses and greying hair.\nTOM: Male. 30s. Does his job, knows the business, works adequately and plays hard.\nPATRICK: Male. 30s. Hopes to break a band one day, so he can have his own office. Hangs out with Tom and Jane when he can.\nJANE: Female. Late 30s. Ambitious, major label A&R woman. Notched a few successes as part of the big system but wants her own label.\n BODY&SOUL official t-shirts, kickstarter backers only.\nSigned A RACE OF MINDS Kosmos paperback novel.\nMobile Motion Pictures\nSince creating the first Mobile Motion Film Festival in 2015, we have watched nearly 1000 films shot on smartphones or similar devices.

Being expensive and time consuming, you often had to be from a wealthy background to learn your craft. \nDigital filmmaking technology gets cheaper every year, opening opportunities for budding auteurs with limited resources. Filmmaking tools that are cheap, simple and widely available (coupled with the collective knowledge of the internet) are driving fresh, unique and open approaches to cinema. \nWe are aiming to be at the forefront of this new wave of filmmakers with our new platform \u2013 the Mobile Motion Film Festival. With MoMo we want to create a festival which provides a level playing field for filmmakers, where talent, creativity and hard work counts more than budget and industry connections. \nBelieving that anybody with a thought-provoking concept or a touching story can make a great film, the festival will showcase new talent using a tool so simple and readily available that it\u2019s often overlooked: the mobile phone.\nThe Conversation\nWe not only show the best smartphone-shot films from around the globe, we invite industry leaders to host talks and masterclasses. Last year we had:\nMASTERCLASS with Chris Bergoch - \"How we shot Tangerine on an iPhone 5s.\" \nTALK with Monika Sch\u00e4rer - \"The camera in everyone\u2019s pockets \u2013 A filmmaking revolution in everybody\u2019s hands.\" Guests: Felix von Muralt, Lukas R\u00fcttimann, Roman Lehmann, Olivier Egli and Manuel Imboden \nSCREENING of Tangerine plus Q&A with Chris Bergoch.\nRewards\nBesides personal handwritten postcards, inside news, home-baked brownies, the possibility to place your logo or name on the cinema screen, we created these awesome MoMo T-Shirts just for you:\n  Everybody who pledges over \u00a312 will be listed here on the MoMo website as an Official Patron.\nJoin the VIPs at an exclusive ap\u00e9ritiv party by pledging for a VIP PASS GOLD.\nVIP Ap\u00e9ritiv MoMo 2016\n Become the official After Show Party sponsor for this years festival!\nAfter Show Party 2016\nOr become this year's sponsor of our unique hand-crafted awards created by the local blacksmith:\nYou can also help by sharing the campaign.

We were overwhelmed by the critical and community reception!\nOur influences include the science fiction of H G Wells and C S Lewis, the planetary romances of Leigh Brackett, Art Nouveau and Planescape: Torment. \nThe rails fall away. The Wilderness is wide before us. \"Where to?\" asks the Navigator.\nSunless Skies tells the story of one possible future of the Fallen London Universe. Ten years have passed since Sunless Sea, and Queen Victoria has led an exodus from London to the heavens. There, a revitalised British Empire - ambitious and authoritarian - begins to expand across the skies.\nTravel between distant ports, unravelling stories, bearing passengers and news, and trading in exotic celestial cargoes.\n  The High Wilderness is space, but not as we know it.     \nThe stars are alive. They are the Judgements: vast intelligences that govern all things. But they are dying. One by one, something is snuffing them out, leaving their thrones empty. An opportunistic Victorian Empire is colonising the domains they leave behind, painting its industrial vision upon the fabric of the heavens.  \nDespite the deaths of stars, the Wilderness is not dark or empty. It is harried by strange winds, coiled with mists, and traversed by improbable beasts.\n  The Reach is, from London's perspective, the frontier: a vast territory of untamed wilderness ripe to explore, to colonise, and to exploit. Here, the Empire is opposed only by the uncompromising environment and a growing movement of independent settlers determined to rule themselves. \nThe Empire's interests are represented by the great trading companies: Murgatroyd's, The Windward Company, Leadbeater & Stainrod. They are well-armed and well-connected. The Independents are a quarrelsome coalition of pioneers. Some believe they need to unify into a new nation to resist London. Others think that's trading one master for another. Can this rag-tag assortment of rebels resist Her Majesty's attentions?  \nYour captain's actions could tip the precarious balance of the region. Will you run guns for the Independents? Or spies for the Empire? Choose wisely \u2013 your decisions will affect the fate of the region; not just for yourself, but for your future captains as well.\n  The heart of London's celestial empire, illuminated by the greatest feat of British engineering to date: a clockwork sun! While the cream of society enjoy tea in their salons and scandal in their newspapers, the wheels of British industry thunder.  \nThe Empress Victoria reigns from her Throne of Hours, exerting authority over time itself. Her favourites are rewarded with freshly-minted months to prolong their lives, while those who displease her are condemned to the Midnight Cells, where every minute lasts a day, and no one leaves until their hair is white and their bones are bent.  \nNew industries flourish. Unseasoned hours are mined in the Reach, then shipped to Albion to be refined on soot-choked workworlds. Casks of stamped and seasoned hours are then delivered to Her Majesty, to be dispensed at her pleasure.  \nThe Windward Company maintains a stranglehold on the trade in hours; but a bold captain could make a tidy living running unlicensed hours to interested parties...\n  Port Prosper is the stronghold of the Windward Company and the terminus of the Isambard Line, London's railroad to the Reach. The Independents call it 'Little London' \u2013 it's a caricature of its mother-city: all twee tea-shops, doilied salons, and gaudy theatres. \nMeanwhile, in its smoky factories, hours mined from the Mother of Mountains are distilled, stamped and shipped to Albion. A daring captain might want to visit to the Chairman of the Thoroughfares Committee, who offers bounties for ridding the skies of \"pirates, smugglers, insurgents and undesirables.\" It is a generous remit.\nIn Sunless Skies, you will leave your mark on the universe, and be marked in return. When you are creating your captain, every decision is a story, and every story has a consequence.\n    Choose your origin: were you a cunning street urchin, a condemned scientist, or a starving poet? The first favours the skill of Veils, used to deceive and evade. The last increases the skill of Hearts, used to convince and endure.  \nYour decision will also affect your Affiliations: the circles you move in. Do you surround yourself with well-bred society? Or do you prefer the company of more honest villains?\nChoose your Ambition and set your own victory condition for the game. Perhaps you want to retire to a life of luxury, or chart the farthest corners of the Wilderness. Perhaps you will not rest until you have won a throne of your own.  \nAs you play the game, your progress through stories will be tracked in your journal, showing at-a-glance the steps you've taken and your next goal.  \nAs your captain increases in power you'll choose new Facets. In addition to affecting your skills, each Facet reveals more about your past. Did you learn the importance of subtlety because of a Feud with your Mentor? Do you still bear the scars of the Battle of the Horizon?  \nSometimes, your accomplishments in the game will unlock new Facets. Perhaps you will become the Hero of New Winchester, or a Bloody-Handed Murderer of Suns.\nThe vessel with which you'll brave the heavens is a (distant, more sophisticated) relative of the steam-powered locomotives that once thundered through the British countryside. Its plating protects you from the killing cold of the High Wilderness. Its engines devour the endless leagues of the sky.\nAccumulate enough money, and you can buy a new vessel, something more attuned to your particular tastes. Something nimble, perhaps, that packs a punch? Or something built for distance, with plenty of cargo space?\nEquip your vessel as you see fit. Would you benefit more from reinforced armour plating, or the additional manpower allowed by external crew pods? (\"Soundproof! Cosy! Detachable!\")\nRecruit a gallery of unpredictable characters to crew your locomotive as First Officer, Chief Engineer, Signaller, or Surgeon. Each brings their own skills and stories to your adventures.\nThe Clay Conductor \n\"Excuse me. I must polish the brasses.\" \nThe clay men provide tireless, unacknowledged labour in countless factories. You saved this one from an eternity on the workworld, and now he seeks the Forge of Souls. \"There is someone who does not exist. Therefore it is necessary to invent them.\" \nThe Incautious Driver \n\"It's tight, but I reckon we can make it.\" \nTheir steering is at best reckless, and at worst deranged. But they're still alive, and luck is a more precious virtue than caution, out here. How did they get the scar? \"In Her Majesty's service\" they say, and then speak no more.\nThe Fatalistic Signalman  \n\"Should've turned left, there.\"\n\nA clerical error consigned him to a distant signal-box on the Trevithick line. Unfortunately, the Trevithick line was never completed, and he spent years alone, drinking pots of Murgatroyd's tea and watching for trains that never came. But when the Wind of Words tore through his boxy home, what it said led him to abandon his duty. Now, he seeks passage to ever-further corners of the sky.\nThe High Wilderness is unconcerned with your tiny life and the lives of your crew. Your every foray into space is as precarious as a Polar expedition. You\u2019ll need to balance your resources carefully and keep an eye on your crew\u2019s Terror to avoid mutiny and death.\nIt is not safe in the skies. A captain will need to defend themselves against pirates, scorn-flukes, the Cyst of Faces, and worse. \nCombat takes place in real time, and requires tactical positioning and planning. Fortunately, you have at your disposal an array of the finest locomotive-mounted weaponry Victorian ingenuity can devise. \nHarry your enemies with a fusillade from the popular Caminus Yards 'Brassraven', or fire a round from the less reliable (but profoundly satisfying) Leadbeater & Stainrod 'Pachyderm'.\nThe pace of combat will remain measured and deliberate. It will be more viable for captains to outmanoeuvre their opponents for tactical advantage than it was in Sunless Sea, and there will be more scope for player skill.\n\nWe want combat to be challenging, but we know that means different things to different players. So we'll provide a range of settings to adjust its frequency and difficulty, meaning that players can customise the experience to be right for them.\n  The Aeginae\nLeviathans that dwell in the belly of the heavens. Usually, they are only glimpsed as sliding shapes \u2013 grand as mountain-ranges \u2013 in the fogs below. It is said that the suns have an ancient pact with them. That they are watchful. That they eat time.\n\n\nThe Scrive-Spinsters\nThey drift like manta rays through the mists. These are the survivors of the Pergamon Manse \u2013 a house of records, destroyed by treachery \u2013 and their gowns are stitched from the pages they managed to salvage. The spinsters can pry locomotives apart with their bronzewood fingers. They harbour a particular hatred for devils.\nThe skies are dangerous. Arriving at the major port in each region will save your game and your progress up to that point. If you set off to explore a new area and die before making port, you\u2019ll be reset to the last major port you visited.\n  Choose to accept your death, and the map ahead will reshuffle for your new captain\u2019s first voyage. Your next captain will continue the legacy, inheriting a portion of their predecessor's wealth and experience.\nBe warned, though \u2013 a captain\u2019s actions are not erased when they die. Unlike in Sunless Sea, not all stories reset for a new captain. Many of the effects you've had on the world are remembered, and the achievements and follies of your earlier captains may haunt those that follow.\n  We are delighted to be partnering with Gametee to create and deliver our physical rewards for Sunless Skies. We have a lot in common as independent British businesses, and we admire not just their design aesthetic, but their whole approach - from their remuneration of artists to their environmental policies. When looking for a partner, we were especially impressed with the quality of their products and the creativity of their designs.\n  Gametee's premium t-shirts are individually silk-screened in Great Britain. Inspired by the world of Sunless Skies, each tee is a limited edition collectible piece of wearable art, available exclusively in this campaign.\n\nPrinted using the finest quality non-toxic water based inks, the design is long lasting and soft to the touch. Included with every t-shirt is a selection of unique printed collectibles.\n\nThese t-shirts are the highest quality, lightweight and tailored in a unisex fit, and available in up to 3XL.\nWe\u2019re delighted to be continuing our tradition of offering backers the naming rights to geographical features. \nCrafted using the finest archival quality cardstock, each magnificent astral map measures 42cm X 59cm (16.5 X 23.4in) making them an exquisite companion piece for navigators. Included alongside the star chart will be a selection of unique collectibles and a hand-numbered certificate of authenticity commemorating your special investment in the campaign.\n  We've completed 25 social goals, unlocking all of the social rewards! Congratulations, everyone! Some rewards will follow during development, the rest are here for posterity.\nHere are three cups of Darkdrop Coffee for your Fallen London character\nWe've released the Sunless Skies avatar generator as a stand-alone toy for you all\nClaim your free Judgemental Hat in Fallen London\nReward for 25 Social Goals: BLEMMIGANS!\nBeloved, beaked, sentient mushrooms with a taste for the written word! You\u2019ll recognise a Blemmigan by its delicate violet colour and desire to see the world - and possibly write poetry about it.\nYour final social reward comprises three Blemmigans, who will become pets or companions in three games:\nThe Blemmigan Gallivanter, a mascot for Sunless Sea\nMy, what a keen little mushroom! Raring to go, and eager to see every soggy corner of the wide, wide zee. But is it too young to be a zailor? Because you're pretty sure it drew that moustache on itself with a pen.\nThe Blemmigan Tourist, a companion for Fallen London\nIts adventuring days are behind it now, but this plucky mushroom can still enjoy a leisurely excursion. One with a sensible itinerary, and plenty of stops for cake.\nThe Blemmigan Voyager, a mascot for Sunless Skies\nThis grizzled Blemmigan has seen all the world can offer. It has been a warrior - a poet - a king. But it finds no pleasure now in war, nor words, nor reign. Only a final voyage remains; beyond the arch of the world, across the windy wastes of heaven. It does not mean to return.\nThis final social reward will be available to all players of Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Skies, at the earliest after Sunless Skies enters Early Access.\n\"TAKE NO ONE'S WORD FOR IT\"  \nThe once-moribund Royal Society of inventors, explorers, and scientists has received a generous grant from Her Enduring Majesty and a renewed mandate: to unravel the mysteries of the High Wilderness!\nInvigorated, they established their new headquarters deep in the frontier. Were they eager to be at the forefront of new discovery? Or were they keen to be further from the Empire's control?  \nAll five parts of the Royal Society port have been added to Sunless Skies thanks to your support! We've collected information about all five parts on the Failbetter blog.\n  Three new origins to choose for your captain! An origin determines your character's background, affects your initial skills, and unlocks a new Facet to take during character advancement.\nA Zee-captain: Once, you zailed the Unterzee. From Old London to Irem; from Port Carnelian to the Avid Horizon. Why did you abandon the seafaring life? Because of a zee-god's curse? Or the promise of a new horizon?\nA Revolutionary: You fought against oppression and the establishment. Feet on the cobbles. Slogans on the walls. Bricks through the windows. And when that failed, bombs in the night. Liberation!\nAn Auditor of the Ministry: The censors of the Ministry of Public Decency have a duty to protect Londoners from material of a distressing nature. For years you served, but were ejected in a purge. Were your detractors correct to accuse you of 'uncensorious sympathies'? Or were you the victim of Ministry politics?\nThree legendary wrecks for your captain to discover, each a storied locomotive that met a tragic end. Will they contain treasures? Dangers? Or the answers to mysteries?\nThe Wreck of the Berrenger: an experimental vessel designed to protect its crew from sky-madness, the Berrenger  strayed where it should not. Now, it has been converted into a secret lecture-hall, where masked revolutionaries gather, and argue, and plot.\nThe Wreck of the Parzifal: the Parzifal was Her Majesty's pride, the first locomotive constructed at the Avid Horizon. But despite the pomp surrounding her launch, she never returned from her maiden voyage. What grim fate did she meet?\nThe Wreck of the Boatman: London has no room for corpses. The Boatman was a necropolis train carrying (for the standard price of a first- or second-class ticket) the coffined bodies of the dead to a distant cemetery-world. The stories say the dead awoke, commandeered the train, and set course for more pleasant climes. Nonsense, of course.\nBe a smuggler! Trade in an enticing assortment of contraband goods! Demand exorbitant prices! Discreetly elude the ungentle attentions of Her Majesty's Customs Service! Enjoy a life of exciting illegality and occasional bombardment!\nWill you outfit your locomotive with hidden compartments in which you can safely stow a Collection of Ministry-Condemned Literature? Or will you brazenly carry Illicit barrels of Unmarked Hours in your hold, placing your faith in bluffs and bribes?\nPlayers of Sunless Sea may recognise a key figure in the smuggling trade: the Blind Bruiser returns, with his earthy aphorism and propensity to egregious violence. His attempts to go straight have not been entirely successful.\n A beast of brass and steam! A midnight miracle of hydraulics! Furnished in the most indulgent luxury, with carpet so thick you'll lose your toes in it, and mahogany as dark as the inside of a confessional.\nManufactured by refugees from Hell, the Moloch is an experimental engine available only at the Royal Society. Devils are no strangers to locomotive engineering - in Old London, trains departed Moloch Street Station for Hell with absolute punctuality. If a train was delayed, the damned were released, and the devils took their timekeeping seriously.\nThe Moloch is a new locomotive chassis for captains who believe in faring the stars in comfort and class.\nWho's this, freshly arrived at the Avid Horizon? Why it's your Aunt, eager to see all the High Wilderness has to offer! A formidable woman whose only weakness is scones, she will undoubtedly get herself into no end of trouble if you don't keep an eye on her.\nShe served as a nurse during London's campaign against Hell in '68 (\"back when I was just a slip of a gel\"). Her will is iron; her needles are sharp; she is accustomed to running a well-ordered household. Perhaps she'd make a good quartermaster? You'd better like scones, though.\nAn Inconvenient Aunt is a new officer who will occupy your quartermaster slot, and comes with her own questline.\nThe Guests are recent arrivals to the High Wilderness. They keep to the skies, avoiding ports. Some say they are cunning; others that they are shy. Some say they are drawn to mirrors. Probably best to turn yours to the wall, just in case.\nThe Guests crave the particular warmth associated with places that have been lived-in - they like stoves, and keepsakes, and knicknacks. A wriggling colony of them will fill a locomotive like a snail fills its shell. Be careful. That Windward Company trader that refuses to answer your signal might be hosting a writhing community of Guests, growing ever-more frantic for a new home as theirs grows cold.\nThere is at least one more stretch goal after these, too, so let\u2019s keep our upper lips stiff and momentum up!\nThis stretch goal adds an advanced Ambition to Sunless Skies. Ambitions are victory conditions you choose at the start of play. This one unlocks a tale of folly, obsession, and myth, aimed at players who enjoy mystery and ambiguity in their stories.\nIt is only a story told on windy nights, while the coals burn low in the engine and the stars wink upon their mantle:\nA wounded king.\nA wasted land.\nA quest.\nA cup.\nSome say the cup holds life; others say grace; still others, poison.\nA pretty romance! Only a fool would believe it. But fools do, of course. And invent elaborate, chivalrous rules to govern their pursuit of a quest that will lead them into ruin. It is the obsession of lunatics, captains-errant, and dreamers.\nBut what if...\nOver the last few months, we've been developing our vision of Sunless Skies \u2013 drawing concept art, writing the lore, designing and prototyping gameplay. We think it's going to be something special and we're excited (gleeful, even) about making it. Before we enter production, we'd like to take the opportunity to confirm that this is also a game you want us to make, and to begin gathering feedback that will help us make the game better.  \nWe're asking for \u00a3100 000, which is around what we raised for Sunless Sea. The game's actual budget is higher \u2013 \u00a3330 000. If this Kickstarter succeeds, we'll fund the difference ourselves, using the proceeds from Fallen London, Sunless Sea and Sunless Sea: Zubmariner.\n\nAll funds raised via the Kickstarter will go directly on game development, Kickstarter fees and fulfilling the physical rewards. Other costs, like marketing the finished game, will come from our other income.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe now have a lot of experience with the main technologies we'll be using to make Sunless Skies \u2013 Unity and StoryNexus, our in-house storytelling engine.

We've prototyped the riskiest elements of the design to prove feasibility over the last few months and carefully planned out production, so can be fairly confident in our timeline. \n\nThe biggest risk is that we'll decide to expand the scope of the game during early access, or budget more time than currently expected to address feedback or improve features (as we did with combat for Sunless Sea).

One player will act as the Nemesis and take control of the secret society called The Cult that plans to install a government of the dead. The rest of the players cooperate as the Gentlemen of the Unicorn Club, dedicated to foiling the conspiracies that threaten the Crown.\nHere's a look at everything that's been unlocked: \n   And here's what you can choose to add to your pledge:\nFollow the links to find out more about The Dragon, The Mekasylum, The Wheel, The Gentlemen of Her Majesty's Service, The Baker Street Set, The Art Book, and The Kingdom Death Crossover.\nRise of Moloch is set in the fantastic, steampunk setting of 'The World of SMOG'. This is CMON's second tabletop entry in this universe, the first one being \"On Her Majesty's Service.\" Rise of Moloch is from the same publishers of the popular Zombicide series and Massive Darkness: CMON and Guillotine Games. The amazing art from Keith Thompson and Christophe Madura give Rise of Moloch a classy and elegant look, complemented by its amazing miniatures!\nOur Gentlemen: Abigail, Emma, Drago, Walther and Major\nIn Rise of Moloch, archaeologists have discovered the means to reanimate dead bodies, quickly replacing mechanical inventions with cheap, undead labor, putting England in dire peril. The campaign consists of six different Chapters. Each one has a unique set of goals and losing conditions for both the Gentlemen and the Nemesis to accomplish. There are many different paths players can follow, and everything from Events, to Upgrades, to the results of different battles and encounters will shape the way players experience the game as they progress. No two campaigns are ever the same!\nAt the start of each Chapter, one of the Gentlemen will be nominated as the Leader and will assign Role Cards to the other players on the team, giving them a unique ability. For example, the Bouncer can dish out extra damage during a battle, and the Samaritan can heal teammates. All the Gentlemen of The Unicorn Club also have a Class, and will upgrade their skills in different ways throughout the campaign. The Classes are: Knight, Dilettante, Mekamancer, Arcanist and Monster.\nTo succeed in their mission, the Gentlemen will have to use some of the fanciest inventions available. Remember to get the right equipment for each of the characters, since some are adept at ranged combat, and others like to get their hands dirty with melee combat. Learning how to use them as a cohesive unit is key to victory! Some special equipment or actions might require a rare and special resource to be activated: ETHER. But beware! Once used by the heroes, Ether becomes available for the Nemesis to use on one of his henchmen, activating their special abilities. So the more Ether the Gentlemen use, the more powerful the Nemesis becomes!\nWhile the Gentlemen have special class abilities and the most modern machinery at their disposal, the Nemesis will be able to use unpredictable Chaos Cards they have in hand to surprise the heroes. As the game evolves, several cards will be acquired and can be constantly activated when their Ether cost is paid. Those permanent cards can allow the Nemesis to bring various types of surprises to the game, such as summoning new Minions, boosting an attack with dice, etc.\nPlayers will have to carefully make their decisions according to the style of each Villain character. When playing with the members of the Grotesque Company Circus, for example, you will find that Titus is a strongman who is heavy on the muscles, but light on the brain power, and the Hammersmith Sisters are two heads sharing one body... but they hold a single talent for swinging a mallet!\nThe crew from the circus: The strong Titus, the Killer Clowns and the crazy Hammersmith Sisters\nEach member of the The Cult and the twisted family of the Grotesque Company Circus has their own double-sided dashboard, presenting 2 different options of abilities for the Nemesis player to choose. While Tobias and Emerson will always gain a bonus when the other one is killed (an effect of their Blood Brothers ability), in different scenarios you can choose if you want to play with a version of Tobias that spawns new zombies or with a version of him that deals more damage to opponents!\nThe mighty Moloch and The Cult Agents\nIn Rise of Moloch, the direction of the game unfolds like a play being performed. However, in this play, the actors are writing the script as they go! All of the action and drama takes place over the course of six different Chapters. The board will change each Chapter, with the streets and buildings of London coming together to form the stage for the play. Just as with any good performance, Rise of Moloch has Intermissions between the Chapters. Normally, this is a time for the audience to ruminate over what they\u2019ve seen and wait for the next part of the play. But in this story, the Intermission is where some of the most crucial decisions in the game will take place, since this moment is all about getting stronger for the future Chapters of the game!\nFor each Chapter of Rise of Moloch, the board is set up with different tiles to form a stage. Each stage will be a mixture of indoor and outdoor locations constructing the streets, alleys, and buildings of London. The players will have to negotiate their way through doors, walls, and obstructions if they want to complete their tasks. The Chapter unfolds across that stage, with each side using the environments and their team of characters to defeat their opponents.\nDifferent overlays and setups: No scenarios look alike!\nAfter a series of fierce encounters with the Agents of the Nemesis (which work like bosses for each Chapter), the intrepid Gentlemen may end up suffering too many Wounds, which will give them a Torment Card. These cards add even more to the story, causing effects like losing an equipment card, a skill, or even having their number of actions reduced! Of course, on the brink of losing their minds, some of the Gentleman might find extra strength and perform a counter-attack action!\nThe right Activation order is key to victory!\nAt the beginning of each round, Activation cards are laid out secretly on a special dashboard, and both sides take alternating turns revealing the cards. A clever and unexpected sequence of activations can find your adversary unprepared, paving the way to a strategic victory!\nThe Unicorn Club!\n  Rise of Moloch comes with:\n63 Highly Detailed Miniatures (5 Different Gentlemen; 6 Bobby Minions; 4 Special Chapter Characters; 13 Agents of the Nemesis; 10 Killer Clowns; 25 Zombies (10 Regular; 5 Zombies in Flames; 5 Royal Guard Zombies; 5 Dismembered Corpse Zombies)\n5 Heroes Dashboards\n14 Villain Dashboards\n220+ Mini-Cards (30 Chaos Cards, 20 Torment Cards, 6 Role Cards, 20 Gear Cards, 20 Artifact Cards, 20 Common Arsenal Cards, 15 Expert Arsenal Cards, 10 Royal Arsenal Cards, 40 Upgrade Cards, etc..)\n5 Player-Aids\n12 Scenery Rooms Overlays\nOver 150 Cardboard Tokens\n1 Activation/Intermission Board\n1 Nemesis Board\n1 London Fire Board\n1 Rulebook\n1 Campaign Book\n8 Custom Engraved Dice\nHERE you can download a work in progress version of the rulebook.

The miniature is also followed by a new art and new abilities - the same character is also present on the base game, but with a different game experience!\nAmbassador Pledge - $120\nThe Ambassador Pledge gives you a copy of Rise of Moloch Core Box, with the Kickstarter Exclusive Alternate Hero Emma Swanson, all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock and a copy of the Kickstarter Exclusive expansion The Embassy!\nIn this exciting expansion for The World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch, the intrepid Gentlemen are sent to investigate strange events surrounding the mysterious Embassy. The Embassy brings an all new three Chapter campaign to Rise of Moloch, beginning with a daring escape from an infected Police Station to the very depths of the London sewer system! But it\u2019s not only the map that has changed in The Embassy, the Nemesis themselves have changed into a new threat!\nAll the Miniatures from The Embassy Expansion!\nThroughout this campaign the Gentlemen will not suffer Torments, but rather Mutations, which can range from bladed arms, enhanced senses, to lashing tentacles! But while these Mutations can grant immense power, they come at a steep cost- each round there is a chance the alien host dwelling within might take over, forcing that Gentlemen under the control of the Nemesis! Can the Gentlemen uncover the secrets of The Embassy before succumbing to alien infection?\nA new pack of rooms and overlays!\n  The Embassy: Agents of The Nemesis and Minions. The alien infection is spreading!\nRise of Moloch: The Embassy Expansion comes with:\n2 Gentlemen Miniatures (Elisabeth Sparkle and Lord Baron Mantes)\n3 Villain Miniatures (Lord Swanson, Ambassador Nail and Kenny Jones)\n8 Minion Miniatures (Infected Constable)\n1 New Campaign, including 3 New Chapters and a pack of Overlays\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nAll of the miniatures in this campaign will be in plastic, and come pre-assembled and unpainted.\nCMON gathered a brave group of gentlemen to face off with Michael Shinall, a Senior Developer on Rise of Moloch in a short gameplay video to give you an idea of how the game plays:\n      The channel Man Vs Meeple took a first look at Rise of Moloch, check the video below:\n    Find out more about The Dragon expansion HERE.\nDelve into The Mekasylum expansion HERE.\nUnearth The Wheel expansion HERE.\nRead up on these Gentlemen of Her Majesty's Service  HERE.\nExplore Baker Street HERE.\nFind out more about this Art Book HERE.\nDiscover the Kingdom Death Crossover HERE. \n                                                                              Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $70 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. $15-$30 to most other countries.\n$35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n$40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n$55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n$60 to Iceland and Israel.\n$70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n   To learn about Retailer pledges, please click HERE. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 25th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire. We're finishing delivery of Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, and Arcadia Quest: Inferno.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Rum & Bones: Second Tide which is about to ship to the distribution hubs and Massive Darkness, which is in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rise of Moloch.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Arcanist", "descp": "*Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nThe World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch Core Box\nExclusive Alternate Hero Emma Swanson\nAll Applicable Stretch Goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["164 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 120 or more", "title": "Ambassador", "descp": "*Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nThe World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch Core Box\nExclusive Alternate Hero Emma Swanson\nExclusive Embassy Expansion\nAll Applicable Stretch Goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,926 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 110 or more", "title": "Ambassador Early Bird", "descp": "*Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nThe World of SMOG: Rise of Moloch Core Box\nExclusive Alternate Hero Emma Swanson\nExclusive Embassy Expansion\nAll Applicable Stretch Goals!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "640 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Replacement packs are shipping!", "update_content": "Gentlemen!\nAs explained in the previous update, a few assets throughout the various Rise of Moloch products were printed with some gameplay-affecting errors, and a replacement pack to correct these errors was in our plans.\nWe just have been notified that the packs started to ship this week, and some of you may even have received them already!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Errata Posting and Replacements", "update_content": "Gentlemen, we have a quick Update for you today:\nIt has come to our attention that a few assets throughout the various Rise of Moloch products were printed with some gameplay-affecting errors.

Survivors fight for their lives against an onslaught of bizarre and fearsome creatures. They will use the fruits of these battles to build a fragile civilization in a place where humans are at the bottom of a monstrous ecology. \nInitially, I brought the concept for Monster to Kickstarter in order to make a far-away dream into a reality. The runaway train of success helped pack the game with more original art, in-depth gameplay, and fantastically sculpted minis than even I dreamed of. A game this size could not feasibly be made without the community of supportive backers we found on Kickstarter. It's too expensive to produce and too vivid for distribution.\nThrough the experience of kickstarting Monster, I found a group of people that shares my vision for a blisteringly difficult game with a continually emerging story. I am truly humbled to share it with the world.\nNow there isn't a single factory sealed copy at KD HQ. There are still people asking if there will ever be more so I'm back on Kickstarter to launch a campaign for a new edition. I want to print updated rules, great new expansions, even more content and (with your help) many surprises!!!\nKingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Changelog\nAdd-Ons\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                         The Gambler's Chest\nGambler's Rolls\n                                                                                                                                                                                                     First Hero Expansion\nIn the First Hero Expansion, players take the role of 4 veteran survivors who have no settlement to call their own. They find and invade a settlement where they face the First Hero, a survivor so powerful, they do all the hunting by themselves! The purpose of this expansion is to help players start more advanced campaigns at Lantern Year 12 or 20. Instead of simply providing complicated rules to generate later settlements, your showdown with the First Hero will create the advanced settlement that you can take over.\n Kingdom Death: Monster\nShipping Details & Shipping Waves\nOne thing we've learned from managing the impossibly huge number of reward combinations from our first campaign is to strike a balance between timely delivery of rewards to our eager fans and being logistically responsible to our staff and partners. So here's what we've decided about shipping rewards for this campaign.\n\nWe have set the estimated delivery of all pledge levels to December 2020. This is a best case scenario, in case our campaign gets insanley huge! 3-4 years development, production & transportation cycle to 100% finish every promise we might make during this campaign is realistic.  \nRewards from this Kickstarter will ship in waves that will be determined by the final scope of this campaign. Each wave's shipping costs will be collected through a pledge manager (most likely backerkit) when the goods are ready to ship. Shipping costs will reflect the actual cost to ship your pledge and any additional rewards you selected from that wave.\nLike our previous campaign, we will make our best efforts to ease the burden of shipping by fulfilling rewards from shipping partners around the world (projected as: US, CA, EU, AU.)\nBackers are responsible for any and all import fees, VAT, duties, taxes, post office fees, and or any other fees their country or government imposes.\n\n*Core Games Ships Separately!\nThe Core Game is massive.

He rides along in Rad's backpack, providing (sometimes questionable) verbal support, and lays waste with his punching power gloves.\nWe feel that this mostly forgotten genre -- which ruled for ten strong years beginning in the mid-80's -- is in dire need of a revival using today's most modern engine, Unreal 4, with a Rick and Morty sense of humor.\n      Rad is a rambunctious but spirited young boy who maybe plays too many video games. After dozing off at the tail end of a long night of gaming, Rad awakens to find his dusty old console has turned itself back on. Suddenly a vortex emerges and he's sucked into his TV, where he finds himself the star in his very own video game adventure.\nDusty is Rad's good-hearted but foul-mouthed, now-sentient game console. His clock speed isn't what it used to be, but what he lacks for in megahertz he makes up for with experience and attitude!\nRad & Dusty's adventure begins in the First World, taking them through seven dangerous stages of action-packed, humor-filled, hardcore platforming fun. This decaying jungle world has been infected by a fierce corruption, and it's up to the unlikely buddy-duo Rad and Dusty to save the jungle's inhabitants and restore the Elder Tree as guardian of the land.\n  Weapons: Dusty arms Rad with a variety of radical bad-ass weaponry. The Bolt Blaster has unlimited ammo, is easy to use, and more than enough firepower to get the job done. The Phoenix Cannon shoots out a fiery bird whose wingspan lights enemies ablaze as it flies by. There are 5+ weapons in this first chapter, with more to come.\nSounds & Music: Our composer Andrew Hulshult combined his years of musical experience (both performing and writing) with his passion for retro-style gaming to create an amazing and authentic soundtrack for the game complete with MIDI-inspired music... And synthesizers!\nThe Pixelverse: While Rad and Dusty are a great team, only Dusty can enter the electrified Pixelverse -- a dangerous spacetime-breaking region that exists behind the game world. Dusty enters the Pixelverse when necessary to repair glitches in the running game world, allowing both Rad & Dusty to continue their journey.\nClassic Easter Eggs: The game features hard-to-find collectibles in sometimes even harder-to-find classic secret rooms. Use your precision platforming skills to collect 'em all.\nVoice Acting: Dusty is voiced by none other than incomparable industry legend Jon St John. Rad's human counterpart is breakout child star Hunter Pratt. The two distinct personalities nurture a rare and cherished bond that can be felt throughout the entire game.\nHumor & Gore: Rad Rodgers may appear to be an 'E for Everyone' game at first glance, but it's not. The explicit language, SFW adult themes, and the sometimes overkill action plants it firmly in the 'M for Mature' category (actual ESRB/PEGI/USK rating still pending).\nUnreal Engine 4: Powered by Epic's incredible Unreal Engine 4, we're able to put more details than ever before into Rad Rodgers.\nA Palette of Levels: You can't get bored with these levels -- each one has a completely new visual style with its own set of graphics, and music!\n  The vibrant living world of Rad Rodgers is steeped with mystery, revelation, and of course, perilous peril. Below are some examples of early concept art for the game that describes the kind of variety for which we've strived.\nClick to view the concept art.\n  There are a total of six unique environments planned for the first world of Rad Rodgers, but check out the Stretch Goals to find out where else we could take this!\n    Click to view the screenshots.\n    We'll just let Andrew speak for himself about the behind-the-scenes process that went into scoring Rad's retro tracks.\nNow just listen to his mind-meltingly mesmerizing sample tracks from the game!\n        Rad Rodgers will be releasing on PC and PlayStation 4. We'd love to include Xbox One, Mac and Linux by adding them to stretch goals later in the campaign.\nA Stretch Goal -- As a bonus we've drawn up plans for an extended 2nd screen experience called Dusty's Surfatron. Players will have the option to play a challenging mobile game which takes place entirely in the Pixelverse, where Dusty can earn you power-ups and weapons that you can transfer back into Rad Rodgers in real-time.\nIt's more than just a 2nd screen -- Dusty's Surfatron is an addicting, standalone endless runner, which will provide players who love these types of games an awesome extended experience.\nDusty's Surfatron will be developed by our great partners at Not Even Entertainment, and will not be required to fully experience Rad Rodgers, but is a fun expansion to the universe we'd really love to bring you guys!\n        Exclusive Artbook - You'll get the awesome physical artbook that includes a comic prologue as well as the level maps.\nBig Box - Get the rad-ass, retro Big Box Collector's Edition of the game containing all physical rewards.\nExclusive Backer T-Shirt - We'll send you an exclusive backer T-Shirt in the size of your choice.\nCartridge - This is a custom made Super Nintendo cartridge that has been converted to a USB drive that will hold a DRM free copy of the game for PC along with all other digital rewards.\nLimited Edition Figurine - You'll get an extremely limited figurine of Rad and Dusty.\nMouse Pad - Get a limited edition mouse pad.\nExtremely Rare Sealed Apogee/3D Realms game - You get a really rare, boxed and sealed Apogee / 3D Realms game from the 90's. \n  Interceptor Entertainment is an indie studio founded in 2011.\nWe're currently located in Aalborg, Denmark, but have Team Members from all around the world. Our first title was a re-boot of the legendary first person shooter, \"Rise of the Triad\". \nWe're a small and efficient team of both legacy- and new talents, and have more than 100 years of combined experience in the industry. \nWe made it our goal to bring back the golden age of the games we used to love as kids, with new and innovative game mechanics, beautiful sound and graphics, and interesting characters with attitude.\nOur team have worked on a range of titles ranging from indie to AAA - including League of Legends, Evolve, Halo 5, Duke Nukem 3D, Call of Duty Black Ops, Max Payne and Rise of the Triad\n  Meet the team behind Rad Rodgers below!\n  We've put a lot of work into Rad Rodgers to get it to where it is today, but we need the Kickstarter community to help us cross the finish line. There's still a lot of work to be done with finishing up our levels, polishing our weapons, voice acting, and of course, quality assurance.\nHere's how we intend to spend your hard-earned money:\nIt's super important that a precision platformer like Rad Rodgers *feels* just right. The controls must be tight and fluid, the puzzles intuitive, and the gameplay fun & challenging. A successful Kickstarter allows us to tighten the screws on every inch of this game.\nWe have a number of social media sites where you can follow Rad Rodgers.  \nFacebook: A good place to follow to have insight in the development of the game as well as future updates.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/radrodgers/ \nReddit: Join our official subreddit.

It is stored in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, Italy.\nSo why the old drawing? Why are we using Leonardo da Vinci? We wanted to make something that was fun and had a little history involved. Not so much you were worried about a pop quiz later, but enough that it might stick with you. Also, the game is about the math of the body in motion, the art of form and its relationship with the world around us.... And the guy you are trying to stick with a sword... We could not think of anybody we would rather pay homage to, the image is public domain, but we still want to pay attention and respect to one of the people that inspired us. Yes I know we said this last time, but the guy was seriously awesome, it is only honest to pay homage each time...\nThis is our third deck, we might be on to something\u2026\nWe are still very proud of the last successful Kickstarters, English Longsword & French Rapier. We are just a little gaming company run out of our house, but it is a real joy to share gaming ideas & creative geekery with all our fellow gamers out there. So thanks for letting us fulfill a dream! I will try to keep this short so we can get on with our lives, so here we go!\nWhat is different with the new deck?\nThe system is the same, the rules are the same, but the style of fighting with the Scottish Claymore is very different from other weapons. We know a guy, and he has been a martial artist with weapons like this for a few decades now. I have seen him fight in tournaments, he knows his stuff; we are proud to have him working with us. So the new deck beats the old decks, right? If you play it right. We have tested all decks in many variations; they all have the same chance to win. Again it\u2019s all how you figure out your opponent. Each deck has strengths and weaknesses. This is a really big sharp object, but it moves a little slower than the previous weapons. So more planning and a lot more hoping your opponent stands still.\nCan I mix the new deck with the old ones?\nThere are rules for carrying more than one weapon to the fight. It is very simple to switch weapons, but also very dangerous. Just like real dueling. That is something that will be easily explained in an update. Can you bring more than one weapon to a fight, and switch, yes. Can you use them at the SAME time, no. Well, not yet anyway. \nNew Artist!\nhttp://www.felixeddy.com\nOur previous artists were awesome, we just want to try to get a new artist for every deck if we can; so each one has it's own look for the illustrations. We found Miss Felix Eddy and we were very happy with her work. Check her stuff out! Better yet, get an original work of art by this amazing artist! We will have some really great options right here in this kickstarter! Miss Eddy will be rocking this deck with her amazing illustrations!\nNext Deck artist alert\nhttp://sukesha-ray.deviantart.com/\nWe are looking into the future for our Katana, Bo Staff and Empty Hand decks, so to give a taste of the possibilities, we had samples done for the companions of the future. Travelers from the east that have come early to aid those from other lands.\nNo model this year\u2026but we will have a  Soundtrack!\nFirst I want to say how much fun it was to work with such a lovely model as Roxana Hire. So much so still going to give her a boost. https://www.facebook.com/roxana.hire. She is still the best!\nWe want to keep our budget in line, so we went in a different direction. We have a new member of our creative team and she is a genius. She has given us a great price on composing music, so we are going with a Theme song for each noble and hero! If you pledge at the $50.00 or more pledge level you get a CD of the collection! Each theme will be about 2 minutes long and each Noble or Hero will get to input the kind of direction they wish theirs to go. We will post a link to a sample and her site for more.\nShe does not disappoint! This is a longer peace she did for me.  https://soundcloud.com/beckyp-1/bloodbriars-theme?utm_source=soundcloud&utm_campaign=share&utm_medium=facebook\nWhat are the new Hero cards and Companion cards?\nThe Status cards are still good from previous sets, but we are holding them back this set to keep costs down. We will still have some cards that you can play pickup games or adventures with. Heroes take the place of status cards when played as a single (like a Noble for those honored few). Companions can be played as an additional character to accompany a hero or status card in pickup games.\nAnd as usual an awesome playmat!\nBut wait there is MORE! We have been working hard on making as much as we can out of this game and we went so far as to create a VERY cool rule book. It is a great quality print and we will add this for FREE to any pledge of peasant and above!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are happy to say we have made a quality game each time and can repeat that again with confidence.

We're working on a graphic novel about a Deaf superheroine. We basically need your help with the print costs and hiring a BSL proof-reader to make sure our portrayal of her is accurate.\nIt's a good story. We think you'll like it:\nSo, we're in Edwardian London. Edward VII is on the throne and the British Empire is at its peak. \nIn this reality, superpowers and magic are very real, but most of the great and the good who are gifted with such talents probably aren't on your side. Particularly if you've got the guts to stand up to them.\nEmily, a curiously strong Deaf girl from Deptford docks, discovers this for herself on the day her mother is kidnapped by a pair of peculiarly talented, but thoroughly unsavoury socialites. Now it is up to her and her friends to save her mother from a destiny far darker than dying.\nThe story is going to be released in two parts. Right now we need help publishing part one. The first book (the one this Kickstarter is all about) is going to be roughly 48 pages long (possibly a bit longer as we're allowing a bit of wiggle room for story pacing at this stage), perfect bound with a soft cover. The artwork will be black and white throughout to reflect the dark and shadowy nature of Emily's world. \nWe're aiming to launch it in May of 2016 in association with the East End Women's Museum in London. We are planning a cool launch party with some interesting speakers. More on this as the project progresses.\nSarah is drawing the book right now so we will be able to show you her progress throughout the campaign. For now we've got some preview pages that should give you an idea of the look of the book: \nSo, yeah. Black and white. Atmospheric. Grim and spooky. Kind of Sin Cityish in aesthetic, but with an angry teenage girl instead of a generic grumpy old man as the central protagonist. \nEmily's got a really, really tough journey on her hands. We kind of feel bad for putting her through it, but we think it's going to be a brilliant read.\nFirst off, we could do with some help with our printing costs. Pretty straight forward stuff, really. Initial aim is to raise enough money for a print run of 500 books. If we get more orders or are really over funded we'll be printing a lot more :)\nWe also want to hire an editor to make sure the book is the best it can be. A fresh, professional pair of eyes would be really useful. We really want to hire another Sarah, Sarah Logan. She's a writer who works at Manchester University, improving accessibility for students. Her writing is really very good.\nFinally, and super important, the story is about a Deaf teenage girl. Howard is a fluent BSL user and Sarah was a teenage girl a while ago, but we're both hearing. With your help we want to pay a Deaf proof-reader/actor to go through the story and make sure Emily is grounded in more reality than we could manage on our own. It's going to be a big job for them and we want to pay properly rather than rely on favours.\nWe have some extra things we'd to do with the book now we are base-level funded:\n\u00a33000+ All book-level supporters also get a bookmark with the BSL alphabet for their reference. Yay!\n\u00a35000+ The book gets smart-looking end papers covered with useful signs for everyone to know.\n\u00a36000+ Fancy paper stock! We get to print the book on something that feels 'really nice' rather than just 'very nice'\n\u00a310,000+ Posh cover - Sarah gets to make a really, really nice-looking cover.\nHoward Hardiman is the writer behind Deeds Not Words. He has been self-publishing for about eight years and currently has a major exhibition on display on the Isle of Wight on Mythology. He has a couple of other books, The Lengths (Described as \"Beautiful and gritty\" by Out There Magazine) and Badger's Day Out (\"A charmingly ungraphic graphic adventure that understands the journey is the destination\" - Kieron Gillen), which are probably worth checking out (no, seriously. They are pretty good).\nSarah Gordon is the visual artist on this project. She has been self-publishing comics/working as an illustrator for about five years. Her latest book, Strip has just been short-listed for Best Comic of the Year at the 2015 British Comic Awards (\"a singular piece of art\" - Starburst Magazine). When she's not making comics, she can be found doing things like talking to scientists and making art reacting to their work or playing Dixit with her neighbours.\nThey are both humanoids who met whilst they were in college. They have been itching to do a proper project together for years. \nThey look like this when they're being serious adults:\nAnd like this when they think no one's looking:\nWe're going to get on with getting on with the book now.

As I am writing this campaign, the script has been finalised and I am currently filling my sketchbook with thumbnail layouts, rough pages and concept sketches of the Deeds Not Words world. This means as of writing, we don't have the completed book just yet.\n\nIf I keep to schedule then DNW part one should be finished comfortably by spring next year. We have about six months to final proposed deadline, which should give us plenty of time to make edits and revisions before the book goes to the printers. \n\nThere is always a chance that there will be a minor delay at the printing stage of the book if proofs aren't as perfect as we'd like. If the project needs a bit of extra time we'll take it there, but turnaround with these things is usually pretty quick so any hold ups shouldn't be too lengthy.\n\nIf all goes according to plan then the aim is to get advance copies of the book to people by the end of April.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "A present for you, and news about a new book!", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nHope you've all had a pleasant August and September is treating you well so far. \nBy now, you should all have received your books and Kickstarter rewards.

That Drought Ends TODAY with\u2026\nWe\u2019re blasting Descent into the 21st Century with current-generation gaming technology.\nDescent: Underground is a both a prequel to the Descent series and a modernization of the original game play.

As a hotshot pilot, you are the difference between life and death for countless millions. Only your dog fighting skills and teamwork can master the hazardous terrain, using it against your foes to gain the upper hand in uncontrolled space.\nThe Underground\nThe people of Earth watch from afar as opposing forces race to gather the materials that will keep them alive. The struggle for resources is the newest sport \u2013 a source of hope and a shared effort championed by larger-than-life heroes. As one of those pilots, your life depends on your contribution, your reputation, and your value to your sponsors back home.\nDescent: Underground provides all of the different play experiences that players loved in the original titles while adding new elements that take the experience even further. Tunnel through walls to outflank the enemy, discover hidden pockets of rare and valuable resources, set traps to ensnare enemy ships, and work as a team to accomplish your goals. Keep an eagle eye out for power-ups throughout the map, and uncover more by mining the walls. Collect resources to save the earth, fund your team, and make your name in the Underground.\nSingle-player Campaign  \nEnjoy the puzzle-solving single-player experience of the original Descent games. Descent: Underground's initial release will include an engaging single-player campaign that serves as a prologue to the full game. \nDesign Underground discusses Single player\nCooperative  \nJoin your friends to conquer the single-player maps and to accomplish bonus goals that require teamwork.\nMultiplayer Mayhem\nPit your skills against other pilots as you battle for critical resources in the asteroids. Fly alongside allies of your corporation, and crush competing corporations into bankruptcy, or play as a free-lance pilot available to the highest bidder.\nMatch Types\nMatches can include multiple teams of up to sixteen players each. Each game mode will have team goals and configurable parameters, such as mission timers, stock ships only, or limited ship types.\nAnarchy \u2013 Classic Descent combat where your only goal is to crush your opponents. Choose 1 vs 1, team matches, or free-for-all.\nCapture the Asteroid \u2013 Secure and defend strategic beacons in the map.\nCorporate War \u2013 Mine resources and ferry them to your harvester. The first team to reach their mining quota wins.\nMining for Minerals \u2013 Find and mine a special resource and return it to your harvester. But watch out! If you drop the \u201cball,\u201d your enemy will swoop in and snatch it away.\nAnd many more!\nMap Types\nLevels come in a myriad of types.\n\nMature Mine - This asteroid is riddled with tunnels and has already been heavily mined. You\u2019ll find plenty of space for pitched battles.\nMolten Core - A newer mine, this map offers a lot of opportunities for miners and explorers. Watch for the lava at the center, though \u2013 digging in the wrong place could be disastrous!\nThe Ice Cave - This frozen ball of rock is rich in resources, but glittering ice makes for tricky navigation.\nAbandoned Base - This station was built to house a now-defunct corporation. This map is built for classic Descent battles and single-player exploration.\nAnd that\u2019s just a few. Not to mention you can create your own maps too!\n\nLadders and Leader Boards  \n\nCompete to be the best at each individual role, or become the highest-ranked combat pilot around. Sanctioned matches will use individual skill as part of the matchmaking process, and all of them contribute to your ranking as a pilot.  \n\nDescendent Studios will host regularly-scheduled tournaments, often with specific rule sets, to pit the best pilots against one another for prizes and bragging rights. Create your own corporation with friends. Rally together and fight as a team. A corporation can craft a logo, company name, and a team color scheme for their ships. \n\nShips, Customization, and Tech Trees\nThe majority of the Descent: Underground game packages start with the Wasp. Some pledge tiers begin with additional ships. All ships can be earned through game play.\nEach ship in Descent: Underground has a specialization so pilots can work together to accomplish their mission objectives.\nAUGER \u2013 the mining expert, able to bore through walls to find valuable resources, hidden tunnels and chambers, and rare power-ups.\nGOLIATH \u2013 a massive cargo ship with the most storage capacity, the Goliath is a beast that will maximize your haul.\nPANZER \u2013 a sturdy tank that can take punishment and dish it out, the Panzer is designed to get in and slug it out nose-to-nose.\nPREDATOR \u2013 a small, light craft that is fast and maneuverable. It acts as your team\u2019s advance scout, mapping the terrain ahead and spotting enemies.\nSHAMAN \u2013 a sturdy repair ship, able to stay at the front lines and keep all of your drones in the action.\nTORCH \u2013 the maneuverable light combat specialist. It doesn\u2019t pack quite the same punch as the Typhoon, but it is a good all-around combat craft with strong defensive and maneuvering capability.\nTYPHOON \u2013 a tri-winged heavy assault craft that trades defensive strength for firepower. The Typhoon is the point of the spear.\nWARLOCK \u2013 your technical specialist \u2013 able to thwart enemy plans, augment teammates, lay and defuse traps, and circumvent locked doors.\nWASP \u2013 a well-rounded craft balanced in all roles.\nShips can be customized for the look you want. Interchangeable noses, tails, wings, paint schemes, and decals make your craft one of a kind so your foes know who is taking them down. Or choose a scheme to fit your team.  \n\nUse the company scrip that you earn in matches to advance your ships along the tech trees. These trees augment the performance of your ship by enhancing existing abilities or adding new ones. Just remember that when you\u2019re deep in the mines, all of your enhancements can be dropped as power-ups for other players if you are destroyed. (Don't worry - you'll get them back in later matches.)\nWe love sharing with our backers and sharing what our backers share with us. \nMODDERS Welcome: We are designing and building this game to allow maximum community collaboration. Backers will be able to build their own maps, ships, logos, and weapons. Build something cool, submit it, and we may introduce it into the greater universe \u2013 become a developer yourself.\nWe're amping up the communication all the way to 11 (because 10 is not enough).\nYou've seen us do it before and we\u2019re doing it again. Michael Morlan and Eric Peterson set a new standard for reaching out to the community with \u201cWingman\u2019s Hangar\u201d and \u201cGalactic Inquiry.\u201d Look for a new show for Descent: Underground. Also expect behind-the-scenes videos, blogs, peeks into design meetings, and fun side-channel streams.\nThere has been a lot of interest in a Descent reboot and we\u2019ve been building a community ready to back such a project. Kickstarter is how we test the commitment of the fans and how we attract beyond that core community. \nThis genre of game has been neglected by traditional publishers. With the advent of online, digital distribution and crowd funding, we can surpass those publishers mired in repetitive releases and confined to only safe sequels.\nERIC \"WINGMAN\" PETERSON\nWing Commander 4, Starlancer, Conquest: Frontier Wars, Star Citizen \nEric has been making video games since 1984. He has been a founder of several successful game companies, and most recently was President of Production on Star Citizen. His passion for making AAA space games is known throughout the industry. He is very much involved in every aspect of game development from design, to production to team building, he can do it all. Eric believes strongly in community involvement, and is a pioneer in changing the way companies communicate with their communities. He is looking forward to making Descendent Studios, Inc, the leader in community involvement, and of course making a kick arse game called Descent: Underground!\nJASON \"STORMWIND\" SPANGLER\nStar Wars: The Old Republic, Star Citizen, Star Trek: Klingon Academy, Ultima Online and many expansions \nJason has served as chief technical officer (CTO), technical director, lead programmer, and programmer for a variety of studios and projects. He has also spoken at game development conferences in the United States and Japan, focusing on online game development, software quality, and software engineering practices. Before entering the games industry, Jason was a fan of space, RPG, sandbox, and simulation games. He even had a poem dedicated to Wing Commander and other Origin games published in Computer Gaming World as a winning entry in a game poetry contest.\nROB \"DESIGNOPOTAMUS\" IRVING\nWing Commander, Jane's AH-64D Longbow, Ultima Online: Renaissance, Star Citizen\nRob has been wandering around games since 1992, and they've pretty much all featured online play, combat, space, or all of the above. Over the years, he's served as a designer, writer, producer, programmer, and everything in between, but design has always been where his heart lies. Rob will be aiming for one word: FUN for Descent: Underground.\nSERGIO ROSAS - ART DIRECTOR\nConquest: Frontier Wars, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Thief: Deadly Shadows, Star Citizen\nSergio is an experienced video game industry art director with twenty years experience in graphic design including UI Design, 3D modeling, concept art, animation and video production, project management, outsource training and management, and international business development. Sergio has created visuals for companies including Electronic Arts, Johnson and Johnson, HEB, Konami, Capcom, Zynga, Blizzard, Ion Storm, Cloud Imperium,  Human Code, and Origin Systems.\nTODD \"TOAD\" BAILEY\nUltima Online: Renaissance, Star Wars: Galaxies, Richard Garriott's Tabula Rasa, Gods & Heroes: Rome Rising \nTodd started his career in the game industry in 1994, working on titles such as System Shock, Ultima Online, Star Wars: Galaxies, Tabula Rasa, and most recently, Star Citizen. Todd is a game designer, dungeon master, tabletop RPG player and has self published two fantasy fiction novels. He'll be bringing his creative efforts to making Descent: Underworld an awesome gaming experience.\nPHIL \"BLUEDOG\" TITTLE\nGods and Heroes, Deadly Creatures, Multiple WWE titles, Star Citizen\nPhil has served as Project Manager, Producer, and Sr. Producer on a variety of game projects and with companies such as Origin-EA, THQ, Heatwave, and CIG. Prior to entering the game industry, Phil was a programmer, systems architect and project manager in the telecom industry. He has earned his PMP and CSM credentials. Phil's love of MMOs (EQ and Meridian 59) drove him to leave the somewhat stodgy world of telecom systems development to join Origin Studios and the UXO project. He'll be bringing his breadth of development and management experience to Descent: Underground.\nMICHAEL \"VIEWMASTER\" MORLAN\nCrusader: No Remorse, Ultima IX: Ascension, Ultima Online and several extensions, Star Citizen\nMichael started in the game industry as an artist, writer, and director of cinematics. Bridging the divide between left and right hemispheres, he also designed and coded the Ultima IX particle and magic effects system as well as wrote/directed/edited all the cinematics for that project. After art directing Ultima Online: Third Dawn, Michael joined Eric at Fever Pitch Studios then moved on to a full-time, freelance career as a cinematographer. He returned to game development with the successful funding of Star Citizen and produced \u201cWingman\u2019s Hangar\u201d as well as dozens of behind-the-scene programs. He\u2019ll be bringing that experience to the community outreach programming for Descent: Underground.\nDESCENT is a registered trademark or trademark of Interplay Entertainment Corp. in the U.S. and other countries, and is used under license.

There\u2019s a lot that can go wrong between funding and delivery of the game we\u2019re promising. We could run dry on funds, lose key people, mistake our original goals, and/or just not deliver the level of quality we imagined.\n\nFrom Scratch?\n\nWell, okay, not quite from scratch. We\u2019re starting with Unreal Engine 4 as our off-the-shelf platform, a team experienced with integrating multiple front-end and back-end subsystems, and a creative group with the vision to deliver top-flight game design and artwork.\n\nFunds\n\nOur challenge, here, is to assure we properly scope both the project and ongoing revenues, and manage it well throughout the development. Eric Peterson is a multi-successful producer with a penchant for negotiating great deals and motivating his team through inspiration and example. Our project manager, Phil Tittle, is focused on preventing runaway costs and assuring we hit milestones. Our CTO, Jason Spangler, will guide us in making good technological decisions, allowing us to stay focused on getting the game done in an efficient manner.\n\nPersonnel Churn\n\nDescendent Studios is a small team of very key people. Fortunately, we\u2019re incredibly dedicated to reviving the Descent 6DoF genre and are really excited to see this through. That, along with a tightly scheduled development cycle to deliver our alpha and gold master releases, should decrease our risk of losing a vital person.\n\nProper Scope\n\nOur biggest challenge is not overestimating what we can do with the funds, time, and team we\u2019ve planned for the game\u2019s development. Fortunately, our key people have all been responsible for delivering several successful game projects including Starlancer, Gods and Heros: Rome Rising, Ultima Online: Third Dawn, and Conquest: Frontier Wars. We\u2019ll be applying all our experience and craft to delivering Descent: Underground on time and within budget.\n\nQuality Experience\n\nWe really want to play this game. We really do. Anything less than what we promise is unacceptable.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nIn the end, we depend on our backers and tight-knit community to watch and respond as we dive into one more game project.

Our aim is to create the most affordable VR experience while not compromising on quality.\nUnlike headsets based on the Google cardboard, VISR is made from low cost laminated corrugate with high durability that is powered by your smartphone. We think this is the best way to sink your teeth into VR without spending a fortune.\nVISR is super simple to use as it comes fully assembled. It only takes two steps to get you from opening your VISR to experiencing virtual reality.\nFirstly, you need to find and load up a virtual reality game, movie or application. There is already a huge amount of content available out there, with more being produced every day.\nAfter you have your app loaded up, just slip your phone in to the VISR magazine and then into the top of the device. After that you are ready to go! Strap in and immerse yourself in fantastic virtual worlds. \nVISR has been called \"the most exciting and disruptive piece of hardware\" to enter the VR gaming market by Andrew McCartney, CEO of Microsoft Ventures and seen at:\nChris Deering, former president of Sony Europe said that  \"VISR is the sensible way for millions of consumers with selected smart phones to experience quality VR at an affordable price. The VISR design features comfort and durable wearability, yet the cost is low enough to warrant replacement on the same time cycle as one's smart phone. VISR is a brilliant concept\" \nIf we reach our base funding goal, we will be able to start producing VISR on a large scale with a high level of quality. Exceeding that will allow us to spend more time making the VISR experience as amazing as it can be for everyone involved.\nOur first stretch goal is for \u00a360,000. Reaching this will allow us to spend time polishing up all of the tech demos that we have been creating for VISR and to release them all for free! These will be put up on our website regardless, but we'd love to refine them and release them as full games.\nVISR Games\nOur second stretch goal is for \u00a3100,000. We are really excited about this idea, if we reach this target we will create a special game for the VISR. This game will be designed entirely by the VISR community! We will listen to your ideas, take polls and come up with something completely unique. This game will of course be released completely free to everyone in the community and you will get to play your own creation!\nThe VISR team itching to make some games\nFinally, as a big stretch goal, \u00a3200,000. If we reach this final goal we will develop an app for all platforms that will allow you to stream directly from your PC to your device. This will let you play games or stream media on your computer straight to your VISR headset. This would mean that your phone would no longer be the bottleneck for performance and you could experience a much wider variety of content!\nWe have been developing games and apps for the VISR for the last few months and it is surprisingly easy. If you are a developer and you don't fancy sitting on a 6 month waiting list as well as shelling out \u00a3200+ for a high end VR kit then VISR is the perfect way to get into the VR space.\nAnything you develop for the VISR only needs to run on a smartphone so it's as easy as creating a mobile app there will even be a pre-built Unity package released to allow developers to plug in and start playing. We are also super interested in everyone who is creating virtual reality applications, so we will publicise anything you make for free! Just get in contact with us.\nWe want you to be a part of the VISR community. We think that we have developed something exciting that will help everyone to experience virtual reality, but we need your feedback! Help us make VISR amazing. \nWe've worked super hard creating VISR, lets make it a (non-virtual) reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the beginning of this project we have been working with a world class cardboard manufacturer, Garthwest Ltd (www.garthwest.com). Our concerns in relation to the production of this device are very minimal but we are of course keeping a close eye on it all.\n\nThe best thing about the VISR is that the core of the product is your own phone. That raises a separate issue: everyone has a different phone and they are all different sizes; we are doing research to determine which phones are most popular now and which will be most popular in the future. The best thing for this however would be to get feedback from you guys!

Beautifully crafted.\"\nKosmos concept art by Col Price\nMy Vision for Kosmos\nAlthough \u2018Kosmos\u2019 begins with an intimate human story, the world I\u2019ve designed for Kosmos is vast. This gives us a lot of room to expand into. If we do our job well and the show proves popular, the story can keep expanding beyond, into the bigger universe I have waiting for you.\nWithout any industry interference, there\u2019s an opportunity for us - me, the cast, the crew and YOU - to create a show limited only by our imagination. You are invited to get involved so that together we can explore the Kosmos!\nWhat Next?\nKosmos is a web series of 6 x 15 minute episodes. We have the script. The cast is mostly in place and we are all set to shoot next February. But we need a small amount of funds to be able to pay the actors and crew, plus other expenses.\nYou can get involved and help us get this made. If this sounds like an exciting project to you, take look at the rewards on offer and see if there\u2019s a level at which you wish to take part.\nThis campaign is all or nothing. If we don't reach the goal by December 18th, we get nothing and the show will not go ahead.\nThe Cast So Far...\nThanks to the magnificent work of casting director Andrew Fawn, we have an incredible line up of talent for the show. \nWe are still casting for a few of the roles, but already we have an amazing line up of talented actors, including Jeff Dahlgren, who starred in Laurent Boutonnat's Giorgino, which has since gained cult status, and Virginia Hey, who has featured in scifi TV show Farscape, Mad Max 2 and Bond movie The Living Daylights.\nThe cast so far...\nThe Crew\nSimon Horrocks (writer/director/producer)\nSimon wrote, directed and produced his debut \"mind-bending\" feature Third Contact for \u00a34000, without a professional, shooting it himself on a consumer camcorder. The film was selected for the prestigious Hofer Filmtage in Germany before it's \"global premiere\" at the BFI IMAX, last Sept.\nYana Georgieva (producer)\nYana has worked in various television programs in production, film distribution as well as producing and directing multiple short films. Sleeping Dogs is the first feature film Yana produced, which received nominations from the British Independent Film Awards and was part of several international Film Festivals as well as the Raindance Film Festival.\nMike Myshko\nMike gained a 1st class BSc in Broadcast & Film Technology in 2003 and has since worked behind the scenes on indie shorts and features including 'The Liability' starring Tim Roth and Jack O'Connel, as well as post supervising roles on 'Bypass' dir. Dwayne Hopkins and 'Light Years' dir. Esther Campbell. He also does photographic, design and digital work for major brands, creatives and acclaimed artists like Alexa Meade, Reg Gadney and Motoko Ishibashi.\nMarcus Markou\nMarcus is the writer and director of British feature film Papadopoulos & Sons which was completed in 2012. The film was self-distributed by Marcus Markou and went so far as beating blockbuster G.I. Joe: Retaliation during its opening week in London. This success places the film among the Top 5 self-distributed UK films in the past 15 years. It led Marcus Markou to become a speaker about the subject of self-distribution such as a Masterclass at the London Breakfast Club and a lecture at BECTU's Freelancers' Fair in 2014 about \"new opportunities for distribution\". The film is a subject of case studies, such as the book Selling Your Film Outside the U.S.\nVideo FX by\nKosmos Backer Only t-shirt\nWe Will Deliver\nIn the last 18 months, myself and a few of the team have been involved in several crowdfunding campaigns. Firstly, for cinema distribution of Third Contact. More recently, to set up a film festival to help talented new filmmakers get exposure.\nAlthough there are risks involved in backing a crowdfunding campaign, you can see that we have a great track record when it comes to delivering our promises.\nThe feedback from last year\u2019s BFI IMAX Global Premiere was a great reward for the hard work which went into making the film and screening it at one of the world\u2019s most prestigious cinemas.\nThis has inspired me to involve you once again in creating something unique and memorable.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe job of making films always contains a certain amount of risk, no matter how much your budget. There have been epic failures at all levels of the film industry, a few involving some of the legends of cinema. Nobody can be a 100% certain of success.\n\nOnce the funds are in place, we hope to be filming by early to mid February. Most of the locations are interior, which means we will not be too vulnerable to the elements. We will have production insurance, contingency plans, and an experienced production team with a proven track record.\n\nOnce filming is over, we will try to get the first episode ready for viewing as soon as possible, aiming for March or early April.\n\nRewards will be delivered as close to our estimated time as we can manage, but remember you must also make sure to provide us with all the details we need by the deadline set. If you don\u2019t give us your t-shirt size until after we have ordered them, for example, it can be difficult to get that reward to you.

Like many of you, we too were shattered when our beloved City of Heroes was taken away. But now is our time to rebuild. Our time has come to rise up, and build a stronger foundation against the forces of evil, or a more menacing threat to world order. Help us make City of Heroes one of the only games in history to launch several successful spiritual successors. Be the part of our story that says indie developers can, instead of indie developers can't. We can make a successful superhero MMO, standing on the shoulders of the giants, but we need your help to go all the way!\nIn 2049, the villainous superhuman organization known as Leviathan first revealed itself to the world. As their armies marched forth, countless cities were ravaged and countries torn asunder. Never before had the world witnessed the horrific might wrought by super-powered beings. Fortunately there were those willing to oppose the terror, and assist the armies of the world in this battle. Heroes arose to fight evil, to protect their people, their cities, their world. Leviathan was driven back and the world began to rebuild in a new era of peace.\nOn the west coast of the United States, the city of San Cielo was devastated by the double hammer blows of war and earthquake. Its citizens could easily have abandoned the ravaged city to seek out new homes, but instead they chose to rebuild, to see their city once again reach to the sky and serve as a beacon of hope.\nNow, at the end of the Twenty First Century, San Cielo faces new challenges, her citizens caught in the immortal struggle between morality and villainy. On one side, the forces of Valor, led by the legendary Paramount, fight to protect the city from rapidly strengthening gangs, rising crime and other unknown evil forces. Meanwhile, the mysterious Magistor directs a resurgent Leviathan, intent on reshaping the world into his vision.\nLooming above it all is The Trinity, a group of megacorporations that have introduced world-altering scientific and technological breakthroughs. Thanks to their efforts, ordinary people can now be born with, or acquire, superhuman powers, or use advanced technology to achieve the same effects. As humanity\u2019s abilities grow, The Trinity reaps massive profits.\nCurrently we have a working pre-alpha version of Valiance up and running. It\u2019s been a labor of love for the team over the past year, but with your help it could be so much more! Right now we have a group of passionate gamers building VO, all of whom have volunteered their time and creative energies in the belief that together we can create a new superhero MMORPG for everyone to enjoy.\nWe are nowhere near finished bringing our vision to life. We will be adding many features to enhance the Valiance experience, such as:\n\n- An evolving game world tied to character choices.\n- An open world environment with continuous no-loading between zones.\n- Semi-Freeform character build options\n- A choice through action system for character alignment- Player run stores and a decentralized market system.\n- Additional travel powers including fan favorites like swinging, acrobatics and flash stepping.\n- Powers customization options\n- A flexible and customizable UI\n- Multitudes of costume choices\n- Over 25 zones planned, ranging from futuristic city, to island fortress, to Atlantis, to subterranean maze, and all the way into space.\n- Player created content\nWe are gamers, just like yourself, who know and love games. How can we say this? Our talent pool consists of former members of such companies as Zenimax, Origin Systems Inc, Turbine, Image Comics, Bethesda Softworks, FASA, Ubisoft, Hewlett Packard, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Sony, IBM, Cryptic, Disney, Adult Swim, Coca-Cola, GSN, and yes, even NASA. Our writers have many decades of experience between them, and multiple degrees. Our sound and music department has credits that include The Last of Us: The Fireflies, and the recently produced Nightwing web series. We have access to MMO and server technology that has been 8 years in development and combined we have decades of experience in designing, building, running and playing games. We are volunteers, but make no mistake, we are not amateurs. We were brought together not only by the loss of our beloved City of Heroes, but by a common goal: not simply to resurrect a lost game with cheap cut and paste tactics, but instead to give you what you deserve: a game that will honor the memory of what was lost, while living up to the promise of what our City could have been if given time.\nNow, you may be wondering \u201cIf you\u2019re such heavyweights, why are you on Kickstarter?\u201d The simple answer is because, on average, it costs most companies $10 million to develop an MMO from conception to launch. We\u2019ve made it halfway into production with $3,700, and a tremendous amount of time, patience and effort from everyone involved. Unfortunately, we\u2019re reaching the end of what we can do on such a miniscule budget, so now we need your help.\nThe short answer is, if it\u2019s part of game development, these funds will help pay for it. Specifically, we need to pay for servers so that you all have a place to play. We need to hire a dedicated team of programmers, artists, animators and modelers to create the world you\u2019ll belong to. We need to license software in order for the team to build the world and upgrade hardware so we can push our creation further.

Nice combination of \"try to do what you can on your own\" and \"try to work with others despite limited communication\", with the latter yielding better results when you pull it off. The time-pressure and limited communication mean the Usual Co-op Problem (of the best player telling others what to do) simply does not manifest; even if the Communications Satellite is out there's no time for that sort of nonsense.\" - R. Eric Reuss, Massachusetts, USA (BoardGameGeek)\n \"If you like real-time games (and you know I do), here\u2019s a quick one\u2014each game of Meteor lasts 5 minutes or less. There\u2019s a swarm of meteors headed toward Earth, and you have to cooperate with others to build and launch rockets to shoot them down. One of the trickiest parts of this game is that you can\u2019t talk to each other. Well, there\u2019s a technology card, the communications array, that lets you start talking, but until then everything is done with gestures and raised eyebrows. Even when you can start talking, it can be a pretty tricky game to beat.\" -GeekDad.com\n\"Meteor is a time-limited cooperative game for up to 5 players. The game starts with a set of meteor cards in the center of the board and players are given only five minutes to destroy them all. Players play rocket cards and then power them with one or more types of three resources so that they can be launched at and destroy the displayed meteors.\nIn addition to rockets there are some special ability cards. Some important ones even allow players to start discussion options among themselves. Yes, at the game start players aren\u2019t even allowed to talk. Each game uses a small set out of a large number of meteors, most with special abilities, giving the game plenty of variability.\" -Matt Carlson (OpinionatedGamers.com)\n\"Meteor is...a Blast for me (OK, I could have said Meteor...Rocks! or Meteor...is Rock Solid or Meteor is...Out of this World). It's a fun Coop filler game that plays in 5 minutes and is easy to teach. As far as I know this is the only coop game that is also filler. I love the constant tension during the game, the simultaneous player action and the interaction between players.\" -Gabriel Ouimet, Ottawa, Canada (BoardGameGeek.com)\n Set Up:\n1.Shuffle the Small Meteor cards, the Medium Meteor cards, and the double-sided 6 and 7 Meteor cards together. This creates the Meteor deck.\n2.Create the Meteor Field by dealing out the number of Meteor Cards according to the number of players.  Place the cards face down in the center of the play area. Spread them out so that each Meteor Card be seen by all players.\n3.Place the Altitude Zone Cards in descending order (5 on top, 1 on the bottom) in one stack near the Meteor Field.\n4.Place five Sand Timers near the Altitude Zone Cards. Make sure Sand Timers are ready for play.\n5.Shuffle all the Resource Cards together to create the Resource Deck. Give each player the number of Resource Cards according to the number of players shown on the Set-Up Chart below.\n6.Choose one player to be the Timekeeper, ideally the player most familiar with the game. \nTimekeeper: The Timekeeper is the player that keeps the game moving forward by performing Altitude Zone Changes and ensuring that a sand timer is always active during game play. When a sand timer runs out, the Timekeeper needs to Change Altitude Zones as follows:\nChange Altitude Zones:\n1.Remove the active Sand Timer from the game.\n2.Remove the top Altitude Zone Card from the game.\n3.Start a new Sand Timer for the new Altitude Zone.\n4.Each player draws new Resource Cards according to number of players.\nMeteor Size: At the beginning of the game, the Meteor cards are placed face down. The back of the Meteor card provides an approximate size, so you have a general idea how big the Meteor is but you do not know the exact size until the Meteor Card is revealed. The exact size of the Meteor indicates how much damage the Rocket needs to inflict in order to destroy the Meteor.\nIf the Meteor Card is face down when you launch a Rocket, flip the Meteor Card over to reveal the exact size of the Meteor. Leave the Meteor Card face up for the remainder of the game.\nThere are three different ways a Rocket will interact with a Meteor:\n1.If the damage of the launched Rocket EQUALS the exact size of the Meteor, the Meteor is destroyed. Place the launched Rocket in the discard pile and remove the destroyed Meteor from the game.\n2.If the damage of the launched Rocket is LESS than the exact size of the Meteor, the launched Rocket has no effect and is placed in the discard pile. The Meteor is unharmed and stays in the Meteor Field.\n3.If the damage of the launched Rocket is GREATER than the exact size of the Meteor, the Meteor is destroyed. Place the launched Rocket in the discard pile and remove the destroyed Meteor from the game. Note that the player just caused an Overkill.\nThere are some Meteors that have unique Traits. The Meteor Traits may affect how a Rocket interacts with a Meteor.\nOverkill: Overkill is a big explosion caused by an overpowered Rocket. This big explosion blasts the remaining Meteors one Altitude Zone closer to earth. The Timekeeper Changes Altitude Zones immediately. If an Overkill occurs in Altitude Zone 1, the remaining Meteors are blasted into earth and players lose the game. If the players Overkill the only remaining Meteor in Altitude Zone 1, the players win the game because the Overkill destroyed the Meteor.\nMultiple Overkills: It is possible that the players can work together to destroy more than one Meteor at the same time. If this happens and more than one Rocket creates an Overkill, then you are still blasted forward only one Altitude Zone. Overkill does not stack. If the players manage to destroy all the remaining Meteors at the same time, they win the game even if it would have caused multiple amounts of Overkill.\nGame End: The game ends when one of the following happens:\n1.The Meteors are at Altitude Zone 1, the Sand Timer has run out and the last Meteor has not been destroyed. The meteors smash into the Earth and the players lose.\n2.The players destroy ALL the Meteors and win by saving the Earth.\n3.The players Overkill a Meteor in Altitude Zone 1 and it is not the last Meteor. The Meteors blast into the Earth and the players lose.\n Mike Young: Designer & President of MDC\nMike has designed many games and expansions over the years, but this is his first time working with our Mayday Games Team.

What can I get as rewards?\nYou can get puzzles, or posters, or books. Or combinations of all of the above!\nWhat if I don\u2019t like puzzles?\nPuzzles are a Rorschach test. So maybe...maybe you don't like YOURSELF? Just saying!\nHey are you the guy who did that Machine of Death Kickstarter?\nYup! And it turned out super great. You can buy our game, or check out more information and videos about it, here: machineofdeath.net/gca\nCheck out these different types of rewards!\nThere are three puzzle designs available, and I am also offering my existing six posters and seven books. \nEach puzzle is 1000 pieces and approx. 19 x 26\". Each puzzle also comes in a BOX. \nThe posters, which are not puzzles, are each 16 x 20\".\nYou can get any single puzzle, poster, or book;\nOr, multiples and combinations of the same items. The tiers should be pretty self-explanatory. \nAt the top of the rewards list, \u201cUPDATES ONLY\u201d is in case you just want to keep in touch and hear from me periodically! You won't get anything in the mail or anything except MY FRIENDSHIP insofar as it can be communicated via Kickstarter updates.\nI've also partnered with master puzzlemaker Chris Yates to offer a limited number of special hand-cut wooden puzzles! Scroll down a little for more info about that.\nWay down at the bottom, the SPECIAL and MADNESS rewards are for people with more money than sense. I hope you don't pick them, but if you do, I've made it worth my while so go nuts.\nHere are the three puzzles I am hoping to make in this campaign! \n(Click any image for a closer look)\n         The three designs above AND these three below are available as POSTERS:\n         (P.S. you can reblog most of these posters here if you like)\nAnd here are the BOOKS available!

Feel free to add as many instances as you like \u2013 we will ask you later which designs or titles specifically to send you.\nThe weird penny amounts are so we can easily track which add-ons you've ordered!

(e.g. 2 add-ons = $18 extra.)

For years and years he's been making puzzles by hand using a scroll saw.

Note: For the 12x15\" and 16x20\" puzzles, the tier gets you the custom puzzle only. If you want books, posters, or other puzzles, they must be added on separately in the manner detailed above. And I encourage you to do so!\nAs always, if you have any questions, please message me on KS or ask me on Twitter (@malki) before you pledge!\nWe're so excited to have fully funded!! If we make it to these additional amounts, I'm pleased to announce these two stretch goals:\nIf we reach 150% funding (17,266.50):\nI will work with Feral Cat to create an Official Feral Cat Sound Pack for you to download as ringtones, text alerts, etc.! Check out the video above for a brief example of what that might sound like.\nIf we reach 200% funding (23,022):\nI will enclose, with every puzzle shipped, a single blank Emergency Replacement Puzzle Piece so that your puzzle may still be usable even if a piece is lost! (Assuming you lose the same shape piece as the replacement you receive.) These pieces will be blank, so you can easily draw on the missing artwork. \nThis is a service I have seen NO OTHER PUZZLE OFFER in the HISTORY OF MY LIFE, so I'm very pleased to announce that this offer is EXCLUSIVE to the Wondermark Jigsaw Puzzle Campaign.\nIf the campaign is successful, we expect the puzzles will arrive from the factory and begin shipping by March 2015. Poster-only and book-only tiers will ship earlier (before the end of 2014).\nInternational orders will ship via U.S. Postal Service, with customs documents specifying the contents as a Kickstarter Reward. \nAfter the Machine of Death campaign, I reviewed our shipping procedures to make sure we avoid as many predictable problems as possible.\nHowever: if you live in Brazil, Greece, Italy, Russia, or Eastern Europe, please assume that at least 30% of your local postal employees are bridge trolls in disguise with insatiable appetites for packages, and guard your livestock accordingly. In general, we cannot be responsible for any local charges incurred on delivery. If you live in Argentina, check your customs rules to see if puzzles can even be imported successfully.\nActual photo of a postal carrier.

This time around I'm trying to make it a deliberately simpler campaign, and if issues do arise, they will surely be smaller in scale than the ones we managed to solve before.\n\nBecause the puzzles will be printed in Asia, ocean travel and customs will be one point of concern. This could cause unforeseen delays. The boat might sink. Weirder things have happened, some of them to me. There is still a wizard on the loose out there somewhere.\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I have deliberately placed my expected delivery date far in the future, so I won't have to fight the busy holiday ocean-freight season.\n \nOur manufacturer is a very well-known puzzle printer and the samples and proofs we have reviewed have been well within our exacting standards. So that's good news! The only other rewards, posters and books, are either already in hand, or can easily be reordered.\n\nWith my last project, backers in some countries were charged extra duties or taxes when their package arrived, or they had their shipments refused or returned for various reasons. With respect to those issues that we have identified the causes of, we will absolutely do things differently this time. Still, international shipping is always somewhat risky, so there may be delivery problems we cannot yet anticipate. If they arise, we are on call to help backers through any difficulty, and we offer one free reship for any package returned to us.\n\nI have a European distributor on standby to potentially handle fulfillment for puzzle orders shipping to the EU. Whether this will be viable or not will entirely depend on order volume \u2013 it's possible it won't make economic sense. In any case, it wouldn't save postage costs for me or backers, but it would allow EU backers to avoid paying VAT (I'll pay it on the bulk shipment, instead) and it would increase the delivery speed and reliability of EU orders. \n\nIf we go that route, we might encounter delays or errors due to the process of transferring backer information to them. Because they would be doing the EU puzzle shipping, their workflows would not be overseen by me personally. I have faith in them, but it is indeed somewhat of a risk...and a challenge.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "NOW FUNDING: A new Wondermark book collection!", "update_content": "Hello again, puzzle backers!

Perfect for beginners and experts alike, just plug in the printer, download or create models, hit print, and watch your custom creations form right before your eyes.\nThe Micro is Designed For Everyone\nBring your ideas to life, turn them into businesses, educate, learn, personalize products, make toys, make jewelry, start a curriculum, run a modern workshop, and unleash your creativity.  The power of creation is yours!\nA Fantastic 3D Printing Experience\nWe've built The Micro with reliability, consistency, and accessibility in mind.  Micro Motion Technology is a sensor and feedback system built into the print head, providing auto-leveling and auto-calibration.  This means that every time you run the printer it works, even after thousands of hours of use! The Micro is not only a useful tool, it makes 3D printing an enjoyable experience for the every-day person.\nMaterial & Filament options\nYou can use PLA or ABS, as well as our Micro filament spools or standard 1.75 mm filament spools available on the market.  \nWhat's the difference?  We made Micro filament spools so that people can print with more materials and colors, by adding $12 to their pledge amount per spool.  These spools fit inside The Micro, allowing it to be portable and seamless.  They weigh nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) of.That is enough material to make 45 of the vases from the time-lapse in our video!\nThe Micro filament spools are fed from inside the printer.  Alternatively, you can use an external filament access port located on top of the extruder.  \nSoftware Options\n3D printer software should be as fun and futuristic as the printer itself.  That's why we've designed the M3D software to be as interactive and enjoyable as a game, making sure it\u2019s fully touchscreen-capable with a minimalist and simple-to-use interface. It allows you to search and browse countless objects online, organizing 3D models you've downloaded into an easy to view library.  Just pick a model, drag it into the printer, adjust the model if needed, and hit <print>. Software shouldn't be a barrier to 3D printing, and it\u2019s our goal to make The Micro accessible to everyday users.\nAdvanced users can use the expert settings as well as other software such as open-source slicers.  \nTechnical Specifications\nPrinter Dimensions: It's a cube, 7.3 in (185 mm) per side.\nIt is lightweight, roughly 2.2 lb (1 kg).\nIt can also be used with any Windows, Mac, or Linux based system.\nUSB-Compatible connection.\nSupports many different materials: ABS, PLA, Nylon, and more.\nFilament: standard 1.75mm. Nearly 1/2 lb (225 g) rolls.\nStandard filament rolls also supported.\nRemovable Print Bed.\n50-350 micron layer resolution.\n15 micron X and Y positioning accuracy.\nDimensions: Print height: 116mm (4.6\"). Base Print Area: 109mm x 113mm.  Print Area Above 74mm: 91mm x 84mm.\nM3D software for an effortless, plug-and-play experience.  \nSupports and uses open source software (for advanced users).\nHow Did You Create The Micro?\nStarting with a seamless design, the Micro evolved from two years of productive debates between engineers, artists and production experts.  Since everyone was involved from the beginning, their vision of the product was fully integrated into the final result.  This led to 15 innovations in the field of 3D printing and we are very honored to share the result of all that hard work with you.\nBut the work doesn't stop there. We want your feedback on The Micro, and help us build a community that can be a part of this exciting project.\n15 Innovations\nM3D has introduced many innovations in the field of filament-based 3D printing with the introduction of The Micro:\n1. Most space-efficient 3D printer ever made.  \n2. Light-weight, portable design fits nicely on your desk.\n3. Micro motion chip provides completely automatic leveling and calibration.\n4. Most quiet 3D printer ever made.\n5. Lowest power consumption 3D printer ever made.\n6. Carbon fiber rods: light, sturdy, self-lubricating and long-lasting\n7. Ceramic heater for rapid heat-up, power efficiency, reliability and safety.\n8. Bold colors. Choose from Silver, Black, Blue, RedOrange, and Green.\n9. New filament materials like Chameleon PLA.\n10.

An ABS-based print bed allows you to print larger ABS parts.\nDesigned & Assembled in The USA\nThe Micro was designed for assembly and production in the USA.  We will use a combination of imported and domestic components to assemble all of the printers near our Bethesda, MD location.  \nYour Backing = Earlier Delivery\nWe're ready for production and really need your support to ramp up assembly to get printers to you as early as possible.  We've been preparing for this stage for over a year by buying and testing parts from over 100 manufacturers and talking with hundreds more.  \nBy pre-ordering now you\u2019ll help us reach our last crucial milestone: purchasing the injection molds that will provide us with high-quality, high-volume 3D printer parts we need to assemble the most affordable consumer 3D printer ever.  In return, you'll get one of the first Micro 3D Printers and be an early adopter of this exciting project.  For that we cannot thank you enough.\nWhat's Included with My Reward?\nBesides our eternal gratitude, we\u2019ll assemble a Micro 3D Printer with great care in the US and send it to you along with M3D software, instructions manual, USB cable, country-specific power adapter, and one Micro filament spool.  You can unbox it, install the software, and print right away - it\u2019s as quick and as simple as that.  \nWhy We Need You\nAs far as we've come, we've only just scratched the surface of what's possible using this technology. We need your help to take it further, and make The Micro a reality.\nProduction Timeline:\nThe Incredible M3D Team  \nEveryone at M3D has a single-minded focus to deliver an amazingly fun and fulfilling 3D printing experience for everyone. To get here has been very rewarding, and we've formed an amazing team of gems. We would like to give a special thanks to so many supporters, motivators, backers, team members, and advisors that helped us get to where we are so quickly:\nThanks For Your Support!   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any innovative project, we face several key risks and challenges. The primary risks include:\n\nINJECTION MOLDING \nWe consider this is our only significant risk. Injection molding has very large capital expenses and thus we can only secure one manufacturer. In addition, when making the specification for the seamless frame of The Micro, we demanded only the best quality surface finish. Injection molding is one part science and one part artistic optimization. Thus the mold may take up to 4 months to produce and perfect. For this reason we have put a great deal of careful planning and strategy into the sourcing of our injection molded parts such as working with suppliers in North America to ensure that the long lead time parts are closest to us.\n\nSUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS \nBefore starting we noticed that some projects can encounter unexpected hurdles when going from prototype to production. That\u2019s why we have done so much work to test The Micro with over 100 manufacturers to ensure that our designs are production ready and designed for both manufacturing and assembly. The last pieces to be ordered are the very expensive injection molds for plastic parts. To verify these designs we\u2019ve had them CNC\u2019d and 3D printed so that the injection molds are as close to our prototypes as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Thank you all", "update_content": "Dear Backers,  \n           The entire team here at M3D would like to take a moment to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for your continued support.

But what is equally clear is that the way we will interact with such smart objects and services will be difficult within the current visual user interface paradigm. The visual smartphone will always play a central part in our life, but it will be far too cumbersome to help us with the many quick interactions that will populate our day.\nHow does it Work?\nXOWi Demo\nWhat Can XOWi Do?\nXOWi Makes our Life Better\nXOWi -- Perfect for the Visually Impaired\nAt XOWi, we STRONGLY subscribe to the dictum that designing for universal use is the best way to design for a maximally usable product. In the case of XOWi, we want our device to be used by not only the traditional smartphone user base \u2013 those who can use both hands and eyes to interact with the device \u2013 but also people who can\u2019t use their hands or their eyes. The effect of subscribing to the dictum of Universal Design is that not only will the user base of the product broaden, but the usability itself of the product increases in situations where an otherwise enabled person is disabled \u2013 for instance, if you are carrying a box (hands no longer free) or you are trying to control your AC in the dark (no vision).

What's left is the work of making a good idea a great product that consistently, securely, and reliably delivers value. We want to make XOWi something that people LOVE, and people love products that reliably work as expected.  So, a lot of exciting cutting edge engineering, both hardware and software, lies ahead that will enable us to robustly deliver great experiences.  A lot of testing, both the hardware and the software, a lot of tweaking and fine tuning.  And perhaps most importantly for our mission is to deliver XOWi at a price that will enable anyone who wants a XOWi to get one.\nHere is a more detailed timeline of the main milestones between now and the time we begin delivering XOWi to our wonderful backers:\nNovember 2013\n- Final Hardware Designs: The look and feel of XOWi is set, but we believe that we can further optimize the internal circuits and the placement of the microphones, speakers, and accelerometer for optimal performance.\n- Final Selection of Language Technology vendors: Speech Recognition, Text To Speech, Natural Language Processing, Dictation Services\n\nDecember 2013\n- Hardware Manufacturer Selection:  We are already engaged with several manufacturing partners and are halfway through the selection of our manufacturing partner.  It is crucial that we select a solid partner.\n- Beta Completion of iOS and Android Software Driver Software\n- Beta Completion of the XOWi Middleware Cloud\n\nJanuary 2013\n- Hardware Material Selection: XOWi needs to look good, feel good, and fit with user's clothing and environment.  Selecting the right material that will enable us to deliver on all these dimensions and at the same time keep XOWi affordable is a crucial step.  We will take it carefully.\n- Finalized the Packaging Design: XOWi will be beautifully boxed.  We want to make the unboxing experience of XOWi be the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\n- Beta Completion of Microsoft and Blackberry Software Drivers\n- GA Certification of iOS and Android Software Drivers\n- GA Certification of the XOWi Middleware Cloud\n\nFebruary 2014\n- Beta Batch production: a Beta Batch will be manufactured for extensive real-life field testing by XOWi testers as well as ordinary users.\n- Quality Assurance Certification of Hardware\n- GA Certification of Microsoft and Blackberry Software Driver Software\n- 508 Certification of the XOWi Personal Voice Companion\n\nMarch 2014\n- INNOVATOR and PARTNER Package Batches of XOWis shipped\n\nApril 2014\n- VISIONARY and EVANGELIST Package Batches of XOWis shipped\nJune 2014\n- Basic Package Batch of XOWis shipped\nWho We Are\nXOWi Inc. was founded by Ahmed Bouzid and Weiye Ma, two speech technology innovators with a life long passion for bringing voice solutions and products to the mainstream.

To everyone who has pitched in and who has encouraged us to take on this exciting project: you are a blessing.  We will work hard to live up to your expectations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe key to XOWi's high usability is its responsiveness. The interaction between the hardware and the software running on the smartphone is going to be key. A lot will be invested to ensure that such interactions are smooth on all four mobile platforms: Android, iOS, Microsoft and Blackberry.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe aim to manufacture a beautiful device that is also robust and safe. This means many testing iterations that will ensure that we are delivering a product that works and that people can be proud to wear.\n\nCertification\n\nLike all hardware devices, we need to pass safety certification in the markets where we wish to make XOWi available.

Ti is used in cars, planes, hiking gear, medical implants and spaceships, because it's light as plastic, with the strength of steel!!!!  \nSo why do you need a Titanium guitar pick?\nThe high strength to weight ratio makes the EpicGrip a great general purpose pick, and when you need to do high speed precision picking, THIS should be the pick you reach for.\n\"For all you rock stars out there, time to step up your guitar picks to titanium with EpicGrip. EpicGrip is designed to keep the jam sessions rocking.\" - The Crowdfund Mafia\nA few years ago I custom laser-cut a batch of these picks, but they still needed finishing. I took a pick to my friend Michael's workshop, rounded the edges and sanded it smooth. The resulting pick felt nice and produced a rich full sound. It immediately became my favorite pick. \nBecause it doesn't slip, the EpicGrip feels like an extension of your hand...  Sound-wise, Ti picks have a stronger attack if you hold them loosely, and a tighter grip softens the tone. It gives me an extra bit of dynamic range when I'm playing. Some rock guitarists in the 80's used to boil their strings to achieve a custom sound--now you can tweak your sound mid-riff, just by using the EpicGrip pick.  Check out the sound in the video below.\nContinuing with the story...  Late last year I bought a grinder and improved my polishing technique. I gifted a few of these picks to friends and family with spectacular response, but the laborious process of grinding and polishing each pick was hugely time consuming.  In the back of my mind I wanted to come up with a more efficient way of producing them for less, but I could not envision a reliable process to combine a high quality product with a reasonable price... and I'd probably still be stumping about it if not for a casual conversation last Christmas.\nEnter my good friend Andrew, who used to run the R&D department for The Sharper Image. Andrew liked the pick I had, and offered to share his expertise and manufacturing connections to help get the per-pick cost down to an affordable level. I jumped at the chance to make this dream a reality. \nSo here's where we stand now... \nWe've nailed down a manufacturer and, after sorting through the details, and some minor tweaking, we've finalized the design.  \nBelow is the Rounding/Polishing test photo from the manufacturer. The thin lines in the cut-out design have been thickened slightly to improve durability in subsequent versions (see last image for current design).\nProduction Rounding/Polishing Test\nThat's the story up until now, and I am excited to invite you to the next phase of production, and to be able to offer this awesome pick at a reasonable price.\nIf you make it into the first tier, you can pick up one shiny polished pick at a insanely low price!  If the first batch is snapped up, you're still going to get a pick at less than the final selling price.  The point is, I want to get these puppies out into the hands of musicians where they can sing. Enough about me though. Here are the Options:\nHere is the single pick TITANIUM EpicGrip.\nOne Pick\nOr get two TITANIUM EpicGrips.  Save a little on shipping and get two picks for cheaper than the same tier per-pick price.\nTwo Picks\nThree Picks\nNew Reward Tier Added... Four EpicGrip Picks!\nAs a Stretch Goal, if we pass the $6500 mark,  I will add free SOLID COLOR electric anodizing as an option for EVERYONE'S picks. The color options will be SOLID Blue, SOLID Purple or SOLID Gold.\nIf we pass the $7000 mark,  I will add free GRADIENT anodizing as an option (shown below). So tell all your guitarist friends to hop on board to get this train a-rolling. EpicGrips also make awesome necklaces or ear-rings for a lady friend. Just sayin'...\nGradient Anodized\nThe photo above shows the range of available colors. If we get to the anodizing phase, I'll update with a list of what colors everyone is choosing.\nThe finalized design: \nFinal Design\nClean round outer edges, super polished face, bigger cut-out gaps and slightly thicker bits between the gap-edges makes for a for a better grip, a stronger pick and a more balanced look and feel.\nPraise for the EpicGrip:\n\"It's a great pick, easy to hold on to, and the bevel, which is missing from most non-traditional picks is really great!\"\n- Dale Bodmer\n\"Looks great, plays great, and is ****ing indestructible\"\n-JP Strom\n\"...so cool!

Why not \"EpicPick\"? I realized that I never told that story anywhere, so if you care, read on... Originally I planned to call the picks simply \"Epicks\" because \"Epic\" and \"Pick\" seemed like a good fit, but when I did a web search, I found that  beat me by a couple months...

I'm assuming they must be re-tumbled, re-polished, and then re-packaged. All of them...\n The factory is not passing along the cost, so they are likely taking a pretty big financial hit to make sure these are correct. Although I would have liked the picks on time, having them refinished properly, regardless of how long it takes, is really the only option here.

Follow TUG on Facebook as well for press, news, updates, art, and more!\nTUG sits at the crossroads where survival sandbox and multiplayer RPG\u2019s meet, offering both elegant simplicity and a world of complex secrets for those who desire to seek them out. From freezing snow capped mountains to dark dreary caves, TUG offers a massive procedurally-generated world to explore, full of mystery and danger -- but what makes TUG truly unique is its ability to help us learn what you as players enjoy about the game, and to use your interactions to make an amazing world even better.\nThe project draws inspiration from fun, accessible games we love such as Minecraft, Fable, Animal Crossing, and Zelda, as well as games that feature deeply complex worlds, including Eve Online, Monster Hunter, and Dwarf Fortress.\nWhat do we think you\u2019ll like about TUG? Some of the things we\u2019re most excited about include:\nIntegrated modding support: we won\u2019t just have support for modding tools hooked in from the beginning -- we\u2019ll be sharing our tools with modders. \nPets and Companions will join you in your travels and help along the way.\nEntire Civilizations lie hidden for you to uncover... or create new ones to conquer the world! \nDay, Night, and Seasonal Cycles with perils and opportunities unique to each. \nExotic Wild Beasts to tame, hunt, breed, or ride! \nLogic Engineering, from simple trap triggers to reprogramming your golem! \nDark Mysteries to unearth, and ancient powers to unleash! \nDRM-Free. That includes the servers, which we\u2019ll also be sharing with you. \nAccessibility & Complexity: Playing in the world is as simple as interacting with it. Anyone can dig, build, or fight, but true discoveries await for players who pay attention to the world around them. That logic and consistency applies to everything -- combat, magic, crafting, building, hunting, exploring -- everything! \nPlayer-Driven Design: The game can identify the kinds of activities everyone enjoys most, and that information will direct developers in creating everything from new weapons and abilities to new worlds and creatures. The more you play, the more you\u2019ll enjoy TUG! \nModular Development: From combat to sprinting, from building to crafting, we want all of our players to experience the game in every phase of development to allow for real feedback and discussion about what does and does not work. \nTotal Freedom: We want you to play the game however you like, whether that\u2019s alone, on a private server with your friends, or on a server we host. We won\u2019t limit the type of game you want to play, and we\u2019ll find a way for everyone to enjoy the world we\u2019re building, however and with whoever they want.\n\nWhen you enter the game, you awaken as a newborn Seed: a near-human child without defenses, resources or practical skills. All you have to survive your first day are your wits, a set of simple clothes and a mysterious glowing gemstone embedded in the back of your right hand. It's enough -- barely enough -- and it'll be a challenge to live through the night, but it won't be your last challenge. Deserts, mountains, and forests will impede your progress; crumbled ruins will tempt you into their depths, and the cycles of the moon, the sun, and even the seasons will reveal more opportunities and greater mysteries. \nOnce you\u2019ve begun to understand your world, you\u2019ll have to figure out who you want to be, and your options are as wide open as the world around you. Maybe you\u2019ll be a tough warrior, proud of your scars and your trusty blade. Maybe a simpler life, like that of a master craftsman, appeals to you -- trading with adventurers for rare resources and building works of genius and technology. Maybe the deeper mysteries of the world call to you, and you want to explore the ruins and the deeps, searching out the links between you, the stone on your arm, and the mystical energy that seems to bind everything around you together. Or maybe your loyalty lies with your fellow Seeds, and building a civilization to bring about even greater security and prosperity is what appeals to you. \nThis is when your real adventure starts, because while all of these goals are within your grasp, none are easy to reach. Ancient civilizations, wild beasts and otherworldly technologies can serve as brilliant discoveries, grave dangers, or both -- and while you strive to master these challenges, a dark presence looms ever greater in the shadows as forgotten powers of old vie with each other for influence.\nTUG is a game before it's anything else, and we want people to play it and enjoy the experience without feeling like they have to run spreadsheets, juggle budgets, or crunch numbers. Your immersion in the game is one of the most important things in TUG, so here are some ways we plan to help. \nWhile there are lots of complex stats and attributes you can gain from both gear and abilities, they won\u2019t be visible to you -- at least not without the proper tools. Instead, we\u2019ll focus on making every visual cue in the world important. A tiny runed notch in a sword might indicate it's extra sharp, or a glow under the moonlight might be a sure sign that your blade is powerful against certain creatures, but you'll never see \"+25 STR\" or \"UNDEAD SLAYING\" in a pop-up window. \nThe way you interface with the game world will be completely organic. You won't ever see a nameplate hovering over someone's head or a minimap stuck to the upper-right corner of your screen -- unless you create them in-game with tools. Getting a bird's-eye view of the world around you, seeing detailed information about your opponents, and even global communication can all be enabled by tools you can design and craft in the game. \nFinally, everything in the world will have heft and weight. You won't have magic backpacks that instantly transform twenty-pound warhammers into a single weightless inventory slot; an item is as big in your pack as it is on the ground or in your hand. This forces you to make important decisions about how to solve problems, whether you're alone or in a group. Do you pack a second blade for when your main sword is too worn to use, or do you pack extra supplies in case of an emergency? Those decisions will be yours to make, and the outcome of your adventures will hinge on them!\nEverything you do, see, create, harvest, or explore may a have huge impact on the world around it. What seems like a unique design on a weapon could be part of a missing puzzle for a gateway to a hidden realm. Your actions may draw the attention of mysterious entities, for better or for worse. The more you understand about the intricacies of the world, the more prepared you will be to expand your play from swinging a sword to developing or manipulating entire civilizations.\nA lot of RPGs like to take a fast and loose hack-and-slash approach to fighting, but while mindless swinging can always be AN answer, it isn\u2019t always the BEST answer. Variations of combat based on your weapon type and the skills you\u2019ve learned can lead to a much more rewarding fight -- not to mention a better outcome! You won\u2019t have room for buckets of swords and armor in your pack, so knowing your skills and your strengths becomes much more important for a successful encounter. Over time, we want to expand on this idea and utilize real combat physics within TUG, to allow for dynamic and engaging battles.\nAnd that\u2019s just the start... where we\u2019re at right now. As we spend more time and layer more complexity into the combat system, we\u2019ll build both fun and skill into play. Anyone will be able to just swing away, but someone who learns the rhythms and really masters the ins and the outs of their weapon and combat skills will have a clear advantage in a fight. TUG will be using a skill-based system where timing, not mashing, determines the outcome of your battles. You\u2019ll raise your shield in time to block that killer blow, but don\u2019t hold it too long or you\u2019ll lose your advantage. You\u2019ll string together quick hits with your dagger and unlock awesome flourish attacks, or maybe you\u2019ll strike slow and true with your massive flamberge and watch your opponents stagger away from the blows. \nBut most importantly, in keeping with our philosophy about our players being integral to our design, we\u2019ll learn how and why you enjoy combat best, and then we\u2019ll take that knowledge to build features that will make the parts you like even better! \nWe\u2019re a collective of scientists, researchers, technologists, economists, content creators, artists, modders, and gamers from a variety of disciplines and backgrounds. With our love of games, and our deep passion for the nerdery of academic sciences, art, and technology, we have joined forces to build the Nerd Kingdom and craft a game that compels our players to explore, discover, create, and conquer! \nTo learn more about who we are and all our sciency fiascos, check us out: http://www.nerdkingdom.com/\nOr follow us on Facebook! And on Twitter, @NerdKingdom!\nWith TUG, we want to focus on building a game that\u2019s fun for everyone, and to use the ground-breaking understanding we\u2019re forging between developers and our players as our development roadmap. We\u2019re building this game world for our players, and we want to build it free of outsiders who think they know better, and who\u2019ll try to tell us what our players \u201creally\u201d want. \nGoing through Kickstarter, staying independent, and allowing our community to take ownership of what we\u2019re doing together allows us to stay free of the influence of those other groups. If we\u2019re not answerable to anyone but you, the community, then we don\u2019t have to worry about meeting someone else\u2019s agenda. All we have to worry about is making a great game even better! \nAnd to that, we would like to make a commitment to you: all funds raised, from now until our official launch in 2015, will go directly into the game\u2019s development, and not into anyone\u2019s pockets. We want the community\u2019s support to show in full with what is being created.\nMinimum specifications \nCPU: Quad-core Intel\u00ae or AMD processor \nOS: Windows\u00ae 7 or 8 \nRam: 4 GB \nGPU: DirectX\u00ae 11 compatible card with 1 GB of memory, nVidia\u00ae 4XX+/AMD 5XXX+\nHard Drive: 10 GB free space\nRelease Schedule\nWe will make the first Alpha available to backers in that tier in July of 2013. With time to play, share, and interact, we will add more features and reset priority lists based on feedback. Beginning in January of 2014, we will have the Beta phase of the project available to backers in that tier. And by January 2015, we will prepare for an official launch of TUG to the public, and continue to update and refine for as long as the community is enjoying it. All other tier rewards will be sent out as they become available over the course of development (and as soon as possible), but do forgive us if we fall a bit behind.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is an incredibly unique collaboration of minds and practices, and with this comes a great deal of experimentation, iteration and discussions.

It is extremely low budget, and relatively high concept. How is a story of space warfare between two high-technology civilizations to be achieved, doing justice to its original, on a super-low budget?\nPartially because most of the work will be done by students -- ideally my production students at the University of Colorado (you can see samples of their extraordinary work here) -- under the occasional supervision of professionals from the industry. But mainly because Harry Harrison's original novel - his counterblast to STAR$HIP TROOPERS - has to be made this way. It's told not from the flight deck but from the engine room: or to be more exact, the fusebays, where ranks of expendable Fusetenders Sixth Class wait to replace burned-out fuses, or die.\nProduction Artwork\nHarry's story of grunts - and one grunt in particular - in the lowest echelon of the war machine - can readily be recreated in an academic environment. ATLAS, home of the University of Colorado's Film Studies Program, features concrete staircases and windowless basement corridors which already resemble the corridors and fusebays of the Good Ship Fanny Hill. The Visual Arts Complex features asymmetrical hallways and strange machines. Tunnels beneath the campus provide us with the bowels of Helior, the Imperial Planet. The Engineering Dept. has space suits and a mock-up Space Shuttle replacement.\nNCAR\nBut no one location is essential to the picture! Bill's one trip \"above ground\" to Helior's Walled Gardens, can be recreated at a venue like the NCAR (seen above - and also featured in the sf comedy Sleeper).\nProf. Dave Klaus dresses me in one of our costumes\nVeniola, the swamp planet, where Bill is sent to a penal colony, will be shot in an appropriately green location.\nSome sixty pages of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be shot live action, with space-suited actors, on 35mm black and white film. About ten pages will be shot on a stage using front or rear projection.\nPurple Dart with Coal-sack Nebula Cluster\nThere are about ten (overlapping) pages of model shots and special effects, including glimpses of the Voids of Space. We will build our own models, under the supervision of visual effects pros from Tippett Studios (ROBOCOP, STARSHIP TROOPERS, MAD GOD) and Collateral Image (who created the visual effects for REPO CHICK and STRAIGHT TO HELL RETURNS). My colleague Victor Jendras will, I hope, supervise the creation of the medals, and the production design.\nBILL THE GALACTIC HERO begins and ends as an animated cartoon. The anime department, run, I hope, by my colleague Chris Pearce, will also create Eager Chinger, the tiny reptilian spy.\nThe live action - actors in space suits in staircases, sound stages, and swamps - can be accomplished within twenty days. But the \"VFX\" part of the project does not unfold quickly. This is an old-fashioned science fiction film of the technological level of ICARUS XB1: it will use real models, and matte shots.\nSpacesuit sketches\nSince we're outputting a digital version of the film - your DVD or BluRay disc, or download - post production will involve some CGI - computer generated images. How else to achieve our ray gun blasts, or interplanetary lasers? But we aim to keep our technology rooted in the mid 1960s, when the greatest of all science fiction films (DR STRANGELOVE, ICARUS, and 2001) were made with three-dimensional analog models, and when Harry Harrison conceived and wrote BILL THE GALACTIC HERO.\nOur model-building, plate-shooting and costume work will be done this fall The main shoot of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be in early spring. But post-production will take longer than that! One of the things I try to teach my students is the \"impossible triangle of quality\": the one whereby any manufactured item - including a film - can be made good, and fast, but not cheap; fast, and cheap, but not good; or good, and cheap, but not fast. A quality independent film aims for the last of these three. We will endeavor to post a rough cut - viewable with a unique download key - in the Summer of 2014, and to ship the more important costumes and models when we're sure they aren't needed. BILL THE GALACTIC HERO - its sound design and music under the supervision of Academy Award winner Richard Beggs and film composer Dan Wool - will be finished by December 2014.\nHonorable Enlistment Award\nBILL UPDATE #1 - STARSHIP TROOPERS PRODUCER JOINS UP!\nWhat a pleasure to report that Jon Davison has signed up both as a project backer and to come and supervise BILL's preproduction, here in Boulder. Jon and I first worked together on a project called WAR BABY (unmade); for years we struggled with our own original version of MARS ATTACKS! (unmade also). We finally managed to make a film in 2007 -- SEARCHERS 2.0. So this will (I hope) be our second successful collaboration! Jon has even refused to accept money for gas. He will drive here from Telluride in the fall and guide us as we set up our production plan.\nBoss Jon Davison and team, on the set of Searchers 2.0\n(That's Jon in the dead centre of the above photograph, against a magnificent backdrop of buttes.) I remember talking to him on the phone as he was leaving Hollywood for STARSHIP TROOPERS' location shoot in Wyoming -- at the head of the biggest convoy of grip and electrical equipment trucks the industry had ever seen. Far from the grandeur of leading his wagon train, he will be welcome at our humble campfire.\nThanks for reading this -- and please, if you can, support this authentically independent independent film! I shall be grateful for your backing at any level, and look forward to sharing the details of BILL's progress with you as the film unfolds. Only backers will know the true and grisly details of this production. Only with your support, can BILL be made!\nForward to Victory Starburst, designed by Victor Jendras", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks associated with any film project are two-fold: that the film may not be completed. and that the film will be bad. The first of these risks is minimal: a filmmaker's reputation depends on his or her ability to deliver a finished film; all the features I've directed have been completed and distributed, in theaters, on television, or on DVD. The schedule we've established for BILL gives us the lengthy post-production period which a good science fiction film needs (and which the panicked schedules of contemporary Hollywood no longer permit).\n\nThe danger of making a bad film is always there! In the project's favor is the original material - Harry Harrison's amazing book - and the screenplay, which Harry and I were working on when he died, and which is available for your perusal as a $10 Kickstarter reward. The risk-averse might also worry about the budget, which is by Hollywood standards amazingly low. But I'm used to making low-budget pictures: you might want to check out my book, X Films, which deals with ten features I directed, and goes into detail as to the budgets and how they were spent. \n\nRaising our funding now gives us plenty of time to buy film stock, buy and doctor our costumes, and prepare for a fall/spring shoot. I'm confident in the talents of student crews and actors -- and my confidence is reinforced because professionals I've worked with many times will also be around to keep things up to our usual exacting standards!\n\nCould BILL, THE GALACTIC HERO run late? Given our decent post-production period this seems unlikely. Will fulfillment of the rewards be delayed? Highly unlikely. Once the shoot is officially over we can release the leads' spacesuits and regalia. When the visual effects photography is done we can release the spacecraft and refreshment robots.

All others are FREE TO ALL COPIES OF THE GAME unless otherwise noted!\nIntroduction\nWhen Shane & Jared first demoed this game to us, the first thing we thought of was a commonly seen fridge magnet that reads:\nThis captures the feel of this game to a tee!\n\"[Walk The Plank]...really captures the feel of a bunch of boys brawling about in an extremely funny, stupid manner... but in a good way!  You'll get some great belly laughs as your pirate stupidly throws one of your own men overboard or as your best friend tries to do you in! This is a very confrontational game but it all ends in good fun because the results you are trying to achieve are only rarely accomplished!  For my money this is even funnier than GET BIT! and makes for a perfect \"PREQUEL\" to that game!\" -Seth Hiatt, Mayday Games\nYou can download a copy of the rules HERE.\n\nWalk The Plank! is all about trying to out-guess your fellow shipmates, with often disastrous results.  You plan three moves ahead but your crew is so incredibly stupid that if you plan to shove a pirate off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away!  The bigger the action the worse the results will be for someone, very possibly YOU!  \nPlay order goes clockwise but turn order is COUNTER CLOCKWISE which really makes the mechanic hilarious for this game! \nOn your turn you will:\nChoose 3 of your 10 action cards and place them face down in front of you (first action on top)\nResolve each action in turn by going around the table clockwise three times, adding/removing planks, pushing and shoving and just generally making a fool of yourself.\nLaugh your head off as your men thrash about stupidly, bungling most of your good intentions\nRetrieve most of your cards and begin again.  Some cards marked with a skull are too powerful to play in back to back rounds, leave those face up for one round before retrieving them.\n\nAt the end of a round check for the end of game condition, if there are only two (or fewer) pirates left or only pirates of one color left, the game is over.  There may be a shared victory (one of each of two players' pirates left), a solo victory (only one player's pirate(s) left), or NO VICTORY when every pirate has Walked The Plank!\nPlease note that the \"Shove Left\" and \"Shove Right\" are referring to pushing the player sitting to your left or right.  You do not shove someone \"left\" or \"right\" on the plank, but rather these mean you can only push the token of the player sitting to your left or right.  We hope these new \"Language free\" cards (unlocked at $12,000 in funding here on Kickstarter) will help people remember the cards' actions at a glance and make the game more accessible to non-English speakers.  Anyone interested in translating the rule book into another language, you are more than welcome to do so and post the text of the rules in any other language HERE for all to share! You can see all files uploaded to date HERE.\n\nSESSION REVIEW #1 on BGG: \"I still remember how much I enjoyed the game ( it is a light B&P type of game and not to long, which is what I like ). But the thing is, I still think about how fun it is and can not wait to be able to buy this one.\" -Hendal, BGG User, Puerto Rico\nSESSION REVEW #2 on BGG: \"This is a fast, fun, filler game that reminds me of a more confrontational Cartagena or Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game. It's a game of survival and you need to best utilize your 3 actions per turn to try and keep at least one of your pirates alive through the end of the game.\nThe game has aspects of Robo Rally as you need to \"program\" your next 3 moves in advance - making it difficult to know exactly what is going to happen, but that kind of \"controlled chaos\" is right up my alley and I enjoyed the game quite a bit. Certain card combo's can work to your advantage and anticipating when the right time to get rid of a section of the plank is essential to putting yourself in a position to win.\" -Manowarplayer, BGG User, California\n\"I'm friends with the designers, but that doesn't change my opinion of Walk The Plank. I've played this game many, many times, and it's always been lots of fun. Trying to out-think your opponents is an interesting challenge, and it's frustratingly fun when unexpected things happen to mess with your carefully laid plans... I'm excited to see this get a real production. If you like fast, fun, full-of-laughs fillers, don't hesitate to back this.\" Scott Firestone; Theology Of Games; \nTom Vasel's Thoughts:\n\"Walk The Plank is a game that I very much enjoyed, ...you're trying to out guess your opponents.  What are they going to do at any point in time?\nThere is player elimination in the game which means you'll be out of the game, but since we're talking a 20 minute game here, and you probably won't be out until the last 5 minutes or so, it doesn't really matter that much.\n... Charging, shoving people, its very entertaining!  Sometimes great big laughs will be found because somebody will retract the plank and they didn't realize that half or all of their pirates were going to be standing on the edge of the plank when they did it!\nThink of it almost as a very, very light form of Robo Rally where people are going to be programming what they do each turn... but you're only programming three actions.  But you do have that control over the game.  I'm very excited to see what the final components will look like,  and you have a chance to do that too, so jump on this Kickstarter.  A fun, light game.  Everyone I played with had a good time with it!\" -Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower, Florida, USA \nAfter we started working on Walk the Plank! we realized we had something special and wanted to make the artwork truly unique.  We wanted something really different and Max Holiday, our Lead Designer on this project, suggested we commission Mike Groves from PoopBird, a famous tattoo artist.  \nWe were really intrigued by his other work and are delighted with the results!  Tattoo artist turned Board Game Art Designer.. WHY NOT? If you are interested you can check out some of his other art at his Facebook Page.  Really good quality work and an amazing artist!\nLet's face it, to get a game this good at a $20 price point means we need to print lots of copies. To print lots of copies takes... well... lots of money.  We have already invested in the design, layout, graphics and artwork, now we need your help to, well, print lots of copies.  We hope with your help we will be able to get this game made in a big way.  Every dollar this project can raise will go to increasing the print run.  \nWe are taking those savings and upping the production value of the game through stretch rewards and also keeping the MSRP as low as we can.  A game with these components and \"fun factor\" easily sells for $25-$30 or even more.  With your help we will keep the retail price low to allow everyone to share in this game, not just the backers.  Please consider backing this project today!\nAdd-On Awards\nAdd-On Awards are rewards that you can add to your existing pledge as a backer.

Don't wanna back this project?  Help out ALL THE BACKERS by \"Liking\" this project on Facebook! UPDATE: We reached 1,000 LIKES on 3/26, every backer will now get a free pack of card sleeves with every single copy of this game that they pledge for!\n**Don't see the Facebook Link below the video next to \"Tweet\" or \"Embed\"? You must be logged into FB in your browser to see it!**\nStretch Rewards\nWe are doing this game at the really low price point of $20 USD retail to allow it to get out there to as many people as we can.  This is just a bare-bones edition and it will play really well and have great artwork, but we really want to make it even better!  If we can get enough funds to really do this game justice, we will reward all of you backers as well!  Here is a brief summary of each reward level:\n$8 K - Upgraded Cards -UNLOCKED!\nWe will upgrade the cards in the game to super-high quality! That is 310 GSM, Grey Core Center Cards with a Linen Finish Texture! These are the best quality available and the cards will look and feel really premium! Eaten By Zombies Quality Cards! Unlocked on Day 1, about 6 hours into the project! WOW!\n\n\n12 k - Language Independent Cards -UNLOCKED!\nSee updated cards above.\n18 k -Upgraded Starting Player Token -UNLOCKED!\nYou don't really need a nice starting player token, but we would love to include one of the \"Captain\" to show influence in the game going to the starting player. This would be a cool upgrade and could really look great!  UNLOCKED on DAY 2 of the KS project!  See image of the starting player token below.  It will be included in every copy of the game and will make remembering who the starting player is much easier!\n\n\n25 k - Meeples, Meeples, Meeples! -UNLOCKED!\nAs you can see from the Dice Tower Introduction, the game works fine with just some simple tokens, but we want to include some MEEPLES, some wooden pirate shaped men that are 21 X 23 X 8 MM (roughly).  That would be 3 of each color in 5 colors, for a total of 15 meeples (pirate shaped tokens).  These are expensive to upgrade to but with your help we can add this to ALL copies of the game!  Instead of discs we will do something like this:\n\nThese would be in 5 colors: Yellow, Blue, Red, Green and Orange\n\n\n35 k - Bonus Shark Add On Available to all Backers at $18+ - UNLOCKED!\nWe are calling this a Get Bit! prequel.  Never heard of Get Bit!?? Well it won the Origins Award for 2012 for the best Party/Family Game of the Year!  Our latest pirate version was a huge hit on Kickstarter and it comes with a great SHARK figure. We would love to get a custom run of these made for this game and make them available to every customer who is pledging at $18 or more (yes your $18 pledge still would include this offer).  The figure would be available to all backers at $18 or more for just a $3 add on per game, if we can get to $35,000.  This would be really nice to put at the end of the plank for you backers and this extra Great White Shark would not be included in the game for anyone but Kickstarter Backers, though we might make it available down the road at conventions or via some other means if we have some left after the KS project.   You can choose white or the original grey if you prefer, see image below:\n\n\n\n45 k -Dual purpose Get Bit! and Walk The Plank! combined Playing Mat -UNLOCKED\nAt Essen, Germany in 2012 we had a neat little demo mat that we used to show Get Bit to people.  We had literally over 100 people ask us if they could have or purchase this sharp looking play mat for use with Get Bit!  We have wanted to make it available to players ever since then and have redesigned it to look great for Get Bit! or Walk The Plank.  Here is a draft version of it to wet your whistle:\n\n\nIf we get to $45,000 on this Kickstarter then we will print this mat and make it available to any and all of you at a low cost of just $15 per mat.  Canadian backers will need to add $5 shipping to the mat and Worldwdie will need to add $8 shipping for the mat. It will be available for pick up at Essen 2013 at no shipping costs, and possibly GenCon as well!\nUpdate: OK, so it isn't low cost is it?  $15 is spendy for a mat.  Well it isn't just any mat.  It will be REALLY NICE:   It is  70x70cm in size and will feature UV printing. It is printed on Extreme Classic PVC 500 gsm material. This will be durable and not scratch off the top paint layer easily as it is for people to play a game on. For the packing, each piece pack with bubble bag then individually rolled in the cardboard mailers. \nBackers can add this reward as follows:\nEarly Bird Backers:  $12 per mat\nAll others: $15 per mat\nShipping to USA: Included!\nShipping to Canada: $5 for first mat, $2 more for 2nd, $3 for third, $2 for 4th mat, etc...\nShipping Worldwide: $8 for first mat, $4 for each additional. \n$55k Reward -Ghost Meeple Mini-Expansion\nBy very popular demand we are making this really silly and totally unauthorized expansion available. This is NOT authorized by the designers, not play tested and will have no official rules or info on it. It is a secret mini expansion that is just a ghost meeple. This ghost meeple will be awarded to the first pirate who is fully eliminated from the game (all 3 pirates are OUT. This player will continue to push/shove and generally cause mayhem with his ghost pirate, haunting the rest of the crew. He can't do physical things like cut or extend the plank, but can push and shove, but can't be pushed or shoved himself. This will be a white colored pirate meeple and may even feature glow in the dark paint if we can get that done by the factory, no promises though. Again, this is just a silly expansion that is totally unauthorized, but may well turn out to be a lot of fun!\nPicture this shape, but with white or even glow-in-the dark.\n65 k - Pirate Meeple Stickers for ALL copies of the game!\nWe hope to make the pirate meeples for this game (unlocked at $25,000) and if we do we'd love to offer free pirate stickers to all of you for kicking this up to the $65,000 level. This would involve a rework of our existing template for our Get Bit! Pirate Stickers but the art/look would be similar. Of course the pirate meeples are wooden and NOT the plastic figures shown below. These would be included in ALL copies of the game for all backers at no extra charge!\n\n75 k -Shark/Dolphin Die Mini Expansion for all backers at $18 or higher!\nThis is a single D6 Die that will have on it the numbers 2-5 as well as a number 0 (with a shark) and a number 9 with a dolphin. This shark/dolphin die would be fun for the first person to lose a man off the edge to roll a single time. If it is a 0 then he loses his guy for good and cannot do anything (eaten by the shark), if a number 2-5 comes in it is good luck for him, he can move that many pirates one length toward the edge of the plank, but cannot use it to push anyone overboard. If the #9 comes up with the dolphin, it is extremely good loock and his man actually gets pushed back onto the plank, but remains on the last plank spot. Additionally no one can play the \"shorten the plank\" on the round after the #9 comes up to protect this one man for one round.\n\n85k Stretch reward, NOW just $75 K!: Squid Die Mini Expansion\nThis mini expansion is essentially a single die, just like the $55 k stretch reward. Die will have 6 sides, with The Calm Sea (3 sides), Tidal Wave (2 sides), Kraken (Squid) on one side. It is rolled any time someone falls off the end. Calm Sea nothing happens, Tidal Wave pushes all pirates that are furthest off the plank back toward the ship and Squid would mean anyone on the very last plank is pulled off into the sea by the monster!\n99 k - Future Bonus Stretch Reward to be Announced Soon!

We'll continue to take preorders (and once it's printed, we'll have information on where you can buy it) - just check out http://www.cantripgames.com/storywar!\nStory War is a storytelling party game for 3 to 8 players. Players split into teams and take control of classic characters like Puss In Boots or a fire-breathing Dragon and use creativity and humor to defeat the opposing team.\nIn most other games the difference between victory and defeat has a lot to do with numbers; the story itself is secondary. But in Story War controlling the narrative is the only way to win. There are no numbers or rules on the cards, only artwork and hilarious descriptions. It's up to the players to decide how to interpret their powers, which means that every game tells unique stories based on the collective creativity of everyone involved.\nHow does it work?\nEach turn represents one battle between two teams of players. The setting is defined by a randomly drawn Battlefield card. Players then look at the Warrior cards and Item cards in their hands and try to come up with a clever strategy. Once every player has played their Warrior cards face-down, everyone flips their cards over simultaneously. Then players must quickly describe, in an open discussion, how their team would defeat the opposing team.\nEach battle is moderated by a judge that rotates every turn (similar to Apples to Apples) so the shared pop cultural context of everyone in the room is very important! Harry Potter fans might play the Basilisk card differently than Percy Jackson fans. Pokemon fans can cite obscure typing match-ups to explain why you can't punch a bird. Dungeons and Dragons players will often overlay D&D rules onto the game - don't even try to convince a D&D-playing judge that the Giant can defeat the Dwarf!\nPlayers are also free to make stuff up, as long as they can be convincing! Everything is being moderated by a judge so if your opponent claims their character is unrealistically powerful, you can challenge that claim. Once a challenge has been issued the judge has to immediately decide whether or not it's a valid move. This means your characters are able to do anything as long as the judge lets you get  away with it! The player acting as the judge and the grouping of teams changes after every turn, so the social dynamic is always shifting! Each battle ultimately evolves into an organic story and a memorable shared experience.\nWhat kind of stories are told?\nStory War was designed from the ground up with inclusiveness in mind. It can be played by anyone and different groups will tell different kinds of stories. If you're playing with gamers the stories are often more combat focused and if you're playing with writers, stories tend to be more character-driven.\nWhen you play Story War with young kids, then you'll likely end up telling G-rated stories. But if you're playing with just adults, the stories can become serious, inappropriate and often very scientific - can Midas turn a Ghost into gold? (Story War also makes a great drinking game!)\nHere's some examples of some great stories that happened in playtesting:\n\"The Lich is the Lady Gaga of the underworld and used her Twitter followers to attack her hater: a Zombie.\" (played by @LeiaJ)\n\"The Leprechaun created so much gold that gold became worthless and his society became isolationist and crumbled.\" (played by Brad)\n\"The Imp used the Philosopher's Stone to transform the air around the Fairy into a bottle - a bottle is the Fairy's nemesis!\" (played by Nick)\n\"The Treant was a Tree of Cheem from Doctor Who. It was protected by The Doctor because it's a space minority.\" (played by Khadijah)\n\"The Mimic put on the Mythril Tux to go to a party with other classic D&D characters but he got kicked out because he's always getting drunk and throwing up treasure and everyone hates him.\" (played by strangers)\nWe've playtested Story War hundreds of times with a diverse balance of ages, genders, and skills. Our objective was to make every card as interesting and useful as possible while also keeping the game accessible to anyone. It's a game that you can pull out of your pocket in front of a group of friends (or strangers) and within minutes everyone will be laughing and having fun.\nWho is making Story War?\nCantrip Games! Which consists of Tom McLean, Brad O'Farrell and Vondell Swain. The initial concept came from months of Tom and Brad prototyping and play-testing different card game ideas until we found something interesting. We knew Story War would require fantastic character design skills and hundreds of pieces of art so we hired Vondell Swain, who is only 19 years old but annoyingly talented at everything. We've spent the last 6 months writing, drawing, designing and playtesting. Now we need your help to finally publish Story War!\nBy becoming a backer of Story War, you'll get to have creative input on the expansion cards! We'll be posting unfinished sketches and concepts in our backers-only update section and welcoming feedback. Story War is a game for everybody, so it's really helpful for us to gather feedback from as many people as possible.\nBut also, backers get cool stuff! Read the list of options on the right side of the page for a full list of rewards. Here is more information about those rewards:\nPrint-and-Play Pack\nFor $10, you'll get a \"print-and-play\" PDF containing all the cards in Story War that you can print out on your own as soon as the campaign ends! (This PDF will also be available at all higher reward tiers.)\nBasic Pack\nFor $25, we'll ship you a physical copy of the Story War base set, which contains 100 cards and the rules. This set is already finished so we'll begin printing it as soon as the campaign ends. This is the game we've spent the last 6 months developing, and it includes cards such as:\nWarriors: Lich, Puss In Boots, Cherub\nBattlefields: Beanstalk, Capital City, Sky Port\nItems: Shrink Ray, Flame Bow, Bramble Seed\nHero Pack\nFor $40 you'll be sent a copy of the Story War base set as soon as it's printed and you'll also get a second shipment containing the expansion deck once it's completed. The expansion deck is less focused on Greek mythology and fairytales and more focused on Asian mythology, science fiction, and niche fantasy concepts.\nThe expansion deck will include at least 50 cards, but we'll add more cards as we get more funding! It will hopefully be expanded to 100 extra cards if we reach our funding goals!  We'll be able to develop the expansion deck much faster than the original deck because we'll have more resources and we'll be able to hire additional artists. But we've already begun working on it! Here are some of the cards it will include:\nWarriors: Oni (a Japanese demon), Kraken, Kami (a Japanese spirit)\nBattlefields: Lunar Colony, Labyrinth, Mystery Mansion \nItems: Philosopher's Stone, Bottomless Top Hat, Super Cape\nDeluxe Pack\nFor $60 you'll get everything listed above AND your copy of Story War will include a bunch of cool comics and exclusive cards! We've added a LOT to the Deluxe Pack since the project launched and unfortunately we can't edit the reward description. But if you back at $60, you won't just get the 5 cards mentioned in the reward description, you'll get ALL of the cards shown below:\nThese licensed cards are Kickstarter exclusives and they will NOT be sold later. The only way we're allowed to make them is as Kickstarter rewards.\nYou'll also get a bunch of \"blank\" cards - that is, cards you can write and draw on and shuffle into your Story War deck! They have the same backing as regular cards, so you can use them just as you would use any other card.\nCustom Cards\nFor $100 or more we'll make a custom card, just for you! Read the reward descriptions on the side-bar for more details! The lowest tier for custom cards is $100, where we'll redraw the Witch or Wizard card to resemble you. At the highest tier, we'll make a custom card based on you that will be included in EVERYBODY's copy of the expansion - the Dwarf card is an example of a card that's based on a real person (Brad O'Farrell, the creator of Story War!)\nShipping\nShipping is included in the cost of the cards, but backers outside the US will have to pay an additional $10. Story War will be printed immediately after this campaign ends and be shipped as soon as it's printed. But the Expansion Deck and any custom cards will be shipped separately  a few months later, after they've been completed.\nTo avoid paying for international shipping twice, we'll hold international orders until the complete order has arrived; if you're an international backer and you'd prefer two shipments instead of one delayed shipment please add an additional $10 to your order.\nStory War is already finished. We've spent the last 6 months playtesting, writing, and illustrating cards, printing prototype copies, and paying our artist out of pocket. We have a complete game of 100 cards and it's super fun! We only need $20,000 to recoup our losses and print the first run of the game. But if we raise over  $20,000, there are so many awesome things we could add to Story War!\nWhat would additional funds add to the game?\nExpansion Deck: We're planning to make at least 50 extra cards for the Expansion Deck, but we'd love to make a full 100 card expansion! That would mean, when combined with the base set, there'd be a full 200 cards! More cards means more random match-ups, which means greater variety between games! \nGame Modes: We've only ever playtested the game using a single set of rules, but we designed the cards to work with a lot of different styles of play. Game Modes would be new rules that you could print out and use with the standard Story War cards. If we raise enough money we'll develop these new Game Modes and distribute them for free.\nCampaigns: Campaigns are one-time-use stories that involve unexpected plot twists that affect the gameplay! These would also be distributed for free. A campaign would be printed out and given to a player who would act as the judge for the entire game. Think of it like watching a suspenseful movie with your friends, but you're also controlling what happens next!\nOnline Multiplayer Client: Story War actually started out as an online game that we first playtested using a chatroom robot. We decided to develop Story War into a card game for simplicity, but we always knew we wanted to ultimately make an online version. Everyone involved in this card game is also a video game programmer and we're very capable of making a high quality online version of Story War. We think the best implementation might be a webcam-based game using Google Plus Hangouts. But doing so would take a lot of time and energy and resources, so we've set it as our highest goal.\nHere are the milestones we're hoping to reach:\nFUNDED! Thank you so much everybody! The game is definitely going to ship now! We've also unlocked at least 50 cards for the expansion deck! More will be unlocked as we reach our stretch goals!\nWhoa! We hit our first stretch goal way faster than expected! This means the number of cards in the expansion (for everybody who backed with $40 or more) increases from 50 to 60! If we reach all of our stretch goals, the expansion will be a full 100 card deck!\nAwesome, our first game mode has been unlocked! \nIt's called Myth Master! It uses all the same cards as Story War and is structured similarly, the key difference is that you are playing as yourself manifested into the battlefield and you are summoning Warriors from the cards in your hand. The ultimate objective isn\u2019t just to take out the other player\u2019s Warriors, it\u2019s to take out the human player who is controlling them, just like in Magic the Gathering, YuGiOh, and the Pokemon manga*!\nSo now that we\u2019ve hit $30k, I\u2019m going to spend the next few weeks playtesting the Myth Master rule set and refining it and then packaging it in an easy-to-understand PDF rule sheet that you can print out for free!\n(* in the Pokemon manga the objective of battle is often to kill the other trainer, it\u2019s pretty metal)\nAwesome, 10 more expansion cards added! We're now up to 70 cards in the expansion deck! But we also have a SPECIAL SURPRISE:\nWe've teamed up with our KICKSTARTER PALS, the Machine of Death, to release a cross-over game mode these special bonus cards only available to backers of both projects:\nThe Machine of Death card in Story War can be used to predict your opponent\u2019s death with just a single drop of blood; the Story War card in Machine of Death can be used to redeem something from a fairy tale. Both cards stand alone as usable items in both games, but they become even cooler when you combine the two games!\nCan a vampire die of cancer? What if it\u2019s sunlight from the Cancer constellation? Using the Machine of Death\u2019s cause-of-death predictions on fantasy characters adds a whole new level of creative challenge to the gameplay of both games! We\u2019ll post more about the crossover rules later on in the campaign!\nWow, we just hit our $40k stretch goal, which unlocks a 5 pack of campaigns! What are campaigns? They\u2019re a single sheet of rule variations that you can print out and read from top to bottom as you play the game. Here\u2019s some examples of what a campaign could contain:\nA choose-your-own adventure style storyline, that uses cards from the player\u2019s hands to fill in unknown variables, where the story\u2019s path changes depending on the outcome of the battle!\nA list of 20 numbered alternate victory conditions for battle (\u201cWoo the princess!\u201d \u201cWin an election!\u201d \u201cDefeat the opponent without drawing blood!\u201d \u201cWin a go-kart race!\u201d) that you could use with a 20-sided die!\nA one-time-use storyline that plays out like an elaborate shaggy dog story with a big twist at the end!\n\nThe best thing about campaigns? We\u2019ll be releasing some that we make ourselves, but players are free to create their own and share them with other players! We\u2019ll even come up with a convenient way for players to share their campaigns with one another.\nHow\u2019s that for re-playability?\nWait we - somehow hit THREE stretch goals in a single 24 hour period? How is that possible! So at $45k we unlock another 10 cards for the expansion, bringing us up to 80 expansion cards! There's only two stretch goals left before we have a full 100 card expansion deck!\nWe've also figured out a good solution for scaling up art production for our higher level reward tiers, so we've DOUBLED the number of available Magic Packs, which continues to be one of our most popular rewards!\nWhoa, we're halfway to $100k! That's so awesome!\nAt $50k we\u2019ve unlocked a new game mode called Conquest Kingdoms. This is a pretty big deviation from the way Story War is typically played! We wanted to make a game mode that focuses on Battlefield cards as more than just a background thing. So we came up with this idea: Let each team choose a Battlefield card that is treated as a base that the other team must capture. That means things like structural stability and environmental advantages and potential booby traps really come into play!\nOutside of the overall concept (which sounds super fun!) the specific rules for this mode are still up in the air! But now that we\u2019ve gotten $50k in funding, we can afford to actually playtest it and find the best possible rules! Once we\u2019ve finalized the rules for the Conquest Kingdoms game mode, we\u2019ll release them online for free as a downloadable PDF!\nWow! Heck! Wow! We went from $40k to $60k in 24 hours! Do you know what that means? We gained the entire necessary funding amount in a single day! The whole $20k, wow!\nWe also added 10 cards to the expansion, bringing us up to 90! If you want to join the discussion which cards we add to the expansion, head over to the comments section on update #7!\nHoly cow! $70k! in the first 10 days! That means we've unlocked new campaigns written by Cantrip Games, but ALSO we have an exciting announcement relating to campaigns:\nWe're going to build a website where users can write their own interactive campaigns that can be viewed on mobile devices. That is to say, when you're playing Story War with your friends in real life, someone could load CantripGames.com on their smart phone and you'll be able to jump right into alternate game modes and rules that are displayed right there on your phone! No printing necessary! Online campaigns can even even contain interactive components and rich media, like photos, video, and branching story paths.\nWe'll be putting all of our campaigns online for free, and also offer printable versions of ones that would make sense as printed versions. We're also going to make it so users can post their campaigns online for free! It's going to be really cool!\nWow, $80k, that means the expansion is complete! We now have a FULL 100 card expansion! This means you can play the expansion as its own game! We'll develop the expansions with the input from our backers, so be sure to check the updates section for more details! \n\"Objection! It's impossible that my client, the Vampire, could've killed the victim - the crime HAD to have taken place during the DAYTIME!\"\nTrial Tales is a Story War game mode we're developing that turns the concept of \"proving your character can defeat another character\" on it's head - instead the objective is to prove your innocence! It's like Nursrey Crimes meets Phoenix Wright!\nThe players on the left and right of the current judge act as the Attorney and Prosecutor who must defend Warrior cards that represent their client and the victim, respectively. Each subsequent player is a witness/suspect. The Battlefield cards art as crime scenes, and the Item cards act as evidence!\nStory War is largely about choosing your Warrior cards, but Trial Tales is all about evidence (Item cards). The prosecutor and defense attorney will have a hand full of evidence cards that they could choose to play or not to play, based on which ones they think would better suit their narrative. Remember, even if you're the one who submits an Item into evidence, it can still be used against you by the other side!\nWe'll be playtesting this mode until we have a solid set of rules nailed down, then we'll release those rules for free. Also $90k! We had a huge bump this week thanks to Hank and Emmy!\nHey, it\u2019s Tom here! Shortly after Brad pitched me the idea for Story War, I threw together an IRC bot that could play it. (IRC is a really old chat platform that nowadays is only really used by hackers and time travellers from the 90s) Even with no art, hastily-scrawled descriptions, and totally un-thought-out characters and locations, we realised this game was a blast.\nIt turns out that a heck of a lot of you think it\u2019s a pretty cool game idea, too, because as of just a little while ago two-and-a-bit thousand of you have helped us hit our $100k stretch goal - and we\u2019re not even halfway into the campaign yet! Amazing!\nSo, it means that, once the Kickstarter wraps up, I\u2019m going to start bringing this old IRC bot into the twenty tens, including lovely graphics, chat, and video! At the moment we\u2019re looking at building it as an add-on to Google+ Hangouts, which means the webcam-based communication elements will already be there for us; we\u2019ve just got to get the game happening!\nIt\u2019s going to be a fair bit of work, so it certainly not going to be live when the kickstarter ends or anything (plus I\u2019ve got to put together the print-and-play stuff first!), but we\u2019ll keep you posted on the progress. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll end up playing it with at least some of you, so I look forward to seeing you on Google+!\nWow, we hit that stretch goal super fast! To celebrate, here are a preview of four of our favorite items in the base set!\nNow that we've hit the \"base set upgrade\" we're going to include some of the features of the DELUXE PACK in the BASIC PACK: The basic pack will now include a sampling of blank cards that users can draw on, as well as it's own mini-comic that will contain different comics from the DELUXE PACK version. These rewards *stack* too, so if you ordered the DELUXE PACK you're also getting everything in the BASIC PACK as well, which means you'll have even more blank cards and even more comics.\n\"Medusa and the Gargoyle would be a PERFECT couple, come on! He's already stone, so she can't turn him to stone and her snake hair can't hurt him. His cold priestly heart would be warmed by her fiery diva attitude. Plus they look so cute together!\"\nKiss & Make Up is our newest game mode - another way to play with the Story War cards. Rather than trying to figure out \"who would win in a fight\" you're trying to convince another player to go out with you in a sea of competing suitors.\nIt's structured similar to The Bachelor - the 'judge' has a Warrior card that everyone else is trying to woo. Then every other player makes their case for why their Warrior is the best match for the judge's Warrior - and they can use Battlefield cards to suggest date locations, and Item cards as romantic gifts.\nThe Warriors are all fighters, the Items art mostly weapons, and the Battlefields are pretty hazardous - but volatile creatures need love too! Isn't that the whole point of Sex And The City?\nThe weekly webcomic has been unlocked! Which means we're going to start posting weekly comics featuring the Story War characters on the Cantrip Games blog! Comics will often be based on actual battles and they can even be submitted by players themselves! The whole world is a writer's room - any time you're playing a game of Story War, every single turn has the potential to become a comic that can be disseminated to other Story War fans. So that's pretty cool!\nStory War hit $180k last night, which means we\u2019ve unlocked a new Game Mode called Hero\u2019s Saga!\nThe basic idea is this: Rather than playing as a new Warrior every round, you play through the entire game as a single Warrior who gets stronger after every battle. There are two ways your Warrior can get stronger: By acquiring \u201cSkill Cards\u201d which are Warrior cards interpreted as learned abilities (for example, if you play the Red Dragon as a Skill Card on your Witch you could reasonably argue it gives her the power to cast fire spells) and by acquiring Item cards that could be re-used in every future battle without penalty.\nThis is our most ambitious and complex Game Mode yet! Once we\u2019ve thoroughly playtested it and worked out all the kinks, we\u2019ll release the rules as a free PDF to all of our backers!\nThat's it, that's the animated short. No I'm kidding the real animated short will be much more animated and much less short. But I am fairly certain it'll star these characters, all of whom have turned out to be fan favorites. We're already talking to some animators and voice actors and music people and animation studios. It's going to be an actual thing and you guys are going to love it!\nEndless Journey is a new game mode that pushes Story War a little closer to Dungeons and Dragons than Apples to Apples - you'll be playing an allied team of Warriors (decked out with magic items, of course) fighting \"against the deck\" rather than each other!\nEndless Journey will be developed with the intention of having it be played as recurring sessions with continuity between them rather than just a once-off game, and we'll be releasing updates once a month that will affect your epic as it develops!\nWe made it! The final stretch goal, until we demolished it way ahead of time and had to come up with extras!\nSo it looks like now we'll be getting the ball rolling in developing a mobile adaptation of Story War! We're not exactly sure what form it'll take just yet, as it's a pretty big undertaking, but we'll keep you posted as we figure it out!\nWe've received a lot of messages about using Story War in schools, and kid-friendliness was an intentional goal of the project from really early on! Now that it's been successful beyond even our most ambitious guesses, we're going to pay some of that good fortune forward by giving away a hundred copies of Story War for use in classrooms!\nPlease spread the word and try to get your friends to back Story War and help us reach these stretch goals! We can't do it without your help!\nThe song in the video is \"Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues\" by Anamanaguchi, used with permission. All the artwork was made by Vondell Swain.

We've gotten some price quotes from a few major card printers and distributors and we are ready to start printing as soon as the campaign ends.\n \nThe only real potential setback is getting the art for the expansions done fast enough - especially if we get a lot of custom artwork orders. We've been talking to some people that we'd like to bring on board as additional artists so we can work faster, but we have to wait until after the campaign ends to get any formal deal in place.\n\nWe've also partnered with Breadpig, who have assisted with several large Kickstarter endeavors in the past few months - like Ryan Norths' \"To Be Or Not To Be\" book and Zachary Weiner's \"Science\" book.

Nobody knows just how it works, but it\u2019s always, always right. (You may recognize this concept from our #1 bestselling short story collection, which is also titled, COINCIDENTALLY, Machine of Death.)\nThe book was about exploring the existential ramifications of the existence of the machine in worlds otherwise much like our own. It\u2019s a thoughtful, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, meditation on fate.\nThe GAME is about flinging SHARKS from CATAPULTS in order to kill imaginary people. It\u2019s basically a game of Mousetrap or a Road Runner cartoon, except that it\u2019s TOTALLY WITHIN THE RULES to create a QUICKSAND GENERATOR in a TREEHOUSE in order to DROWN A CHILD.

They will go free (digitally or physically) to every backer. They will not become part of the permanent game; they'll become a separate expansion pack, but if you pledge during the Kickstarter, you'll get that pack tossed in your shipment for free. They will be of various different card types.\nBlank game cards \u2013 these were unlocked by the 90K goal and are now part of the permanent game! These allow you to customize your own copy of the game, if you like. Each base game will come with 20 blank cards of various types, and you can buy extra packs later on too.\nExpansion cards \u2013 these are six sets of 50 additional death cards that can add variety to your game, and 100 Intel cards featuring target details. You can get them \u00e0 la carte on our Add-On page, or get the SIDECAR tier, which gives you a second game box containing all the expansion cards that this campaign creates. (The Deluxe Box gets you all these cards as well.)\nBacker-created cards \u2013 these are cards created by backers to the INFAMY, TYCOON, and FROM ABOVE tiers. They're permanently added to the game as well!\nAll told, right this moment there are over 900 total cards available!! Here's a more detailed description and breakdown:\n\nFeel free to take advantage of our Add-On page! This is in case you want some stuff \u00e0 la carte, things we haven\u2019t included in the rewards \u2013 different T-shirts, multiple copies of the game, etc. If you want to Add On something to your pledge, here\u2019s how:\nFirst, start with a pledge tier that has some of the stuff you want. For example, if you want the game plus a different T-shirt, you\u2019ll want \u201cGOT PLAYED\u201d, which is just the game itself. This is your \u201cbase tier\u201d.\nGo to our Add-On page and select the other stuff you want. (In this example, you\u2019d select the different T-shirt.) The Add-On page will then show you the amount you need to ADD ON to your pledge to get the T-shirt.\nCome back here and make or increase your pledge. Select your base tier \u2013 in the example, \u201cGOT PLAYED\u201d \u2013 and then manually add the additional amount from the Add-On page. This way your single pledge can cover both the base tier and your add-on stuff. (International buyers do have to pay both shipping charges, sorry!) Go on to confirm your pledge.\nBack on the Add-On page, submit the form there so we get your Add-On information! This is transmitted to us separately, but we need both that form and your Kickstarter pledge, otherwise we can't match things up and matters get all sideways.\nIt\u2019s a little complicated, but so is life. If you have questions you can message me through Kickstarter, or leave a comment on this update. Or, email us via the MOD site.\nYou can also use the Add-On page to calculate how to make a pledge to the campaign via PayPal, if you can\u2019t (or would rather not) use Kickstarter. But those pledges won\u2019t appear on our Kickstarter page, so we\u2019d prefer that method to be a second choice, and used only if necessary. \nHooray for TECHNOLOGY!\nI\u2019m David Malki ! \u2013 I\u2019m the creator of the comic strip Wondermark, as well as one of the editors of the original Machine of Death book and its upcoming sequel, This is How You Die (coming out in July). Ever since I first designed and printed a series of death prediction cards as a promotion for the book, I knew it felt like there was a game in this concept eager to come out. Over the last year and a half, I\u2019ve been writing, play-testing, tweaking, play-testing again, conferring with friends and experts, tweaking further...and now, I have something I\u2019m really, really proud to share with you.\nMy friend Kris Straub, the creator of Chainsawsuit and Broodhollow and one of the talents behind Penny Arcade\u2019s Blamimations, helped me refine the rules, and did a ton of original art for the game. All the characters and logos on the cards are his. Kris and I have had a lot of fun playing this game \u2013 it can get really wacky really quickly.\nIt didn't work.\nWe\u2019ve also enlisted our friends to write jokes and help playtest: Ryan North, Zachary Sigelko, Matthew Bennardo, James Sutter, and many others. So tucked into one tidy package is the combined creative efforts of many fine individuals!\nMachine of Death, the book, was a 2010 story collection, based on a Dinosaur Comic by Ryan North. It contained 34 short stories by writers from all over the world, and the day it was released, it shot to #1 on Amazon \u2013 the first independent anthology ever to do so. It was later named one of Amazon\u2019s Top 10 Customer Favorites for sci-fi & fantasy in 2010.\nThis photo is from when we offered the book to a bird\nSince then, the book\u2019s gone through seven printings and been translated into eight languages! We\u2019ve gone on to stage fun events all over the US and Canada, and at one of them in 2011, we opened submissions for a second volume. \nNow, after receiving nearly 2,000 stories from writers on all seven continents, we\u2019re excitedly awaiting the release of This is How You Die, due out this July from Grand Central Publishing.\nNever were there a more handsome pair of siblings.\nSo the game\u2019s an adaptation of the books?\nYes and no. Every story in the books is independent of the others \u2013 each individual world explores the idea of the death-predicting machine, but doesn\u2019t otherwise share continuity with any of the others. Machine of Death stories have been set in the past, present, or future; have featured machines large, small, or in-between; have told stories of the machine\u2019s invention, or postulated a world in which the machine is old and forgotten.\nThe game is the same way. It doesn\u2019t reference any existing story in particular. If you can picture a machine that can predict how you\u2019ll die, that's all you need! You\u2019re now 100% caught up and can dive right into the game. (Of course, if you\u2019d like to read our book anyway, it\u2019s available as a free PDF and audiobook podcast on our site.)\nThe game where you can do ANYTHING, including THESE THINGS\nObviously you can get the game itself! We also have a digital-only version in case you want to print it yourself. Above that, you can get copies of our book; a Kickstarter-exclusive T-shirt & poster; and even a fancy Deluxe Edition game box.\nIn the game, you get \u201cBlack Market Gift Cards\u201d to obtain various types of items to use in your assassination plans. For example, you can buy animals using a gift card to the smelly beastporium known as Zoo-in-a-Can! (Just off I-210 at Haven.) While allegations of health code violations at Zoo-in-a-Can have yet to be proven, our Zoo-in-a-Can T-shirt may have started its life as white.\nOur custom-made wooden Deluxe Edition game boxes feature individual laser-etched numbering and come with, in addition to the base game and any stretch goal cards, all expansion cards available separately (in other words, every single card, no matter what). It also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by me & Kris, and a blank Assassination Mission Log for you to record the best details of all of your games \u2013 fitted into a hand-crafted box that holds everything perfectly!\nWe've also added the Sidecar Box \u2013 a second game box containing all the expansion cards. The base game comes with ~300 cards, and now thanks to stretch goals, every backer will be getting Webcomics Pals cards too. The Sidecar Box gives you a place to put the Webcomics Pals cards, and also included will be every expansion card available \u2013 no matter how many are added \u2013 for a flat price. Currently this is 300 additional death cards + 100 Intel Cards.\nSo either the Deluxe Box, or the base game + Sidecar Box, will get you every game card we offer in this Kickstarter!\nthe can would have to be quite large\nmmm, needs more stuff going on\nEvery box is HAND MADE by a FUTURE CORPSE\nThere are also ways that you can INSERT YOURSELF into the game, by contributing new death cards that'll become part of the game itself, or getting a likeness of yourself (drawn by Kris) in the manual as a victim! And perhaps MOST EXCITINGLY, we\u2019ve gotten approval from Grand Central to offer a small handful of ADVANCE COPIES of This is How You Die. :O\nFirst off, we\u2019ll be really, really thrilled! Creating the game has been such a fun process and I'm so excited to share it with you in this way. But we\u2019re hoping this game can become EVEN MORE great, through stretch goals. We\u2019re hoping to improve the packaging with a cooler box; add cards to the game; get comics artists to contribute special cards; and be able to print & give away additional stuff to all backers (including previews of the upcoming book This is How You Die).\nBut one thing at a time. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if we come to it! If it does happen, THIS IS THE POINT ON THE PAGE WHERE WE\u2019LL DISCUSS IT.\nUPDATE: IT HAPPENED \u2013 and we moved the stretch goals up near the top of the page!\nZach wrote this joke.\nOver the nearly a decade that I\u2019ve been doing webcomics, I\u2019ve designed and shepherded to production dozens of books and different types of products \u2013 mostly my own, but I also work for TopatoCo heading up their book production department. I\u2019ve had a hand in designing and printing books for Questionable Content, AmazingSuperPowers, Dinosaur Comics, Nedroid, Gunshow, This Modern World, Homestuck, and, most elaborately, the recent Sweet Bro & Hella Jeff super-weird limited hardcover. So I\u2019ll be using that experience and vendor contacts to make this game something really nice that you\u2019ll be proud to own.\nI\u2019ll also be working with TopatoCo\u2019s new subsidiary, Make That Thing, a dedicated fulfillment agency specifically for campaigns like this. TopatoCo has a warehouse full of people who do nothing but receive pallets and ship packages all day long for over fifty of the internet\u2019s top artists (including me, Kris, and Ryan). So they and I will be working together to ensure that all the products and rewards from this campaign will be produced and shipped to you as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nI AM! I'm GONNA make that thing!!\nThat\u2019s cool, I totally understand! I\u2019m the same way. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 I wanted to make a game that lets me do the things I like to do anyway: tell crazy stories with my friends, make up ridiculous and absurd scenarios for us to laugh about, and generally GET CLOSER AND BOND with OTHER HUMAN BEINGS through the HEALING POWER OF LAUGHTER.\nIt may be shocking to assert that a card game that is essentially about MURDER can accomplish that. NONETHELESS, I HAVE ASSERTED IT. I\u2019m the sort of guy who can\u2019t let an idea go \u2013 when it occurs to me, I have to chase it, I have to wrestle it into submission, I have to make it real. And I\u2019m a perfectionist. So it is SO gratifying to start with a vague idea, spend a lot of time and effort carefully crafting it into something that I think is really fun and special, and then see it come to fruition. \nThrough this campaign, I\u2019ll get to see if people agree with me that this sounds like a pretty fun thing! I\u2019m nervous but EXCITED because I know this game is great. I really hope you think so too!\nWith YOUR help...this game WILL exist!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve got a lot of experience working with complicated designs and printing companies, so I\u2019m confident that I can shepherd this from prototype to actual finished product. However, one of the doors we\u2019re leaving open is the option of adding extra content to the game (depending on how the campaign does), which means it might take some extra time getting all that created & collected. In the last couple of years, I\u2019ve put together two anthologies with over 60 contributors each, so I understand the coordination this sort of thing requires, and I'll be doing my best to stay on top of it.\n\nIn addition, because we\u2019ll be printing overseas, it\u2019s possible there will be shipping delays, due to customs or other elements out of our control. To try and mitigate that risk, we\u2019ve built in some buffer time to our expected delivery dates, and so if all goes well, we\u2019re in a good position to beat those estimates. In addition, we\u2019re working with a manufacturer who does this sort of thing all the time, so hopefully there shouldn\u2019t be many surprises.\n\nIf this campaign does extraordinarily well, we\u2019re ready for it -- the warehousing and fulfillment staff at TopatoCo/Make That Thing has been shipping hundreds of packages a day since 2003.\n\nIf a meteor falls on my house the day the Kickstarter ends, I don\u2019t know that I have a plan in place to surmount that particular challenge \u2013 but I will certainly have a long list of people (all of you) who should definitely NOT IN ANY WAY be considered suspects.

These are not never-to-be-worn t-shirts, we guarantee. These are the real deal.

We just need 23,000 more backers.\nSo, starting right now, we're adding an official $1 donor level. Get your friends to climb aboard, and help us make history! Also, starting today, Kickstarter backers are going to begin receiving exclusive for-your-eyes only content. You can get in on that with a simple $1 pledge! (And of course, if you've already donated, you're already on the exclusive update gravy wagon.) Plus, there'll be a backers-only treat tomorrow. I promise.\nYou guys are the best. Keep it up. Our love is epic. - Rob\nMarch 13\nWell, there's no other way to say it: wow. We asked for help, and you came through in the biggest way. It's hard to believe how fast we shattered some of Kickstarter's biggest records, but that's what you guys do. Us? We're just excited and grateful, and thrilled that so many of you want to go back to Neptune with us. But you know what? Now that we know what's possible, there's more work to do. $2,000,000 is just the beginning! We've got 30 days, and the more we raise, the bigger and better this movie will be. So, let's not pop the cork on this champagne yet. We still need you! Please keep it up, and we'll keep working to deserve your support.\n- Rob\n11 hours, you guys? Seriously? It only took you 11 HOURS to cross 2 million dollars? You speedy little marshmallows :) Words can't even express how excited we are. You came through, and I'll keep my promise too. We're going to make the best Veronica Mars movie anyone ever made, and the movie YOU deserve. Because YOU made this happen. But there's still time, and the more we raise, the better we can make it. All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen.

Well now you can!\n3Doodler is the world\u2019s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It\u2019s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes.\nThe latest model 3Doodler\nOh, and it\u2019s also the most affordable way to 3D print\u2026 by a looong way! With 3Doodler we\u2019re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.\nHow does it work?\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\n3Doodler in action\nAs 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.\n3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can\u2019t wait to see what you 3Doodle!\nSix little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler!\nWhat can I make with 3Doodler? \nThere are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including:\nBasic 3D shapes and 3D models\nJewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments\nDecorative art and fridge magnets\nPersonalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.)\nA mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men\nAnd much much more\u2026\n3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work.\n3Doodler \"stencils\"\nWe\u2019re particularly excited about 3Doodler \"stencils\" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We\u2019ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free.\n2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil\nWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere.\nThe Sellers of Etsy Special\nWe're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. \nWire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com\nWire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com)\nBud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.\n\nNakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly.\nWire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com)\nWire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com)\nMore to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support!\n3Doodler Components & Accessories:\nThe pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v.\nThe evolution of 3Doodler\n3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary.\nThe Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its \"ink\" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler.\nSome suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic\nABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a \"bioplastic\". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nWe plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model!\nFun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling.\nThe Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun...\nPete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler\nWe have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we\u2019ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we\u2019re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have!\n*The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

We held back so that we could ensure the prototype worked perfectly (check out the video, it does!) and so that we could speak to more factories (and make related visits to Hong Kong and China). Comfortable that we can deliver this, we\u2019re now launching 3Doodler! \n\nBelow are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:\n\nChoice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale 3Doodler, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n \nQuality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Kickstarter will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will hand test each and every 3Doodler ourselves at 3Doodler HQ in Boston. If we received over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel, and with relayed video footage of each 3Doodler going through testing.\n\nThis is about getting the best possible 3Doodler into your hands ASAP.

But not here.  Here, in the many universes of Limit Theory, space is luminous, vibrant, and rich with opportunity.  Step into an open-world, sandbox universe in which you can explore, trade, pirate, mine, escort, hunt, defend, build, and more.\nIn brief, Limit Theory is:\nAn open-world space simulator / RPG\nA sandbox game : No story, no restrictions.\nCompletely procedural : A completely new universe is only a button-click away.\nInfinite : The game universe has no boundary.\nThird-Person or First-Person : Command your ship from within or without.\nDeep and intelligent : Engage in far more than just combat or trading.\nTwitch-Based : Aim and fire weaponry directly, as you would in a shooter.\nApproachable : Intuitive controls and slick interfaces ensure that playing will never feel like a job.\nStrategic : Command an entire fleet when you amass enough cash to purchase more ships.\nExtensively-Customizable : Outfit your ship, fleet, and space stations with whatever equipment you choose.\nSingle Player : A universe built just for you, that no one else will ever get to see (unless you choose to share it with them!)\nBeautiful and Atmospheric : Gaze in awe at a universe as diverse, vibrant, and uniquely-atmospheric as your dreams.\nSound like something you might want to play?  Then read on.\nEnjoy your Freedom Among the Stars\nLike any good space sim, Limit Theory offers you the chance to explore a vast universe, prospect and mine minerals in asteroid fields, take jobs as a patrolman, escort, bounty hunter, courier, etc, or become a pirate and hijack convoys.\nCommand a Fleet ... Or Many.\nWhen you've acquired enough wealth, hire other pilots and purchase more ships. Customize and outfit your fleet with whatever weaponry and equipment you desire, then fly alongside your armada in combat, or send them off to explore, trade, or conquer while you attend to other affairs. No restrictions are placed on the number of ships that you can own. A wealthy player can play the game much like an RTS, achieving victory from afar.\nBuild Your Empire.\nBuy or construct buildings on planet surfaces as well as stations in space. Acquire mines, factories, trading outposts, and more. Set up production chains to build guns, munitions, or even new ships. When hauling goods for a profit gets old, why not try manufacturing the goods instead?\nInteract with a Living Universe.\nExperience a rich variety of interactions with an artificial intelligence that actively explores, trades, works, and lives just as you do. Just because the game is single player doesn't mean you'll be alone. Take jobs, strike deals, and become friends with the inhabitants of the universe. Need an escort to get you through a particularly dangerous stretch of space? Call up the mercenary that you met last week on a station a few systems away. Need just a tad more ore to get the furnaces of your new factory cranking? Call up your old pals from your days as a miner, and offer them a nice price for finding what you need.\nA rich social interaction system is key to making Limit Theory more than the average single player experience. With the ability to keep track of and build relationships with the non-player characters that you meet in the universe, a whole new world of gameplay opens up, allowing for a wealth of creative ways to achieve success without ever having to arm your missile bays! (Although, to be realistic, you'll still probably end up doing so a few times...)\nIn a universe of such freedom, how will you spend your time?  Here are just a few of the possibilities:\nYou are a Merchant.  You have explored the farthest reaches of the universe, and know exactly where and for what price anything can be bought. For the right price, you can move anything. You supply what is demanded, and demand what you deserve - which is substantial...because you do so much more than move goods. You supply the universe.\nYou are an Admiral.  You command a ship that dwarfs everything in sight. Frigates and cruisers hover about you, pretending to offer protection, but you don't need it. At the first sight of an enemy, hundreds of bolts carrying terrawatts of energy pour out of your ship, vaporizing the unwanted presence in seconds. Slowly and steadily, you drift from system to system, steamrolling those who oppose your authority. You conquer the universe.\nYou are an Explorer.  You move quickly between systems in a nimble ship. With a keen eye and even keener sensing technology, you pick up all the details that everyone else misses. Selling ore locations to miners, enemy ship locations to warring factions, and uncharted system locations to aspiring empire-builders, you broker your knowledge to those that are ignorant of the beautiful and bountiful universe around them. You uncover the universe.\nYou are a Pirate.  That's what they call you, but you prefer to think of yourself as an \"opportunist,\" because, when the opportunity arises, you can and will take what you want, unlike those bound by the chains of law. Your home station resides in dense, unscannable clouds of dust. In this dark blanket of matter, you are untouchable by the arrogant hands of the law. You exploit the universe.\nYou are a Wingman.  You fly alongside hulking ships that make your fighter look trivial. But you aren't. You are critical. You know where and when the ambush will come - you've seen it a thousand times before. You know that they'll go for the engines first, and that, while they're doing so, you'll acquire a perfect lock on their fuel tanks. The pirates think it will all be over in a few minutes. They're wrong. It'll be over in seconds, but not how they anticipate.  You protect the universe.\nYou are a Miner.  You can spot the shimmering reflection off of asteroids a lightyear away. You know the color and composition of each and every raw ore that the generous galaxy provides. In the deepest, darkest corners of space, you harvest that which will become warheads, turrets, and even ships. You are the very heart that pumps blood through the arteries of the universe. You create the universe.\nYou are Everything.  Life is not black-and-white, and neither is your career. You can't devote your life to one profession. And that's fine, because Limit Theory won't make you. All of the above are options - but you won't find a checkbox for selecting which life to lead. The universe is yours for the taking, and your time therein will be whatever you choose to make of it.\nIt's Infinite.\nNo matter how far out into the universe you delve, you will never find an edge. The algorithms behind the universe have been designed very carefully, such that they are mathematically-guaranteed to generate universes of infinite size, each and every time. What's more, each universe has a unique number associated with it - a \"seed\" - that defines it entirely. By sharing that seed number with someone else, you can both explore and experience the exact same universe!\nIt's Totally Procedural.\nWell, almost...the music and sound effects will be hand-made. But everything you see will be procedural. Planets, nebulae, stars, asteroids, ships, stations, textures, and so on. Thanks to cutting-edge procedural generation technology, Limit Theory will have the ability to keep providing you with new experiences. No matter how long you play, there will always be more to explore, see, learn, and conquer!\nEvery mission, every event, and every asset that you encounter in game will be unique - and it won't be the same next time you play. You'll never \"beat\" the game, nor will you ever know it like the back of your hand. When you feel that it has become too familiar, all you must do is click \"New Game,\" and you will once again be completely lost.\nIt's All About the Interaction.\nLT will focus heavily on bringing the universe to life with a deep and powerful AI engine that includes advanced, high-level planning. You aren't the only one trying to make your way in the universe, and your path will regularly cross with others that are trying to do the same - for better or for worse.\nIt's All About You.\nLimit Theory will not offer a story, a campaign, or a guiding direction of any sort. You are unique, so isn't it best that you craft your own unique story, rather than live out a pre-fabricated one?\nHere are some screenshots from the current prototype. They're straight out of the game, except for the small border and logo text at the bottom.\n.\nLimit Theory is far from a wide-eyed dream! After only three months of full-time work, I've brought LT from a mere idea to the well-underway game that you see here. Furthermore, much of the three months was spent developing core engine technology, since the engine is being built from scratch.\nAt this stage, much of the graphics technology has been completed, most of the core engine is in place, and many of the procedural algorithms are well underway. Gameplay is the largest part of what remains, and I fully intend to make gameplay my burning focus for the rest of the development process. Gameplay is king, I recognize that! Limit Theory will not be about graphics (although they will be good!). It will be about gameplay. Deep, rich, engaging gameplay, just like the space sim genre deserves.\nThe planned release date is Early 2014. That may seem like quite a while, but I'm not interested in making unrealistic promises, and, to be realistic, LT is going to take a lot of work. But if my work so far represents only three months, can you imagine what another year-and-some will do, especially given that much of the engine heavy-lifting is finished?\nI hope you'll help me find out where the project will be in a year!\nHi! I'm Josh Parnell, the one-man team that's going to bring you Limit Theory! I'm a passionate game programmer with a particular love for graphics, space, procedural content, and open worlds. I guess you can see why I'm excited about this project :)\nI currently study computer graphics at Stanford, but that doesn't stop me from working 40 hours a week on LT. I absolutely love working on the game - expanding the features, making it more beautiful, and discovering new algorithms for creating bigger and better content to fill the universe.\nI grew up playing games like the Elder Scrolls series (Morrowind will always have my heart!!), the Egosoft X series, Freelancer, and various Star Wars titles. All of them inspired and left me with a burning desire to someday build my own world - free, open, procedural, and infinite. So I devoted myself to studying graphics and procedural generation technology. And here I am, years later, finally ready. I'm ready to realize my dream. I'm ready to bring you a space sim that will inspire and excite you - and allow you to live out all those grand sci-fi adventures!\nI definitely feel most at home when I'm engulfed in my code.  I've been coding since I was 10 (that was 10 years ago, for those who are wondering..), and since then, c++ has become just about as much of a first language to me as English!  Going for a week without coding makes me uneasy.  Good thing I've always got LT to work on these days :)\nI love taking on projects that seem insurmountable. Perhaps the most exciting thing in the world for me is taking on something that seems impossible, hammering away at it for hundreds of hours, and ending up with a beautiful result. As an example, I did this last year when I won the grand prize at the 2012 Stanford Rendering competition by writing a GPU-accelerated renderer (using MC path tracing) from scratch. Here's the award-winning image produced by said renderer:\nStanford Rendering Competition 2012 ~ Grand Prize Image\nThat's exactly what I intend to do with Limit Theory. I have pitched you something that probably sounds impossible, or too hard for one young developer. And it seemed like that to me too, when I first started. But now, I can see that Limit Theory is just like any of my other projects: it will require extreme devotion, untold hours, and endless perseverance, but it is very much possible.\n\"Judge me by my size, do you?  And well you should not.  For my ally is the force, and a powerful ally it is.\" ~ Yoda\nI may not have the name, but I promise you, I have the passion!  Please, I urge you, don't judge me by my lack of reputation. Judge me by what you see here. Judge me by the quality of this content. Keep in mind that I have far fewer distractions than high-profile game designers. That being said, I also have far fewer resources...which is why I need your help!\nGive me a chance, and I will give you a universe :]  (Well, actually, infinitely many universes...!)\n[ $20 + ] The Game.\nGood choice. Get a downloadable, DRM-free copy of the game so that you can hop into your ship and start exploring the endless universe(s) the day it comes out.\n[ $30 + ] The Soundtrack, The Book.\nDownload the maximum-quality version of the Limit Theory Original Soundtrack (composed by yours truly), as well as a digital copy of \"Architecture of a Universe,\" the making-of book with development shots, commentary, and details concerning the technical magic that makes Limit Theory possible.\n[ $40 + ] The Hitchhiker's Maps\nThe universes of Limit Theory are big. Infinitely so. If you're going to make your way around, it sure would be nice to have a map. We've got you covered. The Hitchhiker's Map will give you information concerning the starting regions of a handful of different universes. You'll see planets, space stations, asteroid fields, jump gates and jump holes, and more.\nWith these digital maps in hand, you'll start with a leg up on finding your fortune in the stars!\n[ $50 + ] The Hitchhiker's Guides\nMaps are good, but insider information is even better. Many Bothans died to bring you this detailed information. The Hitchhiker's Guide, much like the Hitchhiker's Map, will give you a wealth of information concerning a handful of universes. Unlike the maps, however, these guides will include detailed  planetary economic data, planetary point-of-interest data (including goods bought/sold, ships manufactured, etc), locations of rich ore fields, optimal trade routes, faction dispositions, and more.\n[ $60 + ] The BETA.\nBe the first to explore the infinite expanse of the Limit Theory universe(s). You'll get access to a closed BETA well before the game's official release. Voice your opinion, and you may just have a significant impact on the game!\n[ $75 + ] The Prototype(s).\nIf you can't wait long enough for the BETA, that's okay...because at this tier, you'll receive exclusive access to a PRE-ALPHA combat prototype/playable demo, coming in early 2013. You'll be among the first players in the world to experience the epic fleet combat of Limit Theory! You'll also get the chance to provide me with feedback, so if you don't like something, you'll be in a good position to get it changed long before release.\nWhile I'm only officially promising one prototype, there's a lot of cool technology in Limit Theory that I want to show off and have tested by real players. I anticipate releasing more than one prototype, because there's a lot more than just combat that needs early testing! At this level, you get access to any and all prototypes that I decide to release.\n[ $100 + ] The Discs.\nGet your hands on a shiny new copy of both the game and the soundtrack on custom CDs. At this tier, you will get the custom discs in sleeves. These are only available through this Kickstarter offer, so your CDs will be truly limited-edition!\n[ $150 + ] The Box, The Credits.\nNot only will you get a physical copy of the game and soundtrack, but also a custom physical game box, adorned with beautiful Limit Theory artwork. But that's not all. Open up that box, shove that CD in the drive, run the game and click \"credits\"...and what do you know? There you are. Your name, immortalized in Limit Theory history under \"supporters.\"\n[ $200 + ] The Map, The Signatures.\nIncluded in your physical Limit Theory box, you will find a physical map of Universe 3827, the default starting universe for new players (of course, since the universe is infinite, the map cannot be complete!) Never take a road trip to a foreign system without a map in hand! While other players wander around in the (metaphorical) dark, you'll be whipping across systems, doing business as you please without ever having to wonder where you are. Note that this map will show at least twice as much as the Hitchhiker's Map version (and of course, it's physical)!\nMoreover, you will also find that both the map and box have been signed by your dev team (me)!\n[ $250 + ] The T-Shirt.\nCDs and boxes and maps are all good and well...but when you want to show off your support in a flashier, more stylish way, you're going to need a shirt. Not just any shirt, though. You're going to need something that says \"hey, I'm all about unbounded space exploration, and that's why you should come over here and talk to me.\" How better to do so than by having a little slice of an infinite universe slathered across your chest?\nMock-Up of Limit Theory T-Shirt\nIn all likelihood, there will be multiple awesome designs to choose from by the time I'm ready to ship the shirts, so it's entirely likely that you'll end up looking even cooler than you're imagining right now as you picture yourself in this extravagant cosmic drapery.\n[ $300 + ] The Poster, The Signature.\nOkay, so your chest is covered, your disc drive is full, your box shelf is boxed, and your map shelf is mapped. But what about your wall? It's probably feeling a little left out in the cold. But you can fix that. How about adorning it with a large, signed, numbered Limit Theory poster, printed on high-quality, glossy poster paper?\n[ $400 + ] ??? TOP-SECRET SCHEMATICS ???\nGet your hands on an ORIGINAL, ONE-OF-A-KIND \"idea sheet\" from the development process, signed and dated by me. I write down all of my best ideas regarding technical features as soon as they come to me. You will receive a laminated, one-of-a-kind element from this set of notes! Unfortunately, I only have a limited number of grand ideas...lucky for you, that means you'll own a truly-unique piece of LT history (and possibly have the blueprints of a technological aspect of the game that has not been publicly disclosed)! I'll also include a historical explanation of whatever is on the tech report, and summarize how and why it was such an important achievement.  Unlock secrets ranging from the algorithm for constructing a universe of guaranteed-infinite size, to the mechanisms that allow AI players to formulate and pursue high-level goals and aspirations!\nNote that higher-level tiers include one schematic each.\n[ $500 + ] The Physical Book\nGet a printed, hardcover, limited edition copy of \"Architecture of a Universe,\" signed and numbered by me, including a personal message of thanks.The book will be of the utmost quality, printed on high-grade, premium paper with a hardcover. It will also include extra content not found in the downloadable version, most likely in the form of extra details concerning the magical secrets behind Limit Theory technology!\n[ $1,000 Exclusive ] The Custom Edition.\nI will write a CUSTOM VERSION of Limit Theory JUST FOR YOU!  In it, I will include a small-to-medium feature of your request that did not appear in the publicly-released version. I will be willing to extend the code by a few thousand lines for your personal edition, which will result in a cool new feature for you and only you to play with! Of course, you could also just request a bunch of minor cosmetic changes (like having your name appear on menus, changing the appearance of lasers, nebulae, or planets, or perhaps making the NPCs have Star Wars names...), since those take very little time.\n[ $1,000 + ] The Elder Council.\nI've given you all that I have to offer in the way of physical goods. But it's not the end. At this level, you gain membership to the Limit Theory Elder Council, a VIP group of high-tier backers that will be given special privileges, including regular interaction and meetings with me, as well as exclusive content updates that will not be released to the general public. Such updates will include videos of new features, work-in-progress screenshots, and perhaps even playable demos!\nAs a member of the council, your word will be taken very seriously, and I will make suggestions made by council members a top priority. Your words will carry significantly more weight than the average forum-goer's, and, as such, you'll be given a special rank on the Limit Theory forums to identify you as a member of the council.\nIn addition to being able to voice your opinion individually, the council will also get chances to vote as a collective on features that should be prioritized, major game design decisions, and general matters of high importance.\nFinally, your status in the Limit Theory credits will be upgraded from \"supporter\" to \"Elder Council.\" Your name will, of course, be more prominent than those of the non-council supporters.\n\nCan I Pledge Without Kickstarter?\nYes, I've set up a PayPal page for doing so here. Unfortunately, due to limitations with PayPal, I can only offer one tier, so you will only be able to select the $20 tier. Please note that you WILL be refunded if you pledge via PayPal and we do not meet our Kickstarter goal!\nWill it be on Mac/Linux?\nIf we hit the stretch goal, then yes, definitely!  Otherwise, I will make porting an immediate priority after release, but cannot guarantee a Mac/Linux port.  However, the codebase is completely portable, so I wouldn't anticipate any problems doing so.\nCan you Land on Planets?\nVery much so.  In fact, much of the deep gameplay will involve planet activity.  More information to come in future Kickstarter updates!\nWhat About Space Stations?\nYes, of course there will be landable space stations that will, like planets, be the core of much deep gameplay.  Conceptually, they aren't much different from planets, except that they have a different aesthetic and can be destroyed.\nAre Planet Landings Seamless?\nYou decide!  Right now, the plan is to have a transition between space and planetary surfaces.  But if you'd like to be able to fly straight from space to the planet surface, without ever having to see a loading screen or fade-out, then help me hit that stretch goal!  The goal will be announced when we get closer to the appropriate level.\nCan You Get Out of Your Ship and Walk Around?\nNo, not this time around.  Someday, whether in an expansion, LT II, or whatever.  This is one of my most revered dream features, but I have been realistic in choosing what I can and can't implement within a reasonable time frame, and I don't feel comfortable that I could do justice to this feature in a reasonable amount of time.\nWhat Engine Does the Game Use?\nI have written the engine from scratch using C++ and OpenGL.  I felt that it was the right choice for several reasons.  First, it allows me to develop my own unique style - something that games using prefab engines often fail to create.  Second, and most importantly, the engine is designed completely around procedural paradigms, and this influences the architecture of the engine in many ways.  Every file is written with \"everything procedural\" in mind.\nWhat Does the Name Mean?\nThe founders of the Ancient Colony were idealists.  They conjectured - long before the advent of space travel, long even before the rise of technology - that all limitations are merely illusions.  Physical, mental, emotional...every limit is simply a misunderstanding.  A failure of the mind.  Anything and everything can be overcome with the right thought, the right idea, the right insight.  This philosophy became known as Limit Theory, and it prevailed throughout the ages.  It was idealistic and unrealistic, but it drove them forward.  It pushed them to distant lands, to the corners of the Ancient Planet, into space, and, ultimately, to the furthest reaches of the universe.  Limit Theory is the theory that limits do not exist.  It is not only the philosophy of the Ancient Colonists, but also of your developer.  The game is the ultimate embodiment of the Limit Theory ideal - that one can be, and should be, free of all limitation.\nHow Will you Distribute?\nThe usual: Steam, Desura, proprietary online download system (if necessary).\nWhy Isn't There an Option to Have In-Game Planets/Stations/Systems/... Named After Backers?\nI thought long and hard about this one.  It seems to be the norm for Kickstarter projects these days, to have backers included in the game in some way more than just the credits.  While I am eternally grateful to my backers, I feel that I must place the utmost importance on creating an immersive experience.  Backer names will no doubt seem out-of-place, perhaps even jarring, to players in the game world.  In addition, the naming systems in the game use a system that is far more complex than a simple random list, so that names have certain characteristics based on faction and region.  There's simply no way to integrate backer names into the game without breaking the immersive, procedural experience that I want Limit Theory to be!  But you can certainly get a shout-out in the credits!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLimit Theory is a large undertaking..I won't deny it! I certainly wouldn't blame you for questioning whether a single young programmer could fulfill what may seem like a AAA-grade promise. But the key difference here is in assets. Limit Theory has no assets - they are procedurally generated - which means all I really have to worry about is algorithms and gameplay.\n\nSince Limit Theory is totally procedural, I don't have to spend day after day modeling new ships or painting new background textures. When I spend a day working on a procedural algorithm, not only does it enhance the quality of one asset, it enhances the quality of EVERY asset of that kind in the game. This is really an incredibly efficient development process. The problem of building an entire game of assets becomes the problem of building an algorithm to construct a single type of asset. It's this sweeping simplification of game development that allows me to work quickly enough to build Limit Theory as a one man team.\n\nNow, you might be skeptical. You might think that everything will look the same after a while, perhaps because you've seen poorly-done procedural content before. But that's not the way it has to be. That's not a fundamental property of PCG. Procedural algorithms can be as complex, diverse, and varied as the author allows them to be. Since they are at the heart of Limit Theory, you can rest assured that I will be spending countless hours advancing and tuning the algorithms to make sure that they produce high-quality yet diverse content.\n\nSo there you have it. At the risk of sounding ludicrous, my claim to you is that building Limit Theory is easy. I build an algorithm for planets, ships, background nebulae, asteroids, stations, etc...and then I build the gameplay. I recognize that the latter, in particular, is quite a complex task, which is why I have allotted over a year for it.\n\nWith procedural algorithms and an endless supply of coffee by my side, I will face the challenge of building Limit Theory, and I can't wait to show you the result :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "The End", "update_content": "It is with a heart of lead that I write this announcement.

During her time here, Lindsey built up an impressive procedural geometry library that I'll be able to leverage in finishing up the remaining algorithms.

The original Populous hailed from the 8-bit era but GODUS will use the most modern technology the world has to offer. \nAnd you can help us make it!\nAs a god your destiny is to spread your influence throughout the world. But you are only as powerful as your following. Using your ability to sculpt the land, you can create a habitable environment that will allow a population of believers to flourish. In your crafted utopia you can grow as a god in the face of various challenges that affect the population. You can watch hundreds of individual followers live out their lives with dynamic and captivating behavior. If you choose to spread out and conquer more lands however, you will confront other gods with their own civilizations of followers. There is only room for one god, so prepare to guide your worshippers into battle by altering the world around them with your god powers, then watch your followers reign victorious across the world.\nHalf a living sandbox world, and half a strategy game, players can choose to explore the power of the almighty however they wish. Whether it\u2019s granting the power of life and blossoming the world around your believers, or using godly powers to wreak havoc via natural disasters to defeat the armies of other gods, prepare for the Ultimate God Game: Single Player, Multiplayer, Cross-Platform gameplay, sandbox worlds, strategic battles, living populations, and the power to create, change, and destroy the very structure of the world.\nAn essential part of GODUS is single player. We all love to take the time to hone our godly powers before venturing into the exciting multiplayer wars with other gods.\nIt\u2019s a living world, unique and detailed. And it\u2019s a world you influence, whether you\u2019re good or evil.\nGODUS is instantly accessible, easy to learn but immensely deep.\nAs you flourish and build your own cult, you\u2019ll engage in pitched battles with other gods and their cults. It\u2019s a multiplayer power-struggle the way it should be.\nGODUS draws on the cunning battle-psychology of Dungeon Keeper, the living, changing world of Black & White and the instinctive, satisfying gameplay of Populous.\nPlus you get to be a god. In fact, play well and you get to be the ultimate god!\nGODUS will be developed for the Mac, PC and Mobile devices, we hope to be able to add more platforms as our Kickstarter campaign progresses.\nClick here to back us\nWe are a proudly independent company founded in March 2012, and we\u2019re passionate about creating the next generation of innovative digital entertainment. We believe that a great team with great ideas can lead to great success, and, driven by true innovation and creativity, we\u2019re determined to make some truly unique products.\n22cans has been set up with our own personal savings and the talented team we\u2019ve assembled has already built and released the bizarrely popular Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube. But we need funding to continue, and rather than partner with a publisher, we\u2019re keen to explore the exciting new Kickstarter platform. It means we can stay independent and it gives you the opportunity to have a voice in the development of GODUS.\nOur backgrounds include Bullfrog Productions, Lionhead Studios, Electronic Arts, Microsoft and many others. Most of us have been developing computer games for a long time, and we\u2019ve worked on titles such as Populous, Syndicate, Theme Park, Theme Hospital, Magic Carpet, Dungeon Keeper, Black & White, Fable, The Movies, Risen, Moshi Monsters, Sniper Elite V2, and Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube of course.\nOne member of our team is Tim Rance, who in 1989 as Technical Director for Electronic Arts worked on the two-player multiplayer feature for the original Populous as it was released for DOS (those of you unfamiliar, it's the version before Windows). We also have people from Rockstar London, Mind Candy and several other places we really can't mention. Paul McLaughlin has worked with Peter on every Bullfrog game since Populous.\nWe\u2019re a talented team, highly experienced at playing and creating games and it\u2019s fair to say we\u2019re extremely passionate about them. Plus we love the idea of using Kickstarter to fund GODUS. Why? We\u2019ll tell you\u2026\nWith GODUS we want to make a game in a culture of openness, co-operation and honesty. Creating a game involves imagination and passion, and we\u2019re keen to share the experience. So we want to make GODUS with you watching and, we hope, participating. Funding it via Kickstarter allows us to stay a small independent team with unlimited freedom in our creativity. It\u2019ll just be you, us and our unbridled dedication (no publishers).\nYou see, although GODUS is a new idea, we\u2019re keen to return to the spirit which started it all. In 1989, in a small, cramped office in Guildford, England, a hard-working and enthusiastic duo experimented, collaborated, took risks and came up with Populous, a game which would become a legend and which would launch the god game genre. \nWe\u2019re going to make GODUS in that same spirit. And your support will enable you to be involved at every stage as we share everything we do and learn with you. We\u2019ll produce video diaries, blogs, live streams, developer chats and a great deal more. We aim to end up with a truly delightful game and as you play it, you\u2019ll be able to say that you also played your part in its very creation.\nWe\u2019ll fund an experienced team of 22 people to make GODUS. That\u2019s not a big team \u2013 we\u2019re doing this efficiently. But we\u2019re committed to quality, so we\u2019ll create outstanding gameplay, characters, artwork, animations, sound and music, and the very world itself. With your help we\u2019ll turn our great idea into successful reality.\nWe need \u00a3450,000 to do this. Yes, games typically cost more than that to make, but we\u2019re sticking to a small, highly effective team and we\u2019ll be employing careful management to keep the project on track and get the most out of our funding.\nGodus Avatars for our backers\nGODUS will take seven to nine months to complete, but if we exceed the amount of funding we\u2019re asking for, we\u2019ll use the extra to enhance the game further and support additional platforms which will add a little more time to the development schedule. Should we find ourselves in that happy situation, as a thank you, we\u2019ll collaborate with you to implement the ideas and features you love the most.\nWhat do you get for pledging? The full details are just over there, on the right. As you\u2019d expect, the greater your support, the more you\u2019ll get in return. But everyone who pledges will be able not only to watch as the game takes shape and get cool stuff, they\u2019ll also be able to influence its design. During GODUS\u2019s development there will be many instances where specific decisions need to be taken and choices made. As a valued supporter we see you as part of the Project, so you\u2019ll be able to suggest, comment and vote to determine many elements of the game. As you\u2019ll discover, designing games is intriguing.\nDepending where you are are in the world, you might start thinking about Thanksgiving and even Christmas soon. We\u2019ve got you covered...any gamers you know, people who maybe even played the original Populous or Dungeon Keeper, you can now get them a very special gift.\nHere's a visual indication of the exciting items you will receive in return for your generosity:\nWe would love to hear from you. We have a website, can also be found and liked on Facebook and we also send out little updates of 140 characters or less on Twitter.\nOur Peter Molyneux can also be found on Twitter @pmolyneux.\nOf course we\u2019ll continuously update this page until we've finished and released GODUS, we will also listen to what you have to say and refine our Kickstarter page  accordingly.\nThank you so much for helping us make GODUS. If you are unable to back and pledge (but we really hope you can help us make GODUS a reality with however small an amount) then sharing this page with your friends and family would be wonderful too. \nWith your help we will make GODUS a reality and reinvent the entire god game genre.\nDigital Add-Ons:\nDigital Download Gift Pack. Receive an acorn that you can plant in your home-world, and over time a tree will grow. You will also get to reserve a name for your own clan and you'll get your own world flag for your Homeworld! +\u00a37 (approximately $11)\nDigital Soundtrack +\u00a310 (approximately $16)\nExtra GODUS beta access +\u00a310 (approximately $16)\nPhysical Add-Ons:\n(Requires the base pledge to be at the \u00a35 tier or above. Any pledge that ends up including a physical reward will require \u00a310 for international shipping, unless it has already been included in the base pledge (e.g \u00a360+). You will only have to pay shipping once.\n22cans tee-shirt +\u00a316 (approximately $26)\nGODUS tee-shirt +\u00a316 (approximately $26)\nPrinted, Exclusive GODUS artwork +\u00a320 (approximately $32)\nTo add an add-on to your pledge, follow these steps:\nPlease click on the 'Manage Your Pledge' button on this page. If you have not pledged yet it will say 'Back this Project'.\nIncrease your pledge in the 'Pledge Amount' by the total of the add-ons you want.\nYou do not need to change the tier you are currently pledging for. If you want to do so, you will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you have choosen.\nWe will send all our backers a survey at the end of our Kickstarter campaign that will ask you which add-ons you want.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenge is to reinvent a genre and make a great game in a short space of time. We\u2019ll only release GODUS once it\u2019s the fantastic game we know it can be. And we want to get it into the hands of players in less than a year from now. GODUS is going to be powerful, unique and rather wonderful, and luckily we\u2019re going to be able to draw on our Kickstarter backers to beta test it with us. Yes, if you back it, you can help us finish GODUS and we\u2019ll have taken another huge step towards the big game which will be the culmination of 22cans\u2019 22 experiments.\n\n22cans has a lot of game industry veterans so we know the risks \u2013 GODUS will be using new technology and that has to be tested and perfected. Balancing and bug-testing the game will also take time. And there are many other factors; for example, Curiosity \u2013 what\u2019s inside the cube showed us what happens when everyone wants to engage with your product online at the same time. We learnt a lot from that in a very short space of time.\n\nFinally, trying Kickstarter is itself a risk. Our backers deserve a great game they\u2019ve funded, seen in through its development and helped create.

Customisation stretch goal announced.\nPhysical reward tier details, reward tier changes: New tiers!\nA design for the t-shirt and a brand new video. Take a look!\nWe've announced a multiplayer stretch goal at \u00a380,000. Please help us get there!\nWe're funded! Thanks, everyone. Check out our stretch goals just here. Three of them have already been unlocked.\nYou can find all our other updates, including our gameplay video, over here.\nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a single-player first-person game of desperate survival in a world where mechanical aristocrats hunt humans for sport.\nOur game world is brought to life by what we call The British Countryside Generator: a procedural engine that means that every player gets a different experience. We can generate the islands on which the action takes place in mere seconds, creating unique, highly detailed environments and an experience that is different each time you play. Thanks to the work we've done with this engine, Sir, You Are Being Hunted takes place in a recognizably British landscape, the inhabitants of which are a mockery of the aristocratic gent and his ecosystem.\nWe love our weird heritage of British science fiction and horror, and we're aiming to bring it to life with some of the best tools that game development has to offer.\nRobots meet and drink tea in abandoned villages, poachers lurk in reed-beds, and red-eyed hounds patrol the moor: these are the things you will be dealing with as you fight for survival across our open-world environments.\nSir, You Are Being Hunted gathers up elements of our favourite things: exploration, non-linearity, AI interaction, survival, robots, sinister butlers, and hot drinks, and blends them into a rich pixelly pulp.\nCombat is a big part of the game, but choose your battles wisely. This is primarily a challenge of brainy stealth: so flee across the countryside, hide in dense woodland, and sneak into villages to loot the haunted buildings for biscuits and shotgun shells. The approach you take in escaping the island is up to you.\nAnd do be careful: you are being hunted.  \nGentlemen automata hunt humans for sport.\nWhat Are The Key Game Features? \nSir, You Are Being Hunted is a first-person game set in an open world. Your mission is to escape from the archipelago on which you have been stranded. That means surviving being hunted, looting abandoned buildings, and collecting up scattered fragments of a mysterious machine which should enable you to get home. \nSir, You Are Being Hunted includes: \nProcedural tools to generate, save, and explore your own landscapes.\nOpen-ended gameplay: choose how you want to play. Complete the game non-lethally, or use whatever you can find to bring down the tweedbot menace. \nA Thief-style visibility-meter combined with our own foliage-based stealth system. \nUnique generative soundtrack. \nA disembodied sinister butler! \nPubs! \nNo DRM! \nVaried loot including weapons, traps, booze, marmalade, tea, something that may or may not be bacon, and a dead rabbit. \nFires to cook that rabbit on. (And other things besides!) \nMac, Windows and Linux versions. \nStrange lore and pipe-smoking moustache-wearing mechanical locals. \nPlease note that all of what we've listed here is already present in our prototype, but much of it is currently in a early, undeveloped state. Kickstarter will help us deliver the game with final, professional art. It already looks pretty good, but we want it to look and sound breath-taking. \nHunters stalk the player through crop fields.\nWhat Will Kickstarter Money Do? \nThe target we're aiming for here is going to allow us to complete the task that we've already put so much time and effort into. We've invested so much in the prototype, as you can see in these screenshots and videos, but they nevertheless contain lots of placeholder material - particularly in animation and audio - and now we need your help to make that into a full-fledged game. \nWe don't have a full time artist, so Kickstarter money will be vital to helping us commission the art and animation we need to fill the game up with exciting assets: new biomes to explore, new buildings to explore, more robots to flee from and do battle against, more strange things to collect up and pack your inventory with. Most importantly, we need money to tweak the systems that will bring this project to life: the robots themselves. \nThe robots need quality animations, and lots of them, which does not come cheap. They also need better-developed AI, which is all about giving our two programmers more time with their tools. Furnishing our robots with intelligence and personality is no simple task, and we need time and money to get on with it. This project is about us making the kind of game we want to play, and as experienced and dedicated gamers, we know that this is the kind of game many of you will want to play, too. It's an open-ended experience which you'll decide the pace and direction of as you play. \nThe better we do here on Kickstarter, the deeper that experience will become in the finished game. \nShotguns get a fair bit of use.\nBut Who Are You Guys? \nBig Robot consists of two full-time team members, two part-time team members, and a small supporting cast of artists. We've already produced two games: generative music sequencer puzzle game AVSEQ, which you can find on Steam, and Fallen City, a BIMA-award nominated educational game about the value of cities which was commissioned by Channel 4. You can find that freely available on the C4 website. \nJim Rossignol initially founded Big Robot to produce the Channel 4-commissioned educational game, Fallen City, and then went on to focus on projects based on generative and procedural design, thanks to his creative work with Tom Betts. Jim is a veteran games journalist and author of the book This Gaming Life, which was published by the University Of Michigan in 2008. Many of you will already be familiar with him from his day job at the PC-gaming website Rock, Paper, Shotgun, or from his time writing for outlets such as PC Gamer or Wired magazine. Jim is the creative lead on Sir, You Are Being Hunted, and is responsible for the overall direction of the project. \nJames Carey is our lead designer and production co-ordinator. You may know him from his work on Bohemia Interative's Arma II, his time at Total War devs, The Creative Assembly, or from our own previous games Fallen City and AVSEQ. James has a hand in all aspects of the game, and is particularly interested in simulationist approaches to design. \nThe man behind the majority of the maths involved is Tom Betts, a veteran programmer with a keen interest in generative and procedural systems. Tom designed and wrote our generative music puzzle game AVSEQ, and has been working on digital installations and in videogame academia for many years. Tom's work is what powers our procedural world generation, and he has also created a generative music system which will be furnished by audio from digital artist Andy Holbrook. \nDan Puzey, who has been our consultant programmer, helping with all aspect of the project, is a lead architect for a major commercial software company. We've been enormously lucky to have him working with us in his spare time. \nOur art needs have been met by a small team of talented freelancers. Talented indie devs Frogames' lead artist Christophe Canon has helped produce 3D models and textures, while Martin Davies (PC Gamer contributor and talented illustrator) has produced our beautiful hand-drawn 2D art and UI elements. Sir, You Are Being Hunted is being made in Unity Pro, with our own procedural terrain engine, the British Countryside Generator. \nBleak British landscapes are generated automagically.\nWhat About Stretch Goals? \nStretch goals are additional features that we can promise if we hit higher levels of funding, now that the \u00a340,000 goal has been reached. Here's what we're planning.\n\u00a345,000 - The Landowner UNLOCKED\nAt this amount we'll be expanding our NPC roster with \u201cThe Landowner.\u201d This chap is an aberrant mechanical ultra-toff. He's a leader among hunters, and the nightmare gaze of his glowing monocle means near-certain death, and at the very least lots of peril. With The Landowner in play, the player is truly in trouble \u2013 his tracking skills and his riflemanship are peerless. Fear him.\n\u00a350,000 - Hunting! UNLOCKED\nThis stretch goal will allow us to include additional wildlife-slaying functionality. You will be able to hunt pheasants and rabbits and then cook them for sustenance. This will provide a complementary mode of survival for players aside from scavenging, as well as furnishing the world of Sir with more life. (And death.)\n\u00a355,000 - The Castle Biome UNLOCKED\nA completely new island type on which a ruined castle is procedurally generated across the entire island. This will provide the game with both a radically different terrain, and an atmospheric arena in which to be systematically hunted down and shot. (We're really excited about this one \u2013 more proc-gen makes Tom happy.)\n\u00a360,000 - Hot Air Balloon Spotter Patrols UNLOCKED\nThis will probably take a little bit of explaining. Basically, the robots will man a hot air balloon which will make passes over the islands. From there they'll be able to direct hunters on the ground, and take pot-shots at you if and when they spot you. This adds some verticality to think about, especially as balloons are silent most of the time. Keep your eyes on the skies! These balloon patrols might be slow moving, but they will provide platforms for the hunters to snipe and spot you over a large area at any one time, and as such should provide serious jeopardy.\n\u00a370,000 - The Riders UNLOCKED\n\nOur most ambitious NPCs will take on the form of a classic British fox hunt, one of the favoured bloodsports of the rich and landed. These red-coated rider robots will be the most merciless - and the fastest - hunters in the archipelago. Once they have you sighted, well, run, Fox, run. We're asking a bit more for this thanks to the additional complexity of riding characters, and we're certain they'll make the most exciting addition to our NPC arsenal.\n\n\u00a380,000 - Multiplayer UNLOCKED\n\nIt goes without saying that multiplayer is an extremely complex undertaking in its own right, and because the focus of Sir is on a single-player game, we are not going to promise multiplayer on release. We are a tiny team, and must hit one objective at time. What we will do, however, is provide a multiplayer component to all backers when this goal is unlocked, soon after the initial release of the game. We've had plans for multiplayer for a long time, and we agree with those of you who have suggested that some manner of multiplayer suits the nature of the game. \nCurrently we're planning a 4-player game, where the players can compete or co-operate with each other as they are hunted by the robots. Only one player can get off the island, and so winning will require getting others to sacrifice themselves, or you to sacrifice others. The choice, we hope, will be one that drives the game.\nWell, we can dream, eh?\n\u00a3100,000 - Character Customisation!\nThis is something that will benefit both the single-player game and the multi-player expansion to come. Right now we're planning a standard player avatar for multiplayer, and we hadn't anticipated any character creation for single-player. What we'd like to do, however, is to add character creation and customisation to the whole game, so that the avatar you create can appear in both your solo experience, and in whatever you do online.\nWhat this means is a character creation screen where you can name your avatar, customise their appearance \u2013 moustaches, tweeds, boots, monocles, and other accessories \u2013 so that you have a unique character in the game world. Furthermore you'll be able to choose a number of \u201ctalents\u201d that will have an affect in both the single and multi-player game. These will allow you to push your specialisation towards a particular direction: perhaps increasingly your constitution for a vitality bonus, or pushing up your stealth ability with the appropriate selection.\nThese won't be \u201cclasses\u201d or anything like that, but more like a couple of abilities from something like a talent tree. Small bonuses that push your advantages this way or that. This doesn't mean we're looking at other RPG elements \u2013 the game will still be about your skill and what you find in the world. It just allows you a little more depth in focusing how you want to play the game.\nBut there's more! This feature will allow us to add an optional (turn it off if you don't want to use it) third-person view. The game is still first-person, don't worry! We're just adding another option, which we hope will bring another layer of depth to the single-player game, and should help with stealth activities, as well as letting you see the character you have put together. We only have just over four days to unlock this final goal.\nLet's make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are challenges in any game design project, but we are formidably equipped to deal with them. Our team each have years of experience in their respective fields, and we've shipped two games - Fallen City for Channel 4 and AVSEQ on Steam - as a team. But more importantly: we are making the game we want to play. That alone means we cannot afford to fail.\n\nWe've already proven that the game can be made - we have a working prototype which you've probably already seen in the videos and images on this page - the challenge now is to polish that prototype into a mature and engaging experience: one that will be memorable and unusual. Our goal is to create something genuinely interesting, and we're well on the way to doing that.\n\nWith your help, we'll bring home a veritable trophy of a game.\n\nSo please Pledge!\n\nEvery dollar brings us closer to making this the game it deserves to be.

We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images. They can be found at higher resolution here:\n http://www.frontier.co.uk/elitedownloads/wallpapers/\n*All names must not be offensive, trademarks, or in any way problematic for us to include in the game, and must follow our naming guidelines.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStating the obvious, all projects, whether building a bridge, making a film, studying for an exam or whatever, carry risk. Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults. Continue to spread the word about Project Eternity, and let's see how big we can make The Endless Paths!\nWe're also pleased to announce we're supporting the Kicking It Forward initiative.\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

What I'd like to give back.\nUpdate #2: Sample pages from the PDF.\nUpdate #3: The finished card design:\nJust the facts, ma'am\nRight to the point: I want to design and print a deck of 69 large (3.5\"x5.75\"), full-color cards, each featuring an illustration from the Dictionnaire Infernal.  I'd also like to create a supplementary PDF for the deck, with all 69 card images and extended information about each.  If you're already familiar with the images I'm talking about, you can scroll down to the \"accountability\" section to see what this project would entail.\nIt's my hope that people will want this deck and PDF for all sorts of reasons. I mean, sure, there's the beautiful art -- but I'm aiming to create something that's useful for more than just looking at, too. I'm building a resource of art and information, for people that want inspiration for creating, or divination, or planning a gaming campaign. They might even be useful flash cards for Demonology 101. The beauty of it is that I get to restore something old, create something new, and then hear about all the wonderful things you can think of to do with it once it's released into the world.\nHere's where I get excited about history and process\n\u201cThere is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion.\u201d\nIf you look up Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy's Dictionnaire Infernal on Wikipedia (and many other sites on the web that have cut and pasted from Wikipedia), you'll see that \"perhaps the most famous is the edition of 1863, in which sixty-nine illustrations were added to the book.\"\nThat's not entirely accurate: there were really more than 500 illustrations added to that edition that weren't in the original 1818 copy. The French National Library have digitized the entire book (at a not-so-great resolution, in black and white instead of grayscale, but still) so you can see them all, if you like. But, in my opinion, the most interesting of those images are the 69 engravings (mostly of demons, but there's a couple of unnamed witches, too) signed by L.B. (Luis Breton). Those are the images Wikipedia is talking about, and that you may have seen reproduced in other books and websites.\nIt's no wonder that those are the engravings that get all the attention: they're lovely, and they're strange. They're probably lovely because they're so strange. These demons aren't pretty men and sexy ladies with batwings and horns pasted on, they're creatures with exaggerated, not-human proportions, or animal heads and limbs. So, when I got my hands on a copy of the book, I too wanted to pull out those 69 images and print a collection of some sort. And, because the images are over a century old and in the public domain, I can.\nNow, the images in the original book aren't very big. I don't mean scanned resolution in this case -- I mean the actual printed images are only a couple of inches square. Any larger reproductions you've seen have probably been redrawn (with varying degrees of detail), as there's only so much you can scale an image up (especially engravings) before the line weights start to look off. I don't want to redraw these images -- I think they're lovely at the intended scale, with incredible detail. What I want to do is restore the images -- clean up the bits of dust and dripped ink, bring out the shadows and highlights -- and then create design elements to bring everything together, incorporate the names of the demons, and add additional details and information.\nWhen I'm done, I'll have created a beautiful deck of 69 cards, one demon per, and a supplemental book that expands the tiny paragraph of information into something a bit more detailed.\nI hope this is where you come in. \nI'm looking at a fair bit of work, here, between the restoration of the images, design of the cards, and research for the book. And it's work that I love to do (and often get paid for), so I'm certainly not lacking the skills or enthusiasm. What I need is enough people saying \"yes, this is something we want\" to help pay for the time that's money and the print production costs for the finished cards.\nAccountability (what exactly are you paying for?)\nThere are 69 original images that need hours of work, each, to be print-ready. And a lot of that work is just \"oh, what's this weird spot, that needs to go\" -- but there's also level adjustment to bring out the shadows and highlights of the engravings, fixing broken lines, and then printing out the images to check the proofs and go back in for a second pass.\nThen, when I've got nice, crisp, clear images, there's designing the card fronts and backs. That's the graphic elements/ornaments, text layout, choosing quotes and information that works with each design (and fits in the allotted space)... and then printing out the images to check the proofs and go back in for a second pass. I'm going to leave that last bit off on the rest of these points, but you can assume that every step is going to have quality assurance.\nThe cards go off to the printers. I want good quality, glossy, rounded corner, professional-looking cards.  All the design in the world doesn't make a bit of difference if the finished project isn't on quality paper.\nBut that's not all! A short line of text on each card is great for design and mnemonic purposes, but there's so much more information available out there, just waiting to be bundled together.  So, each card will be placed on its own page in a PDF file, and accompanied by extended descriptions, so I can go into more detail.  These pages will be laid out like a physical book, edited and numbered with a linked table of contents for accessibility.\nI'm generally a bit wary of stretch goals, as they're often a bit vague to start. That said, if this project is wildly successful, I would love to keep going with the work I will have already done: there's the possibility of turning all of the images and information into a website, amending the PDF to create a physical book, perhaps even incorporating the images into other, larger posters and prints. \nTo sum up: at the very least, you'll get to come along with me as I put together something pretty.  I'll be posting updates with pictures and rants (probably more than a few rants, because let's be honest -- there's always gremlins when you're designing something new) as I go along, and I tend to get very chatty when I'm talking about design or research.  I can't promise you'll find out anything you didn't already know (especially any fellow designers out there), but it should be fun.  If you pledge a bit more, you'll be helping me offset the costs for print and shipping, as well as my time and energy (and coffee).\nAnd thank you!\nYour time is as valuable as mine, so thank you for taking the time to stop by, for reading all of this, and for considering my project.\n.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "Quick post for the creators out there:", "update_content": "So this one time I had an idea (I have ideas a lot) to go through and make some pretty cards out of a 17th century demonology text (I have CRAZY ideas a lot), which turned into a fun sort of Kickstarter project when I also started translating the text (my CRAZY ideas often turn crazier), which was way more successful than I really expected it to be (that doesn't as often happen), which attracted the attention of a publisher (whoa!), who changed the project's name (which I think was a little bit silly, but what can you do) and added some tasks to the to-do list (that ALWAYS happens), which made for a lot more work than I'd initially been expecting (yep), but was still a lot of fun (or else why would I?)... and now, even though the Kickstarter project of is coming to a close, another version of the book and deck will be out in November, called "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "LittleLittle Update", "update_content": "This should be the last update for today -- I am NOT going to turn this Kickstarter into spam central here at the end, because that would be a terrible conclusion.
