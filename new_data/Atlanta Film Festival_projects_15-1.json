[{"backer": "Atlanta Film Festival", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you for visiting our 2014 KickStarter campaign.\nEven though the campaign has ended, you can still visit FlipBooKit's homepage, where there's a place to purchase FlipBooKits, a \"Maker Tool\" and many downloadable animations that can go into your very own FlipBooKit!\nThe Back-Story:\nAfter touring their mechanical flipbook art at galleries, expos and maker-faires, Artists Wendy Marvel and Mark Rosen were encouraged to create a kit version. They recruited their friend and ace-inventor Steve Goldstein, and together designed an old-tyme analog animation kit for everyone that included simple online tools\nFlipBooKit first launched on Kickstarter in late 2012 and has since delivered over 5000 old-tyme hand-cranked, flip-display kits. They continue to provide a free online \"make-your-own\" flip-animation tool, and most recently have been hosting FlipBooKit art shows with animated submissions from all over the world. Currently Wendy and Mark are preparing new creations for a 2015 exhibition of their mechanical flip book art.\nReducing Costs and Building Local Partnerships\nThe original version of FlipBooKit was a bit costly to produce and that fancy black boxed version is still available at the FlipBooKit.com online store - but new designs and cost-saving ideas have been a near obsession for us.\nThe newly designed FlipBooKit components are now completely manufactured in the USA and we are proud of that fact. Most of our vendors are within a 100 mile radius. We hope to continue to be good local citizens (and good world citizens) as we strive to achieve the highest value / high quality product for a reasonable low price.\nAfter doubling our pledge goal and breaking the $12k milestone, we now have the ability to offer another reward. We've heard lots of requests and this one combines many of those. We call it the MOTO Plus...and it's a dream team combo of Motor Kit, Starter KIt and Blank Card KIt.\nYour pledges will help fund:\n1. New manufacturing\n2. Lower Cost Products\n3. Community Outreach for shows, schools and young creatives\nCommunity\nThis funding campaign is also about encouraging art and education. Since our launch, MANY teachers, art schools, high schools, summer camps, and maker-spaces have approached us for a lower-cost version for young artists and budding makers. Have a look at our facebook page to see the wild creations that people have made with their FlipBooKits.\nFlipBooKits in the community\nGiving Back\nPlease help us promote animation & arts in schools! For every $4000 raised, we are donating a craft-style 12-Pack to a worthy community charity or Middle/High School. If we can reach our original Kickstarter funding levels with the CRAFT campaign, that would send more than 30 FlipBooKit project packages back into the community!\nPlease, vote with project support. Your pledges will lower manufacturing costs and help us give back in so many ways. Only people who pledge can add their suggested institutions to the official list. 12-pack FlipBooKit donations will be chosen at random (from a hat) and delivered in 2015. (granted only to legitimate non-profit organizations)\nYour pledge will open young minds and spread FlipBooKit fun to a whole new generation!\nAward winning original design", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, there are always risks. There is a chance that one of our vendors will fumble their part of our project and cause a delay, but we have been doing this for over two years and we believe that we know the ropes. \n\nThe most ambitious part of this project is all the rewards that are promised before Christmas 2014. Back in 2012, we didn't deliver 100% of the kits in time for Santa. But we were just getting started. So, if, for some reason we are faced with an overwhelming quantity of pledges or a unforeseen bottleneck, we will limit the reward quantities. But don't let that discourage you ;) We are very confident about our delivery promises for this campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "NEW Optical Toy - TWIRLATROPE!", "update_content": "Only TWO DAYS LEFT in our Muybridge MOTO campaign, and we've included NEW Optical Toy!

Overall, the funds we hope to raise on Kickstarter is only one piece of a multi-tiered plan that includes securing financing from a bank, verifying gifts from various philanthropic organizations, and raising additional capital from community members and major donors. The staff and board are diligently working to ensure we hit the those goals, but missing one could make the reality of purchasing this building very difficult. That said, we're already under contract on the building, and know there is community support because we've already successfully rezoned the property and had the land use amended. Hooray! \n\nThe other big challenge is not being able to move into the space until 2016. Even if /when we successfully secure the space this December, the current tenant is still entitled to be in the building until February 2016. But, while that seems like a long time, that's not necessarily a bad thing. They'll cover our mortgage while we go through the permitting process, finalize architectural plans, and raise additional funds for a modest renovation.

These locals include brothers Jeff and Craig Moore, along with their pals Gabe Pilato, Justin Gray, and Andy DuVall.\nOld Fourth Distillery (O4D) will be located right in the heart of Atlanta\u2019s Old Fourth Ward. This vibrant and historic district is particularly well known as the location of the Martin Luther King Jr. historic site and being part of the Atlanta Beltline. As Atlantans already know, the city continues to revitalize this neighborhood and focus on projects that will bring people and businesses back into the heart of the city. As a result of an ongoing project we will soon see light-rail lines and more impressive renovations around the district. Very cool for the neighborhood and those who love it. This neighborhood is special and we want to be a part of the next chapter of history that happens here. And, what you\u2019ve heard on the street is happening- we are establishing our distillery operations in Old Fourth Ward. We know that O4D will attract foot traffic in the area as people stop by for tastings and distillery tours.\nOur customers are quite simply, you- people who are looking for a premium product that is made locally. We can\u2019t wait to bring you a premium product made right here in Atlanta. We also look forward to bringing people to the Old Fourth Ward area that may not have otherwise checked it out. We fully anticipate that other businesses won\u2019t be far behind us and will plan to plant their roots in the neighborhood also.\nSpirits\nO4D will be capable of producing Vodka, Gin, Whiskey and Bourbon.  We\u2019ll bring you Vodka first and then introduce Gin. Don\u2019t worry, down the line, we'll release O4D Whiskey and Bourbon after they have been properly aged. \nProgress\nWe have come a long way since we decided that it was a good idea to open a distillery in the heart of Atlanta. In August, O4D finally received the near impossible Federal permit to operate the still and we are on track to receive our state and city permits once the build out of O4D\u2019s facility has been completed.  The O4D still and equipment have been ordered and are on their way- this is progress! The facility housing the distillery and tasting room, (which we can see you in now) is on track to be completed by February 2014.\nWhere you come in and where the money is going\nWe need a little more progress\u2026In order to get O4D fully open, we always knew that we would have to beg, borrow and steal.  Having done the second two by convincing a bank that that this was a good idea and then raiding our savings we are now turning to you, the people who like to buy local and love a good drink.  We are asking people to join us in making sure that this is going to be successful.  Your money will go to help us pay for the equipment that we'll be using to produce O4D spirits.  Our still is being custom made in Germany and it is a thing of beauty- you can see the latest pics on our Facebook page. The more money that we are able to raise the sooner we are able to start rolling out additional products, which benefits everyone.  We can all drink to that, yes?\nAnd speaking of equipment... here is a drawing of what our still will look like:\nUPDATE! where your money is going, this is our actual still!\nBasic Goal\nOur kickstarter goal is to raise $40,000 initially.  Obviously we don't want to stop there because every additional dollar that we raise will help to fully pay off the still and additional equipment.\nStretch Goal\nWhiskey anyone?  Who doesn't like a nicely aged whiskey, especially something local?  We know y\u2019all do. The last time that whiskey was produced in the city of Atlanta was over 80 years ago. If we can meet or exceed our stretch goal of $80,000, then we'll be able to start barrelling whiskey to age immediately so that it can then be released for your enjoyment.\nReward Spotlight\nThe Brick\nWhile we do admit that everyone loves the look of exposed brick, we think that it would look much better with your name on it. Right now it just looks lonely.\nT-Shirts!\nYou know what these are and they're made right here in the Old 4th by our friends at Broken Arrows!\nLimited Edition Knifemen Print The Knifemen are Brian Manley (funwithrobots.com) and Roy Fleeman (royfleeman.com). Knifemen is the print side of our brains. Design. Print. Stab.\nThe East Pole\nPrivate Event for those who love to party\nMore about those 5 locals\nThe local brothers Jeff and Craig Moore, along with their pals Gabe Pilato, Justin Gray, and Andy DuVall have been working to make the distillery a reality for over a year.  Each of them brings a different background and skill set to the distillery and most importantly their desire to make a local spirit. \nCraig (along with Jeff) has started several companies (including Mooring Tech), he is a father of two and loves to travel to exotic locations whenever he has the chance. He brings the skill of successfully building several companies to O4D. \nJeff started out in the motorcycle business where he owned shops in Atlanta and Alpharetta.After that he moved into the entertainment field working with the 1996 Olympics and later with a production company out of Los Angeles.In 2003 he moved back to Atlanta, and went into business with his brother Craig.\nGabe has been in the food and wine business as long as he can remember, spending his time as a chef and Sommelier and owning and running restaurants all over the southeast. He is thrilled to be back home in Atlanta starting O4D.\nAndy has a background is in finance accounting (somebody has to help Craig keep the Company afloat), and he grew up in Cordele, GA - a more agricultural area of the state - which helped shape his desire for sourcing locally.  He has a passion for great food and spirits, which was developed over the years and was further ignited during his three years in Finland.\nJustin is the rocker in our group, and when he isn't rehearsing or playing with his group he is building.  As Chairman of the Board nailer, he'll be overseeing the construction of O4D and most importantly the tasting room.  \nFor more on us and what we're up to, check out our Old Fourth Distillery facebook page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the boring (but important) part\u2026in order to manufacture spirits, we have to obtain permits from the federal government, state of Georgia and the city of Atlanta. Each of these has its own challenges and requires the distillery to be at a different phase in the construction or operations phase. Read: lots of red tape because producing alcohol is a big deal. Also read\u2026 lots of attorney fees to navigate the red tape. However, we do have cause to celebrate because we received our federal permit in August. Cheers to that.\n\nThe next big hurdle financially is the sheer cost of the equipment, especially the still. The distilling process starts with equipment that is similar to that used in the brewing process including a boiler, fermenters, holding tanks, but in the middle is this ingenious piece of equipment called a still that is used to remove the alcohol from the fermented mash to create the alcohol used for O4D spirits. We\u2019d be happy to go into more detail with you- we love talking about this part.\n\nO4D has come along way, but now we need your help. We have all invested and borrowed to secure the space, start construction, and order the equipment to get O4D open and running. We are asking you to support us in making this dream a reality. Help us more quickly make the jump from producing Vodka to Gin to barreling Whiskey and Bourbon. Your support will allow O4D to be able to do that sooner, which benefits all of Atlanta.

That was the day that he left the fields and moved into the City Of Animals where he became a dancer, a gigolo, and a bouncer in bars.\nFollow Rabbit as he plows through years of failed friendships, alcoholism, embezzlement, poverty, hypocrisy, promiscuity, violence, supernatural misunderstandings and physical decay.\nWhat is the plan?\nI am planning to turn a book that I have written (RABBIT) into a graphic novel. Rabbit is currently in the form of a 45-page novella. The first draft was written ten years ago. It has never been published. Very few people have seen it, with the exception of select passages that I presented at the Los Angeles Hammer Museum in 2007. My goal is to create and enhance the world of RABBIT through illustration. The writing style is lean and fast, like a rabbit. Little time is wasted. The visual style is inspired by xeroxed nightclub-flyers of the 1980\u2019s and my own newspaper drawings.\nStory Excerpts:\n- \"Rabbit's dream: Rabbit stood on a cliff next to an Angel. The Angel introduced him to a Woman who was so tall that Rabbit could only see up to her belt. The Woman said to the Rabbit, \u201cI am going to give you a gift. I am going to give you a power. Choose a power and it will be yours.\u201d A thousand possibilities raced through Rabbit\u2019s head. He tried to concentrate on flying, stopping time, or being invisible. When the word \u201cVulgarity\u201d popped into his head, the Woman said, \u201cYou have chosen\u201d and disappeared. Rabbit turned to the Angel and asked \u201cVulgarity?\u201d \u201cYou have the gift of vulgarity,\u201d said the Angel.\"\n- \"Rabbit asked the Rat to hire Crow as a bartender. Rat was reluctant at first because she had been a drug addict. Rabbit reminded Rat that all of his bartenders were drug addicts. Rat insisted that none of them had been when he\u2019d hired them.\"\n- \"The impoverished periods in his life had taken their toll on his teeth. They were completely rotten by this point. Any cool drink or slight breeze that came in contact with his open mouth would torture him. No one could tell. He would just stand up a little straighter. Rabbit believed in tooth decay. It inspired him.\"\nWhy take this approach?\nThe story was completed in 2003. Variations on the first 5 pages were completed in 2011. It has proven difficult to develop this project without support.\nI believe Rabbit is the best story that I have ever written. I hope to finish it with your help.\nThank you.

But despite being *over* two hours, a 2012 cinema documentary called EUROCRIME! THE ITALIAN COP AND GANGSTER FILMS THAT RULED THE '70s got selected by film festivals all around the world, garnered Top Festival Picks by newspapers like the SAN FRANCISCO BAY GUARDIAN, won other festival honors, received positive reviews in publications like VARIETY, and received multiple distribution offers.\nEUROCRIME's documentarian, Mike Malloy, diligently edited his doc to pack in so much information, energy, style and creativity that the two-hour running time was accepted by audiences. The net effect? He was able to tell the story of the subject DEFINITIVELY.\nMalloy has been researching his next doc project, PLASTIC MOVIES REWOUND: THE STORY OF THE '80s HOME VIDEO BOOM, since 2003. And when the project's sizzle reel debuted a couple months ago, the advanced buzz and reviews seemed to understand that while other, similar projects may use the word \"definitive,\" this one means it.\nSerialized across six half-hour episodes, PLASTIC MOVIES REWOUND will cover (1) Cultural Shake-Up, (2)  Industry Shake-Up, (3) Golden Age of Mom-and-Pop Video Stores, (4) Alternative Formats and Delivery Methods, (5) Filmmakers Versus Distributors and (6) the Future of Physical Media.\nThe project has about 20 interviews in the can already, from important industry players like the founder of Netflix and the former VP of RCA (that was involved with the company's failed CED format) to colorful low-budget and shot-on-video genre directors. Have a few more interviewees attached that we'd like to pick up.\nSo we're seeking to raise money in order to continue a little more production then jump headlong into post, where there's an 8TB raid drive that needs to be bought, etc.\nThis doc series will feature original synth music by composer Matthew Miklos (from the notorious garage rock band The Lyres) and a mix of original and licensed synth music from amazing Swedish composer Thomas Nyholm. Second Unit director Michael Perkins (THE BOOKER) is working on the dramatic re-enactments. Associate Producer Jonathan Hickman is both a camera op/DP and an entertainment attorney. Associate Producer Michael A. Martinez is a camera op/DP with some major Hollywood credits. Associate Producer Travis Mace is one of the hardest-working guys in the VHS collecting subculture. Associate Producer Morgan White (THE REP) has been helpful as hell in a number of ways.\nBut enough about the project; I want to tell you what you'll be getting if you donate at the exciting MILLENNIUM PLATINUM SIGNATURE EDITION level, which is meant to be a great value to the collectors. $75 will get you one item from each category:\nSIGNED MOVIES:\nKilling Spree (Magnum VHS, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nWorst of Enemies (RaeDon VHS, signed by director Garrett Abdo)\nDemon Queen (Massacre DVD, signed by director Donald Farmer)\nDeath Collector (RaeDon VHS, signed by director Tom Garrett)\nBloodsuckers from Outer Space (DVD, signed by director Glen Coburn -- multiple available!)\nDeath Collector (MNTEX VHS, signed by director Tom Garrett)\nSavage Vengeance (Eden DVD, signed by director Donald Farmer)\nRepligator (Whacked limited pre-release DVD-R, signed by director Bret McCormick)\nReconciled (SubRosa DVD, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nKilling Spree (SubRosa DVD, signed by SOV director Tim Ritter)\nmore coming...\nSIGNED NON-MOVIE ITEMS:\nDeath Collector unused artwork (signed by director Tom Garrett)\nPortable Grindhouse book (signed by author Jacques Boyreau -- multiple available!)\nVideophile magazine issues (signed by publisher Jim Lowe -- multiple available!)\nSplatter Times magazine (signed by publisher Donald Farmer)\nmore coming...\n\n\nMYSTERY ITEMS:\nIncludes relevant-to-this documentary DVDs, vintage press materials, etc etc etc -- donated by filmmakers, by Vagrancy Films, Cult Movie Mania, Massacre Video, Lunchmeat Magazine, Slasher // Video and others!\nMP3 SOUNDTRACK DOWNLOADS:\nSeveral MP3s from Matthew Miklos and a couple from Thomas Nyholm.\nA COPY OF THE FINISHED DOC:\nVHS edition of the documentary, when complete -- likely a two-tape set, likely in double clamshell packaging.\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nSpecial thanks credit in an episode of the documentary (and on imdb, subject to that site's terms and blah yada blah...)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilm projects always contain so many variables and moving parts that it's impossible to predict exactly how one will unfold.

I currently have all the footage on a 1.5 TB external drive backed up to another drive. When I have an 8TB raid drive, I will mirror it down to two 4TB partitions to protect it from hard drive failure on one side or the other. That said, I suppose the drive could still get boosted during a burglary or ruined by a freak tornado that rips our house apart.

With support from the San Francisco Film Society FilmHouse residency, director Jennifer Phang teamed up with the short film\u2019s star Jacqueline Kim to develop the script into a feature and expand this future-world for audiences everywhere.\nHelp us bring this story to life. Check out our reward section, make a pledge, spread the word on Facebook, Twitter (use #advantageous), blogs, and encourage friends to help make this project a reality!\nA MESSAGE FROM THE DIRECTOR\nWe felt it was the right time to take a hard look at issues surrounding the future of women. Stories of mothers sacrificing and suffering for their children proliferate across generations and cultures. But this time we are looking at this story through a futuristic lens and looking closely at the strengths that parents can pass on to their children.\nWe\u2019re envisioning a time when competition for employment and education has reached a crisis point. In this future, pressures on women to strive to an appealing visual ideal are hidden, but pervasive. And this tale is ultimately a reaction to the ways we try to improve ourselves to attain success. Through science-fiction, we focus on urgent issues (with present-day relevance) pertaining to the future of women, social mobility, education, and how they all connect.

For each of her projects at this ultra low-budget level, Jennifer prioritizes generous rehearsal time and director\u2019s prep to ensure considered results. Our producing unit, headed by Theresa Navarro, is focused on scheduling, donations, location locks, budgeting and detailed contingency plans.\n\nAs a SAG ultra low budget feature, we face similar challenges as our fellow independent filmmaker friends trying to reconcile artistic vision with resources. As a sci-fi film, we seek to find creative ways to expand our visually complex version of the future. Finally, we are assembling cast and crew from around the country to maximize our production and performances.\n\nThrough the short film\u2019s awards and accolades, we\u2019ve raised some initial money for pre-production and have been gathering speed into production. The money will be used to ensure we can get this incredible film in the can, and to support the exceptional cast and crew who are sharing their energy and passion already with the film. We are producing this as a micro-budget so this includes the basics, e.g.:\n\n- Production insurance\n- Transportation and fuel costs for cast, crew and equipment\n- Paying ultra-low-budget SAG rates for our cast\n- Feeding our crew and cast\n\nWe\u2019ve secured resources and locations with goodwill from supporters - to whom we are eternally grateful. The money will be used to create, produce and deliver a powerful narrative that will hopefully provoke and inspire audiences to rethink our world. Now we need your support to create and complete a high-quality film that engages audiences visually and emotionally - and expands how we all see the future of women.

If you are just learning about our film, you can find out the latest at our web site. If would like to support the project, you can still make a donation for some of our original rewards below, including a digital download or DVD of Freedom Fighters here.\nTHE FILM:\nThey call themselves the Freedom Fighters, and they are looking to free innocent people still behind bars. Freedom Fighters is a character-driven documentary that follows these change-makers as they rebuild their lives and families, learn to investigate cases, work to support each other, and campaign to fix the criminal justice system.\nOUR TRAILER: Check out the trailer for the film below!\nWHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT: In order to make this film, we urgently need to raise $30,000 in the next 30 days. We need to spend a sustained period of time filming with the Freedom Fighters as they take on new cases, which is happening this summer. We don\u2019t want to miss this important moment in their investigative work! We also need to start editing footage we have shot over the past year so we can apply to grants and get this film fully funded.\nABOUT OUR SUBJECTS:\nChristopher Scott was released from prison after serving 13 years of a life sentence for a murder he didn\u2019t commit. This sounds like a nightmare, but it\u2019s more common than you might think. 32 people like Chris have been exonerated in Dallas. Most of them are black men who were locked up in their youth and emerged in middle age looking for a way to make sense of what happened. One day at an exoneree support group meeting, an idea came to Chris: exonerees could become detectives, find other wrongfully convicted people sitting in prison, investigate their cases and prove their innocence. \"I'm the go-getter, I'm the one that sets the standards, because I'm a leader - I lead by example.\" Chris was recently named Texan of the Year by the Dallas Morning News.\nJohnnie Lindsey, the most dapper member of the Freedom Fighters (Chris calls him \u201claid back\u2026 a real smooth operator.\u201d), spent 26 years in prison for a sexual assault he didn't commit. As calm, cool, and collected as he is, Johnnie can get fired-up about all the wrongful convictions in Texas: \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong, something's happening in Texas\u2026 they robbed us out of our lives - 26 years of my life\u2026 I was robbed.\u201d\nBilly Smith was released in 2006 after spending two decades behind bars, after being wrongly identified and convicted for aggravated sexual assault. He knew his case had DNA evidence but it wasn\u2019t until 2001, 15 years into his sentence, that prisoners could request DNA tests. Billy is still overcome with emotion at times when he looks at his front door, sees the doorknob on the inside, and realizes he can turn that knob and walk out anytime he wants to go. \u201cThere\u2019s no bars there, no guards walking past my door. I can go out when I want to go out... I'm free.\u201d\nFor these men, the most powerful way to create meaning out of the decades they lost in prison is by pushing forward with the detective agency. We will follow them as they learn the ropes of investigation--following leads, tracking down witnesses and finding out what kind of evidence will make a strong case in court--on their first cases. Whatever they discover, we know their sleuthing will shed light on important and interesting issues within the criminal justice system. As they piece together clues, we will also see the new detectives coming to a kind of peace with what happened to them.\nTHE ISSUE: Wrongful conviction is one of the most urgent issues facing our criminal justice system. Since 2000, there have been an average of 52 exonerations a year -- about 1 per week -- and those are just the cases where prisoners have succeeded in court. Wrongful convictions derail lives, steal years away from families, and they leave dangerous criminals at large. The Freedom Fighters represent a way forward, not only with their detective agency, but also their work supporting other exonerees and lobbying at the Capitol in Austin to make changes to the law - solving the problems that lead to wrongful convictions. They are an inspiration, using the experiences they've had to bring positive, grassroots change to the system that wronged them.\nABOUT OUR TEAM:\nDirector Jamie Meltzer\u2019s feature documentary films have been broadcast nationally on PBS and have screened at numerous film festivals worldwide. They include Off the Charts: The Song-Poem Story (Independent Lens, 2003) about the shadowy world of song-poems, Welcome to Nollywood, an investigation into the wildly successful Nigerian movie industry (PBS broadcast, 2008), La Caminata (2009), a short film about a small town in Mexico that runs a simulated border crossing as a tourist attraction, and Informant, winner of four best documentary/grand jury awards at film festivals in 2012, about a revolutionary activist turned FBI informant, being released in theaters nationwide by Music Box Films in 2013. He teaches in the MFA Program in Documentary Film and Video at Stanford University.\nProducer Kate McLean is an award winning writer and filmmaker.

David owns and operates Structure Films LLC, a start-up documentary film company that focuses on how science and health are transforming society. David graduated from Stanford University's Documentary Film and Video MFA program in 2010, and now lives and works in New York City.\nProducer Michael May teaches radio documentary at the Salt Institute in Portland, ME. Before that, he was the managing editor of the Texas Observer and a print and radio freelancer based in Austin, where he investigated an idiosyncratic FBI informant named Brandon Darby, heard Willie Nelson sing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d a capella and discovered that a police \u201cbait car\u201d can snare good Samaritans. His stories ended up on This American Life, Studio 360, Marketplace, The Austin Chronicle and others.\nREWARDS:\nWe hope you join in support of our filmmaking team and we have some great rewards to encourage you, including:\n- A shout-out on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/freedomfightersfilm)\n- A pre-release digital download of the finished film!

We had the privilege to film with Chris as he met with Alonzo Hardy, a man whose actions put Chris in prison, but whose confession made it possible for Chris to get out 13 years later.

Girl Model follows two protagonists involved in this industry: Ashley, a deeply ambivalent model scout who scours the Siberian countryside looking for fresh faces to send to the Japanese market, and one of her discoveries, Nadya, a 13-year-old plucked from her rustic home in Russia and dropped into the center of bustling Tokyo with promises of a profitable career. Girl Model is a lyrical exploration of a world defined by glass surfaces and camera lenses, reflecting back differing versions of reality to the young women caught in their scope.  \nAfter screening Girl Model all over the world we have found the most prominent question has been, \u201cWhat kind of action can I take?\u201d It's not always an easy question given the lyrical films we make, but it's not an impossible question given how the documentary is hitting an emotional chord with audiences. \nDuring production we began working with model Rachel Blais.  She took on the important role of our fashion industry adviser.  She is also featured in the documentary. So far Rachel has booked the film at theaters, garnered important national press, and passed out surveys after screenings for audience reactions. The first law Rachel is recommending is no more minors (under 18 years old) represented in adult fashion, and additionally to stop granting work visas to underage models. Her passion to change industry-wide standards is exciting!  We want Rachel\u2019s passion to become a reality.  Our goal is to work with Rachel and an experienced outreach coordinator to organize an audience engagement campaign alongside the September US theatrical release.  We want to target educational (University/High Schools) and non-profit audiences with the hopes of raising awareness.\nHow you can help:\nOur goal is to raise $12,000. The funds will be used for the following:\n       Organize and book a National educational screening series (Colleges, Universities, High Schools, and Non-profits organizations)\n       Travel to screenings\n       Promotional materials (poster, postcards)\n       Develop DVD extra Educational & Online guides\n       Manage content on social media/grassroots marketing\nThere are ways to help outside of donating.  Please like our video at the top of the page, tweet/facebook it to your friends, add Girl Model on facebook, and pass the word along. \nGet in touch:\ncarnivalesquefilm@gmail.com\nAbout the prizes:\nDuring the making of Girl Model we built a great community from production, post-production, film festivals, and distribution.  With each reward we tried to tie in that community. Please join our efforts to continue to get Girl Model out into the world!\nAbout the film:\nCheck out more information at: http://www.girlmodelthemovie.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/girlmodelthemovie\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/#!/GirlModelMovie\nWho we are:\nDavid Redmon and Ashley Sabin have produced, directed, edited and photographed six feature documentaries: Mardi Gras: Made in China (2005), Kamp Katrina (2007), Intimidad (2008), Invisible Girlfriend (2009), Girl Model (2011) and Downeast (2012). Their intimate and intricately crafted documentaries have won a variety of film festival awards. Their work has aired on television stations throughout the world. Redmon received his PhD in sociology from the University at Albany, State University of New York. He is a former Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard University and the Film Studies Center. Sabin received her BA in Art History from Pratt Institute.\nRachel Blais started her international modelling career in 2002. After a trip to India where she did volunteer work, Rachel met Girl Model co-directors David Redmon and Ashley Sabin in Tokyo in 2009. Since then she has acted as the fashion consultant for the film and has been assisting on it\u2019s development. Since Girl Model premiere at Tiff in September 2011 Rachel has been actively attending film festivals with Girl Model. She's also helped organize the premiere screenings of Girl Model in London, Uk and Montreal, Canada. By speaking out at screenings and to the media, Rachel has become a spokes-person for the film and for the fight against child labor practices in the fashion industry. Rachel has been on the model committee for the Trade-Union Equity in the Uk since 2011 as she feels strongly about the importance of creating regulations to protect models in the fashion industry, but even more to stop using children, under 18 years old, to models as adults. With her experiences and observations of the industry she believes laws banning children to model in the adult fashion world is the only way for certain very negative practices within the industry to change and for regulations to be respected in the industry for adult models. \nWhat Critics Are Saying:\n\u201cStirring Portrait.\u201d Fan Quarterly\n\u201cDavid Redmon and Ashley Sabin\u2019s engrossing documentary provides access to a pitiless niche of the fashion industry, but it\u2019s arguably more fascinating in its depiction of the recruiters that their discoveries.\u201d Hollywood Reporter\n\u201cEerie, visceral horror haunts every scene.\u201d Indiewire (Girl Model @ top of Indiewire TIFF poll)\n\u201cA must-see movie as intriguing as it is disturbing.\u201d Marie Claire\n\u201cA fascinating look at the stark, staring mad world of modeling.\u201d The Times\n\u201cA haunted glimpse into exploited youth.\u201d Variety", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "Meeting the goal", "update_content": "A BIG Happy Monday,\nWe have some fantastic news: we met our Kickstarter goal thanks to you!

The story explores the power of following one's dreams, the beauty of making art from what others call \"trash,\" and the frictions and joys of creating community in and around diversity. When a transgender Caucasian trash collector (artist), a heteroflexible African American college student (dreamer) and a lesbian Asian American entrepreneur (artist and dream-maker) meet in a tiny Southern town, all sorts of magic can happen! \nOur Goal:\nOur goal is to raise $5,000 to create all of the video clips, still images & stop-action animation segments that will be included in the digital novel. We\u2019ll be filming in May and June of 2012. We aim to produce all of these pieces now, so that we will have everything we need to put the digital book together this Fall!\nThe Story:\nJAMIE (Caucasian, late 20's, FTM transgender) works on a dump truck. ALIZA (African American, early 20's, femme) lives on the trash route. As romance blooms between them, Jamie makes art out of trash and leaves robot-like sculptures on Aliza\u2019s doorstep. Soon, these robots come to life!  VESPA (Asian American, mid-40's, femme) moves to town. VESPA is uploading web videos, texting constantly, trying to start an internet caf\u00e9 that will put this quaint town in rural Georgia on the map. Vespa moves in with BILL (self-identified \u201cProud Southern Redneck\u201d, mid-50\u2019s, male), who questions her goals & dreams. When Vespa rises to the challenge and articulates her dreams, the power of her decision opens a magical portal. The town discovers that she is a \u201ckey maker\u201d \u2013 a person with the ability to manifest her dreams. Everyone in town will be granted one wish. But when Aliza wishes to leave, Jamie\u2019s wish to be with Aliza is thrown into jeopardy, and the once-friendly trash-robots become nightmarish hallucinations. Will Jamie go crazy? Will Aliza truly get her wish? Will Vespa and her partner be able to open the caf\u00e9? And\u2026 what did Bill just say?! This is a story about art, magic, community, love and most of all \u2013 daring to be who you are & daring to follow your dreams.\nCloser Than Rust was written first as a feature length screenplay, and was a winner of the 2011 Atlanta International Film Festival Screenplay Competition!\nAbout Kickstarter:\nKickstarter is an organization that helps artists raise money for creative projects.

Without you we can't make this documentary!\nTHE STORY OF THIS FILM\nby co-director and daughter Heidi Van Lier\nMy dad was part of the toughest backcourt in NBA history, an outspoken critic of the team he loved, and he lived a hard life with many disappointments. He never won an NBA championship, he never coached an NBA team, he never worked officially for the Bulls again\u2026and then he died suddenly at 61 before any of these aspirations were realized.\nBut none of this went without some scraping and clawing his way across the court, or brawling through a call, or a flaring temper on the sidelines both during his playing era and after.\nHe did become a broadcaster after some rough years of scrambling to keep it together. And he was a radio personality much like he was a player, he left nothing out, blows were never softened. He wasn't afraid to say what he really thought, even though it probably cost him many of the opportunities he strove for.\nEven with some of the tragic ups and downs of his post-athletic career, Norm was a hero to my sister and I. But as we grew up we realized he was also a hero to many \u2013 and in a strange way this was very surprising to me. \nPeople would talk about his scrappy playing style my entire life, and about an infamous Golden State game that they would never forget. I had never seen this game until the early 2000's when I started listening to his stories to develop a feature film with him. The film never went very far, but I was so glad I had this time to hear about his life before he died\u2026and that I finally got to see that Golden State game.\nAnd that game blew my mind.\nNot because the team was great, they were, but because they were an older team failing at their last chance of going to the Finals this season. And as I watched my dad \u2013 Bulls #2 \u2013 break down during this game, I realized that our whole lives he'd been doing what he was trying to do with this team: coach. We'd been raised through coaching. Even with his faults as a father, even with his personal demons that he made very public, he was an excellent coach to two little girls who weren't even biologically his.\nEveryone I run into in Chicago has some kind of crazy Norm story, from the technical fouls, all the way to the homeless man he came across and let stay in his house. His hard small town upbringing, his mixed emotions of being a sports star at a predominantly white college in the 1960s, the fight from being a 3rd round draft pick to top NBA point guard, the disappointments in finding an outlet in his life after his playing career, and his personal struggles all create a dynamic portrait of an athlete who never held anything back.  We want to use those stories to string together something that will both honor his life (to my dad brutal honesty came hand in hand with honor) and explain his past in a totally unique way.\nLast week the co-directors were in Chicago to promote the Kickstarter. One of their interview's was on Frank Fontana's \"Down and Dirty\" show at the Craftsman studios.\nAs you may have already heard, we are doing our fundraising in two parts. This initial kickstarter campaign is to raise money for pre-production and production. \nPreproduction includes camera equipment and stock, sound equipment, lighting equipment, video editing equipment, office costs during pre-production, and staff. It will also cover a large portion (if not all) of production, which includes shooting, travel to film the interviews, main office expenses, the cinematographer, a sound person, staff to log and load footage, research staff to find and pull TV footage, radio clips, and photos and obtain licenses.\nWe will then cut the film, pull all the archive footage we need, and then get a total of what we will need for post-production. Each archival clip, photo, and article, costs a lot of money (it's a tough world for historical documentaries), so we wanted to wait to see what we need before we put a dollar amount on the fundraising for licensing. We've been told it could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but to tell the story we'll definitely need that footage.\nJust to be absolutely clear: Realistically we will need $125,000 to get through the first phase, pre-production and production. We are only asking for $50,000 in this Kickstarter because that will get us on our way. And because on Kickstarter, if we don't reach our goal, we don't get the funding, so again\u2026\nWE NEED $125k TO GET THROUGH PRODUCTION - SO PLEASE KEEP GIVING BEYOND $50k TO BE SURE WE GET TO OUR FINISH LINE!!\nThank you for all your help.

Here's my challenge...\nThe images I'll be displaying are best represented large, giving the viewer the chance to interact with the landscape true to its form. Each image will cost several hundred dollars to develop, print, and prepare for gallery exhibition.  As someone who has dedicated their career to teaching and working for non-profit art organizations, this monetary outlay is a huge hurdle for me. As passionate as I am about my work, financially its difficult to continue to exhibit. In fact, even though I\u2019ve continued to shoot, because of lack of funds (did I mention I'm still paying off college loans?) a large amount of my work lives only on hard drives. \nThe work I want to share with you at this solo show was shot with a Hasselblad camera that was created during WWII.  It's a great camera (the Hasselblad was used during the Apollo Program to photograph some of the first images of man on the moon) but since it's film-based it requires me to scan in medium format negatives. An extra step which leads to more time and more money... but a beautiful finished product!\nAt this point I'm not even sure how many images I'll be displaying at the gallery.  It all depends on how much support I get through this campaign.  At minimum, I\u2019ll be printing approximately 9 or 10 images at 40\"x40\". It\u2019s important that I fill the space and best represent my work, Poem88, and ACP. The total show will cost around $2500 including the framing.  I'm putting up as much of my own money as I can (several hundred dollars) and I hope that you will lend support and help me make this show possible.\nI\u2019ve included a slide show of my work and you can also check out some of my past work including my MFA thesis show at hollyjowhite.com. I appreciate any support you are willing to contribute! Thank you, and I hope to see you at the opening.\nA note about pledges and funding: Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing fundraising site, so if my goal is reached (or surpassed) by the deadline, that's when the pledges get cashed-in. But if I fall short of the goal, then all the pledges get cancelled and I don't get a penny.  So it's important to pledge here if you want to donate, rather than giving me any money directly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Tami Oliver", "content": "I'm so bummed that I'll miss your opening, but I hope it goes great! :)", "time": "almost 10 years ago"}, {"username": "Christopher A.
