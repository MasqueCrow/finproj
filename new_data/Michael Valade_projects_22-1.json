These incredible publications once existed in numerous quantities before the smelly internet came along and made them unviable. So the big corporate publishers packed their bags and shut the doors on these long-revered Nintendo gaming mags. Sad times.\nThere are those that still think that Nintendo has a place on bits of dead trees, which is where we come in. After a very successful Kickstarter campaign for our first issue, Ninty Fresh is back for a second dose!\nIn the olden times, Nintendo fans garnered their knowledge and wisdom from print magazines. There are far too many to mention here, but personal favourites of ours included Mean Machines (before it evolved like a Pok\u00e9mon into Nintendo Magazine System), Total!, Super Play, Cube, NGamer and of course the Official Nintendo Magazine itself. These magazines were bursting with passion, knowledge and coverage for the consoles that we loved so dearly. Overseas readers will no doubt remember their own (sometimes official) publications, such as the legendary Nintendo Power.\nOur first attempt at making a Nintendo magazine went down very well indeed, so we thought we'd do it all over again. \nJust like old Nintendo magazines\nSo, what's this then?\nWith no Nintendo magazines at all in the UK since 2014 and the recent demise of corporate multi-format publications in general (like GamesMaster and GamesTM) there's a huge lack of Nintendo coverage in print form. Whilst there are enthusiast ventures available, we craved something that completely covered and encompassed Nintendo's vast history. Something that looks at the retro aspect as well as the new, with a fresh perspective on things. So, we thought we would make one: Ninty Fresh. Something that will cater for ALL of Nintendo. From NES to Now. Or, in this case, SNES to Now!\nNinty Fresh? What's that all about?\nCapturing what the magazine is about with the added benefit of a cheeky pun, the title Ninty Fresh tells you right from the get-go what we want to do. Imagine, if you will, a cross between EMAP's Nintendo Official Magazine, Future's Official Nintendo Magazine and a dash of Retro Gamer and NGamer and that's what we hope to be bringing, all with that Nintendo flavour and familiarity that older magazines brought you. But in 2020. And obviously, with no affiliation to those amazing magazines.\nMaking your own magazine without advertising support or huge corporate backing is challenging, but since the first one went down so well, we came back. The second issue of Ninty Fresh is going to be another A4 (210mmx297mm) page turner with a smorgasbord of Nintendo content crammed into 84 pages. And no adverts. Again.\nInspired by the past\nWhat will be in it?\nMuch like our first issue, these are intended to be themed. This one will feature F-Zero. Nintendo may have long-abandoned the franchise, but given that it's been 30 years since the first game launched in Japan, we've crammed loads of content about the franchise into this issue. All SIX core games, the anime, games like F-Zero and the appearance of the franchise in other games. Plus, courtesy of the legendary Chris Scullion, an extensive F-Zero X retrospective.\nOn top of that, we plan to bring a range of enjoyable content to each issue. We will have editorials looking at the latest big Nintendo story and what's happened since the last issue, system recaps, informative interviews and huge cover features, all interwoven with amazing artwork, the latest reviews and even some fun and games! Oh, and fan content. We want your stuff. Letters (or emails), tweets, questions, artwork - all that sort of thing. We will be in touch closer to the launch with more details about those bits.\nWe've already got Matthew Castle (former ONM Editor) on board for an interview, coverage of the LEGO NES and the LEGO x Super Mario, a Game Boy Retrospective and a huge look at Pok\u00e9mon Yellow.\nEverything for this second issue is either in progress, already completed or awaiting release (reviews); we'd say around 50% of the content is already prepared. We've also taken on THREE new staff writers to enhance the quality of our writing.\nPhillip took a break from manual handling to produce this masterpiece for us\nThat cover looks amazing!\nThanks! After such a stunning piece of artwork last time, we wanted something equally as stunning for this one and we've teamed up with Phil Summers. He's the creator of \u201cHand-Drawn Game Guides\u201d, and his most recent work includes the  acclaimed hand-drawn \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\" guide. He has been hard at work to deliver you a cover that is inspired by the classic F-Zero Super Famicom cover of old, giving it a unique spin whilst retaining the feeling of classic F-Zero. Dripping with style, the new artwork is both a tribute to this amazing franchise but also a testament to Phil's amazing ability to capture the glory of hand-drawn game art.\n Phil's work on Nintendo Life \nSome examples of Phil's awesomeness\nWhen will it come out?\nWe are targeting a November release for this, but we will keep you posted. Obviously, we are already hard at work putting this all together - much like last time, around 50% of it is already completed. The release ultimately depends on whether it gets funded and when the funds are processed, but we are hoping to start shipping these out before the end of November.\nFunding Target\nSpeaking of funding, our target of \u00a32500 will ensure that an 84-page print issue will be produced. However, we hope that we can make something much bigger in the future, if enough people support it and show that there's demand. Helping us to produce this second issue gives us the platform and scope to make this evolve even more and we can make this even beefier.\nAs we said, we're already in discussions with folks that used to be involved with Nintendo magazines and really want to be able to bring their fantastic writing back where it belongs - in print. We hope that this will be around for the long-haul; in fact, even our spines are being designed so that they'll make a pretty picture when put together. We'd need a fair few successful issues to achieve that!\nIf you like the sound of what we are doing, we have physical and digital options available, and some more premium levels if you really want to help this project come to life. Please help us get a print Nintendo magazine back into people's hands.\nStretch Goals\n84 pages is the target for this issue, but we are really hoping to add even more content and get as high as 116 (!) pages! Here's what you'll get added if you help us reach these targets.\nA nice and easy one to start with, we'll go to 92 pages if we hit \u00a35,000 in funding. That's nearly 10% bigger than issue 1. We'll make some of the features bigger and to be honest, we could do with the space.\nWhat, you want even more? No problem! Help us to reach \u00a37,500 and we will instantly increase NFM02 to 100 pages. That will mean that you will get a THIRD retrospective in the form of Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64. And means our second issue will have almost 20% more girth!\nThe reward for hitting \u00a310,000 will be that EVERYONE at print and above (\u00a36+) will get a double-sided poster of the cover art and inside welcome artwork. If you are already getting the poster, we will simply send you two. Then you don't need to choose which side to show off!\nThis is going to look amazing on your wall!\nOzcan, aka \"Oskunk\", is a French artist based in Paris. Video games, mangas, comics and graffiti have always been a significant part of his life and are also a great source of inspiration. Oskunk is known for working with such brands as \u201cPlayStation\u201d, \u201cUbisoft\u201d, \"Warner Bros.\u201d and many more, delivering his custom and well known street-art style. For this stretch goal, Oskunk will create a \u201cCaptain Falcon\u201d themed art print (A4) that will be included with every print issue.\n The design is pending but as you can see by the examples below, it's going to be something special!\nExamples of Oskunk's work. Please help us make this for you!\nOur final stretch target (for now) will be at \u00a320,000 and will result in ANOTHER 16 pages coming your way, making for a huge magazine! This will allow us to dedicate far more space to amazing Nintendo content, including a Wii Sports Resort retrospective and \"Games We Loved\" and \"Games We Hated\" style pieces. You know you want to see Superman 64 in there!\nHow can you help?\nFor starters, even supporting our little thing is humbling. Whether you pledge for a PDF version of the magazine, the print copy, or one of the heavier tiers, your support is what will make this happen. We absolutely love Nintendo and its games, and just want to make something that brings more of that content to more eyes. Beyond that, sharing this Kickstarter, telling your friends and pushing it far and wide. The more people supporting this, the more likely it'll not only become a reality, but allow us to make something even better and bigger in the future. And perhaps even more regular.\nAnd, as noted in some of the masses of words above, we will need your letters (emails), and tweets. Pictures and stuff. These magazines in the past were almost communities within themselves. We want to try to build something like that.We are forever seeing people lament the loss of Nintendo magazines. This is your chance to ensure one gets made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge right now is obviously the ongoing global situation.

From \"shelter-in-place\" orders to economic uncertainty, business owners were left without much support. Not only has the pandemic negatively impacted their livelihood, but it's compromised what all of us need these days: a safe space. \nFor many, comic book stores are a place of acceptance, joy, and discovery. This is particularly important for people of marginalized genders who might not have access to other inclusive places with like-minded individuals, which means it's specifically important to provide assistance to comic book stores owned, operated, and staffed by women and people of marginalized genders.\nThat's where INSIDER ART came in. Developed by Shelly Bond, INSIDER ART assembled 150 women and non-binary comics creators from around the world. This 270-page digital anthology raised over $5K on Gumroad, with all of the proceeds benefiting 28 retailers who reached out for support. And now with your help, we want to bring a softcover version of the book to everyone. \nWhile the digital version of INSIDER ART will remain exclusively on Gumroad, we've had many requests for a softcover for people who prefer a paperback reading experience. With your help, we'll be able to provide this astounding 4-color compendium for print-lovers to enjoy and as a bonus, pay the 150 creatives who generously donated their time and talents.\n\"...a joyous celebration of graphic narrative in a multiplicity of forms...much of the appeal of INSIDER ART is in rooting through its eclectic treasure chest of graphic gems...INSIDER ART could be considered one of the key releases of 2020.\" \n \u2014Andy Oliver, Broken Frontier\nChock-full of comics, crafts, and cats, INSIDER ART was designed to entertain readers of all ages who are stuck indoors or just in search of new creative outlets.

Each room is filled with comics, prose, and projects individually curated by a team of eight editors designed to inspire readers and remind everyone why being inside isn't so bad.\n From recipes for comfort food and quarantine bread...\n...to attic treasures and a brief history of Garage Rock, INSIDER ART is guaranteed to conquer the tedium of the great indoors.\nIntroducing our 150 amazing contributors:\nAbby Jame Abs Bailey Anna Puchalski Amalia DeGirolamo Aimee Garcia AJ Mendez Amanda Gonzalez Andrea Rosales Andrea Shockling Angela Cleland Anja Venter Anne Toole Annie Wu Arlene Lo Ashley Ribblett Becca Carey Becky Cloonan Beth Wood Billie Temple Caitlyn Yarsky Carolyn Carter Carrie McNinch Casey Gilly Cat Sims Cathy Brett Cecil Castellucci Celeste Bronfman Ceridwen Gale Brown Chiara Bautista Chrissy Williams Christa Miesner Chynna Clugston Flores Cindy Whitehead Corinna Bechko dANI!

This anthology title featured futuristic stories of heroic adventurers with a mid-century aesthetic, and it is well-loved to this day, often for its lush, high-quality, imaginative covers. Just look at this winner from issue 71: \nPlanet Comics #71 from 1953\nHey everyone! My name\u2019s Jeff McClelland, and I write comics like The Tick and the 2019 Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. With this new iteration of Planet Comics, I\u2019d like to tell fun, imaginative stories under a sci-fi umbrella. To that end, I\u2019ve asked some of my friends to help out and I\u2019m really happy with the result. If you agree, then I hope you\u2019ll help us send this issue to print! If the campaign for this first issue is successful, I\u2019d like to publish a total of four issues on a (roughly) quarterly schedule.\nAs an added throwback, this issue will be presented in an oversized, magazine format, leaving lots of room for wide landscapes and immersive action!\nThe book\nSo what\u2019ll be included in this first issue? First, we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Bulwark\u201d, from myself and artist Andrea Schiavone. This story will be the book\u2019s continuing feature, told in serialized chapters along the way. Here\u2019s a quick preview!\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nNext up is \u201cThe Old Man and the Agean Sea\u201d from my good friend and frequent collaborator, writer/artist Jeff McComsey (Honcho; Grendel, Kentucky). Jeff brings an aesthetic to this tale that is somehow both foreboding and warm, and this complete story features some of his best work yet.\nThe Old Man and the Agean Sea preview\nThen we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth\u201d from Jennie Wood (Flutter; A Boy Like Me) and Duane Redhead (2000AD; The Tick), both wonderful, creative people. I\u2019m thrilled that Planet Comics will be the venue for their first collaboration, and this complete story is so wild \u2013 I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it all! \nThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth preview\nAlso included is an article by Diana Krueger on one of the pioneers of the original Planet Comics: Lily Ren\u00e9e! Diana highlights the life and times of Ren\u00e9e, one of the most prominent female artists from the mid-century run.\nI\u2019ve got a few more (secret!) plans to add some pages to the book if we get past our initial goal!\nREWARDS\nIt's a space ship!\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book. Whether you go in for a physical copy or electronic, I hope you\u2019ll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis first issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Pietro, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Matthew Dow Smith! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.  \nPlanet Comics #1 Kickstarter exclusive cover by Matthew Dow Smith\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \u201cmaking of\u201d publication, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this issue. You\u2019ll also get your name printed in a \u201cthank you\u201d section at the end of the book, and you'll get an electronic copy of an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are a few additional, limited, physical rewards that you can get in this campaign. The first is a neat vinyl sticker of this updated Planet Comics logo, designed by Alan Gallo!\nI\u2019m also offering up prints of Matthew Dow Smith\u2019s variant cover image, sans logos or other text.\nAnd you'll have a chance to get one of the last few copies of Black Terror: Social Insecurity and maybe a few other books I've written!\nThe Black Terror: Social Insecurity\n*Also! The first 30 backers - at any physical level - will receive a signed copy of The Tick 2020 FCBD Special!* \nFree to the first 30 physical backers!\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOAL\nMy first goal with this campaign is to be able to pay the creators a decent rate for their work. After that, I hope to offset some of the printing and shipping costs that otherwise might be prohibitive.\nIf this campaign exceeds its initial goal, all of the extra funds will be funneled directly back into the book, adding pages and helping us get started with issue #2!\nFollow me online!\nIf you\u2019re looking for more content, progress reports or just to see pictures of my dog, you can always follow me online by clicking the images below:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re currently about 75% finished with the art for this book.

JAMBOREE! THE BABOON AND PINK LEMONADE meet and team-up for the very first time! \n I was reading a bunch of 90s Image comics and reignited my love of the crossover. Characters bouncing back and forth between books, binding characters to some great collective omni-narrative. It was fun. And I\u2019ve been missing that fun. So I hit up my friend, and fellow cartoonist, Nick Cagnetti to see if he missed that fun too\u2026\nHE DID and we got working on a story that would link The Baboon and Pink Lemonade!\n It's comic con and Jamie AKA Monkey Bones AKA the Baboon's ward and nephew is super excited to meet his favorite cartoon star, the one and only OJ BOT! But, things go from \"Awesome!\" to \"Awe crud...\" when the Baboon and Monkey Bones run into an old foe, Dr. DeLumenex!\n Luckily for the pair fellow heroine and adventure, PINK LEMONADE is also at the con! Together, The Baboon, Monkey Bones, and Pink Lemonade must team up to stop Dr. DeLumenex or the most celebrated of nerd days, Comic Con, will be ruined!\n THE JAMBOREE! was Co-written by Jamie and Nick, Penciled and Inked by Jamie Jones, and Colored by Nick Cagnetti.  \n This is a small goal on purpose. Nick and I were going to just print stuff up to sell at cons, but with so many cancelled shows we've pivoted, but still want to go straight to the consumer. So, It's books, books, and more books. The Jamboree, The Baboon, and some sketches. \nThis Kickstarter is like our own little convention! \nWHO'S  WHO CARTOONIST EDITION\nJamie Jones is a Florida born cartoonists whose works include, Quarter Killer (Comixology Originals), Kicking Ice (Ominous Studios) Lucha Underground (El Rey), Five Ghosts Special, and A Constant Distraction backup stories for Violent Love (Image) Puerto Rico Strong (Lion Forge) and has self published Dodger: A Western Saga of Mechs and Mayhem, and his ongoing anthology project, The Whisper. He is currently working on the second Baboon book and The Baboon Strip!\nNick Cagnetti is a 25 year old cartoonist from Phoenix, AZ. He's been drawing forever with a life-long love for comic books and has been making his own since 2012. His earlier works included drawing the series Infinite Wonders, and also The Spirit of The Shadows. Nick has done work in production design, storyboarding, commercial art, along with short comic stories appearing in anthologies from A Wave Blue World and covers for Chapterhouse Books. In 2016, he started writing and drawing his own comic strips, titled Pink Lemonade. The Pink Lemonade character expanded into her own comic book series in 2019, which brings us to where we're at now.\n RETAILERS!\nIf you are a retailer and would like to have this awesome crossover comic in your shop please reach out to me privately at artofjamiejones@gmail.com.

Stop Starving. Start Thriving. \nDiscover how you can turn your art skills into your own thriving career in Illustration. \nFACT: Being an Illustrator is tough!\nYou have hopes and dreams to make it big as an artist; but you don't know how to make it happen. Still, you push along doing the best that you can. Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

Your successful career in illustration is possible. I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream. In this guide you will learn how to network effectively, how to get yourself & your art noticed, how to nail an interview, and much more.\nThis means that you will have a competitive edge over all the other illustrators out there trying to get the top jobs in your industry.\n\nHow To Get Freelance Work\nFor those of you looking for the thrill of freelancer life, I've got you covered. You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities. In this guide, you will learn how to combine your talents and establish your own personal brand; what it takes to get your brand off the ground, and how to get your brand to scale.\nThis means you will have the groundwork to expand your influence so you can gain the recognition & wealth you desire.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Products/Services\nSome of you have always wanted to create your own games/products/services and sell them online via Kickstarter, Shopify, or Amazon. In this guide, you will learn how to start your own line of products/services, how to fail fast & improve, and how to sell your products/services profitably.\nUnderstanding & applying the lessons from this section means you will be on the fastest road to 6+ figures.\n\nHow to Develop The Successful Illustrator Mentality\nYou will learn how to think like a successful illustrator and see the world as yours to make & create. You will develop a growth mindset that will enable you to try hard things and accomplish great feats.\nThis means that you will be able to see opportunities that you weren't previously able to see and you'll have the courage to reach out and grab them.\n\nAnd so much more...\n How you are going to get the biggest bang for your buck by backing this guide today. \n30+ years of experience, industry insights, and advice from 13 award winning illustrators who have all been in the trenches and climbed to success; the information in this book is worth thousands. You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally. You will not pay for shipping until after the completion of the Kickstarter during fulfillment  (estimated to be in October). I will be using Backerkit to help me with fulfillment. Backerkit makes fulfillment quick and easy! I will not mark up shipping whatsoever, you will only pay what is fair.  \nWhen we are ready to ship the books (probably in October) you will receive an alert to complete a survey (to be sent to the email address that you provided with your pledge).

Twelve comic creators from Australia and New Zealand come together to bring you eleven original short romance comics with Coffee Shop AU vibes. A familiar warmth, an every day romance, a touch of magic, even coffee in space! - each comic has a different approach to the theme, and the resulting collection features a variety of romantic relationships at different stages, from the very beginnings of something to rocky recovery. \nThe book! With lovely cover art by Hawberries!\nWait, what's a Coffee Shop AU? A Coffee Shop Alternate Universe (or \"AU\") is when a creator takes well-known characters out of their usual canon stories and places them in the familiar, modern-day setting of a coffee shop. Coffee Shop AU stories are usually something fun and light, and though the stories in Cafe AU Lait are entirely original with original characters, we wanted to make stories in that tradition of fun, light, romance fanfiction.\nLeft - by Timothy Delaney | Right - by Cameron Davis\nThe coffee crew includes: Holly Adkins, Cameron Davis, Tim Delaney, Michel Gerencir, Phee Hawberries, Jennifer Reuter, Briar Rolfe, Alyce Sarich, Teloka and Miss Pi, Samantha \"Mamath\" Calcraft and Sid Stones.\nA smorgasbord of Oceanic artists!\nCafe AU Lait is 95% ready to go, with almost all art complete from our creators. The anthology will be printed locally (in Australia!) and should have a fast turnaround since we are working with trusted printers who have produced high-quality work for us before. This means you won\u2019t be waiting long for the anthology to be in your hands, and we expect to be able to start shipping out the book in September.\nFrom left to right, art by: Phee Hawberries, Holly Adkins, and Jennifer Reuter\nAll of the artists on Cafe AU Lait have already received a base page-rate because we are passionate about artists being paid for their work (before everyone else has taken their cut). With your help, we can raise enough funds to print the book and then to give our creators more dollars for their excellent and enthusiastic work.\nFrom \"Bean Me Up\" by Briar Rolfe\nReady to see what you can get out of this campaign? Along with the book, we've created some awesome coffee shop themed rewards for you, which are both cute and practical!\nTHE MAIN EVENT\nThe biggest anthology we've made yet! Priced at only $20 AUD for a book that will contain well over 140 pages of comics content, we believe it is a steal! Including non-comics pages (like title pages, spacers, info etc) this thing is going to clock in around 180 pages. :0\nMock-up only. May be tweaked slightly in production but the basic design will remain the same!\nThese silicone coasters are cute and functional! Perfect to rest a steaming caffeinated beverage of your choice while you read our new anthology!\nMock up only - subject to production edits but basic pattern will remain unchanged.\nPractical but with a little whimsy! You can support Aus/NZ comics artists while also getting this fun tea towel for your kitchen table!\nMock up only. Final may be tweaked slightly.\n Exclusive to this campaign and never to be reprinted - coffee berries, tea flowers and honey bees! \nIf you've been needing a fresh profile pic for all those Zoom calls, consider something simple and sweet like our art cards!\nWe can paint animals, people, characters, you name it!\nLoads of options!!\nReady to support? We've a wide array of options to choose from! If you don't see exactly what you want, refer to our add-on menu to craft your own rewards package. Feel free to ask questions if you need clarification, we're here to help! :)\nWanting to add an item to your pledge? No problem! Use our handy add-on menu! Simply add the correct additional amount to your existing pledge for physical rewards to cover the extra items you want and fill out the survey we send out after campaign end to tell us which items you want added. We'll cross check with your pledge $$ and adjust your reward package accordingly. :) \nUnfortunately, Digital reward only pledges can not add physical rewards. If you're determined to get the digital tier but also want a non-book physical reward, please contact us. We will calculate shipping just for you and confirm the correct amount to pledge.\n*ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL PLEDGE ADD-ONS: If you add any extra rewards, you must also add an additional $6 (AUD) to your pledge to cover the extra shipping cost involved. This is because we estimate the book will weigh close to 250grams once packed to ship, so any additional weight (even one coaster) is likely to push your package up into the next weight bracket for shipping purposes. That additional 6 AUD covers you up to 500g though so you can add a bunch of extras and still be in the clear - just add the 6 AUD once. If you're looking to add-on a LOT or more than one extra book, hit us up on messages so we can calculate postage for you. :) Sorry it's a bit complicated!\nDOMESTIC PLEDGE ADD-ONS: Additional shipping cost for you is already covered in the add-on costs in the menu.\n2 stretch goals down!\nOur first goal of $7000 AUD let's us do the bare minimum of printing a small run of books. Throw us some extra coffee dollars though and we'll be able to do even more! More books, better quality printing, and additional payments to our contributors, who absolutely deserve it.\nAt Milestone #3, the editors (Sam/Mamath and Sid) who are otherwise not paid for their comic page contributions to the book, will get to be paid the same page rate as the other contributors. \nAt Milestone #4 and #5 the contributors (excluding the editors) will receive additional payments for their work.\nThis basic breakdown estimate is based on our first milestone requirements and data collected from previous projects. These numbers can shift around a fair bit depending on which milestone we get to (printing more books makes for a better price per book, for example) and what kind of rewards people back for. We've done our best to plan a tight campaign while still having a buffer to cover extra costs.\nTIMELINE:\nWe expect to be able to start shipping the books and extra rewards in September. However, with the pandemic and just the regular woes of fulfilling a project, there is the possibility of delays. \nJULY 1st - JULY 22nd : Kickstarter campaign runs.\nend of JULY: confirm reward numbers, book file preparation.\nAUGUST: Book printing, rewards production.\nSEPT: Reward fulfillment. Digital rewards will be distributed at the same time as physical fulfillment.\nStill need convincing? Check out a couple more full page samples! They're so good??\n\"On the House\" by Teloka and Miss Pi\n\"RX Coffee\" by Michel Gerencir", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBoth Sam and Sid have printed many books before with the printer lined up to print the book. Unless Covid gets somehow even worse, we got this. We've also got back-up suppliers for the non-book reward items.\n\nAnd even if it gets worse and the printer can\u2019t print, there might just be a small delay. \n\nIt's understandable to be worried about shipping right now because of the pandemic! Sam has been operating her webstore (sending a couple hundred orders per month) all through the pandemic with no significant issues aside from delays. It simply means international folks will have to accept that 1-2 months transit time for packages is normal right now.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 7 or more", "title": "Decaf", "descp": "The digital only tier!

We know - crazy, eh? In this technologically-challenged era, Nintendo fans garnered their knowledge and wisdom from print magazines. There are far too many to mention here, but personal favourites of ours included Mean Machines (before it evolved like a Pok\u00e9mon into Nintendo Magazine System), Total!, Super Play, Cube, NGamer and of course the Official Nintendo Magazine itself. These magazines were bursting with passion, knowledge and coverage for the consoles that we loved so dearly. Overseas readers will no doubt remember their own (sometimes official) publications, such as the legendary Nintendo Power.\nThe internet (and specifically, video coverage) may be winning now in terms of content and delivery, but there are still those that yearn for the days of a print Nintendo magazine. Here in the UK, there hasn't been a dedicated Nintendo magazine since 2014. So, we think the time is right for a new one.\nThe final issues of some amazing Nintendo coverage. We miss all of these, do you?\nSo, what's this then?  \nThere's a hole in the market. As we said, with no Nintendo magazines at all in the UK since 2014 and the recent demise of corporate multi-format publications in general (like GamesMaster and GamesTM) there's a huge lack of Nintendo coverage in print form. Whilst there are enthusiast ventures available, we craved something that completely covered and encompassed Nintendo's vast history. Something that looks at the retro aspect and well as the new, with a fresh perspective on things. So, we thought we would make one: Ninty Fresh. Something that will cater for ALL of Nintendo. From NES to Switch.\nNinty Fresh? What's that all about?\nCapturing what the magazine is about with the added benefit of a cheeky pun, the title Ninty Fresh tells you right from the get-go what we want to do. Imagine, if you will, a cross between EMAP's Nintendo Official Magazine, Future's Official Nintendo Magazine and a dash of Retro Gamer and NGamer and that's what we hope to be bringing, all with that Nintendo flavour and familiarity that older magazines brought you. But in 2020. And obviously, with no affiliation to those amazing magazines.\nMaking your own magazine without advertising support or huge corporate backing is challenging, so this first Issue of Ninty Fresh is going to be an A4 (210mmx297mm) 80-page page-turner and will contain a smorgasbord of Nintendo content crammed into those pages. And no adverts.\nWhat will be in it?\nOur intention is to bring a range of enjoyable content in each issue. With editorials looking at the latest big Nintendo story, what's happened since the last Nintendo magazines, huge cover features as well as system recaps and informative interviews, all interwoven with amazing artwork, the latest reviews and even some fun and games! Oh, and fan content. We want your stuff. Letters (or emails), tweets, questions, artwork - all that sort of thing. We will be in touch closer to the launch with more details about those bits.\nWe've already got an interview with former NOM Editor Tim Street, the legendary Chris Scullion, who has written a massive NES encyclopaedia, has written a NES retrospective, and we have a feature/retro review on why The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was incredible. These things are already written and in place.\nThis year also sees the celebration of 35 years of Super Mario, so it seemed timely to dedicate a huge section to Mario's history. Everything for this first issue is either in progress, already completed or is awaiting release (reviews); we'd say around 50% of the content is already prepared. We've also reached out to other former Nintendo magazine writers and collectively they've written around 1000 words for the feature.\nAlthough not the final design, this is the sort of thing you can expect in Ninty Fresh\nWhen will it come out?\nWe are targeting an early August release for this, but will keep you posted. Obviously, we are already hard at work putting this all together - around 50% of it is already completed. The release ultimately depends on whether it gets funded and when the funds are processed, but we are hoping to start shipping these out before the end of July.\nFunding Target \nSpeaking of funding, our target of \u00a32000 will ensure that an 80-page print issue will be produced. However, we hope that we can make something much bigger in the future, and if enough people support it and show that there's demand. Helping us to produce this first issue gives us the platform and scope to make this evolve even more and we can even make this beefier.\nAs we said, we\u2019re already in discussions with folks that used to be involved with Nintendo magazines and really want to be able to bring their fantastic writing back where it belongs - in print. We hope that this will be around for the long-haul; in fact even our spines are being designed so that they'll make a pretty picture when put together. We'd need a fair few successful issues to achieve that!\nIf you like the sound of what we are doing, we have physical and digital options available, and some more premium levels if you really want to help this project come to life. Please help us get a print Nintendo magazine back into people's hands.\nStretch Goals\n(Updated 2nd June 2020)\nAfter smashing through our initial target, we have had a quick little brainstorm and amended/added new bits for you.\n\u00a35000 - NES Pin Badge! - Achieved!\nPoor Jhon has hand-drawn every Nintendo console for us.\nThis shiny little beauty will be making its way to everyone that supported the print magazine or higher. PDF-only folks, can we tempt you?\n\u00a37500 - Famicom Pin Badge and Colouring-in Sheet\nGet your mates to sign up for the premium level and we will hit this level Easily!\nThis will go nicely with the other one. You know you need it. We will also issue the cover as a line-art drawing so that you can colour it in if you are feeling artistic. Or better yet, give it to the kids. They can colour it in so you can read the magazine in peace!\n\u00a310,000 - Top Loading NES Pin Badge and Art Print\nYes, we've made three badges. You know you want them all!\n\u00a310000 - All issues of Ninty Fresh 01 will come packaged with a high-quality art print from the cover. And the little badge we initially said you'd get is now this one. So this stretch goal hasn't really changed, we've just added more badges to help us get there.\nHow can you help?\nFor starters, even supporting our little thing is humbling. Whether you pledge for a PDF version of the magazine, the print copy, or one of the heavier tiers, your support is what will make this happen. We absolutely love Nintendo and its games, and just want to make something that brings more of that content to more eyes. Beyond that, sharing this Kickstarter, telling your friends and pushing it far and wide. The more people supporting this, the more likely it'll not only become a reality, but allow us to make something even better and bigger in the future. And perhaps even more regular.\nAnd, as noted in some of the masses of words above, we will need your letters (emails), and tweets. Pictures and stuff. These magazines in the past were almost communities within themselves. We want to try to build something like that.We are forever seeing people lament the loss of Nintendo magazines. This is your chance to ensure one gets made.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge right now is obviously the current global situation. However, our usual printing company are running as normal as is the Royal Mail, so delivery of these issues shouldn't be an issue.\n\nThe design of the magazine is already set and work has already started on the content at the time of writing this (May 2020) with the majority of the planned work already laid out.\n\nThe financial cost of the project is managed versus the target. If we hit the target, we will be able to fund and manage the issue. The biggest risk is the cost; hence the (seemingly) smaller page count. This will, however, be offset with a stretch target. It becomes more affordable to make a bigger magazine if more people support it!\n\nWe have experience running another little thing (Switch Player Magazine) like clockwork so the workload to produce this single issue alongside it over a longer period of time shouldn't have any impact whatsoever.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nOur printing company uses vegetable based inks on FSC certified paper", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a32 or more", "title": "Get a Digital Copy", "descp": "Backers at this level will receive a digital copy of our new Nintendo magazine!

You may know me as Dibujante Nocturno on Instagram or Facebook. \nThank you for taking the time to check out this Kickstarter campaign for my art book Dibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s. \n Together with 3dtotal Publishing, I am creating a book that reflects who I really am as an artist, by giving insight into my creative experience and processes. The book will also include my ballpoint pen sketches, many of which I have scanned and colored especially for this project, and some new digital paintings, which I can't wait to share!\nDibujante Nocturno: The Art of Fran Garc\u00e9s will be beautifully presented in hardback with grained leather-effect binding and gunmetal foiling, making it a stunning addition to your art book collection. \nI see my sketchbooks as personal journals, recording important thoughts and moments in my creative journey. To offer a glimpse into my artistic mindset, I have chosen to include unseen personal sketches in this book, accompanied by notes and inner musings.\nIn addition to showcasing diverse galleries of my fantastical works, I will be sharing my workflow through a series of step-by-step tutorials and a collection of tips and tricks I have learned over the years as a freelance artist. Through this book I hope that I can help you to grow and develop as artists and offer inspiration for years to come.\nI hope you will consider supporting this project to help make this book a reality. Thank you all very much!\nBelow are the exclusive items that are available in addition to the book. Some tiers and gifts are limited, so be sure to pledge quickly if you don\u2019t want to miss out! We have put a lot of love into these items and we hope you enjoy them.\nPlease note that as this is a live project, all designs are examples of content I would like to include but these are subject to change.\n\n\n\n\n Launching this book through Kickstarter means we can thank those who support the book by adding extra stretch goal rewards to the campaign. I have designed high-quality bonus rewards to be given away if we can meet certain targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3dtotal like to give the best and most exciting stretch goals possible to their backers. For that reason we only reveal one stretch goal at a time. This allows us to respond to the success of the campaign, offering more exciting and adventurous items when the campaign does well, rather than having committed to multiple smaller inexpensive products.\n\n3dtotal publishing is committed to having a positive effect on the environment. From 2020 they have committed to planting one tree for every book they sell by partnering with re-forestation charities. This includes books sold in their Kickstarter campaigns. If you support this campaign we would like to thank you for helping us take on this mission.\n3dtotal Publishing is able to ship worldwide! Simply select your pledge option and your location, and Kickstarter will calculate the shipping for you.\nAll rewards will be sent out at the same time (both signed and unsigned). However, if there is a very high number of backers, please keep in mind that it will take us a few days to work our way through packaging all the rewards. 3dtotal Publishing has a fulfilment company lined up to do this as quickly as possible, so once dispatched, rewards should reach you in 10-15 working days.\nWe have fulfilled many successful Kickstarters and we have a great record for delivering parcels around the world. For this campaign we will be offering tracked shipping to certain locations as we're really determined that you receive your parcel first time without any hiccups or problems with delivery. Parcels sent to the UK, USA and Europe will be sent using our regular and reliable service, and parcels sent to the rest of the world will be sent with tracked shipping. Due to complications to logistics caused by the Coronavirus, some countries have introduced surcharges to receiving international postage. This is why shipping prices will seem slightly higher for some backers than it has done on our past campaigns.\nUnforeseen delays that are out of our control can occur during delivery, so please allow an additional two weeks before checking up on your package. We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nFor those who are not familiar with Kickstarter, it\u2019s a worldwide crowd-funding platform for artists and their creative projects. Once the funding period ends, we will start finalizing the book and the extra rewards, which will be sent to you in October. About a month before that, we will send you a survey through Kickstarter, asking for your address \u2013 the reason we wait until a few weeks before is so that we have everyone\u2019s most up-to-date details. When the survey is ready for you to fill in, you will receive an email through Kickstarter. We ask that you fill the survey in as soon as possible, to avoid any delays in sending out your reward!\n  As seasoned users of Kickstarter, 3dtotal Publishing know that a very small number of backers don\u2019t fill in the survey at the end of a Kickstarter campaign, making it impossible for us to process and ship their rewards. 3dtotal pledges to hold all rewards for backers that fail to fill in their survey for 12 months and to make multiple efforts to contact the backers in question to try to successfully deliver their items.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne of the biggest challenges will be producing and delivering everything to you on time.

The story is planned to span three 32 page full color issues.\nThe story follows a team of super-powered humans on an assassination mission to the edge of the known universe. Each member of this elite unit must wrestle with their role in the power structures of earth as they are pushed to their mental and physical limits.\nPREVIEW:\nHere's a preview of ERIS to give you a taste of the insane world we've built:\nWe designed ERIS to capture the energy of 90\u2019s comics, the thought-provoking formalism of alternative comics, and the excess of 80\u2019s sci-fi action films. \nERIS is 100% complete and ready to print!  This means when we hit our goal, the book can be immediately sent to the printers and ready to ship as soon as possible.  You won\u2019t be waiting months and months for your reward to arrive, which we know is a huge bummer!\nHere's what other comic creators are saying about ERIS:\n\"With ERIS, Tyrell is bringing a new voice to science fiction with a dynamic and blood fueled tale.  GET THIS!\" -Daniel Warren Johnson, creator of Murder Falcon, Extremity and Wonder Woman: Dead Earth.\n\"ERIS is sci-fi action comics as they were meant to be: Big ideas and even bigger muscles.\" - Aubrey Sitterson, co-creator of No One Left to Fight and The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling\n\"This comic is hot as shit. No one draws like Tyrell Cannon.\" - Isabella Rotman,  co-creator of Wait What? A Comic Book Guide to Relationships, Bodies, and Growing Up and creator of This Might Hurt Tarot Deck,\n...\nERIS theme song by J.L. Shioshita\nERIS title animation by Jonathan Lamantia\n...\nWHO WE ARE:\nERIS is created by the Cannon brothers, Tyrell & Logan.  They grew up on a steady diet of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and Rob Liefeld comics in the golden age of Saturday morning cartoons!  Logan is an actor and writer, bringing his penchant for awesome movie lines to the ERIS script.  Tyrell is a comic artist and illustrator who has been making comics for over 15 years.  He is known for creating the ground-breaking sci-fi anthology Speculative Relationships, cover art for comics like Murder Falcon, as well as his own comics Victus and Gary.   Most recently, his DOOM-inspired inktober comic IDKFA lit up the internet with it\u2019s brutal demon-killing action.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the world right now, especially in the comics industry.  We feel that what we can do is: KEEP MAKING AWESOME COMICS. ERIS is our gift to you during this crazy time.\n...\n REWARDS\nA high resolution PDF of ERIS #1. 32 Pages, full color.\nA high quality, full size, staple bound copy of ERIS #1.  32 pages, full color.

I firmly believe in stretch goals that provide more content and focus on the actual comic, rather than throwing in a bunch of unrelated knick-knacks.  In that spirit\u2026\n$4k: Artist Edition\nAs comic and movie fans, we LOVE special features.  Hearing from makers how they create expands the work, giving readers another level of appreciation for the book.  When this stretch goal is unlocked, we will offer an Artist Edition PDF of ERIS #1 to all backers.  This Artist Edition will include things like:\nThumbnail sketches of each page\n  Raw scans of the artwork\n  Color process guides\n  Script pages\n  Commentary on each page by Tyrell & Logan\n  Development sketches\n  A video walkthrough of each page of ERIS, with commentary by Tyrell\n  We really want to make this available to readers, so let\u2019s hit that goal!\n$6k: Issue #2 Fast Track\nWE WANT YOU TO READ ERIS #2 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! Issue 2 is completely written and the thumbnailing has already started.  It is shaping up to be an insane action-packed issue.\nIssue #1 of ERIS was drawn over the course of a year, in my \u201cspare time\u201d between my paid illustration and comics work.  It is a labor of love that I want to spend more time and attention on going forward.  When we hit this stretch goal, the funding will go towards making ERIS #2 my full-time focus for the 2 months directly following the campaign (and after orders are all shipped).  This means the story will continue without waiting another year!  Backers would get sneak peeks into the process during this time, followed by another kickstarter campaign to facilitate the costs printing/shipping of issue #2.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI (Tyrell) have run 4 successful kickstarter campaigns to date, delivering rewards safely and on-time to backers.

This is, as they say, \u201cnot my first rodeo\u201d. I know the many challenges of putting a comic together and getting it into the hands of readers. I will always meet these challenges with planning and communication.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has already created many issues for comics and everyday life. We have checked with our printer and confirmed that they are operating and ready to go. We also have looked into multiple shipping options to have a plan for delivery. No doubt, more challenges could arise due to the current pandemic, but we will always be communicative and forward with our backers about the status of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "ERIS #1 Digital Edition", "descp": "A high resolution PDF of ERIS #1. 32 Pages, full color.\nINCLUDES:\nERIS #1 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}], "stat": ["89 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "ERIS #1 Print Edition", "descp": "A high quality, full size, staple bound copy of ERIS #1. 32 pages, full color.

Having myself experienced what can happen when a screenplay becomes a graphic novel, to say I'm excited by this Kickstarter is very much an understatement!\u201d \u2014 William Gibson\nMADI is a 260-page road trip graphic novel set in the near future, by film director Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and writer Alex de Campi (BAD KARMA, BLADE RUNNER), and drawn by some of comics\u2019 most exciting artists including Glenn Fabry, Simon Bisley, Duncan Fegredo and Pia Guerra. Each artist tackles a 8-30 page section of the story, bringing to life one location.\nSee for yourself: Download the first 19 pages of MADI here! Includes both the Fegredo/Phillips and Shimizu covers.\n This project is EU/UK shipping friendly! We are drop-shipping to a UK distributor so shipping is affordable to our huge and beloved European fanbase. Estimated maximum shipping costs for a single book are: US: $10 / Canada & Mexico: $15 / UK: $20 / Mainland Europe: $25 / Rest of World: $55. Shipping costs will be collected at checkout (after the campaign ends) via Backerkit, where you\u2019ll also have the chance to add on additional books or upgrade to a higher-tier book. \nMadi Preston, a veteran of Britain\u2019s elite special operations J-Squad unit, is burnt out and up to her eyeballs in debt. She and the rest of her team have retired from the military but are now trapped having to pay to service and maintain the technology put into them during their years of service.   They're working for British conglomerate Liberty Inc as  mercenaries, selling their unique ability to be remote controlled by specialists while in the field, and the debts are only growing as they get injured completing missions. We meet Madi as she decides she\u2019s had enough.  She will take an off-the-books job that should earn her enough to pay out her and her sister, but when the piece of tech she\u2019s supposed to steal turns out to be a kid, and she suddenly blacks out... she finds herself on the run from everyone she\u2019s ever known. \nIn a globe-spanning adventure from Shanghai to Soho, Madi has to stay one step ahead of the giant corporations closing in on her from all sides. \nMADI is the third and final story in the \u201cMooniverse,\u201d an anthology of independent stories that take place in a shared future. You don\u2019t need to have seen MOON or MUTE to fully enjoy this standalone book.\nThe full roster of line artists are: Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Oca\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell, Tonci Zonjic, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Gu\u00e9ra, Chris Weston,  Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David Lopez and Christian Ward. Our amazing colour team includes: Matt Wilson, Nayoung Kim, Chris O\u2019Halloran, Adam Brown, Jacob Phillips, Ra\u00fal Arnaiz, Giulia Brusco, Sergey Nazarov and Kelly Fitzpatrick. Lettering is by Alex. \nEvery artist has been paid their full asking rate and is also getting royalties on the project. As freelancers ourselves, we believe in being the change we want to see in the industry.  \nThe book is almost finished being drawn and is currently being lettered. It will be sent to backers in early November, and comes in your choice of a luxe 7\u00bc X 10 \u00bd\u201d paperback, a 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d hardback (the original art size), or an oversize 10 x 14\u00bd\u201d cased hardback with over 40 pages of back matter. The paperback cover is by Duncan Fegredo & Jacob Phillips, and the hardback cover is by Yuko Shimizu. \nDuncan Fegredo and Jacob Phillips' beautiful wrap cover for the paperback edition\nBecause both Duncan and Alex have big fanbases in Europe we are doing our damnedest to make sure shipping is as inexpensive as possible while maintaining safe and careful mailing of these extremely nice, high quality editions. We're working with drop-shipping to UK distributors so European buyers won't have to pay airmail from the US.  Backerkit is handling all our pledge management and will be charging shipping at the end, once the campaign is over (you'll also be able to add on books or upgrade your pledge at that time, if you want). Z2 has its own warehouse, so US fulfillment can be handled easily and professionally in-house. \nNo digital version of MADI will be made available at this time, or indeed maybe ever.\nStores, you will be able to order MADI for retail sale at your fine shops a few weeks after Kickstarter fulfillment.  \nYuko Shimizu's luscious cover for the hardback edition\nA model of Yuko's cover on the hardback, without logos (why interrupt the pretty until you have to)\nThe deluxe slipcase edition is truly a magnificent book, with the art reproduced at luscious 10\u201d x 14.5\u201d size (a 20% blowup on the book\u2019s original art size of 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d) and with over 60 pages of extras, process, and essays from Duncan and Alex, along with surprise bonus art from friends like Colleen Doran and Jeffrey Veregge! See a scene go from original screenplay through Alex\u2019s handwritten breakdowns to comic script, pencils, inks, then colours! Pore over the thumbnails and rough layouts of masters like Duncan Fegredo and RM Gu\u00e9ra! Enjoy all the character sketches and development work that went on behind the scenes (there was a lot, this project was super complex to produce) such as Annie Wu\u2019s amazing Kitty Cop concept art, below! (The whole Kitty Cop origin story is pretty great, too, it basically involves Alex + too much sugar.) \nThe Madi deluxe edition with diecut slipcase\nThe slipcase edition features Yuko\u2019s gorgeous wrap cover without logos, inside a diecut slipcase that allows Yuko\u2019s illustration of Madi to show through. This slipcase edition will not be available for retail sale; if you miss it here, maybe we might have a few at the Z2 Comics table at a convention, but maybe not. \nAnnie Wu\u2019s concept art for our Kitty Cops, or: \u201ckawaii, but make it fascism\u201d\nDuncan Fegredo's lovely wrap cover for the softcover edition, before its colours by Jacob Phillips!\nA Simon BIsley warmup sketch, as you do; another of the sort of extras that only come in the deluxe slipcase edition\nAlso, neither Duncan nor Alex have ANY chill so we'll probably post lots of lettered pages in the updates.... but only for backers.  \nDuncan's last \"Free the 156\" stickers from MUTE, for the first 50 hardcover backers\n Who we are:\nMan; made Moon & more\nDuncan Jones is a British advertising and film director, best known for his BAFTA winning film MOON, epic game-based fantasy movie WARCRAFT and his other science fiction films SOURCE CODE & MUTE.  He is presently staying safely locked up at his home, waiting for it to be safe to go out and make ROGUE TROOPER of 2000AD fame with Rebellion Studios.  Duncan is answerable to his wife, Rodene, his two kids, Stenton 4 and Zowie 2, and his dog, who takes her privacy very seriously after a scamming incident, and wishes to remain anonymous. \nWoman; made books\nAlex de Campi is a novellist and comics writer, best known for her noir graphic novel BAD GIRLS and her love anthology TWISTED ROMANCE, both of which were nominated for three Eisner awards last year. She has also written some episodes of Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s BLADE RUNNER anime (on Toonami next year) and worked with Masamune Shirow on a GHOST IN THE SHELL comic for Kodansha. Her debut novel, medieval suspense thriller THE SCOTTISH BOY, comes out at the end of the month and you can preorder it here in the UK or here in the US. You can read her action-thriller comic BAD KARMA anywhere in the world right now, as it is pay-what-you-wish on lovely webcomic site Panel Syndicate. Alex is answerable to her daughter Lorelei and her deafblind pit bull Tango, and they\u2019re all answerable to the darn cat. Her little family is currently enjoying being the only people left in Manhattan. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks, the book is already paid for and most art is finished.

This is it: \nIt made me think, why hasn't anyone made a blacklight comic book with fluorescent ink? These colors are so bright! It would be the best looking comic book ever.\nSo I decided to make one. It's called OCTOBRIANA 1976. \nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIt's about a badass Russian superhero/devil-woman who fights Soviet oppression and robot Stalin.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIt's set in the 1970s because when I think of blacklight art, I think of the 70s. Plus the story is inspired by underground comix of the 70s.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nOctobriana comes from the book Octobriana and the Russian Underground (1971) by Petr Sadecky. It's about a subversive group of artists and writers in Kiev in the 1960s who create a western-style superhero character as an act of dissent. They made outlaw comics called samizdat (publish-it-yourself <-- reminds me of zines in the US or dojinshi in Japan) that starred Octobriana. Sadecky smuggled this material out of the USSR for his book. Since then, Octobriana has appeared in several comic books across many decades and countries. She seemed like a perfect character for American underground comix - a show of solidarity with their Russian countercultural kin. \nOf course some of that is not true. It's a great book that reminds me of things like Orson Welles' War of the Worlds and F for Fake, Spinal Tap, or H.P. Lovecraft's mythology (specifically the way other writers are free to use his creations). Here is a Cartoonist Kayfabe video that Ed Piskor and I made about Sadecky's book:\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 preview\nIn order to make this work, I'm teaming up with my frequent partner-in-creative - AdHouse Books' Chris Pitzer. Pitzer's my print guru. We first teamed up on the 1970s superhero graphic novel Afrodisiac. It featured some unusual printing/coloring/design to approximate the look of the time period: \nWe also did Street Angel: Princess of Poverty. This was the first time I worked with fluorescent ink in offset printing (the cover lettering and spine). It's not the same as other ink. For example, you need to print it twice to \"charge\" it:\nSo when I first thought about making a blacklight comic book with fluorescent ink, I talked to AdHouse Books. His expertise is the reason this is going to be the best looking comic book ever!\nREWARDS\nUPDATE!!! I've created 3 editions of the digital OCTOBRIANA 1976 - Neon, Retro, and Black-and-white! These will be sent to everyone who backs this Kickstarter starting at the $5 level! Here are samples. I'm also making comic book editions of the retro and black-and-white versions:\nREWARDS\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 - DIGITAL EDITIONS \nRead these on your computer or mobile device. Because the fluorescent color doesn't translate well to the screen, I decided to create a custom digital copy of Octobriana 1976. The coloring is different than the print edition but I tried to make it look its best for your screen!\nPROCESS: OCTOBRIANA 1976 ZINE\nThis is a cross between a how-to book and an Artist Edition. It features my script, layouts, sketches, and scans of the original art that went into the creation of Octobriana 1976.\nOCTOBRIANA 1976 - PRINT EDITION \nThis is why we're all here - 24 page, saddle-stitched comic book featuring bright, fluorescent colors! Is it the best looking comic book ever? Get one and decide for yourself. If you or someone you know loves comics, printed matter, or design - this is for you!\n UPDATE!!! I've created 3 editions of the digital OCTOBRIANA 1976 - Neon, Retro, and Black-and-white! I like how they look so I'm going to make limited print editions of the Retro and Black-and-white versions. If you've already chosen another Reward but you'd like to add these variant editions - you will be able to add them when you check out at the end of this campaign:\nBLACKLIGHT SCREEN PRINTS Signed and Numbered\nIn addition to the comic book, I'm offering signed and numbered blacklight screen prints as rewards, including the Dragon Killer print that started this journey plus an Octobriana print and Afrodisiac print - it is her Kickstarter after all! You can also get a set of all three for a nice price. Prints are 18 x 24 inches.   \nUPDATE: Afrodisiac package REWARD is now available - Octobriana 1976 comic book + Afrodisiac book + Afrodisiac blacklight screen print\nUPDATE: I have added 2 prints for a very limited 5 print set. The 2 prints are from previous print runs and limited quantities. One is a blacklight screen print based on Alexis Ziritt's comic book Space Riders. The other is a 3D screen print for Plan 9 from Outer Space. Both prints are 18 x 24 inches.\n\nART\nOctobriana drawings on comic book backing boards. The drawings pictured below are samples of what some of these backboard drawings look like. The drawings will vary since each is a unique, one-of-a-kind drawing and not a print.  Backing boards are approximately 6.75 x 10.5 inches. Media is pencil, ink, marker, paint, highlighter, color pencil, or mixed media. The backing board will be in a plastic sleeve along with your copy of Octobriana 1976 comic book. \nORIGINAL ART: STRETCH GOAL BOOKPLATE DRAWING\nThe original art for the Stretch Goal Bookplate/Signed Print. It is ink on bristol, 11 x 17 inches.\nORIGINAL ART: DRAGONKILLER\nThe original art from the Dragonkiller blacklight print is now available. It is archival ink on bristol, 18 x 24 inches.\nDetail:\nThere are a few concept drawings available as rewards. These are character drawings that I made when I was working out the designs, materials, and style of OCTOBRIANA 1976. These concept drawings are 11 x 17, ink on bristol.  \nConcept drawing 1\nConcept drawing 2\nConcept drawing 3\nThe cover art is also a Reward and 11 x 17, ink and screen tone on bristol.\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED! $60,000 - Octobriana Checklist: Old school fanzine style! Where else has Octobriana appeared? I'll try to make a comprehensive list of appearances in comic books as well as real world media.\n$75,000 - Signed bookplate/print: This will be included with the Print edition OCTOBRIANA 1976 fluorescent, blacklight comic book. It will feature a new drawing and design by Jim Rugg! I'm not saying it will be from OCTOBRIANA 1986...but that was a magical year for comics. I'm sure the goddess of war had something to say about it!\nFINAL NOTE\nEventually I plan to distribute this comic book anywhere and everywhere that I can. This includes comic book shops, conventions, and online. I do not know how those details will unfold, but I want to be honest about my intentions. My goal is to make comics accessible to readers everywhere. \nThank you for your support and read more comics!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDigital copies will be delivered as soon as the funds are cleared by Kickstarter.

A few years later in 1995, the first Spawn action figure was released to retail and critical acclaim helping to usher in a whole new way of giving you much detailed and \u2018art\u2019 to your action figures. Now, twenty-five years later, Todd McFarlane is joining forces with Kickstarter to help deliver an updated version of that original 1995 toy & comic release. \nABOUT THE FIGURE\nThis figure will be 7 inches tall and come with a huge folding cape and weapon. The articulation in this version will be more than double what the original toy had, and the included comic cover will be re-drawn by the international award-winning artist and creator of the Spawn character, Todd McFarlane.  \nPLAY\n\n As well, this new remastered version will come in its own box with slipcover to help preserve the condition of the figure, comic and packaging. And speaking of the actual blister packaging, it will mimic the original design from the classic toy of 1995, though upgrades will be all across the final product.\nPLAY\n\n A new re-sealable clamshell  package will be used so you may take out your figure and comic for display, but also be able to return them both into their packaging like you have never opened it in the first place!\nTo simplify this offering, there will be only four levels: A CLASSIC costume version. A MODERN costume version (with new head), an ARTIST PROOF (what we\u2019re calling the \u2018black & white) and lastly the 3-PACK bundle which will include a Classic, Modern and Black & White figure. The latter two figures getting new head sculpts!)\nTODD MCFARLANE'S AUTOGRAPH\nIf you choose, you can also get an autograph by the creator and artist of Spawn, Todd McFarlane himself. Todd will be personally signing a name plate that can be used for display with your comic and toy. And each autographed item will also come with a bonus weapon: A re-imagining of the wooden plank weapon from that original Spawn figure from 1995.\n\n3-PACK SPAWN TRILOGY: TWO NEW HEADS\n The 3-pack Spawn Trilogy will only be offered with an autograph and include the CLASSIC SPAWN, MODERN SPAWN with a unique AL SIMMONS HUMAN HEAD, and ARTIST PROOF SPAWN (black & white) with a unique SCREAMING HEAD. Each figure included in the 3- pack comes with an original comic book. \n This is your chance to get in on history as it repeats itself in this remastered version of the character and toy that helped change the industry of how visual and detailed action figures could look.\nFREE BONUS head for 3-Pack and CLASSIC SPAWN pledges.\nHeads and Weapons (check your level to see if your item qualifies for these)\nMODERN SPAWN 3-PACK work-in-progress\nNECRO-ENERGY BURST (all Classic Spawn will come with one)\nColor scheme for LAUNCHER-GUN Weapon for Modern Spawn\n\nNECRO-SWORD weapon (included with all ARTIST PROOF Spawn pledges)\nSHIPPING COSTS\nFigures will be shipped anywhere in the world, but ALL backers are responsible for shipping.

Humanity creating its own demons in the form of the weapons it forged. Though the conflict has long ended these dangers remain. Hong Kong is now one giant bazaar selling anything your heart desires. Encrypted black ice, tame plagues and multi-phase rifles are now sold alongside the flesh and crime of the old city. Those who look further still will find the true horrors hiding in the dark corners of the city and all have a price tag attached.\nOnly a select few walk this beat any more. One such soldier now works for the United Nations Weapon Inspection team, tasked with removing errant dangers from the public's possession.\nHer name is King.\nUpdate:\nDue to the amazing support and success of this project I am happy to announce the stretch goals, with all three having now been met! So if your already backing me then thank you! If not then keep scrolling down to find out more about the book and join us on this awesome ride.\nThe Book.\nGrenade is a graphic novel that I am in the process of making. The core of the story follows the efforts of Inspector King as she and her partner strive to keep the cyberpunk city of Hong Kong safe. The future is filled with a wide array of fantastical and horrifying weapons and it is their job to protect the public and seize any such items.\nI'm wanting to create a story that will capture the imagination and also give the reader a real journey through the future Hong Kong I'm illustrating. Filled of course with a colourful cast of heroes, villains and con-artists.\nHere are the first few pages to give you a feel for the project.\nThe book itself will be 120-130 pages long, A5 sized (148mm x 210mm) and Hardcover. This is because I want to create something that will feel great in your hands as you settle down to read the finished product. The story within will be a stand alone tale. So there will be no hanging around or the sequel. Just a great story to enjoy on its own.\nThis image is not the finalised cover.\n The reason I chose to use kickstarter is simple. I wanted to be to pitch my idea for a book straight to you, the reader. You're the only one I'm trying to impress with this idea. Rather than pitch to a publisher I want you to be the reason I'm working on this, pure and simple.\nAbout Me.\nI've been drawing since I was little and drawing comics on the small press scene for almost 10 years. I have grown in that time and now my work will soon be appearing in Image Comics \"Island\". I have also self published a range of comics including my series \"The Sea\" and \"Tuk Tuk\". \nRaised and living in Sheffield in the UK I studied graphic design and now work or myself as an illustrator/comic artist. The only thing I've been doing as long as I have been into drawing is roleplaying. So I guess I'm a terminal geek...\nThe Rewards.\nWe all know the book is the thing but your probably wondering what about the other things offered in the rewards. \nAlso as a side note where it reads Tyrant in the rewards this is in reference to the old name of the book. The book will be exactly the same just named Grenade. \nWell every tier will receive a digital copy of the finished book just as soon as it is finished. I will also be emailing out sneak peeks and pages on a regular email to all backers while I work through the project.\nThe postcard sized prints will have 5 different designs and will be printed on high quality card stock. The illustrations will be solely on these prints and will only be available through the Kickstarter.\nA personalised drawing in your book. This will be an ink sketch of your fine self or your avatar, drawn as though you are a part of the Grenade world, on the inside cover of the book.\nThe character illustrations on reward five will be full length Illustrations of a character of your choosing. It could be from my book, your book, a roleplaying character or anyone really. You will receive the original pencils with your book and an email containing the finished colour version in high res.\nThe A3 (420mm x 297mm) can be anything you want. As with the previous reward you will be sent the original pencils along with your book and an email with the finished colour version.\nThe Final reward tier is the chance for up to 5 people to role-play in a custom written adventure set in the world of Grenade. You will create your own character and explore Hong Kong under the guidance o myself as GM. I will run the game over Skype for your group or if you are in the uk I will come to you if your prefer. Along with this I will illustrate your characters for the game and of course you'll all get your copy of the book too.

If The Wizard of Oz met the Hidden Fortress with influences derived from Escaflowne, hip-hop, and classic RPGs -- you get Cannon Busters, one wild ride of fun, suspense, action, and wackiness. It's a roadshow-style adventure of epic proportions!\n\nThe Story\nFollow the adventures and exploits of S.A.M, a high-end, royal-class friendship droid who's joined by a quirky, discarded maintenance robot and a brash, deadly fugitive. Together, the unlikely trio embarks on an unforgettable journey in a fantastic and dangerous world in search of S.A.M's best friend, the heir to a powerful kingdom under siege.\nThe Main Characters\nThe World\nThe story takes place hundreds of years ago in the vast and magical world of Gearbolt. As the centuries passed, the practice of magic became extinct, and many have forgotten its power, regulating it to mere superstition\u2026\nThe Project\nCannon Busters is an animated project created by TV animation producer/director LeSean Thomas. The goal is to produce a 8-10 minute pilot episode (1 act) through Kickstarter. We're looking to you to help us raise, at the very least, the minimum goal of $120,000 (8-10 minutes). If we surpass our minimum goal, our stretch goals will increase the length of the episode by 8-16 minutes, ultimately providing us the funds to create and develop a full 24-minute episode!\nThe Team Players\nHere's some of the team members who you'll be supporting to help bring Cannon Busters to life!\n LeSean Thomas, Creator/Director/Writer (https://twitter.com/LeSeanThomas)\nLeSean Thomas has contributed to television animation in the United States for over 10 years. His most notable works include Peabody Award-winning series The Boondocks on Adult Swim serving as Co-Director (Season 1) and Supervising Character Designer (Seasons 1 & 2), Nickelodeon's The Legend Of Korra (Book 1) as a storyboard/production artist, and most recently Black Dynamite: The Animated Series as Creative Producer (Season 1) and Supervising Director (Seasons 1 & 2) on Adult Swim.\nRecently, Thomas spent several years working abroad in South Korea as an animation production/storyboard artist, honing his skills and developing Cannon Busters while lending his talent to hit shows. He is driven by his passion and enthusiasm for animation production and enjoys sharing his knowledge with the animation & art community online. Drawing from Western and Eastern influences, Thomas's work displays a level of stylistic expression and dynamism that makes him highly distinguishable among his peers. Through his unique vision and your support, he hopes to bring Cannon Busters to life!\nJoe Madureira, Contributing Character Designer (http://www.airshipsyndicate.com)\nOne of the most influential artists working today, Joe Madureira is a celebrated comic book creator, illustrator, and game developer. His breakout work on titles such as Marvel's Uncanny X-Men and his creator-owned comic book Battle Chasers has earned him much acclaim. He also served as Creative Director for the hit video game series Darksiders (1&2). Madureira's energetic and distinctive style combines Western comic book influences with aspects of Japanese manga. We couldn't be more excited about his contributions to Cannon Busters!\nThomas Romain, Mechanical Designer (https://twitter.com/Thomasintokyo)\nThomas Romain has been a creative force since he moved from France to Japan over 10 years ago. As the Co-creator of Code Lyoko and Co-director/Character Designer on Oban Star Racers, Romain caught the attention of legendary Mecha Designer Shoji Kawamori (http://www.satelight.co.jp/kawamori/) and joined the famous animation studio Satelight Inc. (http://www.satelight.co.jp/eng/), where he helped co-create Basquash! Now a BG and Mecha Designer at Satelight, his most recent work has been lauded around the globe thanks to his unconventional Mecha designs for the popular Toonami series Space Dandy. His newest work on Cannon Busters promises to go even further!\nTim Yoon, Consulting Producer\nTim Yoon has worked as a producer in the American TV animation industry for over 10 years with notable works such as Batman: Under The Red Hood and The Legend of Korra (Books 1& 2). Having served as producer for The Killers \"Miss Atomic Bomb\" music video and most recently, the animation producer for the Drake Vs. Lil Wayne Tour, Yoon's wide range of experience -- in and outside animation -- is a valuable asset for Cannon Busters. \nBahi JD, animator\n(https://twitter.com/bahijd)\nBahi JD is one of the most promising up-and-coming animators working in TV animation today. Garnering online acclaim for his gif set animations years ago, he has since blossomed into one of 2D animation's growing talents. He's contributed his talents to various projects such as the Skullgirls video game, Shinichiro Watanabe's Kids on the Slope, the Mitsuyo Miyazaki/Koji Morimoto-directed short A Better Tomorrow, Space Dandy, Ping Pong, and most recently Ghost In The Shell: Arise. Bahi's kinetic and expressive flair will bring just the right touch to Cannon Busters!\nEric Calderon, Writer ( https://twitter.com/ericcalderon )\nEric has been in the international animation business for 20 years and has been the force behind the development of no less than 15 animated TV series in the genres of action, prime-time comedy, and kids entertainment. As a writer and co-producer for the legendary series Afro Samurai & Afro Samurai: Resurrection (starring the voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Kelly Hu, and Ron Perlman with music by the RZA), he helped lead that project into becoming the only anime in history to ever be nominated for a prime-time Emmy (the series also won an Individual Achievement Emmy for best Art Direction). In addition to development work, Eric was also the producer for Linkin Park's 'Breaking the Habit' video which won the MTV Video Music Award in 2005 for 'Viewer's Choice.' Finally, Eric has also written and released an original graphic novel called COLD SPACE with Samuel L. Jackson and continues to work daily to break the boundaries of what animation can do in the USA. He currently owns and operates an original Intellectual Property development and production company called Wild Boar Media, Inc. and is also Directing a YouTube series called 'Perfect Idol' which aims to find the next breakthrough English language voice talent in America. Eric's enthusiasm for this project, love for wacky RPGs, comedy, Stories with heart and classic animated shows from the 90s and beyond is a welcome addition to the project and is a great match with the creator's enthusiasm for all things action & adventure! We're glad to have him on board!

Say hello to Bessie, Philly's top lady -- and his primary source of transportation. \n  Bessie's base color is a sharp, Fuchsia/Pink tone. But when she enters \"RAGING BULL\" mode, she turns red-hot before changing her appearance to a Minotaur Mech!!!!\n Bessie's Raging Bull mode is a necessary feature since not all roads in Gearbolt are built in straight lines...or are without creatures of all sizes that need to be defended against! She may be an old model, but this old bucket of bolts still got a few new tricks up her sleeve!!!\n REAR - Philly is used to spending his life on the road alone, living inside his old but reliable whip, Bessie.\nBG CONCEPTS\nBALLON TOWN, a remote market city just on the edge of Jester's Belt Desert. Home to all manner of creatures and individuals who don't wish to be found.  \nTHE SEAL CLUB, a haven for bounty hunters looking for a drink between jobs. Not a place for wanted criminals! \nLittle is know about Locke's rise to power, and although magic is still considered superstition, legends tell he is a reincarnation of a wizard hundreds of years ago...\nAeon Flux creator, Peter Chung speaks on the importance of Kickstarter and shows LeSean Thomas & The Cannon Busters project Love!!!\nThanks for the Signal Boost, Pete! :-D\nBACKER REWARDS!!! \nOne of the great things about crowdfunding is being able to reward backers who've donated.

(http://www.bitmapd.com/welcome)\n\n Get yours in the backer rewards list now! :-)\nWhy Use Kickstarter?  \nAs kids growing up, we had a plethora of animated shows on American TV that spanned all genres -- action, adventure, comedy, dark humor; some content with mature themes and some educational... But over the years, the economy has influenced studios to become more risk-averse towards new ideas that don't already have a built-in following (e.g. celebrity talent) or an established franchise. And if so, it catered more towards comedy.\nAs a lover of comedy and big franchises myself (and having worked on dozens in my time), I still secretly yearned for more adventure shows that had plenty of comedy, but also a sprawling drama at its core -- along with kick-butt action and memorable characters! \nEnter crowdfunding, one of the most liberating platforms for the independent creator! After giving it a lot of thought (and much encouragement from my peers), I thought, ''What if I just brought an action-adventure dramedy series to the fans and admirers of this genre, instead of going through a network who would use focus groups to determine if my project was even worth seeing the light of day? Why not go the REAL focus group? The ones who would actually donate to see a project like this come together with some of the most exciting talents--domestic and abroad-- in the industry today?\"\n\nSo here we are. We're trying to make this unique and exciting journey a reality -- and we need YOUR SUPPORT in backing this project! Let's make Cannon Busters happen! \nWhere Your Donation Funds Will Go\nAll donations will go to the production and increased quality of one episode of Cannon Busters! Each donation from you, the backers, will get us closer to delivering something new, exciting, and high quality! In the event that we unfortunately fail to reach at least our passion-project minimum of $120k before the ending campaign date listed above, Amazon will not charge you and we will not achieve our goal. So we really need your support to make this happen!\n8-10 Minute Pilot Minimum Goal Budget of $120k:\nKickstarter's billing is payment by credit card with an http://www.amazon.com account.

I'm a comic artist. I write and draw the \"Sharknife\" series of graphic novels, as well as the advanced kickball comic \"PENG!\", and the space-grape action adventure \"Seedless\". You may have also seen my work in Marvel's \"Nation X\" and \"Strange Tales\" anthologies, as well as the \"Avatar: The Last Airbender, Lost Adventures\" graphic novel. \n**UPDATE! 1/5/13**\n**PLEASE NOTE! ALL backing levels (even the early-bird $12 level) will come with the Stretch Goal Items! (in addition to whatever is included) **\n**END UPDATE!**\nFor the last three years I've self-published a black & white comics anthology series called \"Layered Jacket\" and released them at the Emerald City Comic Con, annually. \n\nThis year I'd like to do something a little next level. \nPresenting \"SUN BAKERY\" my first ever full-color self-published project! \nSun Bakery is a comics anthology / art book / design container. The first volume will feature THREE unique comic stories, all in their own varied styles, sporting a variety of themes. Along with the comics will be an artwork / illustration section, making Sun Bakery a hybrid comic book / art book.  Along with all that, Sun Bakery will have some written columns, microcomics, and most definitely some eye-popping design.\n\nThe following are the contents of Sun Bakery #1!\n-- THE COMICS --\n\"LAZER JACKET\"\nContinuing in the tradition of \"Layered Jacket\" comes the birth of a new Magic Jacket-wielding Persona. Jim Thompson is an above-average scientist with a major personal problem that overflows into his work. When personalities clash, it gives way to a mistaken biproduct: A jacket made of matter undocumented by mankind-- A tool of precision world-building, or utter destruction. Is Jim-- now more than a mere human-- friend or foe? \n\"COCKFIGHT\"\nIt's a blood-sport most don't care to acknowledge. But to a certain sect of individuals, rooster battling is the ultimate past time. However, in this world, it's not just the chickens in danger. Whatever pain is inflicted upon the losing rooster, is also inflicted upon it's master. It's high risk, man meets animal action. Featuring characters from my long-running series of illustrations, the Skeletal Scarf Ninjas.\n\"THE GOOD & THE FOWL\"\nWhen the president's daughter is kidnapped, it's up to LJ and the Unnamed Black Knuckle Swordsman to defeat the Panang Chain Gang and recover her! But what happens when you're too hungry to continue?\nOriginally seen online, this Layered Jacket side-story is finally printed in all it's 3-color glory. BUT ALSO with an extended ending that shifts LJ's world into a realm he never expected!\n-- THE ARTWORK --\nIn addition to the comic sections, Sun Bakery will have an artwork / illustration section. A lot of these are various marker drawings, commissions, fan art from comics, anime & video games, drawings done online, or for fun. \nExample pages from the gallery\nAnd more and more!\n-- THE REWARDS --\nOf course, all backers will receive a copy of SUN BAKERY-- but most of the Reward options come with extra stuff, too! Check it out... \nPINS! Four 1\" full-color buttons to emblazon your favorite garments with!\nSHIRTS! Armor your torso with this daring piece of apparel, featuring Sharknife, Sabreseal and Orcasword, scrawled in hi-graphic intensity. \n** Depending on the amount of backers, these shirts might be extremely limited. So if you want one, now's the time to strike! **\n\n... If you're not sure what \"Sharknife\" is-- It's my graphic novel series!\nPRINTS! Three offset printed, cardstock art prints. Sharknife one is 8.5x11\" Shredder / Spider-man are 5.5x8.5\" and each one also has shiny spot gloss!\nORIGINAL ARTWORK! There's a limited amount of backing levels that will also come with an original marker sketch from me! You can request what you'd like me to draw. It will be drawn on 11x14\" bristol in markers.\nHere's an example of what my marker commissions look like: \n*Many of my previous commissions are featured in Sun Bakery!\n-- STRETCH GOALS!!! --\nSince my goal has been obliterated, I've decided to add some stretch goals. If we get to the following prices, these things will happen:\n$6000 - Each backer of SUN BAKERY will get a die-cut SHARKNIFE sticker! Same design from the t-shirts, featuring Sharknife, Sabreseal and Orcasword! \n$7000 - Each backer of Sun Bakery will receive a WHOLE EXTRA COMIC!!! ! !!! A 12-page Sharknife side-story featuring the Sliding Penguin, RUFYO!!!! \n$8000 - Each backer of Sun Bakery will receive SUN BAKERY 1.2 !!!! A 32-page supplemental black & white Sun Bakery zine! Containing both the Sharknife Rufyo side-story AND the unfinished reyyy horror comic, OCTO POISON (re-drawn, and finally finished in all it's horrific glory!)\n**Note: Unfinished pages. Octo-Poison will be completely remastered / restored for SUN BAKERY 1.2 ! \nThank you all for your support, and let's see if we can meet these goals, get more quality comics in your eyes!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n-- THE GOAL -- \n\nI need $2000 to pay for about 200 books and the shirts, prints and buttons. $2000 is the bare minimum and I think that's even kind of cutting it close.

After the 7th inning stretch, the sun goes down, and the dysfunctional teammates find themselves fighting for their lives against a town of flesh-eating monsters!\nNow, it's up to coach Casey Sullivan to help his team escape from being the next dish in the town's terrifying feeding frenzy!\nEisner & Harvey Award-winning graphic novel author Mark Andrew Smith joins forces with Eisner nominated illustrator James Stokoe for a gripping roller coaster of a graphic novel, packed with shocks, gore, and screamingly outrageous humor, when America's Favorite Past Time becomes one team's ultimate nightmare!\nAbout myself: \nFor the past 9 years I\u2019ve been working as a writer on many Image Comic Book series such as Gladstone's School for World Conquerors, the New Brighton Archeological Society, and the Amazing Joy Buzzards.\nIt\u2019s no secret that I love creating comic books.\nAbout James:\nI was lucky to meet James early in his career and since then James has gone on to become a fan favorite among readers and creators.\nIn my opinion James Stokoe is the Jimmy Hendrix of comics.  His work speaks volumes, already placing him in the pantheon of the Gods of comic book creators.  I cannot speak highly enough about James or stop gushing over his work.\nPlease take a moment to share 'Sullivan's Sluggers' with your friends on Facebook and Twitter by clicking the 'Like' & 'Tweet' buttons above. \nBy sharing 'Sullivan's Sluggers' you're helping our project to round the internet bases and spread the word about 'Sullivan's Sluggers' for more points!!!\nTwitter: @MarkAndrewSmith  Google+ Mark Andrew Smith's Tumblr Blog\nPANELS FROM SULLIVAN'S SLUGGERS\nIn the Town of Malice things aren't what they seem.\nThe two trouble makers of the team, with the rookie Duncan trying to put a  stop their antics.\nThe Malice Gladiators.\nThe Slugger.\nThe Transformation.\nNo one is safe.\nBaseball Players VS.
