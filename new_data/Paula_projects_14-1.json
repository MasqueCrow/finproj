The song stemmed from a discussion regarding his favorite line from a movie in which the antagonist says, \"I didn't graduate third grade for nothing!\"\nMy son asked me to write a song around this idea.  \nThis song, when played live or from a recording, touches people more deeply that I expected.  It is a tale of growing up and facing the obstacles of life and the journey to adulthood... and the perils and joys we find along the way.\nWritten with many personal experiences and memories, \"Third Grade\" is a \"Coming of Age\" story that resonates easily with many.  \nStudio production was just completed for the audio at Audio Refinery in Amarillo, Texas. \nI believe that the cinematography that Kuker Films will provide for Third Grade will make it even more powerful. I want to remind people that the important things in life are the really simple things.  Kindness, being with your loved ones, and the joy of simplicity.  \nALL funds raised will go 100% to the production of this project.

Check the picture below to get an idea and follow the link https://bitly.com/1bUjn7t to see close ups from the possible color combinations!\nStikey is made from polyurethane and has a matte finish similar to that of hard rubber. There is a built in neodymium magnet, that helps Stikey to securely attach on the stainless steel tab on the back of the smartphone or case.\nThe innovative packaging comprises of the magnetic wall mount which acts as its base and the rest is recyclable cardboard. This ensures minimum waste.\nThe metal tab is laser cut with rounded corners and is 0.8mm thick. It is attached with a 0.2mm thin 3M VHB tape that has a very strong bond and is made to be taken off without leaving any residue behind. The tape works on many materials, as long as they are flat, so you can even stick the tab on the case instead of the smartphone.\nMORE CREATIVE USES...\nStikey works with iPad mini and other similar tablets on landscape orientation. Ideal for typing and watching movies!\nThe magnetic mount works in your car as well!\nIDEA & DEVELOPMENT\nWe developed Stikey in order to enhance our smartphone experience and add the element of versatility in the way we use them. Another important aspect of our design approach was portability. We wanted users to have Stikey with them at all times in order for them to benefit from its features whenever needed.\nWe have analysed different user profiles and developed several concept designs.\nFrom the initial concepts we moved on early prototypes which we tested with users for functionality and form.\nFinally we ended end up with the final models.\nIn order to offer a complete product to our backers we decided to design the packaging. We believe that product packaging should not be an afterthought and treated as potential waste, so it was designed with the goal to bring extra functionality to the product and value to the user.\nMANUFACTURING\nThroughout the development we have met and discussed our designs with various manufacturers in Greece and in the UK. After we agreed on the timeframes and related costs, we selected the production plant that the final product will be produced.\nOur decision was based on 3 factors: \nProduction capability for the required volume \nProduction track record and high quality product samples \nClose proximity and easy access location, in order to supervise the process closely and avoid any delays caused by long distance production\nFUNDS BREAKDOWN\nWe strived to absorb as much of the cost for the development and manufacture of Stikey as possible. Therefore, the funds from our backers will go to:\n\u00a35000 for materials and production costs of the first 1000 Stikeys. \n\u00a37000 for the production of the required molds for the injection molding process. \nTHE TEAM\ndcubed is a new product design studio with the aim to transform clever ideas into practical and fun products. The team behind Stikey is Meletis, Ilias and Liban. Combining our different backgrounds in product design, engineering and management we have brought to dcubed the necessary skills in order to meet our passion for developing exciting products.\nThere are a lot of friends that helped us out throughout the process, and we would not have done it without them. \n\nSpecial thanks goes to Leonidas Konstantarakos, Marea Damkalidi and Iason Arvanitakis for the exceptional work they did with our video and photos. \n\nFinally we want to thank spiti bar and taf53 for allowing us to film on their locations and 3D Solidforms for our 3D prints.\n\nMusic: \"Something Elated\" by Broke For Free licensed under CC BY 3.0\na few words on magnetism...\nThe storage technology on smartphones and USB sticks, that you may have on your keys, does not include any moving parts therefore cannot be affected by magnetic force. \nThe only thing which is temporarily affected from our magnet is your smartphones digital compass when Stikey is attached to your smartphone and used as a stand. But using the compass while having your phone on a stand is improbable.\nAs far as navigation is concerned it does not require the compass to work, position and direction is calculated while moving through the signals sent back and forth between the smartphone and a satellite in space.\nCheck out the following links for additional info:\nhttp://www.techhive.com/article/116572/article.html", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe carried out and agreed a detailed production and delivery plan with the selected manufacturing unit.

In that way we tried to ensure that we will be able to stick with our schedule and make our backers happy.\n\nWe are more than confident that the final product will exceed expectation as far as quality and function is concerned. We have carried out a detailed production and delivery plan for Stikey and are committed to stick to it and send out rewards a.s.a.p. But in the development of a new product a minor unpredicted issue might cause delays, we have worked hard to narrow down these possibilities as much as possible. We prefer to ship the best product possible later, than an inferior one sooner.

Only 20-25% of the products that came from the factory were up to the required standards. Most failed the surface finishing check-meaning that they had defects like sink marks and other surface irregularities (check the photos), making them unacceptable from our side. As you understand having 80% of the production in garbage bins is not sustainable and we can't lose any more time with the current manufacturing facility, since the problem lies with their machinery, which while performing in the testing environment, when working in full production cycles failed to create a stable environment for the mold to work properly."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 217, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/17821891/stikey-a-magnetic-portable-stand-and-cable-tidy-on", "project_name": "Stikey - A Magnetic Portable Stand & Cable Tidy on your keys"}}, {"backer": "Paula", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Visit Commeta.ca for the latest news and updates.\n\nThe Problem: Online comments are restricted\nOften the most valuable source of information on a website is in the comments below the actual content.\nWe all use comments to discuss, debate and determine the validity of information, products and services.\nBUT! The vast majority of websites and pages do not allow comments.\nThe Solution: Open, democratized comments\nCommeta is a simple browser extension that will forever change online comments.\nThis easy to use browser add-on lets you read and write comments on any webpage on the internet.\nReally, it is that simple.\nTwo clicks to install and you have the ability, the power and the freedom to speak your mind. Comment anywhere, everywhere.\nExample: Kate & John\nKate and John are both looking at the same property.\nOne of them finds out the property has a serious problem, how can they share that knowledge?\nThey don't have any overlapping social media circles.\nThe property listing doesn't allow comments.\nThere are no online communities discussing this property.\nEven if there are people talking about this specific place, they are not connected to the page listing - the impact and reach is minimal at best.\nCommeta solves this by connecting people who already have a shared interest - listings, apartments, job boards, online classifieds, the possibilities are endless.\nCommeta brings together the power of shared open knowledge without having to leave the page, without having to sign up or register for yet another platform.\nCommeta helps share information, preventing people from becoming the victim of misinformation, prevent scams and potentially harmful situations.\nIf you have ever...\nApplied for a job only to find out it wasn't 'a great opportunity with excellent benefits'.\n(Door to door on commission)\nRented an apartment that wasn't actually in a 'quiet, clean and friendly building'.\n(rats, bugs and 24 hour parties)\nWent to a modelling or acting gig that wasn't 'a fantastic addition to your portfolio'.\n(just a creepy guy with a polaroid)\nPurchased a house only to find out 'structurally sound' isn't.\n(so expensive too)\nMet up with a seller only to find out NIB wasn't actually that new or in a box.\n(missing buttons does not equal 10/10 condition)\nThen Commeta is the solution, revolution and internet evolution you've been waiting for.\n(insert as many exclamation points as you like)\nWhy do a Kickstarter?\nThe demand for an open comment system is huge and a Kickstarter is one of the most effective ways to really get this off the ground. Launching with a massive, passionate group of users helps ensure that no one can block or squash this revolution.\nIs it really a revolution?\nThat word gets used a lot, but think of all of the places online where user comments would be a benefit?\nJob boards - there are so many scams and misleading job postings on boards right around the world that this would be worth doing just to address this one small segment.\nProperty listings, MLS, apartments and rentals - Have you ever viewed a place in person and wished you could tell everyone else looking at that property what you saw?\nOnline classifieds - Craigslist, Kijiji, Ebay, they all could benefit from the ability to have comments available for individual listings, in real-time.\nThere are so many places online where comments would be a benefit. Commeta will let you. That sounds pretty revolutionary.\nWhat about social media? Doesn't it provide a place to comment?\nSort of.\nComments attached directly to the page guarantee that people reading days afterwards are able to read and participate in the conversation. Social media platforms do not provide this sort of long term memory.\nMany of the websites and publishers that have recently blocked comments say that they are moving their discussions to social media, citing 'evidence' that on-page comments are harmful to their message. One publication even went so far as to say that scientific fact should not be debated. They should ask Gauss about that one, 2000 years of Euclidean mathematics didn't stop him from questioning the established consensus and neither should any of us.\nCan websites block Commeta?\nNo they cannot. Commeta is above the webpage - hence the 'meta' in our name.\nWill Commeta work with my browser?\nThe Commeta plugin works with Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer and Safari browsers on Windows, Apple and Linux systems.\nHow will you prevent Spam and Bots?\nWe've blocked the ability to add links and attachments to limit the appeal to spammers and bot systems. We also have several systems in place to ensure that commenters are actually human without using those horrible captcha boxes.\nWhy is Commeta ad-supported?\nIncluding unobtrusive ads to support the ongoing development of the plugin is the best option to provide a free and robust platform. We will only allow non-intrusive ads at the bottom of the comment window. No flashing-musical-popover-animated nonsense.\nThe ads are based on the url being commented on. If you are looking at cars, you might see an ad for a car or oil changes etc. We do not use the comments themselves to target ads - we want ads to be relevant but will not use any creepy, privacy violating methods to do it.\nDo you have an ad-free option?\nYes, you can get an ad-free code through this Kickstarter. Choose one of the reward levels that includes an ad-free code and you simply enter the code and the ads disappear.\nWe chose a code redeem system to prevent user names, emails, and data being linked to your comments.\nYou can use your ad-free code in any browser, reuse it with several different computers, transfer it, re-gift it, anything you like - it is your ad-free code. The only limitation is that any code can only be in use on one pc at any given time.\nWe highly recommend buying a pack of ad-free codes to share with friends and family!\nModeration and take down requests:\nWe wish that all online conversations were pleasant and dignified but that is not always the case. We want to keep this as open as possible but there are some basic rules - No bots, no links, no attachments, spam filters will be in effect.\nThe legal environment has been defined by large social media platforms before us and we will follow those. Anything contrary to the law and we'll have to comply with the authorities - just like Google, facebook, twitter and even Wikipedia. We will not moderate or take down comments for any frivolous reason and won't let anyone pay for comment manipulation. (cough*yelp*cough)\nWhat information do you collect?\nCommeta can see the url and the ip address - that's it - less information than the webpage you are on or even your internet service provider. We will never share your personal information with anyone else.\nThis is actually a very important question - several of the 'established' comment platforms are capturing a lot of data about your surfing habits including time spent on page, name and personal data, even your social media profile information.\nCommeta is actually interested in providing a foundation for online comments rather than callously farming your online activity for profit. (Disqus, Taboola, we're looking at you right now)\nFuture Development: We've got big plans!\nThis kickstarter will also allow us to grow and develop...\nMobile - we want to extend the Commeta platform to mobile.\nUser selectable features - Ability to filter comments for language, hide offensive comments, change plugin style and color schemes.\nSearch - Build a portal on the Commeta.ca website that allows people to search for comments based on keyword / phrase / timeline and url.\nApps / Api - Develop a system that would allow app developers to freely link the Commeta comments into apps. Think of a gps home buying app with a map but also able to display comments for a given property as you walk in.\nOpen research - Anonymized data that would be helpful to university and NGO research. We'd like to be able to share any insight and learning with the world. As mentioned in the introduction, comments are a powerful source of information and sharing is caring.\nThe more support we receive, the faster we can grow and develop.\nYou already have at least one website you'd like to comment on, support Commeta and you will be able to.\nWe truly encourage you to use the $1 pledge. \nThe number of people signed up and passionate about commenting everywhere is far more important than big $$. We'll use every dollar to build and grow Commeta, but really, $1 is awesome and we appreciate every penny.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a working prototype, the plugin is built on existing systems and code that have stood the test of time, security and reliability.

We'll already starting to make our plans to make the game.  \nI wanted to tell you a little more about our first stretch goal Spoonie Island is an idea created by our Village seed backer who wishes to remain anonymous. She suffers from a chronic illness and she wanted to include some kind of awareness for people with disabilities on an island she gets to create with her tier. She gets to design some NPCs and shops.\n\nHowever we want to push is a bit further. If we reach our stretch goal we're going to include a larger quest-line and adventure that revolve around that island that players can play through. I hope in the last 24 hours we can push towards it. Thanks again\n\nThere has been much popular demand to polyamorous relationships. ONLY if we meet the stretch goal will it be implemented. If not it is not planned to be in game. \n\nBETA ACCESS\nDue to poor wording there seems to be some confusion with the open Beta Access tier. Open Beta Access, at $15 and above, includes all the game updates leading up to the gold version of the game. You pay once for the game and that's it. Gold means the game in its completed form as intended. Thank you guys we're really close! Thank you!  \n                                                                             Special thanks to:\nLaura Klotz and Vinny Parisi from Indie Game Mag.\nEliot Lefebvre from Massively\nAdrienne M.

I've been making soap for over 12 years now. Almost 3 years ago I took the leap and quit my day job to pursue my passion for making all-natural soap and skin care. I love Jesus and try to pursue Him with all my heart, I'm married to the most wonderful man who supports me in every way and am a new mommy to the most spunky, beautiful, joyful little girl in the world.\nFUN FACT : I protested the circus when I was 18 and almost got arrested. You could say I'm passionate about ethics.. which is basically why I created Bambu Earth.\nSOMEDAY : I want 8 kids and a farm. I'd love to adopt and teach children how to grow their own food and make things with their hands. I think those are important things that are undervalued in our culture today.\nI started out on a mission to make a \"worry-free\" product line after realizing that commercial (and even many \"handmade\") soap and skin care products contain harmful ingredients. \nBambu Earth products are \"responsible\" in every way: ethical, sustainable, all-natural (really), fair trade, organic, and unrefined. Our products are also eco-friendly, right down to our packaging. We package our soaps in plantable paper... which means you can PLANT the wrapper and wildflowers will grow!!! \nWe are so excited about opening our very first retail store! It has been a dream of ours since the beginning. There's something special about personally engaging with our customers that is unparalleled. When people can touch, smell and see how pure our products are, they become a customer for life. \nWe want to change how people purchase body care products! With your help, we can bring our responsible soap and skin care to the city of Mission Viejo for people to purchase locally. We will also be able to offer workshops to show people how we make soap and educate on the importance of good, all-natural ingredients. \nWe need $10,000 to secure our storefront and get our store ready for business. Here's how we will use the money we raise: \n$500 Signage (branding, menu, pricing, instructions)\n$1500 Shelving (soap and skincare displays)\n$1,500 Furnishings (tables, checkout counter, etc)\n$3,500 Demo Area (customers will be able to watch soap being made!)\n$500 Decor (to make the store look pretty)\n$2,000 Inventory (so we have enough product to sell when we open!)\n$500 Workshop Materials (educational materials, catalogs, tools)\nWE DID IT!! \nWith your help, we've reached our funding goal of $10,000! Thank you! \nOur 1st stretch goal:\nSince we've reached our goal with 5 hours left to go, we're creating a stretch goal! \nIf we reach $10,500 before our campaign ends we'll be able to start scaling and purchase a professional soap cutter which will cut our loaves of soap in one shot. \nIf we reach $11,700, we'll be able to purchase a soap tipping pot which will allow us to make over 140 lbs of soap at one time! More soap for everyone!!!\nOur store will look something like this when it's done:\nStorefront Concept\nWe will be supporting local businesses to help furnish and ready our store. For our furniture and displays we'll be using Maker and Meadow. They are an awesome husband and wife duo who handcrafts furniture located in Aliso Viejo, CA. \nAshley and Tyler Seeger, owners of Maker and Meadow\n We will be positioned in the Union Market in Mission Viejo. They are still constructing, so we've drawn a mini rendering so you can see where the store will go. We'll be the second store on the right after you enter the building and across from Portola Coffee!!\nStore rendering\n ***UPDATE!*** We've actually signed our lease for the store! Check out more in our updates section. We've posted a video! :)\nSigned, Sealed, Delivered!\nLike we mentioned before, most ingredients that beauty products use these days are pretty crappy. They use a couple of great ingredients like \"shea butter\" and \"jojoba oil\", slap it on the front label and add to it the unregulated term \"natural\". What they don't tell you is that the product is loaded with all kinds of other non-natural ingredients (chemicals) that are not only cheap fillers, but actually harmful.\nWe are bent on changing all of this (or at least making a dent!). We've been selling our truly awesome products online since 2009. We think that opening a retail location is the next step for us to increase brand awareness and create a \"community hub\"... a place where people can come to learn about soapmaking, ingredients, and environmental sustainability.\nBecause we think you're awesome and we couldn't reach this milestone without you, we are offering some pretty sweet perks! \nNew reward! \nMini Replica Shelving by Maker and Meadow\nWe know some people just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean they can't help!\nGet the word out and make some noise about our story!

We will need permits for this and we are hoping to be approved to make products onsite for our customers to be able to learn the process.

All other rewards are still made in the USA and still shipping in 2014.\nNew T-Shirts!\nGet an Heirloom T-shirt for $15\n Background\nThe Heirloom is an updated version of the bean bag, a tried and true tool of photographers for as long as there have been cameras. It works very well with smartphones, point & shoots, and DSLRs. I created the Heirloom for people who want the stability of a tripod without having to carry one around everywhere they go. Many times photographers will avoid taking the time to set up their tripod and settle for a handheld shot instead, but as a result their pictures suffer. With the Heirloom, all you do it plop it down and setup is done. You don't miss any opportunities to get a great shot.\nTurn the Heirloom's stem to mount your camera\nThe Heirloom is made of only two parts - \nStem: The stem uses a standard 1/4 inch bolt to mount securely to any camera. You can mount phones to the Heirloom using an smartphone adapter such as the Glif. But you only see half of the stem in the video. The other half lives inside the bag and grips onto the beans to provide the bulk of the stability. No other product on the market does this! This is the magic that keeps your camera still. It works so well that you can tilt most cameras more than 45 degrees and the Heirloom will keep it still.\nBody: The body is made out of a single piece of Cordura (similar to what backpacks are made of). I did this in order to use minimal fabric and to create as little friction as possible while turning the stem. The turning action is very smooth.\nThe Heirloom body is made out of a single piece of Cordura using a unique flower petal pattern. This makes it possible to turn the stem without any friction or sticking caused by unnecessary seams. Shown here is an actual sample that I took apart.\nThe Heirloom travels well. If you need the extra space in your suitcase, the zipper opens so you can empty the bag before you leave on a trip and fill it up again when you get to where you're going. Or you can simply leave it filled, and it only weighs about a pound. It doesn't take up much room in a backpack. You can fill it with whatever you want. I prefer small-ish beans (currently using navy beans).\nI use it often to film myself playing guitar. It's really helpful to have a clear, steady video so I can review my technique. How will you use it? I'm excited to find out!\nRewards\nThe Heirloom you will receive. This one is a prototype. Yours will be cleaner and more polished overall.\nGlif: Tripod Mount & Stand for Smartphones (courtesy of Studio Neat)\n                                                                The color of the limited edition yellow Heirloom\nDesign Process\nI have been working on the Heirloom for about 2 years, experimenting with different sizes, shapes, and materials. I've hit the sweet spot with size, durability, and weight so that it will support any camera size up to and including DSLR. The bag is made out of a single piece of durable, water resistant 1000 denier Cordura.\nJust a few of the early shapes, sizes, and materials for the Heirloom\nI started prototyping ideas for camera mounts in Sketchup and getting bags made in NYC's Garment District. The initially small camera mounts were cumbersome to turn and not very stable, so after I began increasing the size of the mounts and experimenting with various shapes, the whole thing started to resemble a piece of fruit. The Heirloom was starting to sprout!\nWith the help of multi-talented product designer Mike Knuepfel at Brooklyn Research, we refined the design into its current form. He was able to bring to life to what I could only see in my mind, help give the Heirloom its charming character, and make it ready for production. I couldn't have done this without him.\n$43,000\nOur funding goal is a break-even number that includes the cost of the plastic molds, plastic parts, bags, packaging, and shipping of 1000 pieces. This is a small run made entirely in the USA.\nProduction Plan\nDomestic manufacturers (and backup manufacturers) are already in place. At the end of the campaign, I essentially flip on the switch; molds start to get made, then the plastic stems, and red Heirloom bodies will be manufactured as quickly as they can be made. Then the Heirlooms are assembled, packaged and shipped to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have made every effort to mitigate risk through diligent planning.

( we tried, but we are artists and don't have the camera, computer or know-how to make one, hahaha so enjoy! :)\nThe League of Monster deck of cards project! This is the first completely hand-painted on canvas card project we are aware of! My wife and I have spent the better part of three months sketching, drawing, erasing, re-drawing, designing, and painting this deck of cards. Each card was carefully designed, hand-drawn and hand-painted onto 24x36\" stretched canvases. One of our favorite elements is the hidden words on the Ace cards. (See if you can find them!) Our dream was to be able to hold this entire collection of paintings in our hands as a deck of playing cards. This has been the greatest challenge and we need your help to see our dream come true.\nEach and every card is a unique work of art! We wanted to stay true to the original style of playing cards you grew up with and are accustomed to, at the same time incorporating the look of the old-school monsters, creating the league of monsters deck!

Geek themed quirky shirts!  You will put a smile on everyone you meet with these cute unique and \"off the beaten path\" shirts.  Our family loves to laugh and we have a strange since of humor which really helped in the creation of these shirts!\nWe spent a lot of sweat and laughing tears coming up with these designs. We are new empty nesters, and not that old either ..lol!  Since our daughter went off to college we need something to sink our teeth into.   I guess it is nurture vs nature.  I have raised my daughter since she was 4 months old and around the age of 4 she joined us in the witty mockery of what is our family.  She is so funny and smart as a whip too!  I'm so proud to call her my daughter.\nI\"m a veteran of Operation Desert Storm. I found out fairly early that you can't take life to seriously and need to have a sense of humor.\n---------------------About the Shirts ------------------\nShirts will be printed on a so soft comfy lightweight cotton t-shirt! * Heather color shirts will have a mix of 10/90 Polyester/Cotton\nThe design will be screen-printed with good-quality ink. It will not crack, peel or flake off. We will be offering a wide range of sizes.\n6 Funny Designs in 6 Sizes\nS, M, LG, XL, 2XL, 3XL\nPLEASE NOTE: Apparel images here are only mockups.

Then some will go into marketing.  I need some professional website help! Any left over from those we will use for trade show travels. We hope this launch will help us start a great business so we can visit our daughter at college more and bring her some good home cooked meals!\nWith your help if we exceed our goal by 10% we will be using $150 in supporting \"pay it forward Kickstarter\" to other great projects!\n ____________  Onward to the shirts! ___________________\nI AM GEEK will be an orange heather color shirt.\n__________________________________________________________\nMad Chatter will be a Caribbean Blue color shirt.\n__________________________________________________________\nWho doesn't like Pi ? shirt will be navy in color\n__________________________________________________________\nOur twist on Twearking!
