All beverages and food will be completely free from Gluten, and Organic consciously prepared. Organic meat and dairy will be at the heart of our cuisine as well as made from scratch non-Gluten baked goods and Organic non-GMO produce to prepare and serve high quality delicious eats that are easier for the human body to break down and enjoy, including those with Celiac Disease or a sensitivity to Gluten and other sensitivities.  \nOrganic, Non-GMO, Gluten Free Fried Chicken skillet fried with virgin, unrefined, organic olive and coconut oil.\nWHY NON-GLUTEN?\nIt\u2019s a choice but we\u2019re not really against anything. We find that eating organic gluten-free food can be a very flavorful and healthy way to wellness. It is noteworthy that people with Celiac disease are highly sensitive to foods containing gluten. The symptoms may be apparent but it is also possible to have celiac disease without any symptoms whatsoever. A few of the conditions associated with this disorder are: depression, diabetes, arthritis, increased risk of infections and autoimmune disease, as well some of the more controversial disorders like peripheral neuropathy, schizophrenia and autism. These conditions may improve by removing gluten from the diet. And now with our cooking, you don't have to sacrifice yourself anymore :-)\nBaked doughnuts in cinnamon-sugar, double chocolate, glazed, & coconut delight\nSO, WHY ORGANIC CONSCIOUS & NON-GMO? \nOrganic food production is a heavily regulated industry where synthetic pesticides and chemical fertilizers are not allowed. We will use organic meats, dairies and produce because it is necessary in our experience to produce high quality edibles. Even so, it is in our best interest to mention that Non-Organic foods are vastly grown with unregulated practices like Nanotechnology and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO\u2019s). As of now there are no restrictions, nor official reports, noting the effects of human consumption using these unregulated practices on our food. In 2014, studies found fewer pesticides and higher levels of antioxidants in organically grown food. Organic practices also foster the cycling resources for maintaining an ecologic-environmental balance which also conserves biodiversity. It is at its core the most intelligent-natural-life-conscious-humane source of food and with a little help from technology, one day, soon, we foresee all food will be grown organically without genetically modified organisms. \nHoney-Chipotle & Savory Meat Pizza\nWHAT EXACTLY IS THE MONEY RAISED, GOING TO BE USED FOR? \nThe $250,000.00 raised from Kickstarter will be used for acquiring the westside BJ\u2019s Food-Truck along with all the specific tools and appliances needed. The money raised would also ensure licensing, permit fees, insurance, registration, maintenance, fuel, labor, ingredients, as well as maintenance of inventory, non-toxic biodegradable to-go packaging and utensils, non-toxic biodegradable cleaning supplies, accounting and payroll basics for 1 full year of operation. Our combined 20 + years of experience in the food and beverage biz. has led us to acknowledge the fact that most businesses close down within their first year, due to a lack of capital. This capital we would acquire will also help establish westside BJ\u2019s in generating revenue to continue running in the years to follow. \nPastel Mocha, our insanely moist chocolate gluten-free cake with a cocoa cream topping & white chocolate espresso ganache filling.\nWHAT IS THE ULTIMATE VISION OF WESTSIDE BJ\u2019s WORLD FUSION ALIMENTOS?\nJust to clarify, BJ\u2019s stands for \u201cBrigit Juan\u2019s\u201d (What else could BJ's stand for?) but the ultimate vision for westside BJ\u2019s world fusion alimentos, is to create quality, delicious, gluten-free, organic, non-gmo edibles. At the same time, westside BJ\u2019s would be creating a business structure grounded on dynamic intelligence and universal principles that would allow the individuals working with us to think and work freely, and to be interdependently responsible while delivering quality food and service as part of the team. Through the many years experience that Juan and Brigit have in the food and beverage industry, they have attained insights and wisdom of hard earned knowledge that has inspired them to work for the joy of work and well being, and not just the pursuit of Pure Profit. Westside BJ\u2019s would also emphasize using (whenever possible) the progressive ingenuity of green technologies such as electric motors, solar and wind energy technology, to name a few, that are at the forefront for our self-sustaining advancement in our globally aware society.

In the process we created a device that makes people happier and more open to each other. We found out from the beginning that, when we took the sign to the people on the street, they were hungering for a way to feel more positive about their current situation. The signs had an instant effect, taking them to a place where they could remember something good in life. It was as if they were transported to a better place by the power of their own minds. \nSigns that can inspire people to recreate their perspective and refocus on what's good about life by using a little humor and wit! Wow! \nIts objectivity has allowed it to become many things to many people.

We are very proud to be a part of something that inspires people to think more positively and feel less fearful of our current situation. \nBy disarming the viewer with positive humor and engaging them with curiosity, we hope to help reconnect the world one Good Sign at a time. \nOur mission is to make positivity contagious and spread this message of well-being all over the world. \nOur intention is to cast a spotlight on positive people, artists and organizations.

We funded our goal of $100K!  We now have enough pledges and seed money to start the filming!! Wooohooo!\nPlease keep sharing the project. We will continue accepting pledges here until the kickstarter campaign ends 8:33am on Monday morning. Thank you for building this forgiveness community. We couldn't have done it without you. We love you! Shawne, Teresa & The entire Project: Forgive Team\nATTN MEDIA: Thank you for your story requests. Please head here for immediate support in writing a story: www.shawnetv.com/media\nLife happens.\nWe lose our jobs, we face bankruptcy and foreclosure. Some of us are dealing with a divorce, others of us are facing life threatening illnesses such as cancer. Culturally, we see deep political fighting, immigration issues, war, despair and violence. In the face of all this, how can we find the courage to forgive and cause a new realm of possibility, a new conversation?\nWe want to find out, so we're making a documentary that will dive into a simple, yet complicated inquiry. The film will include exquisite stories of courageous forgiveness from celebrities, thought leaders, and people whose stories have yet to be told. Just like the one that inspired us to create the film.\nThe Inspiration\nA few years ago, a man named Gary received news that his wife Judy and their children, twelve-year-old Alex and nine-year-old Sam were hit by a drunk driver and did not survive. Project: Forgive Producer Shawne Duperon, is a friend of Gary's. What's more, the driver turned out to be yet another of Shawne's family friends, Tom Wellinger.\nHow do you make sense of this type of tragedy? When looking at Tom from Shawne's perspective, a conflict appears. On one hand, Tom is a drunk driver who took a family. On the other, Tom is a loving and kind man who made a horrific mistake.\nA dilemma and a movie were created in that moment.\nThe ability to hold two very different perceptions at the same moment is where the breakthroughs lie.\nGary's ability to forgive Tom, inspired us to examine what we describe as an internal emotional maturity that our planet hasn't yet experienced. Project: Forgive explores how to hold conflicting thoughts and emotions at the same moment, allowing for miraculous breakthroughs regardless of any circumstance. \nWhen Marianne Williamson (www.mariannewilliamson.com) saw the video, her only word was \"Wow.\"\nSonia Choquette (www.soniachoquette.com) and Master Charles Cannon (www.mastercharlescannon.com) pledged support for the project as well. The national media coverage is starting to come in. The world is ready.\nThe film is a deep inquiry through stories of forgiveness from the forgiver and from the forgiven, stories of success, and stories still in progress. Each of these stories will unveil the power of true forgiveness.\nYou, too, can play a critical role in the creation of this documentary with your Kickstarter pledge and story of forgiveness.\nWe Want Your Story\nIf we asked you to describe your greatest moment of courageous forgiveness, what would it be?\nMaybe it was the courage to forgive yourself after losing a job or a failed business. It could have been the strength to leave a relationship and face the uncertainty of being alone. Maybe the security of the financial future you spent decades building was torn from you in the recession or by an unscrupulous fund manager.\nOf course these pale in comparison if you've faced a life-threatening illness, witnessed your own child suffer or if you yourself were a child who saw death too soon or faced the indignities of abuse. Yet it's from events like these that emerges the greatest stories of hope, strength, courage - and the most amazing qualities of humankind.\nAnd we want YOUR story. We will use every story we receive. No story is too big or too small. If inspired to share, your story will be added to the voices of others of remarkable grace who've found the other side. If your story doesn't appear in the film itself, it will be used for the book and DVD series we're also creating. This conversation is that important.\nWhen you pledge any dollar amount, you'll automatically receive an email to send us your story, if that's something you're called to do\nThe Funding\nDocumentaries that include a theatrical release, celebrities and high-end production cost big money. We can start filming right away with $100,000. The money will go toward production, editing, and appeals for the additional funds to complete the project.\nAny amount raised over the target will go toward making Project: Forgive even better. More money means more production value, more interviews, and an increased ability to spread the conversation of forgiveness.\nAs a backer, you'll take a front-row seat to the documentary's progress.\nAs a story contributor, you'll be forwarding the mission of laying down the swords for a new realm of possibility WITHIN the conversation of forgiveness.\nWhy Kickstarter\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent documentary film community.  They democratize the process by allowing you, the consumer,  to support movies you want to see developed, while giving us, the production team,  the freedom to experiment, take risks and share deeply moving material without anyone else compromising our vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established film studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\nEvery month tens of thousands of amazing people pledge to projects from the worlds of music, art, film and technology and other creative fields. Every Kickstarter project must be fully funded before it's time expires.\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, our team will develop the film Project: Forgive.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for you,  the backers, to see.\nWe will document the creative process and release monthly video updates exclusively to Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make you as much a part of the film process as possible by showing the film creation from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  We're committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of film making ever conceived.\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with us and submit your thoughts and feelings about the film's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the production team can't decide.  We'll also be choosing stories from you to highlight in the film, along with the eventual DVD's and books. Once the film is finished, backers will receive the completed version for download.\nFor fans of documentaries that promote global conversations, this is your chance to prove there is still a large demand out there for a unique film experience that inspires forgiveness and love, something the world is craving.\nToday Gary, who lost his family, says...\n\"I have never felt so loved. I feel more blessed\nthan any person should be.\"\n-- Gary Weinstein\nWe are blessed by you allowing us to share our vision. Thank you for contributing your stories to the film.
