These include Apple (iPhone), Samsung, Huawei, OPPO and many other cell phone manufacturers.\nRISC OS is an alternative to operating systems such as MS Windows, Linux or macOS. RISC OS provides a faster user experience, a flexible development environment, and energy-saving processor technology.\nWe\u2019ve designed a fully integrated system that runs RISC OS on a powerful hardware device that we call Cloverleaf. \nRISC OS is the first and original OS that ran on ARM RISC CPUs. It is a 32-bit OS with cooperative multitasking. It was designed with a graphical user interface with many outstanding features like contextual menus and a three-button mouse.\nFrom the beginning, it has included a vector-graphics program. One key feature is its modular design which offer programmers easy access to all areas of the OS. RISC OS also includes BBC BASIC as its main programming language.\nWe\u2019re building the Cloverleaf RISC OS for you. With the user in mind, RISC OS is an OS for users who want a more efficient and robust OS. Cloverleaf RISC OS comes with a large list of free programs that cover most areas (see under section \"Free Software\" below for detailed information). \nRISC OS is the right OS for explorers and tinkerers as it doesn't restrict your access to the hardware and you can create any software you like. You can control external hardware using the 40-pin GPIO connector \u2014 the same as used in the Raspberry Pi\u2122 and Arduino\u2122. For programming beginners there is the built-in BBC BASIC which is the perfect tool to learn programming. BBC BASIC also opens up the doors directly to the heart of the hardware, the widely-used ARM CPU, as one awesome feature of BBC BASIC is the possibility to include ARM assembler code directly in your BASIC programs.\nCloverleaf RISC OS is your choice to reduce your carbon footprint. At Cloverleaf, we are firm believers that we must find sustainable solutions to power our computers to fight global warming.\nThanks to RISC OS and ARM CPUs, Cloverleaf is making it possible to build low-power systems available for everyone. We have the technology to deliver systems that run on 5 - 15 W of power rather than 80 - 300 W on your current desktop computer. At this low-power consumption a RISC OS computer can be easily powered by a small solar panel.\nRISC OS provides a feature that every computer user needs: speed. \nRISC OS was originally written for ARM chips with a clock rate of only 8 MHz! The RockChip RK3399 SoC used for our Cloverleaf hardware runs now at 1.8 GHz. That is 225 times faster than the original CPU. The handling speed of RISC OS has improved nearly 100 times in the last 30 years. \nAnother factor of the fast and responsive user experience is the cooperative multitasking of RISC OS. This ensures that the application you are currently using at any moment gets the processing time it needs to finish its current task. Only then does the CPU move on to the next task.\nRISC OS programs use minimum space in your computer\u2019s memory because the original OS was designed for a computer with half a megabyte of RAM rather than several gigabytes like most of the operating systems on the market today. RISC OS can run happily in 256 MB and still have 200 MB free for applications. Our current Cloverleaf hardware offers 4GB of RAM so there is plenty of free space for data and programs.\nWith no need for virtual memory, RISC OS runs your programs faster than on other operating systems, especially when overloaded.\nMany computer users may find themselves frustrated with operating systems such as MS Windows and macOS and with good reason. Forced computer upgrades or OS upgrades usually occur every three to five years.\nEach time a user installs new hardware in their computer, these monopolist companies make gargantuan profits by taking advantage of the \u2018need\u2019 to upgrade.\nHow often have you had to buy new hardware such as printers, scanners, graphics cards, and sound cards because new versions of the OS do not have drivers? How much has your company had to pay for upgrading third-party software because of incompatibilities with new operating systems?\nWe don\u2019t believe that this is right. That\u2019s why Cloverleaf will build a smart, user-friendly OS that doesn\u2019t force you to upgrade your computer hardware every four years or upgrade your software to newer versions.\nBecause this technology was built right in the first place, you can be confident that RISC OS will perform as powerfully ten years from now as the day you take it out of the box.\nPLAY\n\nThe RISC OS operating system is right choice for retro gaming lovers and computer hobbyists. RISC OS offers a number of emulators for well known retro computers as the Commodore C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Micro and the Acorn Archimedes. In addition to games in these emulators, a plethora of games have been ported to RISC OS from Linux and other platforms, including commercial titles like Elite, Duke Nukem, Lemmings,  and Heroes of Might and Magic 2. RISC OS also develops and releases new games frequently.\nAlso available on RISC OS is the well-known ScummVM, which allows you to perform numerous adventures and RPGs. ScummVM supports an extensive library of over 250 adventure games - including many classics from legendary studios such as LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, and Revolution Software. ResidualVM is also available to play 3D adventure games on RISC OS, including Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island, and Myst III: Exile.\nBecause RISC OS is such a compact and resource-efficient OS, it will happily run in a few megabytes of RAM rather than gigabytes\u2014making it the perfect tool for any computer hobbyist. RISC OS, unlike most operating systems, is barebones out of the box. RISC OS is great for 2D vector graphics, DTP, and programming whatever you have in mind in BBC BASIC/ARM assembler, C/C++, Python, RiscLua and others.\nPLAY\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is an affordable single-board computer that is very versatile. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including electronic projects, games, media servers, secure Internet proxy servers, robotics, spreadsheets, word-processing, and more. But Linux pushes this lightweight hardware to its limits.\nIn contrast, RISC OS was designed for much less powerful ARM CPUs and\n    smaller memory sizes, and is therefore a perfect match for any\n    Raspberry Pi.\nBecause the lightweight RISC OS was designed to run on ARM processors and doesn\u2019t need gigabytes of memory to perform, Cloverleaf\u2019s RISC OS distribution is perfect for your Raspberry Pi Zero, 2, 3, and 4.\nRISC OS is for explorers who want to have new experiences and seek exciting computer solutions. Those who want to do more with their OS at faster speeds will love RISC OS\u2019s intuitive straight-forward technology.\nPlain and simple, many computer users are fed up with monopolists, and are looking for alternative solutions that better meet their needs. Instead of dealing with constant, expensive updates and constricting hardware and software, RISC OS explorers can experience a completely new OS world while being environmentally conscious.\nCloverleaf\u2019s system is the ultimate tool for tinkerers, makers, and programming ninjas as well as for computer beginners.\nRISC OS was introduced by Acorn Computers in 1987, and was bundled with every ARM-based computer manufactured by the company. Acorn Computers created the fast, ultra-efficient ARM CPU. For this revolutionary RISC CPU, the operating system RISC OS was created. It was popularized by Acorn's Archimedes computer; Acorn machines were used in almost all UK schools and universities during the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe OS has undergone several updates since its inception, with the latest version being RISC OS 5.28. As of October 2018, RISC OS was made fully open source, and it is now licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\nSome of the greatest features of Cloverleaf\u2019s OS are the included software and programming tools that are available for free.\nIn the box with every Cloverleaf computer, users can expect the revolutionary ARM technology, teamed with its original, radical OS, RISC OS. \nIn our Cloverleaf RISC OS distribution, we include a collection of the best free programs and tools available, so that you have a wide range of choices for your daily tasks.\nSome of the available programs include:\n    A powerful Word Processing & DTP System (Impression Style)\n    Pipedream as spreadsheet, database, and word processor\n    Fireworkz (spreadsheet and word processor)\n    ChatCube (Instant messenger with integrated client for Telegram)\n    GCC as a GNU Compiler Collection for C++\n    BBC BASIC which allows users to easily write directly in ARM assembler without needing a compiler \n    Python 2 & 3, the most popular language for machine learning and artificial intelligence\n    RiscLua, a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language\n    Games collection (RISC OS games, Acorn Archimedes, ZX Spectrum, Acorn BBC Micro, Commodore C64, & ScummVM)\n    MessergerPro (Email & News client)\n    OpenVector (Vector graphics program)\n    Merlin (3D editor and raytracing)\n\nWe are building RISC OS for ultimate convenience. Now, it will be easier than ever to access our outstanding collection of games and emulators for:\nSinclair ZX Spectrum\nAcorn BBC Micro\nAcorn Archimedes\nMSDOS\nComodore C64\n  You\u2019ll have access to a wide range of retro games on these platforms, as they will be included in our collections. Not to mention that you can access even more games and programs through PlingStore and PackMan. \nRISC OS Cloverleaf is a crowdfunding campaign to upgrade and revive the unique  computer operating system RISC OS. With Cloverleaf, we\u2019re aiming to build a new brand for the RISC OS operating system that gives users an exciting and user-friendly alternative to monopolists like Microsoft, Apple, and Google.\nWe believe that users need more choices for computer operating systems. The current market for powering our computers is currently insufficient; we must give consumers the option to no longer be dependent on only three companies.\nThis project is about developing RISC OS. When you receive your first version of RISC OS, it won\u2019t be at its final development stage. Improvements will come out on a monthly basis, with new programs and upgrades available over time.\nCloverleaf aims to build community. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll always be available and happy to receive your feedback, so we can ensure that your experience and desires using RISC OS will be met!\nOur project targets include adding support for WIFI, USB 3, Bluetooth, NMVe, multi-threading, GPU and multi-language support for all major languages.\n Cloverleaf has a wide variety of Funding Offers which gives users simple pricing on great products. With any purchase, 100\u20ac will be put towards the development of RISC OS as the best alternative computer OS.

This offer includes also a wireless keyboard and mouse.\nYou are a wealthy individual or are a company or an organization that wants to see RISC OS grow as fast as possible. Then you can opt for our supreme supporter offer. You can choose which open source project you like us to port to RISC OS. This will enable us to work for 4 month on each software package. The port might not be fully completed during that time but should have major features.\nSome of the software packages might need at least two or three fundings (2/3) to be fully ported. The porting will also depend on the current technical limitations of RISC OS. For example RISC OS currently has no access to the ARM Mali GPU. So OpenGL can currently only be implemented with software rendering. \nHere a list of possible open source software that can be ported to RISC OS:\nfreepascal.org\nlazarus-ide.org (former Borland Delphi IDE)(2) This includes the freepascal.org.\nkicad-pcb.org (2) (PCB layout)\nlmms.io (digital audio worksation)\naudacityteam.org (digital audio worksation)\nOpenGL (3D library) (2)\ngodotengine.org (2D/3D Games engine) (3)\nlibreoffice.org (Office package)(3)\nopenoffice.org  (Office package)(3)\nrust-lang.org (programming language)(2)\ngnumeric.org (spreadsheet)(1)\nThe main figures behind this project are Stefan Fr\u00f6hling (former Evolution Computer GmbH, Germany) and Andrew Rawnsley (R-Comp Interactive, United Kingdom). Both have a long history related to RISC OS. Stefan was active in RISC OS products 20 to 25 years ago and came back to RISC OS two years ago and is the initiator of the Cloverleaf RISC OS project. \nStefan found a competent partner in Andrew who was active in RISC OS business during the last 25 Years, and has many years of experience delivering five generations of RISC OS computer systems.  Andrew is also co-owner of the RISC OS intellectual property (IP) and is actively involved in all areas of its development and deployment.\nThere are many helpers behind the scenes that want to support RISC OS for various reasons. Most help us with advice or work in their free time to support the development of RISC OS. Some released their RISC OS software for free to the RISC OS community. Some of them we want to mention here: Raik Fischer, Jeffrey Lee, Jason Tribbeck, Andy Marks, Micheal Grundlitz, David Higton, Tom Williamson, Andrew Conroy, Gavin Smith, David Feugey, Paolo Fabio Zaino, Peter Howkins, Nemo, Richard Hallas and many more. (Sorry if we forgot someone in the list)\n  RISC OS ist ein Open-Source-Computer-Betriebssystem mit einer grafischen Benutzerinferenz (GUI), das erstmals 1989 von Acorn Computers ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, um auf ARM RISC-Prozessoren ausgef\u00fchrt zu werden.\nARM-Prozessoren zeichnen sich durch eine herausragende Energieeffizienz aus, weshalb sie derzeit in \u00fcber 90% aller Mobiltelefone der Welt zu finden sind. Dazu geh\u00f6ren Apple (iPhone), Samsung, Huawei, OPPO und viele andere Handyhersteller.\nRISC OS ist eine Alternative zu Betriebssystemen wie MS Windows und MacOS, die eine schnellere Benutzererfahrung, eine flexible Entwicklungsumgebung und energiesparende Prozessortechnologie bietet.\nWir haben ein vollst\u00e4ndig integriertes System entwickelt, auf dem RISC OS auf einem leistungsstarken Hardwareger\u00e4t ausgef\u00fchrt wird, das wir Cloverleaf nennen.\nRISC OS ist das erste und urspr\u00fcngliche Betriebssystem, das auf ARM RISC-CPUs ausgef\u00fchrt wurde. RISC bedeuted nicht Risiko, sondern Reduzierter-Befehlssatz-Chip. RISC OS ist ein kooperatives Multitasking-32-Bit-Betriebssystem. Es wurde mit einer grafischen Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che mit vielen herausragenden Funktionen wie Kontextmen\u00fcs und einer Maus mit drei Tasten entworfen. Es enthielt von Anfang an ein Vektorgrafikprogramm. Ein wesentliches Merkmal ist der modulare Aufbau, der Programmierern einen einfachen Zugriff auf alle Bereiche des Betriebssystems bietet. RISC OS enth\u00e4lt auch BBC BASIC als Hauptprogrammiersprache.\nOS ist ein Betriebssystem f\u00fcr Anwender, die ein effizienteres und robusteres Betriebssystem w\u00fcnschen. Das Cloverleaf RISC OS kommt mit einer gro\u00dfen Liste kostenloser Programme, die die meisten Anwendungen abdecken (Detailierte Information finden sie weiter unten bei \"Gratis-Software\"). RISC OS ist das richtige Betriebssystem f\u00fcr Entdecker und Bastler, da es Ihren Zugriff auf die Hardware nicht einschr\u00e4nkt und Sie jede gew\u00fcnschte Software erstellen k\u00f6nnen. Sie k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber das 40-PIN-GPIO wie Raspberry oder Arduino auf externe Ger\u00e4te zugreifen. F\u00fcr Programmieranf\u00e4nger gibt es das eingebaute BBC BASIC, das das perfekte Werkzeug zum Erlernen des Programmierens ist. Dies macht es perfekt f\u00fcr Kinder, ihre ersten Schritte in die Computerwelt zu machen. BBC BASIC \u00f6ffnet aber auch die T\u00fcren direkt zum Herzen der Hardware. Die weit verbreitete ARM-CPU als eine gro\u00dfartige Funktion von BBC BASIC bietet die M\u00f6glichkeit, ARM-Assembler-Code direkt in Ihre BASIC-Programme aufzunehmen. Mit Cloverleaf RISC OS sind die M\u00f6glichkeiten endlos. Benutzer haben die M\u00f6glichkeit, das Betriebssystem selbst zu \u00e4ndern, da es Open Source ist und f\u00fcr jede Aufgabe \u00fcbernommen werden kann.\nCloverleaf RISC OS ist Ihre erste Wahl, um Ihren CO2-Fu\u00dfabdruck zu reduzieren. Wir bei Cloverleaf sind fest davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass wir nachhaltige L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Stromversorgung unserer Computer finden m\u00fcssen, um der globalen Erderw\u00e4rmung entgegenzuwirken. Dank RISC OS- und ARM-CPUs erm\u00f6glicht Cloverleaf den Aufbau von Systemen mit sehr geringerem Stromverbrauch, die f\u00fcr alle verf\u00fcgbar sind. Wir verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber die Technologie, um Systeme mit einer Verbrauch von 5 W bis 15 W, gegen\u00fcber 80 W bis 300 W auf Ihrem aktuellen Desktop-Computer, bereitzustellen. Bei diesem geringen Stromverbrauch kann ein RISC OS-Computer problemlos mit einem kleinen Solarpanel betrieben werden.\nRISC OS bietet eine Funktion, die jeder Computerbenutzer ben\u00f6tigt: Geschwindigkeit. RISC OS wurde urspr\u00fcnglich f\u00fcr RISC-CPUs mit nur 8 MHz (!) Taktrate geschrieben. Der aktuelle RockChip RK3399 SoC, der f\u00fcr unsere Cloverleaf-Hardware verwendet wird, l\u00e4uft jetzt mit 1,8 GHz. Das ist 225-mal schneller als die urspr\u00fcnglichen CPUs. Da die GUI bei der Erstellung von RISC OS bereits sehr weit fortgeschritten war, hat sich bis jetzt nicht viel ge\u00e4ndert und es wird auch nicht viel mehr Rechenleistung ben\u00f6tigt. Daher hat sich die Handhabungsgeschwindigkeit von RISC OS in den letzten 30 Jahren fast 100-mal beschleunigt. Ein weiterer Faktor f\u00fcr die schnelle Benutzererfahrung ist das kooperative Multitasking von RISC OS. Dadurch wird sichergestellt, dass die aktuelle Anwendung, die Sie derzeit verwenden, die Verarbeitungszeit erh\u00e4lt, die zum Beenden der aktuellen Aufgabe erforderlich ist. Erst dann \u00fcbergibt es die CPU f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Aufgabe. RISC-Betriebssystemprogramme belegen einen minimalen Speicherplatz im Arbeitsspeicher Ihres Computers, da der Ursprung des Betriebssystems auf 1 MB (!) RAM und nicht auf mehreren GByte beruhte, wie bei den meisten derzeit auf dem Markt befindlichen Betriebssystemen. RISC OS kann problemlos mit 256 MB RAM ausgef\u00fchrt werden und verf\u00fcgt immer noch \u00fcber 200 MB freien Speicher f\u00fcr Anwendungen. Unsere aktuelle Cloverleaf-Hardware bietet 4 GB RAM, sodass gen\u00fcgend freier Speicherplatz f\u00fcr Daten und Programme vorhanden ist. Da kein virtueller Speicher verwendet wird, f\u00fchrt RISC OS Ihre Programme schneller aus als auf anderen \u00fcberlasteten Betriebssystemen.\nViele Computerbenutzer sind m\u00f6glicherweise aus gutem Grund mit Betriebssystemen, wie MS Windows und MacOS frustriert. Erzwungene Computer- oder Betriebssystem-Upgrades werden normalerweise alle drei bis f\u00fcnf Jahre durchgef\u00fchrt. Jedes Mal, wenn ein Benutzer neue Hardware auf seinem Computer installiert, erzielen diese monopolistischen Unternehmen enorme Gewinne, indem sie die Notwendigkeit eines Upgrades nutzen. Wie oft mussten Sie neue Hardware wie Drucker, Scanner, Grafikkarten und Soundkarten kaufen, da es f\u00fcr die neue Version des Betriebssystems keinen Treiber f\u00fcr Ihre alte Hardware gibt? Wie viel Servicekosten musste Ihr Unternehmen f\u00fcr das Upgrade von Software von Drittanbietern aufgrund von Inkompatibilit\u00e4ten mit dem neuen Betriebssystem bezahlen? Wir glauben nicht, dass dies richtig ist. Aus diesem Grund wird Cloverleaf ein intelligentes, benutzerfreundliches Computer-Betriebssystem erstellen, das Sie nicht zwingt, Ihre Computerhardware alle vier Jahre zu aktualisieren oder Ihre Software auf neuere Versionen zu aktualisieren. Da diese Technologie von Anfang an entwickelt wurde, k\u00f6nnen Sie sicher sein, dass RISC OS in zehn Jahren genauso leistungsf\u00e4hig sein wird wie an dem Tag, an dem Sie es aus der Verpackung nehmen.\nDas Betriebssystem RISC OS ist auch die richtige Wahl f\u00fcr Retro-Gaming-Liebhaber und Computer-Hobbyisten. RISC OS bietet eine Reihe von Emulatoren f\u00fcr bekannte Retro-Computer, wie Commodore C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Acorn Micro und Acorn Archimedes. Neben original Retro-Titeln wurde eine Vielzahl von Spielen von Linux und anderen Plattformen auf RISC OS portiert, darunter kommerzielle Titel, wie \"Elite\", \"Duke Nukem\", \"Lemmings\", \"Heroes of Might\" und \"Magic 2\". RISC OS Benutzer entwickelt und ver\u00f6ffentlicht auch h\u00e4ufig neue Spiele. Ebenfalls auf RISC OS verf\u00fcgbar ist das bekannte ScummVM, welches Ihnen erm\u00f6glicht, zahlreiche Adventures und RPGs auszuf\u00fchren. ScummVM unterst\u00fctzt eine umfangreiche Bibliothek von \u00fcber 250 Adventure-Spielen - darunter viele Klassiker legend\u00e4rer Studios wie LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software. ResidualVM ist auch verf\u00fcgbar, um 3D Abenteuerspiele auf RISC OS zu spielen, dazu geh\u00f6ren Grim Fandango, Escape von Monkey Island und Myst III: Exile.\nDer Raspberry Pi ist ein erschwinglicher Mini-Computer, der sehr vielseitig ist. Es kann f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl von Aufgaben verwendet werden, darunter elektronische Projekte, Spiele, Medienserver, sichere Internet-Proxyserver, Robotik, Tabellenkalkulationen, Textverarbeitung und mehr. Aber Linux-Distributionen bringen die g\u00fcnstige Hardware schnell an ihre Grenzen. Im Gegensatz dazu wurde RISC OS f\u00fcr viel weniger leistungsstarke ARM-CPUs und kleinere Speichergr\u00f6\u00dfen entwickelt und passt daher perfekt zu jedem Raspberry Pi. Da das ressourcenschonende RISC-Betriebssystem ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr die effizienten ARM-Prozessor konzipiert wurde und keine Gigabyte Speicher ben\u00f6tigt, ist das Cloverleaf RISC-Betriebssystem perfekt f\u00fcr Ihren Raspberry Pi Zero, 2, 3 und 4.\nRISC OS ist f\u00fcr Entdecker gedacht, die neue Erfahrungen machen und nach aufregenden Computerl\u00f6sungen suchen. Wer schneller mit seinem Betriebssystem mehr anfangen m\u00f6chte, wird die intuitive, unkomplizierte Technologie von RISC OS lieben. Schlicht und einfach, viele Computerbenutzer haben die Nase voll von Monopolisten und suchen nach alternativen L\u00f6sungen, die ihren Anforderungen besser entsprechen. Anstatt sich mit st\u00e4ndigen, teuren Updates und eingeschr\u00e4nkter Hardware und Software zu befassen, k\u00f6nnen RISC OS-Entdecker, dass sie mehr Computer eine neues, schnelles Betriebssystem erforschen und dabei noch umweltbewusst handeln. Das Cloverleaf-System ist das ultimative Werkzeug f\u00fcr Bastler, Hersteller und Programmier-Ninjas sowie f\u00fcr Computeranf\u00e4nger.\nEine der gr\u00f6\u00dften Vorteile des Cloverleaf RISC OS-Betriebssystems ist die beiliegende Software und Programmsprachen, die kostenlos zur Verf\u00fcgung steht.\nEinige der verf\u00fcgbaren Programme umfassen:\nEin leistungsstarkes Textverarbeitungs- und DTP-System (Impression Style)\nPipedream als Tabellenkalkulation, Datenbank und Textverarbeitung\nFireworkz (Tabellenkalkulation und Textverarbeitung)\nChatCube (Instant Messenger mit integriertem Client f\u00fcr Telegramm)\nGCC als GNU Compiler Collection f\u00fcr C ++\nBBC BASIC, mit dem Benutzer problemlos direkt in ARM Assembler schreiben k\u00f6nnen, ohne einen Compiler zu ben\u00f6tigen\nPython 2 & 3, die beliebteste Sprache f\u00fcr maschinelles Lernen und k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\nRiscLua, eine leistungsstarke, effiziente, leichte und einbettbare Skriptsprache      \nMessergerPro (Email & News Client)\nJetzt ist es einfacher als je zuvor, auf unsere herausragende Sammlung von Spielen und Emulatoren zuzugreifen, um:\nSinclair ZX Spectrum\nCommodore C64\nAcorn BBC Micro\nAcorn Archimedes\nMSDOS\nAuf diesen Plattformen haben Sie Zugriff auf eine Vielzahl von Retro-Spielen, die in unsere Sammlungen aufgenommen werden. Ganz zu schweigen davon, dass Sie \u00fcber PlingStore und PackMan auf noch mehr Spiele und Programme zugreifen k\u00f6nnen. Bist du ein Programmierer? Interessieren Sie sich f\u00fcr das Programmieren? Wir haben die Tools, Compiler und Programme f\u00fcr alle Ihre Anforderungen an Creative Computing.\nRISC OS Cloverleaf ist eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne zur Aktualisierung und Wiederbelebung des einzigartigen und dynamischen Computerbetriebssystems RISC OS. Mit Cloverleaf wollen wir eine neuen Markt f\u00fcr das Betriebssystem RISC OS aufbauen, die Benutzern eine aufregende und benutzerfreundliche Alternative zu Monopolisten wie Microsoft, Apple und Google bietet.\nIn diesem Projekt geht es um die Entwicklung von RISC OS. Wenn Sie Ihre erste Version von RISC OS erhalten, befindet es sich noch nicht am Endpunkt der Entwicklung.\nW\u00e4hrend Sie bereits eine Menge gro\u00dfartiger Tools zur Verf\u00fcgung haben, ist dies erst der Beginn der Entwicklung von RISC OS. Die Verbesserungen werden monatlich ver\u00f6ffentlicht, wobei im Laufe der Zeit neue Programme und Upgrades verf\u00fcgbar sind.\n\nUm RISC OS schneller weiterzuentwickeln, ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Hilfe. Mit Ihrer Unterst\u00fctzung k\u00f6nnen wir das bereits herausragende Betriebssystem RISC OS nutzen und es noch benutzerfreundlicher weiter verbessern und an heutige Anforderungen anpassen. \nUnsere Projektziele umfassen Unterst\u00fctzung von WIFI, USB 3, NMVe, Multithreading, GPU und mehrsprachige Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr alle wichtigen Sprachen.\nSie sind eine wohlhabende Person oder ein Unternehmen oder eine Organisation, die m\u00f6chte, dass RISC OS so schnell wie m\u00f6glich w\u00e4chst.

Auf diese Weise k\u00f6nnen wir 4 Monate lang an jedem Softwarepaket arbeiten. Der Port ist in dieser Zeit m\u00f6glicherweise nicht vollst\u00e4ndig fertiggestellt, sollte jedoch \u00fcber wichtige Funktionen verf\u00fcgen. Einige der Softwarepakete ben\u00f6tigen m\u00f6glicherweise mindestens zwei oder drei Mittel (2/3), um vollst\u00e4ndig portiert zu werden. Die Portierung h\u00e4ngt auch von den aktuellen technischen Einschr\u00e4nkungen von RISC OS ab. Beispielsweise hat RISC OS derzeit keinen Zugriff auf die ARM Mali-GPU. Daher kann OpenGL derzeit nur mit Software-Rendering implementiert werden. \nDie Beispielliste m\u00f6glicher Open Source-Software, die auf RISC OS portiert werden k\u00f6nnen, bitte im englischen Text ansehen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we are using existing hardware we will not have any risk of technological matter.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

By now the risks are less of us being able to make the product but more likely if we deliver on time. One of the biggest chunks of time is always the pre-production phase which includes tooling/mold production, test molds, and securing components. This time, we\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of the work done before launching the project which means greater financial risk for us but a lot less timeline uncertainty for our backers. We're happy to say we're even better equipped to face these challenges but no matter how much we plan there\u2019s always a chance that things can go wrong.

Fight aliens; befriend aliens. Make a fortune through trade \u2014 or through piracy! Chart your own course among the stars, or find yourself at the heart of dramatic events: turn the tide of wars, develop new technologies, and destabilise entire cultures!\nCosmic Frontier: Override is a single-player space-trading game in the mold of the inspirational Elite (1984). It is a remake of Escape Velocity: Override (1998), by the same scenario designer. It is planned to be released for Mac, Windows PC and Linux systems, with a target release date in the middle of 2021. We are seeking your backing to meet that target and release a game of the highest quality possible!\nPlanet landing concept art by Chris Smallfield\nGAMEPLAY\nAs in Elite and other games like it, the core gameplay involves piloting your ship from one star system to another, visiting planets and space stations, buying and selling goods to make a profit, while evading or fighting pirates and other threats. When you make enough money, you can upgrade your ship with new equipment and weapons, or buy an entirely new ship which may have drastically different capabilities.\nThe main difference between Cosmic Frontier and Elite is that it features a top-down view, like that of Asteroids, rather than being a flight sim. The result is an easy-to-learn game with a great atmosphere of adventure, suitable for both quick bites of play or long gaming sessions. We\u2019re certain that any fan of the Escape Velocity games will enjoy Cosmic Frontier, but the game is intended to be easy for the most casual pilot to pick up and play.\nCosmic Frontier is a free-form game: you can go wherever you want, and work for whomever you want \u2014 including for no one but yourself. You can be a peaceful trader, a bounty hunter, a soldier for Earth, a galactic explorer, a rapacious pirate \u2014 or all of these and more in the life of a single pilot! In addition, there are dozens of story-line missions which advance events within the game universe and provide unique challenges and opportunities. But it is also quite possible to avoid all this scripted content and still experience many hours of rich gameplay.\nTo get a fuller idea of the gameplay, or to summon up some nostalgia if you played the original game many years ago, please take a look at ASW Fangirl's youtube playthrough.\nSCENARIO\nIt is 150 years into the future. Humanity has achieved interstellar travel, but soon after doing so it became embroiled in a war with the pitiless Voinians, imperialistic aliens who see humans as just one more inferior species to enslave or annihilate.\nThe Voinians were halted at the Battle of Sol, but the conflict remains in the balance and battles continue to rage on the frontier just a few hyperjumps from Earth. Nearly all of humankind\u2019s energies are poured into this struggle for survival, and little of the rest of the accessible galaxy has been explored.\nYou begin as a solo pilot, with nothing but a shuttlecraft, a hyperflight licence and a handful of credits to your name, determined to make your fortune among the stars.\nTo players of the original Escape Velocity: Override, all of the above will sound familiar. They can be assured that all the best things from the original game will be preserved, and that there will be expanded content including new ship types and new mission strings. In addition, there will be a prequel mini-scenario, covering the period of humanity\u2019s first encounter with the Voinians, which will be released as DLC free to backers at the $10 level and above.\nCosmic Frontier: Override will feature:\nHundreds of star systems, planets and space stations to visit\nDozens of different classes of ship to pilot, and fight against\nNumerous human and alien factions with their own characteristic technologies\nA wide range of weapons and equipment for your ship\nHundreds of missions, including some which will change the face of the galaxy\nPlease note that, unless otherwise indicated, all screenshots come from the original game, Escape Velocity: Override, and are not representative of the final product\nMODDABILITY\nAmong the most important features of Cosmic Frontier will be moddability: Escape Velocity was a pioneering game in terms of the ease of content modification and creation by users, and both its sequels derived from content initially created by mod developers.\nCosmic Frontier too will be highly moddable. Shortly after the game\u2019s release, a free mod developer\u2019s kit will be released that will include a full guide to the scripting language that any user will be able to use to make their own additions or modifications to the scenario, or to create entirely new scenarios of their own. This includes the creation of new ships, new weapons, new outfits, new missions, new star systems and visitable worlds and stations, and a host of other features.\nThe new engine will have extensive compatibility with the resource files used by the Escape Velocity games. At worst, it will only take a small amount of conversion effort to get your old EV mods working with Cosmic Frontier. At best, it may prove possible to just plug them in and play!\nModdability is very important to us. Many people got their first taste of software development and graphic design through working on Escape Velocity projects, and we hope that the same will be true for Cosmic Frontier in the future. In addition, if this project is successfully funded, we hope that Override will not be the only Cosmic Frontier game we release \u2026 \nENGINE\nCosmic Frontier will feature a brand new game engine which will at least match the capabilities of the game engines of the games in the Escape Velocity series. In the future, we intend for this engine to be available for use by further projects, both by us and independently of us. Helping to fund Cosmic Frontier will also help to fund development of this game engine.\nThe engine itself is referred to by the name Kestrel. For practical reasons, Kestrel will not be source-available during the initial run of development, but following the release of Cosmic Frontier: Override it will become open-source, with a licence that will allow people to use it as the main engine in the development of their own games.\nKestrel will permit modification of the game on four different levels:\n1. Base Engine (C++). For fundamental changes, such as graphics rendering and physics calculations.\n2. Core Gameplay (Lua) - Changing how the resources and assets of the game are handled and the game experience is delivered.\n3. Mods (Lua) - Additional functionality, and changes to core functionality.\n4. Plugins - Traditional EV-style plugins that add content to the game without altering functionality.\nYou can read more and follow future progress on the Kestrel development blog. \nAn example of the Kestrel Development Language\nFUNDING GOALS\nOur initial funding target of $45 000 is set based on the amount of part-time and spare-time work we expect to put in to bring you the game by the middle of 2021. (Please keep in mind that we do not get every cent of the funding: there are fees to Kickstarter, payment processing fees, and also taxes to take into account.) A healthy funding amount will help us enormously in justifying to our families the amount of time and energy we have already put into this project. The greater the funding, the more time and effort we will be able to put in.\nIn addition, neither of the developers are primarily artists. Funding will enable us to commission artists, or even add an artist to the team if we meet the first stretch goal below, which will allow us to add new and improve existing art assets, and ensure a smooth, polished user interface.\nWe believe that the main funding target will be sufficient for us to at least match the quality of experience of the original Escape Velocity games, re-scaled and adjusted for modern displays and other gaming norms. In addition, there will be new scenario content including new ships and missions.\nStretch Goal 1 \u2014 Graphical Upgrade \u2014 $60 000\nShould we reach the $60 000 level, we will commit to a full graphical upgrade and overhaul of the original, which we will most likely look to achieve by adding a third member to the development team, who will focus on graphic design.\nPart of the charm of the Escape Velocity games was always that any would-be modder felt that they could be capable of creating content that didn\u2019t look out of place alongside the original work, and therefore we don\u2019t want to set the graphical bar so high that the same won\u2019t be true of Cosmic Frontier. So the focus will be on crisp, clear design and UI, putting new polish on existing Override assets and creating new content that fits in seamlessly.\nWe don\u2019t have any definite candidate in mind for this role at this time, but would be looking for someone with both a background in playing and modding the EV games, and some experience of professional graphic design.\nShort of this milestone, we will focus on producing and commissioning specific pieces of art in order to smooth out the original Override look as far as is feasible.\nStretch Goal 2 \u2014 Age of the Council \u2014 $100 000\nAt the $100 000 level, we will have the confidence to guarantee the release of a sequel to the Override scenario, entitled Age of the Council. This will be planned for release between 12 and 18 months after the initial release of Cosmic Frontier as paid-for DLC.\nThe bones of the Age of the Council scenario already exist, including the design of many new ships and weapons. The scenario takes place in essentially the same map of systems as Override, but begins 25 years later and (in addition to the impact of the pilot\u2019s actions in Override) there have been many other changes to the political shape of the galaxy \u2014 and there will be still more in the course of the plot!\nDraft ship designs for Age of the Council\nAnd beyond: We don\u2019t have any further specific stretch goals beyond these at this time, but the greater the funding level, the more ambitious we will be able to be in terms of: (1) bringing you the highest quality remaster of Override possible; (2) creating more content in the Override universe; (3) building the most complete and flexible game engine possible; and (4) planning for future games under the Cosmic Frontier title in new original settings.\nImportant reward tier note: If you are generous enough to fund us at a level where you get the chance to add new missions, a new ship type or other features to the game, we will do our best to implement your vision. However, we may have to impose certain limitations or guidelines to ensure that your addition fits in seamlessly with the rest of the design.\n\nWHO WE ARE\nTom Hancocks \u2014 Engine Developer\nTom is a software engineer who has worked with Apple's Cocoa frameworks for the past 16 years, and had some experience with Carbon and REALbasic before that. His first commercial project was a utility called TuneBar, which acted as a controller for iTunes, allowing users to control iTunes from within any other application on their system. The Escape Velocity series played a large part in expanding his interest in software development, and has been a game that he has periodically returned to. When he noticed that macOS Yosemite was beginning to emit warnings of incompatibility over EV Nova, he began to look into cloning the engine and reverse-engineering the old file and media formats that it had used.\nPeter Cartwright \u2014 Scenario Designer\nPeter began creating the scenario for Escape Velocity: Override shortly after the release of the original Escape Velocity, and Ambrosia Software picked it up as that game\u2019s first sequel shortly after he had left school. Although he has continued to do some game modding \u2014 including being a small part of the Magna Mundi team for Europa Universalis III \u2014 he did not stay in software development, mainly working as a freelance international translator, including for organisations such as the United Nations.\nBoth members of the team happen to be from the east of England.\nOverride Theme Music by Nolan Markey.\n\"Cosmic Frontiers are calling!\" and \"Greetings from the Cosmic Frontier\" poster images by Chris Smallfield.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the first independent software project for both of us.

We are constantly fighting for more donations and we are getting a state-of-the art Direct-to-Garment printer to help our cause. \nThis KickStarter is a wonderful opportunity for us to create some hacker-themed swag for our supporters and become a revenue source for us to use over the long-term. By fronting all of the orders for garments on Kickstarter, we eliminate the risk in having to finance the equipment. With the equipment fully paid for, we will add a crucial revenue stream to our project so that we can get more of our crucial work funded.\nThe Plan\nOSTIF is kicking-in half of the funding for the new equipment from our own donated funds from previous projects, and we are raising the other half through this KickStarter. We have carefully selected commercial-grade equipment, high quality materials, and gathered volunteers to work on the production of the shirts and wallets. \nWe have commissioned multiple designs and our staff has created multiple others, and the designs are all shirts we would wear ourselves. Many of these designs are appearing on this KickStarter for the first time and can't be found anywhere else!\nAll of the designs shown below are available in a \"Men's\" Tee, a \"Women's\" Tee, and a Unisex Fleece hoodie.\nWe discuss the designs of the rewards below:\nThe Designs\nThese are RFID-blocking wallets that block \"drive-by\" readers from scanning cards in your pocket. You can custom engrave them with whatever you want (Obviously nothing copyrighted or illegal, and it must be two-tone black and white. The maximum print area is about the size of the pictures shown in the KS gallery.) \nThis design is a space-twist on the Tux the Linux Penguin. It is very high resolution and looks fantastic!\nThe two designs above are a new design based on the old Jolly Roger flag. It features a skull and cross-keys design. The black shirt design has a bright glowing effect with a blue hue and the white shirt has a more subdued two-tone \"posterized\" design. \n Update: This design was just added! It commemorates our collaborative work with the Monero and Arweave projects to do an intense audit of RandomX, a new proof of work algorithm that multiple cryptocurrency projects have now adopted. It features a block of encrypted text that is garbled and unreadable, with a large X-shaped area of the text block glowing in \"Monero orange\" with clearer encrypted text. It is a high resolution design that doesn't show well in mockups, because we can't cram enough pixles into the maximum file size to show the details.\n This retro design represents OSTIF.org's anti-censorship work on the obfs4, shadowsocks, meeklite, and meekheavy projects. These technologies help break censorship in authoritarian regimes around the world. We are working to make them more secure, easier to use, and more effective.\nThis design shows Edward Snowden in a mosaic built out of computer text (ASCII). Snowden revealed worldwide illegal surveillance programs being conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).\nThis design is made to look like a band world tour shirt, but it is showing the real locations of large organizations that were struck by the leaked EternalBlue vulnerability. EternalBlue was a vulnerability that was originally found by the NSA, and instead of reporting the issue to Microsoft for a fix, they left systems worldwide vulnerable and built tools to exploit it. These tools leaked and ultimately became the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomwares that did billions of dollars in damage from downtime and destroyed data.\n This design is titled \"The Internet is Beautiful and Dangerous.\" The jellyfish design has Ethernet cables for tentacles and the bell has the international symbol for WiFi.\n This design is not just a stylized version of our org's name. We have hidden the Glider symbol in the design. The Glider is a symbol of hacker culture and it represents a simple shape that glides when it is used in the \"Game of Life\" originally designed by John Conway in the 1970's. The game has incredibly deep complexity while having deceptively simple starting conditions. An example of the game is here: https://playgameoflife.com/\n These bright designs represent the growth of the open source community with circuit-board traces and icons representing the many uses of open source software.\n\nThis design is a front and back design that features our organization name on the front, and on the back, it shows an actual NSA document leaked by Edward Snowden that shows that the US National Security Agency cannot decrypt an Off-The-Record encrypted message. It shows that even with the NSA's vast resources and manpower, properly built encryption systems prevail.\n This design represents the security audit work that we do, with a magnifying glass revealing \"horrors\" inside of your devices. It is meant to represent possible back doors in proprietary systems, such as the Intel Management Engine, AMD Platform Security Processor, or the ARM TrustZone, as well as all of the problems with Spectre, ZombieLoad, RIDL, and other security flaws that organizations try to fix with updates.\nThis design satirically calls out the biggest three \"surveillance as a business\" companies in the world with the warning \"BIOHAZARD - AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES.\" One design features just the biohazard symbol with the companies, and an alternative design includes a faint skull in the background, with two of the glowing company logos over the eye sockets.\nHere are two Monero designs. Being the largest privacy-oriented cryptocurrency in the world, we have worked closely with the Monero project on key features that have shrank transaction sizes, sped up the network, and hardened the blockchain against the rise of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). We have worked together on Monero BulletProofs, and Monero RandomX and we currently working closely on two other projects now.\nThis next design is a play on the \"OK Boomer\" designs that are floating around the web. It is the same style of lettering, but says \"OK Facebook\" using fake Cyrillic text. Instead of the \"have a terrible day\", it has a defeatist mantra of \"overthrow my government.\" This is to point out the unchecked Russian (and other) influence campaigns on Facebook and their failure to rein in international campaigns to undermine governments and reshape people's opinions.\nThis design symbolizes the growth of the Open Source Movement and its rise to wide adoption, with our role in improving project code quality and security. It features the word \"FIGHT\" with the \"i\" being symbolized by a tree made up of circuit-board traces.\nThe next one should be appreciated by programmers and security engineers alike! This is our \"typewriter\" design, featuring a typewriter that shows an actual critical flaw that was found by OSTIF while reviewing OpenVPN 2.4.0.\nThis is a two-sided design titled \"resist surveillance.\" It features a symbol of resistance over the United State's NSA logo.\nThe Windows Elephant design has a double meaning, one is superficial and the other is much deeper. Generally Windows is considered bloated and slow when compared to competing Linux solutions for a lot of tasks, hence the elephant failing to jump the chasm. The deeper meaning surrounds the removal of the Elephant Diffuser from BitLocker drive encryption. Removing this key component was against the advice of Microsoft's own cryptographers because it significantly weakens Bitlocker. Micah Lee wrote an excellent article explaining the situation here: https://theintercept.com/2015/06/04/microsoft-disk-encryption/ In essence, Microsoft weakened their encryption for Windows on purpose by killing the Elephant Diffuser.\nThis design is a tongue in cheek joke meme started in the early 2000's when Steve Ballmer of Microsoft famously said that \"Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.\" He then went on to compare Linux and the Free Software movement to communism. Today, Linux is a dominating presence on servers, in the cloud, and on smartphones everywhere.\n\nUpdate: This design was just added! It's a Monero Chameleon. It symbolizes Monero's focus on privacy and fungibility.\nUpdate: This design was just added! It's a play on words for \"fungible\" a key feature that Monero focuses on.\nBelow are our additional designs from our backers and staff.

Learn advanced Scala. Learn really well by coding a huge amount. Write more code during play than you do at work or at school.\nThe Game\nScalaQuest takes place in DataLand, a place where land produces data, and its inhabitants harvest data to survive.\nIn DataLand, many mysterious forces have arisen, with mystical names such as 4-train, C-cross-cross and Hava. They all made data harvesting more efficient, but they all came with dangers of their own. Eventually, Complexity Plagues appeared, forces became slow and inefficient. Whole crops were lost. Those were difficult times for all.\nWithin DataLand, a powerful wizard named Ski has roamed for a while, taming many of these forces. Recently, he's discovered a new force and named it Scala.\nHowever, Ski knows this great power needs to be wielded wisely, so he's gathering an order of apprentices, who can use Scala skillfully and with great care.\nHe's called this the Order of The Ski, or Order[Ski] for short.\nThis is where you come in. \nYou shall become his apprentice, and learn Scala through practice and peril. You will start on the warm, safe haven of Values and Expressions, cross the Classes and Objects plains, hike over Variance Hills and make your way to the treacherous Implicit Forests.\nAnd after that? Who knows what lies ahead.\nWarning: This might be the first time you ask your team members to play a game during work hours.\nWhy Scala?\nScala is a programming language that mixes Object Oriented and Functional Programming. It has been adopted by organizations such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Netflix and Duolingo, and it has enjoyed steady growth for several years. Lately, investment in the language has come from companies like Intel, IBM and Juniper Networks. Its developer community is sharp, curious and dynamic.\nScala is being used in solid frameworks like Akka, Spark and Play, and is gaining much traction in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Reactive Systems.\nIf you're a developer, having Scala under your belt can open up exciting job opportunities.\nThe content\nOur goal is to cover a range of topics well beyond the very basics, including:\nValues and expressions \nClasses and Types\nObjects \nCase Classes\nValue Classes\nFunctions\nInheritance\nOptions\nPattern Matching\nCollections\nError Handling \nImplicits\nCurrying\nVariance and Covariance\nThe type system\nMONADS. Yes, Mondays. I mean Monads.\nEach level will typically focus on one topic, but as you advance you will be prompted to reinforce your existing knowledge.\nWho we are\nAs a Senior Software Developer & Trainer, Alejandro splits his time between architecting and building software, and coaching others on how to effectively use the Lightbend Reactive Platform. He has a strong passion for teaching, and is one of the few certified Lightbend trainers in Scala, Akka and Play. Over the last 4 years, he has taught over a thousand people from a variety of companies, ranging from startups like Hootsuite and large corporations like Intel and IBM. Alejandro has also created strong connections with many experts involved in building and supporting these platforms. (More about Alejandro)\nChristian is an experienced software developer who has been around a few blocks, and is still trying to find the safest neighbourhood to hang out in. Professionally he is somewhat of a generalist. His love for Scala started a few years ago when he was exposed to its capacity for brevity, its hiding of redundancy found in other languages, all the while being unwary of the dangerous hidden parts. Now he believes the way forward is to come to terms with acceptance - that no advanced language can ever be fully understood, yet sufficient patience and effort can still lead to skill, power and accomplishment. (More about Christian)\nWhy do you care?\nYou will want to back up this project if:\nYou want to learn Scala from scratch and have no time for nonsense\nYou want to level up your Scala skillz\nYou want to grow your Scala team\nYou want to encourage others to learn the language\nYou think great learning should be super affordable\nHow will you learn Scala?\nWe strongly believe fun is a multiplying factor for learning.\nWhen you're having fun, you're more engaged and tend to retain more information.\nPlay is the highest form of research. -- Albert Einstein\nSurely, Einstein was referring to the Zelda series here!\nThe best moments usually occur when a person\u2019s body or mind is stretched [...] in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. -- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow (1990)\nIf you're working at a task that's too easy, you get bored. Too hard, and you ragequit.\nAs developers, we also call this Flow, and we crave it often - but do we leverage 'fun' and 'games' enough for learning?\nLearning Scala is difficult and worthwhile... but can we make it **fun**?\nRepetition. In order to survive the quest, you will need to write a lot of code. Exercises will rarely repeat, but we will ensure that every concept is covered from as many angles as possible. You will write lots of code.\nObservation. As developers, we spend more time reading code than writing. We'll challenge you to read, understand and fix Scala snippets.\nMetaphors. We believe the right metaphors can unblock learners from understanding hard concepts. The further the metaphor from code and software, the better. We will use the game environment to create these metaphors and help you develop an intuition for hard concepts.\nThat is our goal with ScalaQuest.\nWhat about other learning options?\nYes, there are great training courses out there, some in pure digital form, others delivered by human beings.\nBut not everyone learns the same way. \nWe believe there's space for many different learning environments, and we've challenged ourselves to build one we really like!\nIn addition, we're creating a very affordable platform, that would allow you to learn at a monthly price that you can simply forget about.\nWhere the project is at\nWe've made tremendous progress and already have two working levels, with number 3 coming very soon. We plan on having beta testers in the near future to validate and improve our current direction. As a backer, you will be invited to participate in this phase, of course!\nFor some of the heavy lifting (compiling and running user code) we'll be integrating with Scastie in the near future.\nOur goals\nOur goal with ScalaQuest is to provide a relatively humane path to learning the basics and the intermediate parts of the deep world of Scala. We want learners to experience success and failure in the form of adventure, laughter and death, rather than in the form of confusion and self-doubt. ScalaQuest is a safe place to play with fire!\nOur objective is to launch ScalaQuest with 8 complete levels, which we believe will take us the rest of 2017. Our goal then is to have a publicly available game by January 2018.\nAfter launching the game, our goal is to release one new level per month.
