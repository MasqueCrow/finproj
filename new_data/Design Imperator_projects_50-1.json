[{"backer": "Design Imperator", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "\"Then war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down\u2014that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, who leads the whole world astray. He was hurled to the earth, and his angels with him.\"\n\nThe deck is inspired by the War in Heaven from the Book of Revelations.  Each suite matches a specific angel with a corresponding demon according to their rank in the hierarchy.\n\nWhat we are trying to convey in our story is that there are always more than one perspective in all he things that we go through in life. Two sides of the same coin, the darkness that comes with the light. Just like the war in heaven in the Book of Revelation. We fight our angels and demons everyday.\n\nDuring these times, when we all have to go through so many challenges, we want to shed light that with the gains comes the loses. Sometimes we rise like the angels in heaven, while other times, we fall like the devils.\n\nThis deck doesn't highlights only one side, rather how we can relate to both sides. We hope this gives an overview of what we want to convey through our artwork and design. \n\nWe want to give credit to Nicolai Aaroe Culminus deck for the inspiration and being one of the best game changers in the playing card design and campaigns. \n\nWe also want to give credit to Wylie Beckerts Wicked Kingdom Deck that inspired to challenged us to create intricate artworks for our card face and the idea to sell her original prints. \n\nWe also want to give a special mention for those whom we are inspired from in this campaign. Steve Mint Anubis & Osiris Deck, Marianne Larsen Circus Deck , Joker and thief Deck and Charmie dreams the cats Bastet the Cat Deck. There is so much more people we wish to mention, thank you for creating wonderful decks that has inspired so many others. \n\u2605 Angels vs Demons deck based on the War in Heaven\n\u2605 Limited edition (Only 2,500 Decks)\n\u2605 Deluxe copper foil on tuck exteriors\n\u2605 Embossed tuck boxes with two designs\n\u2605 100% unique pips & courts illustrations\n\u2605 Custom numbered seals placed on tuck bottoms\n\u2605 52+2 poker sized cards\n\u2605 Printed by LPCC\n\u2605 Fulfilled by Gamblers Warehouse\nThere will be two kinds of tucks available in this edition:  the Gehenna and Lux Bellator. The Gehenna tuck is dedicated to the Demons' side and Lux Bellator is dedicated to the Angels\u2019 side. \n\nGehenna is taken from the Hebrew Bible that is said to be a place where the wicked are headed to. It is not the same as Hell as it is said to be more of a waiting room or a purgatory for those to atone and think of their sins. We want to convey that even if demons fall to hell that there is always hope for those who are ready to atone for their sins. \nLux Bellator is latin for 'Light Warrior' we thought it would be a good contrast to the fact even Lucifer was once a 'Light Warrior'. One can be evil by nature or nurture and in this case even Angels who are born of pure light can fall. 'Light Warrior' depicts the angels as who they are, a warrior of the light and the defender against darkness. \n\nThe solid tuck boxes of War in Heaven will be manufactured with hot-stamped and embossed artwork on all sides.  There will be a numbered seal on the bottom on each tuck box. \nThe Gehenna tuck box is going to be manufactured with a dark grey colored stock and the artwork will be black and embossed on all sides.  The wording is then hot stamped with copper foil. We chose copper as it has a symbolic meaning in our eyes. Copper can be readily customized, it can be made by combining other metals into one. It has a property that is aligned to our deck which is that in life we can be stronger when combined with many other experiences. We wanted to recreate a dark summoning scene for this deck, which is why there are snakes surrounding the demons\u2019 sigil for summoning on the back of the deck. The snake is hand drawn and inked, which is then scanned and digitally integrated into the backs design. The snake depicts the serpent in this narrative that we are telling. \nThe Lux Bellator tuck box is going to be manufactured with cream white stock and the artwork will be hot-stamped copper foil. We want to give the tuck a feel of purity, reflecting the holy power of the Angels. In the Abrahamic religion, Angels are often referenced and represented by its divine light. We want to visualize the deck to have this divine light in its design by giving it angelic wings that replaces the serpent in the back design. We also picked copper foil on this design as even Angels has it's own kinds. There are many different Angels in the Hierachy of Angels such as: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers or Authorities, Principalities or Rulers and Archangels. Which will appear in our face cards.\nInspired by Nicolai Aaroe\u2019s tuck seal, we placed the seal on the bottom so it wouldn\u2019t be broken by use.  Each box will be numbered and be hot-stamped with copper foil. \n\nEach card face depicts two combatants of matching rank in the War in Heaven. Our concept is to try to visualize a reenactment on who will the demons and angels fight against during the war.  We visualized and stylized the angels, along with their corresponding demons. There are many different Angels in the Hierachy of Angels such as: Seraphim, Cherubim, Thrones, Dominations, Virtues, Powers or Authorities, Principalities or Rulers and Archangels. And there are many ranks of demons such as: Lucifer, Leviathan, Satan and Belial, Astaroth, Maggot, Asmodee, Beelzebub, Oriens, Paimon, Ariton (Egin) and Amaymon. There are also lesser demons such as: Demons of fate, Incubus, Succubus, Wandering groups or armies of demons can include multiple regions in hell, Familiars, Drude, Cambions and more. These creatures will also make an appearance in our deck. \n\nWhile the Lux Bellator\u2019s card faces radiates hope and blessings from God, the Gehenna\u2019s conveys a demonic chaos. Each character has its own narrative, stories, legends and origins.  Light versus Dark - whose side will you choose? Or can we relate to both these sides from our struggles in life? or even, in reality can we even choose a side when fate might brought us to see in both sides perspective. This was the reason of our pairing, to not only just compare the two characters but to also see their similarities. For some pairings they may even have the same origin as Angels. \nAs time passes, we will reveal the card faces and introduce our cast in each court. Every design is hand-drawn, inked and digitally colored skillfully by Silvana S. We will eventually let our backers buy our real hand-drawn and inked illustration. Please look forward to this! \nOnce we reach a $15,000 stretch goal, we plan to make the backs hot-stamped with foil. We believe in their quality and ability to manufacture the deck the way we designed and hope for it to achieve its true potential.\nThe number cards will be identical in illustration.  If we reach the stretch goal of $18,500, we will make the pips use metallic ink.  We will reveal more designs in the coming months, please be sure to check back! \nThis is the preview of what the Ace of Diamonds will look like. More ace suites will be revealed soon. If we reach the stretch goal of $18,500, the pips will be using a copper pigmented metallic ink. Copper can be readily customized, it can be made by combining other metals into one. It has a property that is aligned to our deck concept which is that in life we can be stronger when combined with many other experiences wether from the dark and light side.\nAdd-ons are optional rewards that lets backers easily select additional items that are not included as part of the main reward tier they selected.  These add-ons will be limited to Kickstarter only; we don't plan to remake them for our personal shop.

We would also like to explain that these are two side of the same coin (they are not two different coins). They cost CAD$25 per coin. \nWar in Heaven Booklet \nThe War in Heaven Booklet is perfect if you want a deeper knowledge of the stories behind each face card\u2019s pairing.

The construction of Big Ben begins, but there are already many bells tolling long echoes through the dark streets of London. These narrow streets are inhabited by suspicious figures that cast long shadows. A thief, a beggar, a prostitute, a corrupt politician and his cunning wife. All sceptical and scheming about the intentions of the shadowy figure right around the corner and at the end of the street.\n\u2605 19th century Victorian London theme\n\u2605 Embossed tuck boxes with gold/silver foil + TUCK INTERIORS UNLOCKED!\n\u2605 Exclusive to Kickstarter backers & www.isolatedthunderstorm.com\n\u2605 Limited edition (print run is 2,500 for each edition)\n\u2605 Custom, numbered tuck seals\n\u2605 52 poker sized playing cards + 2 unique diptych jokers\n\u2605 Metallic gold/silver ink on card backs \n\u2605 Printed by TWPCC (LPCC/EPCC) \n\u2605 Self-fulfilled by Isolated Thunderstorm \nThe Pennyless tuck has a gloomy scenery printed in a matte material with a striking silver foil and an embossed title that brings the poor people of the Victorian streets to foreground. This tuck is designed to set the tone and atmosphere of the theme. It has a fully custom stamp-like, numbered tuck seal. \nThe Pennyless number and face cards are designed in a one-way format for an art-focused layout on the character illustrations. These characters are drawn by hand in collaboration with professional illustrator Patrick Leis and feature characters inspired by Victorian archetypes, like the brothel owner, the night watchman and the roughneck on the docks.\nPennyless diptych jokers\nWith these illustrations I am building on the thematic representation of London in the Victorian Era. Victorian society was organized hierarchically. While race, religion, region and occupation were all meaningful aspects of identity and status, the main organizing principles of Victorian society was gender and class.\nThe Moonshine tuck is manufactured in a horisontal format with a black soft touch stock for a truly exquisite victorian feel. The tuck exterior is adorned with intricate and detailed gold foil on all sides, inspired by luxury brand tobacco- and matchbox packaging from the time period. It has a fully custom stamp-like, numbered tuck seal. \nThe Moonshine number and face cards are designed in a classic two-way layout with index in all four corners for optimised playability. The court cards are drawn by hand in collaboration with professional illustrator Patrick Leis and feature characters inspired by Victorian archetypes, like Jack the Ripper, Dr Jekyll, Sherlock Holmes and others.\nWith the Pennyless diptych scenery I want to illustrate a rough and poor district, while the Moonshine diptych scenery represents an upper class mercantile main street. I hope you'll find an interest in the contrasts and the stories they tell.\nOn the Shadows of London card backs you will find details such as Victorian street lamps, gate spikes, floral damask and the Big Ben clock tower.\nPledging for 6 or 12 Shadows of London decks you will have a standard box included in your reward, to hold them. These boxes come in two sizes (fitting either 6 or 12 decks) and they are designed to match the vintage paper boxes of the era.

If you choose the deluxe or \"T&G\" variant of these boxes it will come with an elegant gold foiled dustcover as seen in the images above. \n\nYou can add a standard edition Shadows of London box to your pledge, regardless of which pledge tier you have.

See the add-ons prices below.\nAdd +319 DKK for 1 deck of the Circus Playing Cards (Black Mosquito or Deluxa edition).\n\nYou can add an empty Circus box to your pledge, regardless of which pledge tier you have.

The next stretch goal is set at 325.000 DKK and it will be unveiled if the project manages to raise this amount.\nPennyless diptych joker artwork\nMoonshine diptych joker artwork\nSince 2014 I have increasingly been involved in projects here on Kickstarter; with only growing interest in this kind of creativity that reaches so many people worldwide. Furthermore, for a number of years I\u2019ve been running my own bookstores and I\u2019ve always loved the good story!\n\n                             In many ways, a playing card pitch here on Kickstarter is about portraying \u201ca good story\u201d via pictures in a creative and visually strong theme.\n\n                             During 2018 I begun working exclusively with creative projects and many of these involving playing cards. As head manager of Design Imperator you may already know me from projects like Ragnarok, Helheim and Deus Vult Playing cards.\n\n                             I\u2019m also and with great joy running www.isolatedthunderstorm.com which were founded in 2018. Now I\u2019m thrilled of being back here at Kickstarter trying on my own ideas once again and make them grow into launching my second brand new playing card project, which I sure hope you\u2019ll like as well!\nCheers, Marianne", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy previous deck projects - Chivalry, Midgard, Ragnarok, Helheim, Deus Vult, Circus and Norse Medals (fulfilment April this year), were all successfully funded on Kickstarter and received with great reviews from mine and our audience and supporters. What is presented to you with Shadows of London is based on extensive research, experience as creator and my devotion to exemplary execution. For the project I\u2019ve set a very conservative development timeline to ensure a thorough and flawless fulfilment for all backers. TWPCC I know from having proved their quality and attention to detail with numerous previous playing card projects and therefor I feel completely confident in the collaboration with them. \n\nAs experienced project creator, I\u2019ve brought many complex products to the audience on time and with very positive feedback. However, obstacles can arise unexpectedly. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. The fulfilment plan has buffers implemented to counter for potential mishaps as much as possible. As usual all rewards are shipped according to professional recommendations by danish Postnord, Deutsche Post and DHL and again I\u2019m handling the fulfilment process myself to make sure that everything goes as planned and because I simply like it! \n\nI have much experience with the shipping companies and have used them for several years, also for isolatedthunderstorm.com parcels, to send thousands of parcels, big and small. I therefor have every reason to believe that all rewards will be delivered to you as intended. Please note that I can\u2019t not be held responsible for any damaged, lost, unclaimed or destroyed parcels. It is crucial that you enter your address correctly in the survey after the project has ended and that you pick up your parcel when your local mail distribution is ready to deliver it to you. Since experience tells me that some decks, regardless to which country they are sent, can have an unexpectedly long delivery status and/or customs processing. \n\nI need to ask for your understanding, that it may (in rare cases) take months, from the time of dispatch, to the actual delivery to the recipient. If the reward itself does not live up to a high quality control and pass my condition inspections I\u2019ll return it to the facility and demand a re-production.

Both editions have a numbered tuck seal applied on the tuck bottom. Manufactured with exclusive tuck stocks that are sure to honor the spirits of the forest!\nThe Caccabus tuck box is manufactured with a black, soft-touch stock which is embossed on all sides. Copper foil and black/UV varnish is used in combination to honor the spirits of black magic and archaic energy. UNLOCKED BONUS: UV glow in black light. \nThe Hagazussa tuck box is manufactured with a brown, soft-touch stock that is embossed on all sides. Copper, black and red foil is hot stamped in combination to form the elements of witchcraft on the front and a chilling, burning cross on the tuck back.  \nNo tearing of the seals, no disturbance of the Gods. The numbered tuck seals of Vengeance of Witches are positioned at the tuck bottoms and displaying the unique number for each deck out of the 2,500 print run. I was inspired by Marianne Larsens Circus Playing Cards for this idea of bottom seal placement.\nThe face cards feature archetypes inspired by the 17th-century witch-hunts. Illustrations are drawn by hand by professional artist Nicolai Aaroe. The women are named (as apposed to the men) as they are the main characters of this theme and story. Characters are identical in the two editions, but aces and jokers are unique.\nIn the Caccabus edition, the hearts and diamond suits are red. Here, the cards have an old and worn look with no background pattern. See below for a comparison of the card fronts between the two editions.\nIn the Hagazussa edition, the hearts and diamond suits are printed with metallic copper ink. The cards have an old and worn look with a decorative background pattern. See below for a comparison of the card fronts between the two editions.   \nThe backs of Vengeance of Witches feature intricate artwork printed with metallic copper inks and blood red accents in pantone. Caccabus edition has rich black tint, while the Hagazussa edition has a dark, brownish tint. Both editions have a 'no border'/full bleed design.    \nDrowning, fire, madness, dismay, this is how we see the 'vengeance' in play. The aces of Vengeance of Witches are 'curses on the puritans' designed by the elements of witchery and archaic elements of black magic: air, water, earth and fire. Each edition has 4 unique curses. \nThe aces of Vengeance of Witches are my own edits of historic, stock imagery acquired under creative commons license. I give all credit to the original artists. \nIndex and layouts are identical in the two editions, but the tint, color of pips and background pattern varies between them. See below for a comparison of the card fronts between the two editions. \nCaccabus edition\nHagazussa edition\nIncluded exclusively and FOR FREE in the half or full brick pledge tiers comes a branded brick box to store your decks with style. Added decks are not included in this arrangement. These boxes will be CMYK-printed in a black paper stock similar to the Vittoria Di Venezia brick boxes, and fit either 6 or 12 decks (depending on your pledge tier).   \nCustomise your pledge tier with exclusive add-ons. Just like the decks themselves, these are all available in a limited supply. Some of these may potentially sell out fast and will be removed from this list if/when it happens. The prices below is representing the addition of one unit, unless stated otherwise. Shipping may be influenced depending on your pledge tier. See below how to apply add-ons. \nThe Vengeance of Witches spirit talisman and hex amulet are large, metal copper coins with a diameter of 2 inches (50mm). The two sides have different artwork as shown above. Both the spirit talisman and hex amulet are already included in the discounted \u00b4Collectors Edition\u00b4 pledge tier. To grab one of them, simply add +149 DKK to your pledge, or +279 DKK for them both. Please send me a private message to confirm your choice of add-ons.\nThe Vengeance of Witches booklet is ideal for you if you want to enjoy the face illustrations in a bigger format while reading about the witch-hunt of the early modern era. This is a printed booklet in A6 format. \nThe Vengeance of Witches deck pouches are designed to fit one deck of cards each and are manufactured in black satin with a copper foil icons. Both the spirit and alchemy pouches are already included in the discounted \u00b4Collectors Edition\u00b4 pledge tier. Add +30 DKK for 1 pouch or +55 DKK for two both pouches. See below how to apply add-ons.   \nYou can add a Vengeance of Witches box to your pledge, regardless of which pledge tier you have. They come in two sizes, holding either 6 or 12 decks of playing cards. To add a half brick box, simply add +150 DKK to your pledge or add +175 DKK for a full brick box, then please send me a private message to confirm your choice of add-ons. NOTE: Some pledge tiers already have a box included.  In some cases a change of shipping category may also come into effect depending on your pledge tier.\nHow to apply add-ons\nTo apply an add-on, you must increase your pledge with the indicated value via the \"manage my pledge\" button while keeping the same reward level. You must then send me a private message for confirmation and specification of your chosen add-on(s). If you have any doubts or questions in relation to how add-ons work you are more than welcome to send me a private message. I will not be using BackerKit or any other post-funding pledge manager to apply add-ons to your pledge.  In some cases a change of shipping category may also come into effect depending on your pledge tier.\nSo, how do the two editions compare to each other, when lined up side by side?  The devil lies in the detail:\nBesides the card backs, the decks differ from each other by having unique aces and jokers. The hearts and diamonds suits are red in Caccabus edition and golden in Hagazussa edition. On top of that, the Hagazussa edition has a background pattern, while the Caccabus cards fronts have a simpler, yet still worn and old look. Futhermore, the 'tarot style' labels have a different color scheme in the two editions. \nI would like to acknowledge your amazing support by adding a diptych scenery to both editions of Vengeance of Witches. The diptych artwork is formed of two bonus cards that are designed to add thematic atmosphere to the project. Depending on which edition you have pledged for, the cards shown below will be implemented automatically as a free expansion for all backers of the project. You don't have to do anything to get this bonus.\nCACCABUS DIPTYCH: \nIn the diptych scenery for the Caccabus edition, a twisted male corpse lies in front of a doe and her kid. The witch-finder senses that this is some unearthly curse and not simply a terrible accident.\nHAGAZUSSA DIPTYCH: \nIn the diptych scenery for the Hagazussa edition, a female channels archaic energy to set a building on fire. The retribution for the local witch-trials has begun.\n But it doesn\u2019t stop here. I have plans for more stretch goals and the next one will be unlocked at 480.000 DKK so stay tuned for more news on that! \nThe second stretch goal has been unlocked and with it comes a printed 'face card character portrait' for all backers in A6 format. This portrait will be chosen at random between the 12 face card characters and added to all pledge tiers automatically and for free for all backers of the project. On top of being a portrait, the backside will have a 'thank you text' from me. So I am pleased for this extended opportunity to express my gratitude to you as backer. No action is required from your side to get this portrait. It is not possible to get a specific character illustration, they will all be picked at random for every backer.\nWith the third stretch goal I will be adding a bonus card to both editions FOR FREE, which will be introducing the story behind the theme. The theme and idea may be very fresh and obvious to every backer here today, but once the decks are delivered, opened or handed as gifts I think it adds a wholesome value if the owner is able to read a few words to understand the contents of the deck better or refresh memory. Both the Caccabus and Hagazussa edition now feature a total of 57 cards!\nCaccabus bonus: UV glow\nI am now upgrading the black varnish of the Caccabus tucks to a more expensive UV varnish that has a very special characteristic that will make it glow in the dark when exposed to ultraviolet/black light. In normal lighting the tucks will still appear exactly as presented and this change will not take away anything from the current look and feel - it will simply add the new special glow feature automatically and FOR FREE for all backers of the Caccabus edition, which is only visible in black light.\nHere is an example of what you can expect from this UV glow feature. Please note that this is a digital mock-up and the actual look may differ slightly from what you see here. My Vittoria Di Venezia tucks were also manufactured with this UV feature. A glow in the dark! \nHagazussa bonus: metallic ink\nThe metallic ink with copper pigment has been a default feature for the card BACKS from day one, but with this stretch goal all the card FRONTS of the Hagazussa edition will now ALSO have copper pigmented ink as well! You'll notice all the golden numbers, frames and particularly the hearts and diamonds suits. All of these elements will now be printed with a more expensive metallic ink and it will be noticeable in comparison with any other deck printed with standard (CMYK) inks. This ink upgrade is applied automatically and FOR FREE for all backers of the Hagazussa edition.\nThis in a digital mock-up to simulate that I am now upgrading from the CMYK printing to the more advanced Pantone ink additions. But the actual difference can not be replicated on a computer screen. That is just how it is with Pantone inks. The effect of the ink with copper pigment is somewhat over exaggerated in this example, to make sure highlight what the feature upgrade is about.\nIn reality the metallic effect does not catch your attention as much as in this example or like a metallic foil, but you WILL feel that there is something a bit more interesting about this ink for sure. Many of my previous decks also have such metallic ink on the backs and faces as well, so I am really happy with the fact that the Hagazussa edition will now match them with this feature. \nCaccabus bonus: tuck interior\nWith the fifth stretch goal I am adding an exclusive tuck interior to both editions, as a free bonus for all backers of the project. For Caccabus, the interior will have witches' chanting in theban script, manufactured with a glossy black varnish against the matte black stock. For Haggazussa, the tuck interior will have a black foil with a 'pushthrough' pattern, that will reveal brown pentagrams in the gabs.\nHagazussa bonus: tuck interior\nAs the lead artist of several, succesful deck projects I am no novice in the world of fine art playing cards. I have in-depth knowledge on most printing companies and the strengths and weaknesses of each. I design dark art playing cards that are meant to be treated as such. I am an avid backer on Kickstarter and know how things work, on both sides of the table. \nVengeance of Witches is my most ambitious project to date and I have invested quite a significant sum of my profit from earlier projects to give it the attention that it deserves. These playing cards are designed and presented as fine art playing cards and neither designed nor produced for cardistry or other advanced handling.  \nVengeance of Witches will only be made with your support to help cover the costs of investments, setup fees, proof charges, printing, design, freight, shipping and the time to create all the pieces of art. I am launching this deck on Kickstarter as an artist, a deck collector, and an active fan of the crowdfunding concept. Let's do this together and create something unique! \nAny excess stock from my projects are offered exclusively at Mariannes online shop www.isolatedthunderstorm.com. Do check it out if there is something you miss in the above list of available add-ons in this project... or if you simply want to explore an assortment of other rare and unique decks and coins! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my seventh Kickstarter project and I know how things work. All presented features have been technically confirmed and formally quoted by NPCC prior to launching this kickstarter. \n\nMy lastest project, Vittoria Di Venezia, was manufactured by NPCC and completely lived up to my high ambitions of quality. I have much reason to use them again for Venegeance of Witches. I've spent many months researching, designing and budgetting. However, unexpected obstacles can arise. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. That being said, I feel absolutely confident in my tested suppliers and the conservative timeline I've chosen. Buffers are added to the development plan because I would love to deliver all rewards as promised, if not before. \n\nAs an experienced graphic designer, I've brought many complex products to my audience on time and with great feedback. There's nothing more important for me than getting your rewards delivered on time and as advertised. Please note that customs MAY open your deck(s) during shipping and thus break the factory sealing/cellophane. These are standard procedure checks to make sure that the parcel contains only legal items, and I hope for your understanding in such event. Shipping is handled with Deutsche Post and sent with tracking ID on all parcels. Any additional customs charges potentially applied to your reward during shipping is out of my hands. Please note that I can't be held responsible for any damaged, lost, unclaimed or destroyed parcels. \n\nIt is crucial that you enter your address correctly in the survey after the project has ended. I can take no responsibility in the actual delivery of your package, therefor requests such as \u201cKnock loudly on the blue door\u201d is strictly between you and your local mail service. If you have experienced troubles in receiving parcels from abroad I encourage you to establish a contact to your local postal service closer, but prior to fulfilment of this project. Returned parcels with the reason \u201cnot claimed\u201d can always be resent to you against a shipping fee. Experience tells me that some parcels, regardless to which country they are sent, can have an unexpectedly long delivery status and/or customs processing. I therefor need to ask for your understanding, that it may (in extremely rare cases) take months from the time of dispatch to actual delivery to the recipient. \n\nNote that these playing cards are primarily intended as pieces of art and not necessarily manufactured for magicians, cardists or similar high performance use.

IT IS SET TO BE PRODUCED TOGETHER WITH ORIGINAL PROJECT DECKS AND COMBINED FULFILLMENT FOR ORIGINAL PROJECT BACKERS. ALL BACKERS WILL START RECEIVING THEIR REWARDS IN END NOVEMBER.\nWalhalla is the German form of Old Norse Valh\u00f6ll, which is commonly anglicized as Valhalla. In Norse mythology, Valhalla is an enormous and majestic hall in Asgard, presided over by Odin.\nDescribed as a \"warrior's paradise\", it is here that the souls of those who are slain in battle go, chosen and guided by the Valkyries, a group of warrior maidens in service to Odin. \nValkyries choose those who may die in battle and those who may live. Selecting among half of those who die in battle, the valkyries take their chosen to the afterlife hall of the slain, Valhalla, ruled over by the god Odin. There, the deceased warriors become einherjar (Old Norse \"single fighters\"). When the einherjar are not preparing for the events of Ragnar\u00f6k, the valkyries bear them mead. Valkyries also appear as lovers of heroes and other mortals, where they are sometimes described as the daughters of royalty, sometimes accompanied by ravens and sometimes connected to swans or horses.\nLimited edition\nTransparent security holographic foil and invisible ink on tucks \nEmbossed tuck boxes w. custom seals\nDeluxe tucks with special paper stock\n100% custom design of cards, pips and tuck\nSPECIAL UV& INVISIBLE inks on card faces and backs\n54 poker sized cards (52+2 jokers)\nSavings on each deck with higher pledges\nAll decks shipped to backers in protective boxes\nPresenting you a Deck of Valkyries.

Here is glowing paint sample preview, to give you an idea how it will look on cards:\nPLAY\n\nSpades and Clubs are designed in blue and green neon inks, while Hearts and Diamonds - red and orange.

Although I have completed 5 projects on Kickstarter, this is the first deck to be printed by USPCC. Therefore, the quality of card performance must be of the highest standard.\nThe work on the design and art of this deck took almost a year. The idea of making a deck dedicated to the Amazons arised a long time ago because these women warriors were a real historical fact. When creating the heroines, I did not try to strictly adhere to any rigorous historical reconstructions and costumes, but tried to imagine how beautiful these ancient warriors could have been. However, the characters' costumes and weapons are almost authentic. I made every effort to get really high quality cards and boxes, the most meticulous detailing and decoration.\nFound my true inspiration in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Wien (Art History Museum) near the Amazons Sarcophagus.\nThe tuck box has its own insignia - it has the symbols of the shield and the spear, the minimal architectural components, as well as the Latin expressions of that era.\nThis deck will be the first in series of female Amazons. So far, the next two decks will be dedicated to Amazons Samurais and Amazons Vikings. This deck has 2 editions - Ephebes and Ephoros. Ephoros edition is the stretch goal - when unlocked you can choose any edition in your pledges.\nMain features:\nPrinted by USPCC\nGolden, Green and Black foils on the tuck box\nEmbossing on the tuck box\nCustom Tuck Box, cards and back\nLinen Finish\nClassic Paper\nEphoros Edition Deck as a goal\nThis edition will be available after stretch goals unlocked.

However, obstacles can arise unexpectedly. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. That being said, we feel only confident in our tested suppliers and the conservative development timeline we've chosen. As experienced project creators, we've brought many complex products to our audience on time and with great feedback.\n\nPlease note that Misery Development Ltd. is not responsible for any stolen, lost, unclaimed or destroyed parcels. It is crucial that you enter your address correctly in the survey after the project has ended.\n\nWe have much experience with the shipping company, Deutsche Post, and have used them for several years. We have every reason to believe that all rewards will be delivered to you. Tracking ID will be applied to all packages.\n\nIf the decks do not live up to our intern quality control and pass our condition inspection we will return it to the facility and demand a re-production. If this highly unlikely scenario SHOULD happen, some delay in our fulfilment process is be to expected and we hope for your understanding.\n\nPlease note that customs MAY carefully open your deck(s) during shipping and thus break the factory sealing and cellophane. These are random but standard procedure inspections to make sure that your parcel contains what it says on the label. The project budget does not allow us to replace any such inspected decks with new ones, and we hope for your understanding in such event. This happens very rarely.\n\nDesign and artwork is subject to minor tweaks and updates. \nEverything you see is a rendered mockup of the final product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a311 or more", "title": "1 Deck", "descp": "\u25ba 1 Wolves deck\nAdd ons available (see separate section)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["24 backers", "Limited (61 left of 85)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a311 or more", "title": "1 Deck", "descp": "\u25ba 1 Crows deck\nAdd ons available (see separate section)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["22 backers", "Limited (63 left of 85)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "1 Mixed Pair", "descp": "\u25ba 1 Wolves deck\n\u25ba 1 Crows deck\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["139 backers", "Limited (111 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a333 or more", "title": "2 Coins", "descp": "\u25ba2 Cheeki Breeki coins\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a339 or more", "title": "2 Pairs", "descp": "\u25ba 2 Wolves decks\n\u25ba 2 Crows decks\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers", "Limited (121 left of 150)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a340 or more", "title": "1 Mixed pair and 1 coin", "descp": "\u25ba 1 Wolves deck\n\u25ba 1 Crows deck\n\u25ba1 Cheeki Breeki coin\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["47 backers", "Limited (103 left of 150)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a357 or more", "title": "1 Mixed half brick", "descp": "\u25ba 3 Wolves decks\n\u25ba 3 Crows decks\n\u25ba 1 FREE half brick box\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["18 backers", "Limited (22 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "1 Mixed full brick", "descp": "\u25ba 6 Wolves decks\n\u25ba 6 Crows decks\n\u25ba 1 FREE full brick box\nAdd ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Limited (20 left of 30)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Rewards arriving", "update_content": "Dear Wolves & Crows backers\nIt has only been a short while since our last update, announcing that all rewards have shipped.

Chao Gold Coin (included with pledges of $45+)\nUpdate 8/30 - Limited Ed. Chao T-Shirts add-on\nUpdate 8/22 - FREE Chao Booklet added to box sets\nThe Chao\nPLAY\n\nChina\u2019s extraordinary history dates back to more than 5000 years and provides a rich collection of royal subjects which forms the basis of the Chao Playing Cards (limited production run of 12k each).\nOver the lengthy span of Chinese history, each Chao (which is the pronounced word for dynasty in the Chinese language) is distinguished by the name and the impact of the individuals that ruled over that period of time. This very special and unique deck of cards pays tribute to four of the greatest and most recognized dynasties in Chinese history \u2013 Han, Tang, Ming and Qing. Each dynasty has an outstanding and reputable Emperor, Empress and General, each with their own notorious traits and fascinating stories. The Chao depict these influential men and women that were renowned and celebrated from each of the four famous dynasties.\nTo ensure we captured the essence of each dynasty, we invested a lot of time and resource into the research part of this project. The illustrations and design takes inspiration from not only the renowned rulers of the four Dynasties but also from Chinese culture itself, which is visible throughout the deck.  \nThe chosen Chinese Emperors, Empresses and Generals all represent great power, wealth and wisdom, each with different traits and personalities and each dynasty holds their own trademarks to differentiate them from others. Inspired by these different elements, each Emperor features distinct clothing and accessories from their era, Empress\u2019s have different hair pieces and holds the instrument that they played and Generals wear armor and yield the weapon used to fight in their notorious battles. Fine intricate details are added onto each court card, allowing each individual to possess different facial features which best reflects their character.\nThe Chao was designed to closely follow that of a traditional deck of cards in terms of positioning including head facing direction, hand placements and the presence of weapons and artifacts.\nCard Back\nGold Foil Stamping\nThe 4 aces includes very detailed Chinese patterns. We also added a Chinese dragon on the ace of spades \u2013 a symbolism of imperial power and strength.\nAce of Spades\nChao Aces\nEach suit i.e. Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds reflects one of the four chosen dynasties (Han, Tang, Ming and Qing), with a renowned Emperor, Empress and General from that dynasty representing the King, Queen and Jack. Choosing who or what to use to represent the Jokers was not a straight forward task as we wanted these 2 very important cards to have some significant value so we chose 2 very important figures which are still looked very highly upon even up until this present day.\nJoker\nNumbered cards\nMade in the People\u2019s Republic of China \nThe Chao playing cards represents the History of China and where better to produce this deck than in China itself.\nThis is not just any ordinary deck of cards from China, but a completely new limited edition deck (only 12k of each will be produced) manufactured by MPC in terms of design and materials. We broke down the elements that make a great deck of cards and re-engineered it in its entirety from card stock finishing to varnishing used. The card stock is a new much lighter card stock which was specifically developed to obtain a perfect balance between the softness and stiffness needed to excel in performance such as for cardistry, magic tricks and handling. The new varnishing was a monumental part to this project which has been in development over the past 2 years. It took longer than we wanted but it was completely worth the time and investment. The outcome is truly exceptional. I guess you will have to try it to feel the unique difference of this newly engineered deck. As this deck is a limited edition, once it runs out, that\u2019ll be it. If we have any more decks left after this project, they will be sold at a higher price on our website until they run out.\nLinen Air\nLinen Air\nCard Fan\nThe tuck box completes the overall aesthetics of the deck and come in a carefully chosen choice of two significant and representative colors of China, porcelain blue and vermilion red.

A majestic Chao embossed gold metal coin (with a good weight to it). This is great for coin magic tricks and also definitely a limited edition production from MPC, completely exclusive to our Chao deck backers on Kickstarter.\nCHAO gold coin\nHOW TO GET THE GOLD?\nWhile we\u2019d like for all backers to get one, due to the cost to make this beautiful gold Chao coin (even though it\u2019s not real gold), we can only give it for free to all backers of $45 and above. Having said that, if we can reach some stretch goals as below then the production costs can come down as a result of a larger production and more people can get the coin. Alternatively, you can add $5 per coin as an add-on.\n- At present, we\u2019ll be able to give 1 to each and every backer of $45 and above.\n- Stretch goal of $35K, we\u2019ll be able to give 1 to each and every backer of $25 and above and 2 to each backer of $90 and above.\n- Stretch goal of $45K, we\u2019ll be able to give 1 to each and every backer of $13 and above and 2 to each backer of $80 and above.\nThe Chao Playing Cards are designed and manufactured by MakePlayingCards.com (MPC), a professional playing cards manufacturer with over 35 years of experience specializing in custom playing cards and game cards.

Decks from my last series Light Versus Darkness are now exclusively available at isolatedthunderstorm.com.\nHunters of York is funded on day two and I couldn't be happier! I am therefore and hereby revealing a set of stretch goals for the project, which are all relevant to everyone who is backing it. Artwork will be revealed as goals are reached.\nAlternate 'Jack of Hearts' bonus card unlocked with stretch goal II for both editions.\nAs the lead artist of several, succesful deck projects I am no longer a novice in the world of custom playing cards. I have in-depth knowledge on most printing companies and the strengths and weaknesses of each. I am an avid backer on Kickstarter and know how things work, as a creator as well as a backer.\nWith Hunters of York I am hoping to start a new series of unique fine art playing cards. I have never worked as much on a deck project as I have with Hunters of York. My first sketches dates back to 2015 so it has been my 'go to' project for almost 3 years. The courts are illustrated in collaboration with a veteran artist Martin Helgren and I already paid him in full for his involvement in the process. Hunters of York is the most advanced deck design I have been involved with, and I have invested a quite significant sum of my profit from earlier projects to give it the attention that it deserves. Hunters of York is the 'volume 1' of my Florus Drama series, and it will feature multiple deluxe effects. \nFollow me on Instagram\nHunters of York will only be made with your support to help cover the costs of investments, setup fees, proof charges, printing, design, freight, shipping and the time to create all the pieces of art. I am launching this deck on Kickstarter as an artist, a deck collector, and an active fan of the crowdfunding concept. Let's do this together and create something unique!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fifth Kickstarter project and I know how things work. All presented features have been technically confirmed and formally quoted by NPCC prior to launching this kickstarter. This time I have prototypes made to examine and fine tune the details prior to reveal of artwork. \n\nMy last project, Culminus, was manufactured by NPCC and did live up to my high ambitions of quality. I have much reason to use them again for Hunters of York. I've spent many months researching, designing and budgetting. However, unexpected obstacles can arise. Potential set-backs include production delays, shipping and sourcing issues. That being said, I feel absolutely confident in my tested suppliers and the conservative timeline I've chosen. Buffers are added to the development plan because I would love to deliver all rewards as promised, if not before. \n\nAs an experienced graphic designer, I've brought many complex products to my audience on time and with great feedback. There's nothing more important for me than getting your rewards delivered on time and as advertised. \n\nPlease note that customs MAY open your deck(s) during shipping and thus break the factory sealing/cellophane. These are standard procedure checks to make sure that the parcel contains only legal items, and I hope for your understanding in such event. Shipping is handled with Deutsche Post and sent with tracking ID on all parcels. \n\nAny additional customs charges potentially applied to your reward during shipping is out of my hands. Please note that I can't be held responsible for any damaged, lost, unclaimed or destroyed parcels. It is crucial that you enter your address correctly in the survey after the project has ended. \n\nExperience tells me that some parcels, regardless to which country they are sent, can have an unexpectedly long delivery status and/or customs processing. I therefor need to ask for your understanding, that it may (in rare cases) take months from the time of dispatch to actual delivery to the recipient. \n\nDesign and artwork is subject to minor tweaks and updates. \nBrick boxes will be printed by another company (not NPCC).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 89 or more", "title": "1 Deck", "descp": "\u25ba1 HoY Master deck\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["38 backers", "Limited (47 left of 85)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 89 or more", "title": "1 Deck", "descp": "\u25ba1 HoY Mistress deck\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17 backers", "Limited (68 left of 85)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 172 or more", "title": "1 Mixed pair", "descp": "\u25ba1 HoY Master deck\n\u25ba1 HoY Mistress deck\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["295 backers", "Limited (205 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 279 or more", "title": "2 Coins", "descp": "\u25ba1 Hunters Medallion\n\u25ba1 Coin of Good Fortune", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 328 or more", "title": "2 Pairs", "descp": "\u25ba2 HoY Master decks\n\u25ba2 HoY Mistress decks\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["67 backers", "Limited (233 left of 300)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 456 or more", "title": "1 Mixed half brick", "descp": "\u25ba3 HoY Master decks\n\u25ba3 HoY Mistress decks\n\u25baFREE HoY half brick box\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["40 backers", "Limited (15 left of 55)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 506 or more", "title": "1 Collectors deluxe", "descp": "\u25ba1 HoY Master deck\n\u25ba1 HoY Mistress deck\n\u25ba1 HoY Master pouch\n\u25ba1 HoY Mistress pouch\n\u25ba1 Hunters Medallion\n\u25ba1 Coin of Good Fortune\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nAdd-ons available (see separate section).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers", "Limited (115 left of 150)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 698 or more", "title": "1 Personalized mixed half brick", "descp": "\u25ba1 half-brick box containing 6 HoY decks (3 Master decks/3 Mistress decks).

This is a luxurious, custom deck for anyone who is as enthusiastic about cards as I am, whether you are a magician, poker player or just someone who appreciates the finer things in life. \nClick the image for HD\nSummary\nLuxurious peacock themed deck\n56 poker sized playing cards (52 cards + 2 jokers + 1 double backer +1 bonus card)\nManufactured by Cartamundi in Belgium  \nCards are printed on Cartamundi's famous B9 True Linen Finish - developed especially for players, cardists and magicians\nGold and white foiled tuck box \nCustom pips and faces with peacock details - based on the classic playing card design\nGold metallic ink on the card backs and fronts\nCustom stamp seal\nThe more decks you pledge for, the cheaper the price will be per deck\n\nThe tuck cases display the majestic peacock along with eye catching elements based on the bird's feathers. The cases will be printed with high quality gold and white foil on dark blue, textured cardboard stock, just to add another depth of luxury to the look and touch. \nTuck box details - click image for HD\nClick the image for HD\n   The sides display the latin phrase \"Audaces Fortuna Iuvat\", meaning \"Fortune Favours the Bold\" - click image for HD\nClose-up of the seal\nThe cards will be printed using Cartamundi's famous B9 True Linen Finish. This is a high quality paper stock developed especially with cardists and magicians in mind. The paper is soft, but springy, giving the cards superior handling and longevity. For the print, we will be using metallic inks with golden pigments on both the backs and facecs. This will give the cards a luxury and stunning look. There will be no white edges on the backs meaning fanning the cards will give you flawless results.\nDetails of the card back - Click the image for HD\nClick the image for HD\n        Click the image for HD\nThe court cards are all based on the standard face designs, but with custom details from the peacock. For instance, instead of holding a flower, the jacks and queens are holding a peacock feather. By using the standard design of the faces, it makes the deck more suitable for magicians as spectators won't be sceptical or suspicious towards the cards.\nFaces contain peacock details and will be printed with a golden metallic ink - click the image for HD\nExamples of the custom pips\nThe jokers depict two beautifully decorated peacocks (with joker hats of course) - Click image for HD\n         We don't just want the Pride of Peacocks deck to look amazing, but also to feel amazing in your hands. Therefore, the quality of Pride of Peacocks cards is one of the most important factors for us. To achieve a deck with supreme handling, we are manufacturing the cards with Cartamundi in Belgium. As mentioned earlier, they will be printed on their famous card stock, the True Linen B9 Finish. This card stock is specifically made for cardists, players and magicians. This deck is, therefore, not just for decoration, but also ideal to use when trying to attract followers with your cardistry Instagram videos, in your magic routines or when winning money from your friends at poker.\nThe Pride of Peacocks deck will be printed by Belgium based Cartamundi\nADD-ONS\nExtra Pride of Peacocks decks - \u00a311 (~$14) per deck\nUncut Sheet - \u00a330 (~$40) per sheet\nHow Add-ons work:\nAdding several goodies is a piece of cake. \n- First, choose a reward tier\n- Next, go to \"Manage my pledge\" on the top right of the page. Add the amount of the add-on you want. \n- You will then have to confirm and you will be redirected to the payment. \n- Note that more add-ons will become available as new stretch goals are being reached (see below).\nWhat is Arcadia?\nArcadia is the start of a dream I have had for a while. The plan is to release a series of themed, high end decks under this brand. Pride of Peacocks is the first deck in this series. Make sure you follow us on Instagram, Facebook and sign up to our email list on Arcadia's website to not miss out on any news or exclusive, future discounts.\nShipping\nWe have decided to deal with the fulfillment ourselves. This means that, once the cards are produced, we will have them sent to us (in the UK) and we will send out all the decks to our backers. This gives us complete control over all shipments, whilst saving money which we can spend on making the product better. However, if we have a larger quantity of backers from USA than expected, we will work with Gambler`s Warehouse to sent out the decks to our American backers. \nStretch Goals\nFirst stretch goal will be announced at \u00a312 000.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done extensive amounts of research to minimise as many risks as possible when it comes to producing this deck. All files are ready for print so if we reach our goal, all that needs to be done is to send them off to Cartamundi. \n\nThe main area where problems can arise is, like any other playing card project on Kickstarter, when it comes to shipping. As mentioned, we are doing the fulfillment ourselves for maximum control. \nIt is also possible to experience delays when it comes to the printing of the cards, but Cartamundi is a well established manufacturer of playing cards so they know what they are doing. If any problems will arise, we will solve them as quickly as possible and keep all backers updated. \n\nNote that Arcadia can not be held responsible for any damaged, unclaimed or destroyed parcels, so please make sure to enter the correct address when you receive the survey after the project has been funded. Delivery can also take longer than expected. \nYou might be charged customs/import duty, depending on where you \nlive.

The objective of the game is to develop your Necromancer and take control of the lands. Each player starts out as an aspiring Necromancer who can study spells, craft artifacts and eventually graduate from one of four academies. In time, your Necromancer can attract their own apprentice and assemble an undead army of minions to rule the lands.\nYour Necromancer can venture into dungeons where they will encounter wonders and dangerous creatures \u2013 and perhaps meet new companions. In the end, your Necromancer might be able to return to their academy and become Headmaster \u2013 or even seize the foulest of thrones as the Necromancer King.\nEach player moves his or her miniature Necromancer around the game board to gather resources, spells and artifacts, enter dungeons, battle cities and fight rival Necromancers.\nThroughout the game, Necromancers can increase their combat and movement abilities as they amass their armies. A Necromancer\u2019s minions can also be left behind to protect conquered cities and dungeons.\nIn addition to the game\u2019s territorial component, the players compete in collecting spells, artifacts and minions affiliated with the four academies. Enough elements of the same color can make you Headmaster of an academy. The game has a varying starting setup, so no two games are ever the same.\nThe Bureaucrat\nWe designed Rise of the Necromancers with the following in mind:\nSimple game rules that allow for an array of possibilities.\nNo single winning strategy: players can strategize and adapt.\nSome element of chance, but the best player is most likely to win.\nA game where each move has strategic relevance.\nHigh pace.\nIn Rise of the Necromancers your goal is to become the Necromancer King. The first player to put their 13 evil dominion counters in play has proven their wickedness and has won the game.\nChoose your Necromancer wisely\nThe game starts by each player drawing three Necromancer cards and three Apprentice cards at random. You can only play one Necromancer card in the game, so be cunning and dedicate yourself to a strong path of necromancy, but not too soon - don\u2019t let your rivals know your true ambitions. \nWe call them Apprentices, but they are a mere means to an end\u2026 oftentimes their own\nAll players start with their Necromancer in the Valley of Souls, from here the necromancer can move onto adjacent territories. Each territory offer an option: In the libraries you research spells, in the laboratories you craft artifacts, in the dungeons you quest to lay claim to riches and fame, or finally you can take control of the cities of mortal men and send out your tax collectors.\nPlayer board\nIf a Necromancer succeeds in a territory they get to place a dominion counter on either their Player Board or the Game Board. The dominion counters on the Game Board can be pushed off the board again by opposing Necromancers. Throughout the game the Necromancer also have to collect sinister ingredients and corpses to raise an army of undead minions or do fell deeds. The undead minions can be used to attack cities or left behind to defend the cities in your control.\nYour Necromancer can be a Jack of all Trades or be dedicated to one of four academies: Decay, Mist, Blood or Bone - each represented by a specific color in the game. Each academy has its advantages and depending on what Necromancer and Apprentice you have chosen, you can try to strengthen your setup by acquiring the right Spells, Minions and Artifacts. If you have a clear dedication to an academy (by having 6 cards of the same color) you can become Academy Headmaster.\nPerhaps you will learn the spell Zombie explosion\nYou might live out your secret vile dream and become a Bureaucrat focusing on city control and tax collecting, or a Bone lord who will mount his mighty skeletal dragon and set off to explore distant dungeons?\nNo two games are ever the same, because you have to adapt to different situations in each game, and your selection of Necromancers and Apprentices alter from game to game.\nArtefacts will make you even more powerful\nYou might not win every time, but you will always get to develop your own cool and evil character. Sore loser or not, as long as you are a little bit evil you will enjoy the game.\nFor more information on the game and to read the rules of the game, please visit our website www.SoreLoserGames.dk\nAspiring Necromancer- we cannot complete this most difficult of tasks without your assistance!

Distributed by: TwoGeeksGaming\nPrinting by: MPC\n100% custom face cards, aces, pips, jokers, and coloring\nAll 54 cards have their own individual artwork\nEach deck has 2 distinct art styles, Figures & Elements\nCustom Tuck Box\n310 GSM (Black Core) card stock with Linen Finish\nLimited production run\nThe first deck in a continuing series of themed minimalist playing cards\nWhat exactly are the SMArt Series Playing Cards? \nThis will be an ongoing series of \"Themed\" poker playing card decks that will always have that minimalist art style. We plan on releasing several decks (or series) a year and each of these decks will have a different theme. We have always loved that look of the Minimalist art style and in what you can convey with just simple lines, blacks & whites and solid bold coloring. It is a style that is very unique and really stands out.\nOur face cards are the 10's, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers. These have what we refer to as \"Figure Art\".\nOur pip cards are the 2-9 and have what we refer to as \"Element Art\".\nWe spent a lot of time and went through several versions when developing the card back. This ultimately was the one we decided to use. It is a completely mirrored back and works on several visual levels.\nTop - Standard Deck / Bottom - Miniverse Deck\nOne of our all time favorite tuck boxes is the Heretic set by Stockholm 17. It is a thing of beauty in its nearly all black design. Right from the start, we knew we wanted to keep that minimalist look throughout everything and it made sense to make our tuck box very stark. Bits of color, mostly blacks and greys, and with just enough information on it so you knew what deck you had in your hands.\nStandard Tuck Box\nPrices include S&H costs. If you have any questions or special requests, please Private Message or Email us.\nSTANDARD DECK ($15 US / $18 World)\n54 card custom poker style playing cards. Each card has their own individual artwork in two distinct art styles, Figures & Elements. 310 GSM (Black Core) card stock with Linen Finish. Custom tuck box.\nMighty Heroic Minis - Standard Deck\nNew - MINIVERSE DECK ($30 US/ $33 World)\nThis is an all new limited production companion deck to our standard one above. It is basically the equivalent to a red poker deck... while the standard deck would be considered a black poker deck.\nNew Features - Back of the cards are now red (of course). All the King cards have different & new figures not seen in the standard deck. The background behind the main art for the front of the cards is reversed. Alternative versions of the Joker cards. Alternative red colored tuck box.\nMiniverse Deck\nUNCUT SHEET ($40 US / World - Email for Quote)\nThis is a 310 GSM Linen Finish Uncut Sheet. It has all 54 playing cards (includes the Jokers) and the card back design as well. This truly does look awesome on the wall. \nMIGHTY HEROIC MINIS T-SHIRT ($30 US / $40 World)\nWe have two styles and several options for you to choose from. So you can get that perfect T-Shirt for yourself or someone else:\n CUSTOMIZABLE T-SHIRT ($40 US / $50 World)\nWe wanted the backers to be involved in having fun with us. So, we are letting you do something very cool with \"Make-Your-Own\" Customized T-Shirt. You can choose from 1 to 8 pieces of our artwork that are in this campaign and we will take that art and design your very own one-of-a-kind t-shirt. \nStyle C... & some examples\n3D PICTURE CARDS - 2 Pieces ($12 US / $14 World)  \nYou will receive two 4x6 3D Picture Cards that actual transform from one image to another when you look at them. This process is also known as Lenticular printing.  \nBOOKMARK SET - 5 Pieces ($7 US / $9 World)  \nA five piece set of 2x6 double sided & reversible Bookmarks... which includes all 20 face card Figures represented on the playing cards.\nMOUSEPAD ($10 US / $14 World) \nPremium 7x8 Fabric Mousepad that is made from durable, high-density black foam, which stands up to everyday wear and tear.Thickness 3/16 inch. \n(Includes some alternative figures not seen on the playing cards)\nMAGNET SET - 4 Pieces ($9 US / $11 World)\nA four piece set of 2.5x3.5 UV Coated Vinyl Magnets.\n(Includes 2 new figures not seen on the standard deck)\nART OF MIGHTY HEROIC MINIS - COLLECTORS EDITION BOOKS \nHardcover Edition ($22 US / $25 World)\nDigital PDF Edition ($6 US / $6 World)\nA beautiful 6x8 premium 20 page collectors book. This will showcase all the art that made it into the game, as well as, some alternate costume versions and other art that didn't make it onto the final cards. If you want to have it all... then this is the thing for you. Comes in either a Hardcover bound edition or a digital PDF edition.\n(*BONUS - Hardcover also includes the Digital PDF Book version as well)\n\nSo what has changed from the previous campaign?\n1. MPC will now handle all the card production. This way it makes things a bit more manageable for us.\n2. Much lower funding goal of only $2100.00 instead of the original $8000.00. This one should easily be obtainable.\n3. Deck prices are a little bit cheaper... for the most part. We've tried to pass those savings onto our backers. Every little bit helps nowadays.\n4. We've put up all new and really interesting Add-On's for you to get. Some we have never seen offered before in a campaign, Please check those out above.\n5. We had to remove some of the previous characters. BUT, there are new ones in their place that are just awesome. Check them all out.\n6. All the artwork has been improved and enhanced. The background have a more 3D look and feel to it and all the figures have a slight shadow behind them that makes them seem like they are jumping off the card. Really cool looking stuff.\n7. Our backers had suggested easier to read cards. Well... you asked for it and you got it. First, we made the numbers/pips and suits much larger. Next, we removed the right handed side numbers/pips in favor of a more streamlined look, as well as, going back to the industry standard of Red/Black coloring on all the cards.\nI noticed that Mighty Heroic Minis states it is Series 1.1. What does this mean?\nIt just simply means that this is Series 1 Deck 1. \nSo... series 1 will always be your Mighty Heroic Minis. In the future, if we do a second deck of all new characters, it would be Mighty Heroic Minis \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1 Deck 2. That way you always know what specific deck you have in your hands.\nI see there is a tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Heroic Minis LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nHow are the funds going to be used?\nTwo Geeks Gaming is a small design company specializing in Card Games, Tabletop Games and Custom Artwork. We have invested thousands of dollars into getting the company started and designing this one deck. We also have three more decks planned for release in the upcoming 2016 year. \nSo the bottom line is this... if there are any profits made from this campaign, it will go right back into development for our next deck and future projects.\n Twogeeksgaming01@gmail.com\nRead about us here\nRead about us here\n                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed. MPC has already given us the preliminary thumbs up for moving onto production. We just need to give them the very last designs and of course the funds for manufacturing.\n\nThe only risk now is Natural disasters or acts of God... or possibly an unexpected issue with our manufacturer. Which I honestly don't see happening, as we are only using a very reputable company in the card industry. They have even run their own successful Kickstarter campaigns. We also padded in an extra few weeks just to make sure we would meet our deadline.\n\nI will post regular updates, so you can keep track of every stage of Mighty Heroic Minis and see it come to life.\n\nOnce again, thanks for all the support Kickstarter!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Sky Lords - Premium Playing Cards is now LIVE", "update_content": "Yesterday we re-launched our Overlords deck as SKY LORDS - Premium Playing Cards with an all new lower pricing.  \nIt took us a bit longer than expected to launch it, but because of this, we were able to negotiate better prices for both USA and International to such awesome levels.

I started the design over 1 year ago, and I have continuously improved on since I wanted to make an elegant and intriguing version.\nBEFORE-AFTER, SPOT THE DIFFERENCES :)\nIn this case the face of the Queen Of Spades has been modified\nAbout the production: The deck will be printed by Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC) with classic finish. The goal for this deck is a little high because the deck is full of features and the production costs are very high (twice a normal deck). I need to produce at least 2000 units to keep the production costs affordable.\nAbout me: Requiem Team is just me, one-man-band. My name is Lorenzo, I live and work in Stockholm, Sweden. Designing and illustrating playing cards is my passion and this is my 4th Kickstarter campaign; the previous three have been funded and fulfilled, just take a look at Requiem, Heretic and No17. I hope you like No.17 Le Chat Rouge and that you want to support it by backing and sharing. Thank you for being here! :)\nIn every campaign I run, I give gifts to the backers ;) but there are a few rules about those.\nFirst of all, the gifts are not add-ons. Only the copper coin and the uncut tuck-box sheet, and the normal decks can be added on top of your pledge.\nThe gifts are automatically assigned during the shipping process. If the guys at the fulfillment center pack one deck, they will put the gift for one deck. If they pack 2 decks, they will put the gifts for 2 decks, etc etc.\ngifts overview\nHere is how it works:\nIf you have one deck, you get one sticker. \nIf you have 2 or 3 decks, you get one sticker and one button pin. \nIf you have 4 decks, you get one sticker, one button, and one magnet with bottle opener. \nIf you have 6 decks, you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, and one half-brick box for your 6 decks. \nIf you have 12 decks (or brick), you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, 2 half-brick boxes for your decks, and one copper coin. \nIf you are in the 17er reward, you get all.\nAll the court cards (J,Q,K) are illustrated and the 4 aces are big and ornate. The pips (2 to 10) are improved, and the jokers are \"jester-cats\". All the cards have an elegant black border. It is easy to play with, readability is very good, and the cards are made with casino quality paper and finishing.\n The back is full-bleed  with red foiled accents.\nphotoshop rendering\nNote: all the graphics are ready and final. Small tweaks and improvements might be made during or after the campaign.\nFor this deck I decided to make a tuck-box without ink, it will be foiled in black and red, embossed, on black paper. More will be unveiled during the campaign, such as the back side and other details.\nback of the tuck, with cutout in the middle, showing the backs of the cards (stretch goal)\nRed Label Limited Edition Deck\nThis deck is NOT AN ADD-ON. You can get it ONLY IF you are in the limited reward (now sold out), or in the reward called \"The 17er\".\nI will produce approx. 110-120 units, it depends by the count at the end of the campaign. It is an exquisite piece for collectors and playing cards lovers.\nHere the specs:\ncards: same as the normal deck \ntuck-box: same die-cut, but completely black. no foil and no embossing \nLaser-cut \u201csleeve\u201d on red metallic paper, that looks like a label. Actually I\u00b4d call it \u201cjacket\u201d, since it is open on the back (see update #3)\ngolden foil under the front\nsignature \nnumbered \nshipped from the US with tracking number \nawesome Carat case included (transparent acrylic case, lid with magnets) \nshipping included. \none per backer \nassembled in Stockholm\nRed Label Prototype in its Carat Case\nStretch goals and Add-ons will be unlocked and unveiled during the campaign. I will send updates to keep you posted about these question marks.\nIt is important that you take a quick look at the updates, and see what's new, and how the deck will improve.\nADD-ON: Copper Coin for 101 SEK\nThis is a 1.5 inch antique copper coin, with epoxy on both sides with reed edge. \nThe price for the coin is 101 SEK (approx. $11.8)\nIf you want one, just add 101 SEK  to your pledge. If you want 2 coins you add 202 SEK, if three coins 303 SEK, etc etc. The coin does not affect your shipping cost.\nphotoshop rendering\nADD-ON: Uncut Tuck-box Sheet for 203 SEK\nThis is a flat tuck-box without cuts and score lines. There will be the 2 foils and the embossing.\nThe price for this one is 203 SEK (approx. $24.5 USD, \u20ac21.5, \u00a316 GBP) shipping included anywhere in the world. It will look more or less like the picture, here the details:\ndimensions: I estimate 13x29.7cm / 5.1x11.8in, but they might be slightly different. \nshipping cost included shipped from Stockholm \nwith signature \nnumbered \nphotoshop rendering\nWhat is an ADD-ON ?\nThere are items called \"add-on\". It simply means that you can add them to your pledge. The add-on is not a reward tier. All you have to do some simple math, push the blue button called \"Manage\", and modify the total amount. Scroll up and find the button next to the cover image.\nHere a couple of examples to make things clear.\nExample for US backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 130 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 130+203 = 333 SEK\nExample for international backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 170 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 170+203 = 373 SEK\nJust mail me if you need help :)\nCustom Box for 6 decks, included!\nThis box is FOR FREE for backers with 6 decks or multiples of 6. This is a self-assembling sturdy box, with magnets, and it will wrapped in protective plastic (with 6 decks inside of course). On the top lid: custom red-foiled graphics as shown in the pictures (photoshop rendering on the real box).\nSince I am based in Stockholm, the campaign is in Swedish Crowns (Kr SEK). The conversion rate to USD  (Euro and British Pounds) in this list is updated every day of the final days. There are fluctuations all the time, about \u00b11.5%. but you can keep track of them here \ncurrency conversion rate updated on November 7th\nYou can follow me and stay up to date on several social media platforms.

I will send the final files at the conclusion of the campaign, but I cannot speed up the production. There is a possibility of earlier delivery, but it all depends on how quickly EPCC completes the production, once I approve all the printing proofs.\n\nPrinting a deck of playing cards is a standard procedure, but errors may occur, you never know, the devil is in the details. But this is my fourth project and I do not foresee any issues. I'll keep my eyes open and follow every single step of the project to make it real, as I did for Requiem Playing Cards, Heretic Playing Cards, and No.17.\n\nBe aware that the colors on the screen will not perfectly match with the colors on printed paper.

Taking this deck as a starting point, I tried to create my own vision of the Underworld. Although a joyful and positive person myself, I had always been attracted to dark themed artwork. I find fascinating how artists throughout the centuries have imagined the world of the dead and how they dealt with the greatest fear of mankind. In Grotesk Macabre I tried to combine the darkest of all themes with the heavy elegance of baroque and the pointy, flamboyant Gothic art.\nPrinted by EPCC\n54 cards\nMaster finish\n2 Editions: Original and Limited\nTuck cases will be printed by me in Greece, all hand numbered and signed.\nOriginal edition tuck case printed with special inks on a matte black stock, foiled and embossed.\nAnimated Edition tuck case  will be printed on a gold stock, foiled and embossed .\nBoth editions' print run will be determined by the demand during KS campaign but the Animated Edition will be NEVER printed again. The Original Edition may be reprinted but the tuck case of any future reprints will be basic and less elaborate in production compared to the KS Original Edition\n>>>>>>>> THE REWARDS WILL BE SENT FROM THE USA <<<<<<<<\n\nUPDATE!\nAll KS backers will get their decks hand numbered and signed (upon request) on the tuck case! The decks sold during KS will be the only ones numbered and signed. The rest of the decks will just have the total number produced written on the tuck case.\nRendering of the tuck cases\n The picture above can hardly give an idea of the finished product as it cannot capture the shine of the gold stock combined with the foil or the surprising contrast between the matte and somewhat textured black stock and the shiny foil.\n From a black background emerges a bizarre world of  spooky creatures that dwell in the darkness...\nAnimated edition QoS\nQueen of Diamonds\nJack of Diamonds\nAce of Diamonds - Original Edition\nKing of Hearts- Original Edition\nAce of Heatrs - Original Edition\nAnimated (Limited) edition deck will have the courts and figures framed in a marble-like intricate border.

I've been designing custom Playing Cards since early 2012. During that time I've always work on my Playing Card designs late at night, hence the moniker of Midnight Cards! After going with a quirky and unorthodox theme for my last project, I wanted to ground my next Deck in the essentials of a high-quality Playing Cards design. I'm proud to present the Grinders Deck!\nThe design of the Grinders Deck is meant to embody the workhorse mentality of a professional Grinder, but also contains elements of grandeur and opulence. (CLICK ON ANY PROJECT IMAGE FOR A HIGHER RES VERSION)\nTUCK BOX:\nThe Grinders' Tuck Box will utilize a Black matte stock. NO inks will be printed on the Tuck. The extremely intricate design elements will be stamped in Copper AND Silver Foil. SHINY!!\nThe Grinders Tuck Box, Cards and Custom Brick Box (see below!) will all be printed by Legends Playing Card Co. This will be my third personal design that will be printed by Legends. They do an amazing job!! The Cards will utilize Legends' awesome Classic Finish. Classic Finish is a softer and slicker paper. It's more comparable to a vintage Bicycle Deck.\n         THE JOKERS:\nThe Jokers for the Grinders Deck focus on a well kept Poker player ready to make his move! I drew the character in a similar hard-edge outlines with rough painted interiors, similar to the Court Cards. The Red Joker has a Queen of Hearts reveal. Which is good for any aspiring Magicians!\nBACK CARD:\nThe Back Card shares a lot of the intricate details from the Tuck Box. Some elements in the Back Card design contain subtle references to the games of Poker and Roulette. Roulette is another game that has it's share of professional Grinders. Plus, Roulette is one of my favorites while visiting a Casino! (CLOSEUP DETAILS BELOW)\nFACE CARDS:\nThe Face Cards are designed with the intention for maximum playability. The Courts Set is from a more classical design than most modern Courts. I have modified them and added plenty of elegant details and handpainted elements to make them unique on their own!\nCUSTOM BRICK BOX:\nEvery TWELVE (12) Deck order will come packed inside a custom Grinders Brick Box. It will have a custom Diecut, including a top panel that folds into a display Header with the circular Logo shape Diecut above the other elements (seen below in the Render with the grey background). The Brick Box printing specs will be exactly the same as the Tuck Box - the same thick Black matte stock, Copper Foil AND Silver Foil! The Grinders Brick Box is NOT available by itself or as a separate Add-On item (it's only available with 12 Deck orders).\n2\" DEALER COIN:\nThe Grinders Coin will be produced by Coins For Anything. The 2-Sided Coin will measure 2\" in diameter, and will have an Antique Copper Finish. Black Enamel will highlight the details on each side, and White Enamel will bring out the Grinders Logotype on the Coin Front. I have designed numerous Coins that CFA has produced. Above is a photo of the prototype Coin!! \nTo add any extra items to your base Pledge Reward, just click on the Blue \"Manage Your Pledge\" Button and change the dollar amount to account for the added item(s).

All U.S. Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Texas, by Gamblers Warehouse. All International Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Hong Kong, by Legends Playing Card Co.\n\nARE THEY LIMITED? - Of course! I have never reprinted any of my personal Decks, and never will. I will only print the quantity of Decks and Brick Boxes needed for Pledge Rewards and off-Kickstarter orders, plus a few hundred extras for a future Midnight Cards online storefront.\n\nWHY ONLY ONE DECK? - My last project, Bowl-A-Rama Playing Cards, turned into a pretty complex assortment of merchandise between two separate Kickstarter campaigns (three separate Decks, Wooden Nickel Sets, handmade Bowling Pins and three Uncut Sheets). So, I chose to keep this project VERY streamlined - one Deck, one Brick Box and one Coin. IF the Grinders project is a big hit, there MAY be a second Deck.\n\nNO STRETCH GOALS? - After running many Kickstarter projects, I've noticed that listing Stretch Goals publicly on the project page sometimes leads to Backer peer pressure to Unlock items that didn't make it. More than once I've added a Stretch Goal or two to a campaign (usually a premium printing extra), even if the funding level didn't reach the Stretch Goal amount listed. It has definitely affected the bottom line in those projects! So, for this campaign I will have a Stretch Goals list of my own, but I will not share them online. They comprise of the usual - Interior Printing, Embossing, second Deck...... If / When the project gets close to a Stretch Goal, I will post a Kickstarter Update to announce that specific Stretch Goal's details.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Randy Butterfield (Midnight Cards)\n14 created \u00b7 232 backed\nI'm a Graphic Artist located in Indianapolis, IN with my wife, Susan and kids Violet and Aaron.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Under 48 HOURS remaining for OCULUS Deck", "update_content": "Hey Everyone,\nJust a quick heads-up to let you all know that the OCULUS project is down to it's last 48 hours.
