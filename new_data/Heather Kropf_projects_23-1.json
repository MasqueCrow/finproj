[{"backer": "Heather Kropf", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hey Friends!\nI'm extremely excited to share that The Burnt Ends, my vintage instrumental country band, have recently recorded our first album, titled Way Out There.\nA few years ago I revisited some of my favorite classic country music from the 1940s-60s through new found vinyl record collections, such as Take Me Home Country Roads and Country & Western Music Jamboree. I fell back in love with the lush 3-part vocal harmonies and wanted to rearrange for horns and rhythm section, trying to breathe some different life into these old songs while paying respect to the original amazing storytellers and outlaws that played them.\nThe musicians that helped me on this quest across the sonic desert happen to be some of my closest friends, and amazing improvising musicians who I've had the pleasure of making music with for over the past 15 years here in New York City. With a common love of this music and juicy BBQ, and hailing from California, Colorado, St. Louis, Texas, Pittsburgh, New York and Germany, I knew everyone would bring a different flavor to this project.\nThis also wouldn't have been possible without the guidance of engineer, percussionist, and brilliant audio brain, Robin MacMillan. He really helped shape this project which could've gone in a million different directions.\nSO, I can't wait to share this music with you all. But I want to do it right. It's already mixed and mastered, and I couldn't be happier with the way it sounds. But the goal of this Kickstarter is to also release it on vinyl. I want that needle to drop on your turntable next to the fireplace with a glass of bourbon in hand while relaxing in grandma's rocking chair with a golden retriever sleeping at your feet.\nPlease check out the video above and if you like what you hear we would be much obliged if you pledged and helped this meaty dream become a reality!\n- Kyle & The Burnt Ends Crew", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt is my priority to get the vinyl copies out as soon as possible.

Thank you for visiting my Kickstarter. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u2019m a singer-songwriter based out of Toronto (though I\u2019m originally from Boston!). I\u2019ve been singing for as long as I can remember, and have been hooked on songwriting since high school. Over the past 4 years, I\u2019ve released a full album (From the Blue) and an EP (Going Gone), and have toured several times throughout Canada and the United States. I\u2019ve also had the honor of being a finalist in both the Canadian Songwriting Competition and the Songwriter Serenade Competition (2017, 2018). Oh and I\u2019ve written a whole bunch of songs!\nAbout the Project:\nThis project will be a 6 song EP exploring vulnerability, self-doubt, love, and the search for home. Some of these songs have been in the works for almost two years, some are brand new. This will be my second release with my amazing crew in Toronto. For our first EP, we took just 3 days in the studio and recorded most of it live off the floor. I\u2019m very proud of that project, but this time around I wanted to take things up a notch.\nI hired a producer, Joel Schwartz, to bring this project to a new level, and I\u2019ve been floored with what we\u2019ve created. Over the past 6 months, Joel and I have been working to edit, refine, and arrange these songs. At this point, we\u2019ve finished pre-production and rehearsals, and are tracking in the studio as we speak!! I\u2019ve learned a lot through this process, and it\u2019s been SO MUCH fun. And the bonus is that I think we have created something really special.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI believe in these songs, and I REALLY want to give them a fair chance to be heard out in the world. Unfortunately, in this day and age, it\u2019s almost impossible to get your music heard as an unsigned artist without a whole lot of money to pay for a PR campaign and radio/digital promoters. Funds from this Kickstarter will help make that happen. With a PR team, we\u2019ll launch a publicity campaign to really get the word out and reach new listeners! I\u2019ll also hire digital and radio promoters who will pitch these songs to folk radio stations and Spotify playlists.\nBudget:\nThere are so many costs involved in creating and releasing music independently. The band and I recorded at Soleil Sound in mid-October, and will be working on post production through November. So we are well on our way to having a finished product!\nThe funds collected in this campaign will be put towards:\nMixing and Mastering- $3000. \nCD Manufacturing- $1000. This includes album artwork and CD duplication. \nPromotion- $3000. Promotion of the EP with a PR team so that lots of people can hear it!!\nTotal: $7000\nStretch Goal- $1000 for a live music video of NYC to help with promotion of the EP, bringing the total to $8000. \nThank You\nI am so excited that this collection of songs will soon be finished, and it means the world to me that you have visited this page and considered supporting this project. If you are unable to contribute financially, I would love your help in spreading the word. If you know anyone that you think would connect with my music, I would love it if you sent them my way!\nIf you would like to stay updated on future releases, tours, join my mailing list, or check out more music, feel free to visit my website at https://www.lindsayfoote.com/.\nOk, I think that\u2019s it! Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for supporting us independent musicians. It allows us to keep doing what we love everyday, and I am so grateful.\nLove,\nLindsay\nPart of the crew after our second day in the studio!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have budgeted out this project to the best of my ability, there is a chance recording will take longer than expected, and offset the budget I had originally planned on.

My inclination is to record another single or EP, completely different from this album, with the sole intention of giving this music to you all. There are a couple songs that come to mind that many of you have asked me to record (like \"Pour Over Me\").\nWhere Will The Money Go: Small national radio promotion campaign (which costs 1,500)\nHey there, my name is Sarah Eide (pronounced Ay-Duh).\nI\u2019m a pianist, composer and singer-songwriter, and I\u2019m looking for your help in releasing my first fully produced full length album, \u201cDreams on Hold\u201d.\nI\u2019ve been playing and writing music for as long as I can remember, and for just as long I\u2019ve felt this deep sense of purpose as an artist and creator.  \nIt\u2019s a hard thing to admit publicly, but it\u2019s been a calling, and I\u2019ve never abandoned it. My purpose and mission as an artist has been simply to create music that positively impacts others. Along with that sense of purpose, I\u2019ve always worked towards creating art that fulfills three things:\nThat it\u2019s beautiful and proficient \nThat it possesses a vulnerable quality\nThat it\u2019s driven by a vision \nAll my favorite albums are like that, and I believe I\u2019ve achieved that with this album.\n\u201cDreams on Hold\u201d is about the conflict between what we are working towards and life\u2019s twists and turns.\nIt\u2019s about those moments when you feel like you're at tug of war between your aspirations and life\u2019s priorities. Those moments when you're not sure if the sacrifices your making are making any difference. But also those moments when you look back and realize that the unexpected twists and turns ended up offering more joy then you could have ever imagined for yourself. \nIn short, I\u2019ve made an album the I believe is vulnerable and moving.\nThe sonic landscape of this album is heavily influenced by American roots music.\nEverything from Appalachian folk to New Orleans jazz, and bluegrass to gospel. This is the music that\u2019s been inspiring me for the past few years, and for me, this is the kind of music that is most like an unfiltered expression of everyday life in its spontaneity and warmth. \nThe team I've pulled together is truly amazing. \nThis album sounds AMAZING, and so much of that is due to the incredible group of Chicago based musicians I\u2019ve been able to work with, all of whom have their own amazing projects.\nWhile I\u2019m the songwriter and producer of this album, every song on this record has been a collaboration with each of these talented folk,  who\u2019ve all (generously) left their unique mark. \nSo much is ALSO due to the fantastic, professional, meticulous, perhaps OBSESSIVE engineers I've had the pleasure to work with (Anthony Gravino, Yuri Lysoivanov and Victoria  Salazar) and the studios I was lucky enough to record in (Transient Sound, Chicago Recording Company, Electric Audio and Flashpoint Chicago). \nAnd by the way, back in January of this year I released the first single off this album, \"Shadow\" (a 2017 Great American Song Contest Finalist)! \nThe album is done, but here comes the scary part...\nI\u2019ve invested a WHOLE BUNCH to get this far...money, time, blood, sweat and all the tears! But now it's time to put it out to the world. As you probably know, I\u2019m an indie artist and currently, I wear all the hats. I really believe in this album and the impact it can make, and I need help and support. The reality is, there are still a number of things to do to give this album a proper release, and they aren\u2019t free :)\nThe successful completion of this Kickstarter campaign will allow me to:\ncreate music videos for TWO songs on the album\ndevelop promotional material (professional photos, press release, etc)\nget some basic PR (guerrilla style PR!)\nAnything PAST my goal, means I\u2019ll be able to promote this album even MORE, for example tour with a band after the album is released, pay for a proper radio campaign, make more video content... \nIn short: more funding \u2192 better marketing \u2192 bigger impact \nSo I would LOVE for you to join me in allowing this album to make the biggest impact possible. \nFor any pledge amount over $5 you get a NEW single from the album within 48 hours  and a handwritten thank you note from me <3\nFor any pledge amount over $15 you get a digital copy of the album by February, which is months before the official release (May 2019)!  And for $25 and over you get a physical copy of the album sent to you by snail mail in April.\nI\u2019m also offering a bunch of extras, which you can see in the rewards section, like t-shirts or totes, tickets to a show of your choice, a holiday bundle full of super nice handcrafted items, house shows, songwriting session, and more! And if you don't see a reward you are hoping for, please email me and lets figure something out! \nAnd by the way, any pledge amount will allow you to get updates and follow the journey of the album. The way I see it, ALL my backers are on my team!\nWant to help in other ways?\nPlease help me get the word out! Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, so time is of the essence! Spread the word, share this with your friends and family, share this on social media. Word of mouth is the most powerful thing, and your eagerness to share this project with others and encourage them to help me make the goal is EXTREMELY meaningful and deeply appreciated :)\nThank you, your support means the world to me. \nI value you and the time you've given simply to read this and consider helping. It sincerely means the world to me. \nI can\u2019t wait to see how the journey of this album unfolds and I can\u2019t wait to share that experience with all of you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS:\n\u25c9 As you know, the album is recorded, mixed and mastered.

I've got special bonus rewards that everyone will get, if we keep going:\nIF WE REACH $10,000 I\u2019ll write and home demo a brand new song, that everyone who\u2019s backed the project will receive, exclusively.

You get to vote on which cover songs I record, from a list I\u2019ll provide.\nI've even got a few more incentives in mind if somehow we surpass those goals (which would be INSANE AND ALSO AWESOME). \nAll the fun details below!\nSince the release of my 2015 record, The Simple Fear, I\u2019ve been quite busy. I started focusing on writing this record in the fall of 2016. I sat down with the song ideas that I\u2019d had over the last year and found new ideas hiding out somewhere in my heart and mind. I always think that no more songs will exist in me, but somehow they do. I\u2019m grateful for that. I\u2019ve always said that making music is my passion in life, and there\u2019s nothing better than working really hard on little pieces of songs and watching them turn into an entire record that\u2019s ready to share.\nRECORDING: \nSAM KASSIRER // GREAT NORTH SOUND SOCIETY\nI met producer Sam Kassirer in the fall of 2016, and we really hit it off. I\u2019d been a fan of Sam for a while mostly via his work with Josh Ritter and Lake Street Dive (to name a few). We got together to work on two songs in the winter of 2017. It went really well and we decided to make an entire record together. Throughout the summer of 2017 we worked on 9 more songs at his remote studio, Great North Sound Society, in Parsonsfield, Maine. We invited some great musicians (and Sam's dog Lucy) to join us. After a lot of hard work (and a lot of fun times) we ended up with a full length record of 11 songs and it\u2019s ALMOST ready to release. \nClockwise from upper left: Sam Kassirer (The Producer of the Record!) // Lucy The Dog // The Studio! Great North Sound Society // Cristobal (Cello) & Jenna (Violin)\n  Clockwise from upper left: Zachariah Hickman (Bass) // Me // Sean Trischka (Drums) & Ariel Bernstein (Engineering + Drums) // Josh Kaufman (Additional Guitars)\nINVESTMENT + NEED\nI've already invested some of (ok, I'll be honest MOST of) my personal savings into making this record, and I could use your help to take it over the finish line. As some of you may know, this is not my first record or my first crowdfunded project. The challenges of making a record come with the territory. For me, the biggest reward and the energy that keeps me inspired comes from playing my songs for you. With this next record I hope to tour more extensively (across the USA and beyond) and share it with as many new ears as I can reach. \nMy goal is set at $7,500, which helps cover my basic remaining costs. It's just enough to get the record finished. Your support will help fund: final producer fees, mixing, mastering, manufacturing costs, and promotional costs.\nBUT IF WE REACH THAT GOAL... THERE'S MORE. If we're able to reach $7.5k and keep going I've got special bonus rewards that everyone will get. \nIF WE REACH $10,000 I\u2019ll write and home demo a brand new song, that everyone who\u2019s backed the project will receive, exclusively.\nIF WE REACH $15,000 I\u2019ll also record a 3 song EP of acoustic versions of my songs, new or old.

Here are some of the items I\u2019m really excited about in the packages\u2026\nHollowood Music Listening Party - I\u2019ll play the record, before it's released, at a special listening party at my family\u2019s music store in my hometown, Pittsburgh, PA!

(More info in the \"Point of View\" Pack)\nAlbum Influences Spotify Playlist - Throughout the recording process, I made playlists that inspired and influenced the making of my record. Everyone who backs the project will get access to a Spotify playlist of album influences along with a guide to exactly what it was about each song inspired me.\nGlow T-Shirt - New Design inspired by my new song \"Glow\" - a song that is so much fun, I decided to throw glow sticks into that package. \nVinyl! - I'm so excited to offer vinyl this time around!\nVHS Video Tape - 4 live solo electric studio performances of brand new songs on a VHS tape (yes, i'm serious, VHS) (Only 4 of these available, More info in the Throwback pack!)\nPrivate Virtual Concerts - I'll play you and your friends/family a private Skype concert where you pick the songs!

It was right around my birthday in 2016. The stage fright that started after my mom passed away had only been getting worse; I was ready to hang up my hat and take a break.  My first live show was in 1996 and I'd been touring or performing in some capacity since then.  \nI made my set list and played the songs I would play if it was my last show. It was an awesome night. I relaxed. I breathed into it. I let go.  \nWhich brings me to now.  \nThe news can be dire. There seems to be trouble afoot everywhere I look. But now is not the time to surrender to the grief. To hopelessness. To doubt. Now, more than ever, artists are needed to rise up and do their part to bring comfort, passion, love, a voice of the resistance, rage, hope and even despair.  \nDaniel Marcus and I took THE set list from THAT snowy Pittsburgh night and set to work. We hunkered down in his studio late at night after his daughter was asleep and before his new baby was born.\nWe worked with several trusted musicians and friends who respected our vision and helped me get the sound I envisioned.\nIt's almost done. I saved up and paid for it up to this point, but I hope you'll join me in paying the folks who are helping me finish this album.  \nThese are my \"I don't want to quit music without playing these songs live one more time\" songs. This album made me fall in love with art all over again. I hope they'll make you happy (and sad and mad and hopeful) too. Thank you for being part of this project.  \n This goal includes payment for production of the CD (aka: paying Dan for all of his hard work), mastering with Maria Rice, CD artwork (I am making a very limited number of physical copies - pre-ordering here is your best chance of getting one), and fees for Kickstarter.  \nStretch Goals - \nI will break even with the $10,600 goal, meaning all the other artists and the co-producer and the masterer will be paid.\nMARKETING/PROMOTION: I'd love to hire a professional who can help me promote this album for radio and film work. I estimate an additional $3000 for this.\nPAYING MYSELF: It's funny... I feel weird asking to get paid. I can't exactly count the hours I have spent working to create these songs, because they are part of the fabric of my life. I'd love to be able to pay myself for my work on this project. And I'll take anything beyond the $13,600 mark as payment for myself. (PS - this is Frances. Hi everyone! I am very excited about this FREAKIN' AWESOME album, and Judith deserves equal pay for equal work! Woot! Show some green!)\nOh.

Pre-order it through this campaign to help me get my music & message out into the world!\nPLAY\n\n Stretch Goal #1: $15,000 - Radio Promotion, particularly for internet radio and streaming services like Spotify & Pandora, is one of the biggest ways that indie artists get huge exposure. Landing a spot on a playlist is a primary goal of mine that would place my music and message in front of a worldwide audience!\nStretch Goal #2: $20,000 - Tour + press and booking - Tour press is essential for getting the word out about shows in places where I\u2019ve never played. Music connects us, and it\u2019s even more powerful in live performance. My soul speaks directly to your soul, and I can assure you that your soul speaks back to mine. :) \nStretch Goal #3: $30,000 - International Tour in 2018 - In this day and age, we live in a truly global community. Hand-in-hand with streaming, international touring opens up the opportunity to engage new audiences and can be a meaningful contributor to growing my fanbase.\nPhoto by Bryce Johnson, from the \"Slow The Devil\" music video shoot\nThe Story\nI started writing songs for this new album over a year ago but the story, the REAL STORY, begins not with a song, but with a conversation... \nSeveral months ago, I posted this on my blog:\n\"One morning, I woke up with a song in my head. \u2018Slow The Devil\u2019 was a gift from the songwriting gods and the closest thing I\u2019ve ever written to a protest song. I realized that the music was helping me through these dark times of uncertainty and disconnect.\u201d \nShortly after publishing that blog post, I learned that one of my friends, a key member of my creative team with whom I've enjoyed working for years and for whom I have massive amounts of respect and trust, was on the opposite side of the political spectrum from me. I had to ask myself some hard questions. I\u2019ve declared that my goal is to help create Unity, but will my song only create further divisiveness? As an artist, I refuse to compromise, but is there a bigger and more important message here? \nSo, I did something I\u2019d been dreading \u2013 I spoke with my friend, and despite my trepidation, we had a great conversation! One thing he said particularly resonated with me: \u201cWe may have voted differently, but at the heart of everything, we are more alike than we are different.\u201d When I thought about the way he and I live our lives, and the interests we share, I knew he was right.\nWe can have causes we stand for and opinions we hold dear, but that one crucial conversation with my friend reminded me how much we need to LISTEN to one another. What we really need is understanding: finding common ground through conversation.\nMy last album was about loving what makes you different. In the past two years that conversation has evolved and deepened. Slow The Devil is a call for Unity & Connection, through not only loving what makes you different, but loving what makes others different as well. \u2018Unity\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean we should all be the same. Unity is about celebrating diversity! Each of us is a unique blend of biological inheritance and personal experience, yet as my friend said, \u201cAt the heart of everything, we are more alike than we are different.\u201d\nMake Your Pledge Today \nHow do the rewards work, you ask? Check this out\u2026. \nI\u2019m beyond excited to announce that I will also be releasing this record to Limited Edition Vinyl! You can order just the vinyl package, or if you\u2019d like one of the higher level rewards, simply select that reward and add an additional $15 (for Domestic U.S.) or $25 (for International) to your pledge at checkout for the upgrade to vinyl. Please note that there is a longer turnaround time for vinyl than for CDs, but I promise it will be worth the wait!\n **FOR INTERNATIONAL ORDERS* the vinyl upgrade is $25 to include shipping costs.\nEvery order over $100 comes in the \"Slow The Devil\" tote bag!\nThe Music\n\"Robyn is a true artist who forever continues to grow into the hearts of her fans. Her upcoming recordings will connect with you at a deep and honest level. She will give you more than you can imagine.\"\n- Brad Chapman, Multi-Platinum Vocal Producer\nI knew it was going to take a gifted and adventurous producer to fully bring this music to life. Blending electronic and organic instrumentation, producer Caleb Loveless crafted tracks that range from beautifully intimate to majestically epic. The album is a journey, beginning with the call to arms of \u201cSlow The Devil,\u201d through the battle cries of \u201cThis Means War,\u201d the emotional aftermath of \u201cFallout,\u201d and bringing us back together in the healing harmonies of \u201cBit By Bit.\u201d \nPRODUCER: Caleb Loveless AKA COAV - Has written and produced songs that have been streamed millions of times around the world and used by major brands such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Vevo, MTV, and E! Network. Also, the most wonderful person to work with, and I just can't say enough good things about him!\nVOCAL PRE-PRODUCTION: Brad Chapman - Los Angeles-based celebrity vocal coach, specializing in capturing authenticity and emotion in vocal recordings. He has been awarded 23 RIAA Platinum Records and 45 Platinum Records worldwide.\nMIXING: Brenden Bytheway - half of the duo Scott & Brendo, his songs and mixes have been featured in some of the most viral videos on YouTube and heard by over 1 billion people. \nMASTERING: Elysian Masters - They\u2019ve mastered records by legendary artists, including M83, Rodriguez, Fitz & the Tantrums, Bob Marley & The Wailers, Isaac Hayes, and Paramore. \nThis album also features an All-Star cast of collaborators and contributors: \nSTOLAR - NYC based Singer/Songwriter and co-writer of several songs on the album. Brilliant, brilliant songwriter.\nCallie Crofts - Billboard charting singer/songwriter, YouTuber, and frontwoman of My Fair Fiend. Callie lends gorgeous layered harmonies to many of the songs on the album.\nZac Bryant - Drummer for a whole slew of notable projects, including My Fair Fiend, Reflektor, GirafficJam, Callie Crofts (oh yeah, they\u2019re engaged!) and the Crofts Family Christmas. \nAlyse Black - Singer/Songwriter, she's performed on NPR, recorded a commercial for Target, and is the winner of Billboard's Annual Songwriting Contest. Alyse and I wrote \"Bit By Bit\" on the first day we met!\nCari Cole Voice & Music and The Artist Success Circle - Mastermind group headed by my music business mentor, Cari Cole, who also just happens to be a celebrity vocal coach. Over the past several years, Cari's mentorship has changed my career and my life for the better, in so many ways. \nCarla Boecklin Photography\nThe Visuals \nCarla Boecklin Photography - Genius photographers Carla Boecklin and her husband and business partner Vita Krompl are two of my favorite people. I show up with chainmail, a faux Wolfskin, a feather boa, a sheer cloth, and metal armor, and Carla shows up with an industrial fan. The result? Wild, crazy gorgeousness. \nBryce Johnson Visuals - It\u2019s a good thing that Bryce is as adventurous as I am (if not more so!) because every shoot we do together involves some kind of insanity. Like climbing up a rope on an icy cliffside to get to a frozen waterfall in a cave. Or dragging an antique piano AND a 300 lb cast-iron tub into the desert. Or lighting a piano on fire. No matter what crazy idea I come up with, Bryce always turns it into pure visual magic. \nDevore Artistry - Amy Devore is the hair & makeup artist behind every single one of my music videos and photo shoots. Seriously, I hardly dare step in front of a camera without having Amy there to bring out my inner rock star. :) \nCCXA - Delaney Gibson possesses some kind of crazy psychic intuition. She has an uncanny ability to read the vibe of an artist and create visuals and branding concepts that are SO PERFECT for that artist. OH, and she\u2019s also an amazing singer-songwriter with upcoming releases from her band SIGNY. Delaney created the merch designs and logos for this campaign and also helped with creative consulting.\nSlow The Devil glassware, the Unisex Tee, and the Ladies Tank Top\nThe Money \nIn order to make the most of the opportunities I receive and create, I must put out the best, highest quality product possible. The team I\u2019ve recruited to make this album are at the top of their game, and I am so thankful that they\u2019ve agreed to help me bring this music to life. Producing a broadcast quality record and premium content is a huge investment, but it\u2019s absolutely worth it to realize the full potential of this project.\nNow the only thing missing is you.\nYour support will enable us to finish recording the last few songs, and have the album mixed and mastered. Our goal of $10,000 is just enough to get the album released into the world and supported by a basic promotional campaign.\nBonus: Since over half the songs are already finished and ready to go, you\u2019ll have the full album in your hands (or on your phone) before the end of 2017!\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of where the money will go if the project is successfully funded: \nThe funds that go to PR, radio promotion, making videos, and spreading the word are a vital part of the plan. Your pledge of support is the first step, but there is so much more you can do to help beyond your donation. Please share this project with your friends, on social media, with anyone who might enjoy my music. Word of mouth is incredibly powerful. Together, we\u2019ve got a good shot of getting this record noticed. \nAlright, LET'S DO THIS!! \nThank you from the bottom of my heart for your support, and as always, love wastefully, for love is never wasted. \nxoxo, \nRobyn \nFrom my desert songwriting sabbatical\n\"A captivating storyteller!\" - Music Connection Magazine\nPhoto by Carla Boecklin Photography\n\u201cEthereal, seductive and haunting\u2026Like her idols, Sarah McLachlan, Tori Amos and Fiona Apple, Cage's music possesses the same bold, raw edge.\u201d - Ruidoso News\nPhoto by Carla Boecklin Photography\n\u201cBrilliant, piano-led character study and cautionary tales of mismatched desire.

See below image.\n              ___________________________________________________________\n Hi, my name is Joy Ike. Chances are that if you're reading this, you know me in some capacity - maybe you've come to a few shows over the years, follow me on social media, or maybe you came across a few videos, downloaded a few songs, and have been following from a distance.\nWhoever you are, thanks for visiting this page, watching the above video, and reading this! \nI've been trying to figure out how best to share my vision for this next project without feeling the pressure of trying to 'convince' you into giving me your money. I prefer 'excite' :) Admittedly there's a lot of pressure with these things. But I guess here's what I want to say... \nTHE MAIN THING\nMusic is an odd thing. It's one of the few things that we can't physically touch, but it affects us more deeply than anything else. Kind of like love. This is why I will always argue that every song is in some way a love song - maybe to a person, maybe to God, maybe to something else. \n9 years ago I quit my job to make music more seriously. I had NO IDEA what i was doing. But I felt absolutely compelled to do it. This is why I know I am still here...making music. \n That compelling feeling that got me started is still just as strong and alive in my heart right now. \nThere has never been a moment when I didn't expect a song (didn't have to be mine) to soften someone's demeanor, pacify a tense situation, give a mother permission to mourn, comfort in times of loneliness, and empower a weak spirit. This intangible thing somehow magically moves mountains and can wreck a persons life in every possible good way! \n And it's why i make music. \nTHE ALBUM \nThis album is different... Each time I think of how to describe it, \"raw\" is the only word that hits the nail on the head. The theme is big and bold and the songs are lush and vibrant. Very rhythm-heavy and full of movement. \nThis is the first album that has nothing to do with me! Instead, this batch of songs, written over the past 3 years, explores the affect our personal relationships have on us and how that in turn alters, enhances, and influences how we move through the world, respond to injustice, and love our neighbor. It's a political album that has nothing to do with politics! And it's a completely different sound! One I can't wait to share with you all!!! \nTHE GOAL \nThe goal is big! I am raising $15,000 to fund the production, mixing, mastering, hiring musicians, album design, and duplication. There is alot going into this to make this album the best it can be, give these songs their best opportunity, and create something that will tell the story of an age. \nKickstarter is All or Nothing! So if I don't reach the total goal, it means I don't get to keep any of the donated amount.\nTHE HOPE \nWhen people hear my music, I want them to feel at home in it - to sit in it, rest in it, and feel known...understood. But lately I've especially been wanting to light things on fire...figuratively speaking, of course! I want listeners to get a little fire in their bones. These songs are like a piece of newspaper in a stack of wood - starting the flame that makes the whole thing burn. They exist to rumble and inspire. I've nicknamed many of them \"kickboxing\" songs because i want the music to empower listeners and give them their second wind. I want you to be a part of this project b/c these songs are for you! They always have been! \nWith love,\nJoy\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project WILL be completed! However, my projected fall completion date is depending on how well everything comes together in the studio, if we are able to finish tracking, mixing, mastering, artwork, duplication, and publicity according to the timeline I've mapped out. \n\nI promised you will be the first to hear the music before everyone else. Some rewards may take longer. For example, if you pick a house concert level we will need to coordinate that based on when i will be in your city. If you choose a custom- made song, those will take time to create. Hurrying them would cheapen the final product.

Rewards will be in your hands in the first week of December - just in time for the holiday season!\nAbout Me and My Journey:\nThis line of work began in the dust and decay. While researching cancer at the Universit\u00e4t Potsdam in Germany, I began taking photos of the local abandoned train stations and factories. I loved it, and expanded my travels to neighboring Belgium, Italy, and Poland to capture decaying castles and palaces. Vaulted ceilings and chandeliers spoke to an opulent past; layers of paint and wallpaper marked chapters in the buildings\u2019 history; a piano stood tuned to the passing of time. What stories were resting here!\nBeelitz, Germany\nAmong the many reflections promoted by such spaces is the idea that our buildings, our stories, will too fade, to be replaced with new buildings and stories. I began exploring and developing these ideas through photography. My first exhibition, \"The Gilded and The Faded\", juxtaposed vitality and creation with abandonment and destruction. However, the more time I spent pursuing this concept, the more I realized this was a false dichotomy. Because creation and destruction necessarily and unequivocally lead to the other, they shouldn\u2019t be considered separate or isolated; they are a cycle, and two halves of the same whole. Each contains the seed for the other. And so the concept for \"Ozymandias\" was born.\nItaly\nI happened to meet a girl during a research program at MIT AMGEN that summer who convinced me to take the next year off from school with her. Our subsequent travels, again structured around international research at Cambridge University and the University of Melbourne, provided much of the material for the book. Brianna has been an unending source of inspiration ever since, and has been indispensable in the creation of this book.\nLuke and Brianna\nThe Book as an Object:\nThe hardcover, approximately 10x12 inch coffee-table-style-book will feature over 100 pages of photographs, and materials will be of the highest quality. I have years of experience printing archival, museum quality photographs and will be working with an experienced book printer who specializes in photography books. I have no doubt the book will be a work of art in and of itself.\nPotsdam, Germany\n  Rewards:\nRisks and Challenges:\nThe book is ready to be printed \u2013 I have completed the design and layout, so the main obstacle to overcome is the funding - I will need your help to get there! Kickstarter campaigns rely heavily on word-of-mouth, so even if you can't help financially, sharing this project with your friends and family or on social media will make a huge difference!\nI am giving everything I've got to this project and promise to keep this level of attention until the book is printed and in your hands. While the company I am working with to produce the book is US based, the physical printing process takes place in China. This is where the majority of books that are printed in large quantities are produced. After speaking with others who have completed similar projects, the main foreseeable issue is a delay in overseas shipping due to random custom inspections, and this is rare. I will give you updates on the status of the books and will notify you at once if any delays are expected.\nAbout this Campaign:\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the main thing you need to know is that funding is all or nothing \u2013 if I don\u2019t make my funding goal by the deadline, you keep 100% of your pledge, no rewards will be sent, and the book isn\u2019t published.

Should this Kickstarter campaign be successful, it will fund my 8th studio album (likely) entitled \"Ballads\",  a weaving of American roots music; my first album of cover songs. I can honestly say I've been wanting to make this album my whole career.  There will be jazz ballads next to traditional songs and swing and blues - it's all roots music. I will self-produce live recording sessions featuring some of the greatest musicians in the music business today, paying tribute to some of our beloved masters of yesterday (Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole, Johnny Cash, Nina Simone, John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Bobbie Gentry to name a few.) I need your help to fund live recording sessions in a professional studio, accommodating brilliant musicians and their instruments coming from various parts of America (Dennis Crouch from Nashville, TN - Chris Bruce and Jay Bellerose from Los Angeles, for instance), mixing and mastering sessions to complete the audio.  Also the cost of art design, production of CDs, vinyl and T shirts will be covered by this campaign. \nStretch Goal:  Any additional money above the goal of $60K will allow me to further the project with a video and needed publicity. I sincerely hope to make a gorgeous album of standards for the world to hear, but the world will need to know. Publicity and marketing is very costly.  I ask you to be part of my team and join me in this dream to manifest my own album of covers (instead of singing on everyone else's albums - or being told what to do by a record company!)  Thank you profoundly for your support.  Love, Paula.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRESPONSIBILITY:\nI am a veteran of the music business, hard-working and responsible with my supporters' contributions. I do not take this project lightly - I will absolutely do my best to make a lasting work of art in an economical fashion.

Honestly, the challenge is in the ask, and the hope the campaign is successful. Thank you everyone.\n\nRELEASE: \nI anticipate the release of Ballads to be early 2017, TBC, regular announcements through my social media. \n\nTOUR:\nI will continue to tour steadily and come 2017, focus the songs of Ballads more prominently in my set.\n\nPLEDGE DETAILS:\nIf you are a very generous donor, then our studio visit/coffee/lunch/Skype chat/concert etc. will be arranged in advance for a mutually agreeable date, time, place. Concert additional costs must be covered by you (flights - unless we are able to book within an existing tour leg, accommodations, backline gear for the concert.) Studio visit time will likely fall toward the end of 2016. Shipping charges for all items are paid by you.\n\nSOME DETAILS ESCAPE, I'M SURE:\nCD and vinyl packets were weighed and priced at the US post office, so I was able to accurately determine cost to ship these packages within the US, but cost varies state to state. Hence, I am giving you a middle compromise of cost to ship within the US. For international shipping, I simply doubled the US cost to ship. I believe this will be very fair to you, especially those of you in Asia. As I don't know in advance who my international customers will be, nor from which country you call home, I am doing my best with estimates and appreciate your patience and understanding in these details. \nIf there are questions or issues, I will try to be in touch promptly.\n\nYOU, THANK YOU:\nNot only are you a source of joy to me, you are the oxygen feeding the flames.

We will be performing in San Francisco at the FURY Factory Festival of Ensemble and Devised Theater 2016, as part of their Raw Materials series. This is an opportunity to perform and engage with the audience about our 20-minute, work-in-progress performance (which will eventually develop into a full 75-90 minute production). We need your help to kickstart our funding for travel, material costs, and stipends.\n\nFor Those Who Cannot Fly is about all that holds us in, keeps us out, contains and restrains. Over the past three years, we have been researching lines and walls: borders between countries (and states), prison walls, racist redlining, train tracks, and other lines/walls that divide space that used to be whole. As part of that research, we have also been visiting these places, collecting observations, stories, and our own responses. Now we are in the process of funneling our research and experiences into a performance exploring how a line or wall impacts the environment, people, and cultures it divides or interrupts. What changes when walls appear? How does a wall affect a life\u2019s trajectory? Who/what is allowed to \u201ccross\u201d a line or wall, and who/what isn\u2019t?\n\nWe have had very visceral feelings as we visit and cross walls and lines. Those visceral feelings are what we want to bring to audiences: The presence of a large wall. A barrier where there wasn\u2019t one. A line that can\u2019t be crossed. Our proximity to or distance from each other. Restricted movement. Things we can see or hear through walls, but not touch. The way touch changes if it's across a wall.\n\nOur dream is to develop this show through our work at FURY Factory, then expand and take it on the road, encouraging community dialogue about the effects of borders, barriers, and walls.\n                    For Those Who Cannot Fly is created by\n\nMichelle Milne & Heidi Carlsen: Creator/Performers\nJerry Peters: Lighting Design and Tech Director \nJenifer Alonzo: Dramaturg / Structure Detective  \nNiels Carlsen: Set Realization\nAlison Brookins: Fundraising\nKeith Hiebner: Kickstarter Video", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter rehearsing at a distance, we are now looking forward to working together in the same space. This introduces new challenges: How to weave together work we have made separately, and how to do so in a highly compressed time frame. We will need to communicate clearly, throw ourselves into creative risks, and make decisions quickly. We have done this before, and are ready to do so again!\n\nWe also recognize that as white US citizens, our interactions with walls, borders, and barriers are different from a Guatemalan or Mexican family wanting to come to the US, for example. We also haven\u2019t personally been incarcerated, so our perspective on being constrained to one side of a wall is based on the experience of visiting - and at the end of that visit, being forced to leave, rather than forced to stay. \n\nWe have listened to and shared experiences with people who have spent time on the \u201cother\u201d side of these walls and borders - and we recognize that these barriers and lines affect our own freedom as well as theirs. We acknowledge the ways in which systems hurt, limit, and affect us all - and how meeting at, and crossing, walls and borders (if we have that privilege) can be life-changing and life-giving. \n\nOur hope is that this performance brings the feelings of that experience to more people, sparking dialogue across various walls in our world, and inspiring more people to cross divisive lines and connect along borders in their own neighborhoods, countries, and lives.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "The Last Stretch", "update_content": "Generous donations have continued to come in, for which we are so grateful!\n\nWe have a little less than 24 more hours before our campaign ends (and our show opens!), and we are happy to continue taking donations until then.

This will be sent as a bonus CD if you give $25 or more, otherwise you will receive it as a free download. Sweet ;).\nTHE WHY\nI have released three solo albums and toured across the U.S.A., Canada and Mexico. Though I'm proud of my previous releases, they were recorded in humble circumstances and do not have the sound quality needed to stand alongside my peers in the musical world. Now that I've begun to find a real audience, it's time for me throw my hat in the ring with a full-fledged professional recording.\nBACKGROUND\nI spent many years studying jazz, classical, and flamenco, all the while playing in rock bands, but I never found what I looking for in any of those worlds. It was only after moving to Oaxaca, Mexico, that I wrote my first solo guitar piece, for a friend who asked me to play music at her wedding. Since then, I've been dedicated to writing original guitar music that incorporates all of my different experiences with inspiration from music all over the world.\nON TIME\nThe album will be titled \"On Time\". Even though it has taken me many years to figure out my musical direction, none of my experiences have been wasted. Though it's tempting to envy prodigies and other people who figure out their direction early in their lives, I know that the big step I'm making with this project is arriving neither too early nor too late, but just at the right time. \nThe songs that I've written all have a highly rhythmic element, with influences from African, Latin and electronic music. The groove is paramount. I'll be making a solo guitar record that you can dance to!\nTHE LOOK\nTo accompany the music, I'll be making a complete package that will be a joy to hold in your hands. I've been working with a wonderful artist, Samantha Stooke, to design artwork for the cover, disc and inside pages, and I'm thrilled with how it's turning out. It perfectly matches what I'm trying to convey in these songs.\nTHE WHERE\nAudible Images\nI plan to record at Audible Images, a beautiful studio outside of Pittsburgh, which has hosted the likes of Dave Matthews, Airto Moreira, Marcus Miller, and the Ten Tenors, and has won Grammys along the way. I've met with the staff to discuss my project, and I'm thrilled that they will be working with me to produce the best album possible.\nTHE NEED\nIt ain't cheap to do this.\nI'm budgeting $5000 to complete this project. Studio time and staff will be the largest expense. In addition, there will be costs for mastering, instrument setup, artwork, photography, printing, and CD production. If I raise more money than budgeted for the recording, it will go towards promoting the album to press and radio, website costs, and tour support.\nWHERE YOU COME IN\nI can't do a project of this magnitude by myself, so I'm asking you to join me. There are lots of really fun rewards to honor your contribution - now's your chance to ask me to cover a song for you, and I can't say no! - and every contribution counts. I've supported many other artists on Kickstarter, and I like the way it erases the boundary between artist and community, making it a truly collaborative effort. I'm looking forward to sharing the whole process of making an album with my contributors, with videos, photos and news along the way. I truly hope that you can be a part of it with me!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a band of one person, a production staff of one person, and a project manager of one person.

My name is Mandee and I have been performing professionally as \"Phat Man Dee\" since 1996. I have recorded and pressed 4 full length albums \"Life Just Goes On\" (2002), \"Torch of Blue\"(2007), \"Merry ChristmaChannaKwanzaa Vol. 1.1\" (2011) and my most recent release is \"Hey Phat Chick! (ya had it comin' to ya!) 2014. I have always included songs in one of the 10 other languages I sing in, because I feel we are one planet, one people, we are all children of the divine, no matter what color our skin, what languages we sing in. (Quick note: The photo of me singing into a mic against the brick background is by photographer Roy Jones, Kent, OH)\nImage by Chris Koontz Photography, shot at J J Jameson's Late Night Cabaret in Philadelphia, PA\nSmall sample of my music:\nThis year I am turning 40 years old and I am so excited to still be on the planet. I never thought I would make it this long!!!  I was born in Youngstown, OH, on February 12, 1975, the daughter of a school teacher/social justice activist and a railroad man/photographer. Since then I have played the roles of punk rawk circus sideshow marvel, bald poet, janitor, mung bean farmer, migrant farmer, part time prophet, cellist and sculptor.... all on my journey to become Phat Man Dee, a cabaret jazz icon in my own mind....and wife to the largest Amoeba on the planet. I have been blessed to make many wonderful friends and fans along the way.\nPhat Man Dee and Tommy Amoeba's wedding, 2002!\nIf I have had the honor of singing for you during the past 20 years, then this puts you in a community of thousands of people, and it's quite likely I did so live and in person, maybe around a campfire, maybe at a belly dance exposition, circus or burlesque show, maybe from inside a bathtub 20 feet in the air, maybe at the Pittsburgh Opera or a Burning Opera, maybe at a roller rink, maybe in a cave or with flaming robots, or maybe I sang to you in a haunted hotel or at the Warhol Museum standing next to an original Dali, maybe I even sang to you in a jazz club, or perhaps while I was singing and flying on a zip line over the Gowanus River in the middle of the night, but chances are it was in person. I would like to share this live \"Phat Man Dee\" experience with more people, around the US, and around the world. I have not been outside the United States since my french club accompanied Mr Ghogomou to Paris when I was sixteen years old.\nWhen Tommy Amoeba and I married, we asked that no one buy us anything. 13 years ago, we asked our guests who were artists for their own creation, or for a contribution to our house fund. That is how we were able to get our down payment on our house. Now we are settled and thoroughly entrenched in the beauty and art that I have always known Pittsburgh to be, I wish to spread the word of who we are, as artists, musicians, culture mavens.... to the world. I am about to launch my first ever online fundraising campaign. I have never been part of a kickstarter or other kind of online fundraising venture before and I hope this is received with as much excitement as I am having making it. Please, for my 40th birthday, will you please be part of this effort and help me bring my music and the music of those I love to an international audience? \nPlease help me sing to the world. I shall video document my journey. I shall use this once in a lifetime opportunity to connect with musicians from all over the world. I collaborated last year with electronic musician Jensen from Germany last year, I sang on his cd, but I would like to sing with him in person. I have old musical friends from San Francisco who live in Belgium with whom I would like to play again. My friend Roby Edwards is a saxophonist who plays France and Germany regularly, I am sure if I could get  myself there, I would be able to line up performances, make fans and my goal is to meet someone to act as my booking agent. I spoke with a colleague of mine from Mr Smalls Theatre, Mr. El J\u00f6rge de Ors\u00f6vay,  he used to tour manage for Anti Flag (big punk band from Pittsburgh) and asked how I should find an international agent.... His advice? He told me to get myself over there, and go meet the people in person..... that what you find on the internet isn't always real, what seems like the greatest club or festival in the world isn't what it appears in cyberspace.... and for the clubs and agents.... there are so many artists on the net trying to get something, it's really just better to go and suss it out in person.... The one solid gig I have lined up so far is in July at the World Body Painting Festival, held in Austria. My dear friend Foxy Moxy and her fiancee Scott Fray have won every single title offered by this presitigious festival and are now judges. This year they shall get married at the event, and they have requested I come sing to them for the wedding, on stage at this international festival celebrating art and the human body. I intend to use this event as a starting point to anchor around and I will line up smaller club hits and musical experiences in Paris, Berlin and Amsterdam. I have many international contacts who have invited me to come, but whatever money I may make singing my first time out of the US will not be enough to cover my expenses of getting there and getting back. I am asking for help, this first time, to go and meet the people I need to meet and sing to the people I need to sing to, in person, so I can work towards getting my band members and dancers I work with out of town with me so we can share with the world our music and our art. \nAs a student of advanced video technique at Pittsburgh Filmmakers and as a video intern at Mr Small's Theatre, I have learned how to capture and present music through video, and I would like to combine my talents of music, travel and video to share my experiences in the world, with the world. I will present the video online in a travel journal on my youtube, blogs and website. I shall document the musical collaborations I have with the musicians I meet while I am there and present them in a web series video travel blog. As a citizen of Pittsburgh, America's city of bridges, I intend to seek out bridges on my travels and video myself singing on them, songs of mine, songs I learn along the way and new songs.... because a bridge is a special thing, it connects people.... physically and geographically, to one another, and I feel that Pittsburgh and its people are members of a global community, and I wish to exhibit this truth in a musical manner. When I return back home, I shall cut all the footage into a presentation that I shall show at Mr Smalls Theatre for one of their Creative.Life.Support Revival Series evenings. We will show highlights of video I made and I will teach my band to play the songs I learned and wrote while I was across the sea and we shall sing them for the good people of Pittsburgh. At my first ever big Mr Smalls Creative Life Support revival series show, I video skyped in my friend Colter Harper from Ghana and we sang together through the internet for the live audience in the theatre..... I wish to go to Ghana myself someday and I think going to Europe is the first step. \nI have a mission statement, though I never published it, it always just rang in my head. \"Phat Man Dee is committed to bringing world class art and music to Pittsburgh and sharing our world class art and music with the world.\" Please help me and be part of this process and together we will show the world through music and dance, that Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania knows how to get down.\nBudget realities for flying Phat Man Dee and one videographer to Europe for 1 month:\nAirfare to Europe x 2 @ $1500 = $3000\nEurail pass for 1 month x 2 @ $940 = $1880\nHostels - 30 days (average price $30) x 2 = $1800\nMeals 30 days (average price $12) x 2 = $2160\nSubway passes/ transportation: $400\nPanasonic X920 HD Camcorder: $1260\nMacBook Pro plus editing software: $2300\nZoom H4N Personal Digital Audio Recorder: $200\nTravel Insurance: $400\nEmergency cushion, visas, sundries: $1800\nReward fulfillment, taxes: $1000\nTotal request: $16,200\nIT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT I HAVE APPLIED FOR A GRANT FOR THIS SAME PROJECT.... I applied last year for the same \"Investing in Professional Artists\" grant, though it was for a completely different project, and I was denied, so I do not know if I will get it this year, I have never gotten a grant from these people before... IF BY THE GRACE OF GOD AND THE GODDESS I RECEIVE THIS GRANT AND SUCCESSFULLY FUND THIS CAMPAIGN, I WILL USE THIS MONEY TO TRAVEL TO EITHER BRING MY BAND ALONG FOR THE RIDE FOR CERTAIN GIGS OR I WILL GO TO INDIA AND AFRICA. Or both! I have been invited by good people in Mumbai and Ghana... I would like to take them up on their offers, and if I did, by some miracle of miracles, get enough money to make that happen, you can bet your bottom dollar, 2015/2016 would see this little phat girl flying all over the world..... I dream of attending the Guiro Conference in Puerto Rico as well..... \nOne love, thank you for watching this, I am forever, Phat Man Dee", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis section asks me to assess potential risks and challenges. To this I say I have been faced with many trials and obstacles over my time as an independent artist and musician. When issues arise (the plane is late, or the person you were working with is sick and can't work that day, or there's bad weather and you can't shoot outside etc) I try to not let it bother me. I have learned that the universe, God, the Goddess or whichever deity you believe or don't believe in, places obstacles in your path. When you work to overcome them you are better able to achieve the goals you have set before yourself. I would not be where I am today, with 4 self made albums, and a band, a member of a burlesque variety troupe and the director of a choir if I let myself be daunted. I have eaten out of dumpsters, been lost in strange cities with nary a dollar to my name, and I always felt the Divine presence and I always found a friend. I have in turn tried to be a friend to those in need.

I am currently in Scotland, at the Edinburgh Fringe, it is a festival unlike any I have ever attended. The city is filled with artists and performers from all over the world. 3000 shows are happening right now, and there are industry professionals who book, manage, produce performances of every genre and medium imaginable, all looking for new projects to work with. It is wildly exciting. I have so many ideas for what I am going to bring here next year and the people I am working with now are performers at the top of their game. I am honored to be among them. My companion and videographer Alistair McQueen has been working really hard to capture all of our experiences and put some of them up for your enjoyment. Most of the editing will be done after we get back and can actually watch the hundreds of hours of footage logged and piece it together in a sensible format. A tv producer is coming to our show tonight at \"Best of Burlesque\" and who knows if it will actually lead to \"Take it to the Bridge\" to be picked up or not? But hope is a good thing..... Another good thing is clicks, likes, and shares.... social media is the currency and Nielsen ratings of the modern age, so please check out the youtube channel where we have been posting the videos and share them.

And, really, the last several weeks have been a kind of blur.... we documented everything, so it's all on tape, and we will edit it and get it into a movie form when we get home.... but really, we have been changing locations every 3 or 4 days and it's just long enough to make a couple friends, or reconnect with old ones, sing on bridges, go to jam sessions, make plans for future ventures and I am deep down tired and exhausted through every bone and fiber....I think I am on my 27th wind right now.....

I grew up in Pittsburgh following my heart the way my family taught. I attended college at Valparaiso University, where I studied music. Having voice as an instrument of focus, I learned a great amount from performing and private lessons. In my college career I was a lead singer/songwriter for a three piece folk band called \u201cThe Still Life\u201d where I honed my songwriting and band leading capabilities. \nAfter graduating college, I separated from that project to pursue more work on my solo career. Writing, singing, teaching, jamming, playing songs, jingles, and anything that came out of me through some creative force, I took my performance to a new level. Performing around the Pittsburgh area from the far south suburbs to the center of downtown, I have been growing as a person and artist. For example, the open mic scene around town has offered new friendships and collaborations on others music as well as my own. I learned the depth at which my writing could be taken.\nThere has always been a deep side to me about the concepts of existence. I found in my writing I was able to discuss and express myself. A true example of my view \u2026.. I have always existed as the question of what our purpose is and where we are going. By \u201cwe\u201d I mean as a unified group of existence: Humans, animals, plants, the earth, the universe. We all have so much we cannot deny is unified. We are together in this existence. I find supporting and caring for others lives\u2019 brings more positivism to our own. It is equally about pursuing our own dreams, or pursuing what it is that brings us happiness. My goal in my life is to encourage and aid others in their growth of life. \nI pursue my beliefs through my music. I share them. I sing, shout, pour, and am elated in doing so. I am blessed to be capable of this. Without everything we go through in life we wouldn\u2019t be who we are. Without everything I have lived, I could not be who I am, pursuing what I am pursuing and dreaming as I dream. Hence, I am reaching out through this Kickstarter to be given an opportunity to record a professional quality album.\n In this album I am discussing more on my beliefs and opinions on life and existence, as many creative folk do, this is my take. With your aid, I will give my first public portrayal of existence, struggle, and growth through recorded performance. Fear. Love. Every other emotion stems from these and I am eager to share my limited perspective with you. I have never worked with a studio where I felt I was able to really release my passion, heart, determination, or focused energy until now. This also includes a respectful and equal partnership. \nUltimately I have never been able to create a professional quality album. Through the open mic scene, I met an equal who was interested in aiding me in my pursuit of a solo album. We grew in understanding of each other\u2019s goals, learned about each other\u2019s passions, and decided we should try to create a professional quality product. With your aid, I will be able to record out of Soundscape Studio with Michael Anthony Cirelli as the engineer.

Well, read on:\nIf you are open-minded, progressive, and thoughtful, then this book is for you. \nIf you don\u2019t consider yourself an \"activist,\" and yet still want to engage on the topic of race -- not only regarding social justice, but also cultural exchange and friendship -- then this book is for you.\nIf you do consider yourself an activist, then this book is also for you -- because, even though we may have different approaches, we are still working toward the same righteous end: total EQUALITY for ALL PEOPLE.\nIf you want a space where you're not asked to be the \"representative of your race,\" then this book is for you.\nIf you're a white person who is not in denial about the need for this conversation -- but also someone who doesn't resonate with the \"you MUST admit you're racist, even if you don't think you are\" white-guilt approach -- then this book is for you. (In other words, you get that white people and people of color still aren't treated equally in this country, but rather than guilt and shame, you'd like to bring your \"whole humanity\" to the program.)\nIf you are a person of color who is a bit weary of explaining \"racial\" things to white people, and yet also don't necessarily consider yourself an activist, then this book is for you.\nIf you are not afraid to talk about race, but often feel like you don't really know how to, then this book is for you.  \nIf you are multi-racial, in an interracial relationship, were adopted by parents  of another race, or have adopted a child of another race, then this book is for you.\nIf you want to get beyond the guilt and denial and really connect \u2013 in a more meaningful, lasting way -- then this book is for you.\nIf you want a real conversation about race that feels authentic, uninhibited,  and rich with possibility, then this book is for you. \nConversationWe at IGNITE (5-min. video of me sharing some core concepts of the book.)\nHOW I GOT STARTED IN ALL OF THIS\nI was about eight years old, in the mid 70's, looking at images from the Civil Rights Movement, in the big TIME/LIFE book on my grandmother's coffee table.  I was simply riveted.  I didn't fully comprehend what I was looking at, but I knew it was something of great import.  That was the seed of my calling.\nUltimately, I became a musician, painter and educator --  and began to use the arts as a catalyst for a different kind of conversation about race.\nIn the Spring of 2000, I realized a 20-year dream and debuted my full-length \"concept album\" called The Divided States of America.  Tony Norman, of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described it as \"a suite of songs about race, class, and other divisions that continue to haunt the American dream.\"  You will get the full album as a download, at just the $5 donation level -- PLUS the advance preview of the book! You can check out the songs here: https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/j.g.-boccella/id6272793\nThe Divided States of America album\nA NEW PARADIGM FOR RACE\nAfter years of creating and implementing programs on race, I began to notice a phenomenon: a \u201chidden demographic\u201d of people who really wanted to connect across lines of race -- socially, professionally, and intellectually -- but who didn\u2019t have \u201ca way in.\u201d\nIn \u201cThe Conversation We COULD Be Having,\u201d I offer a new paradigm for race relations in America. I describe how -- by engaging each person\u2019s \u201cwhole humanity\u201d -- we can move beyond narrowly defined roles, to a place of far greater understanding, connection, and relationship.\nSomething is brewing. There is a zeitgeist forming \u2013 an opportunity before us. All over the country, members of this hidden demographic want something more -- something more holistic, more accessible, more generative.  I truly believe that this book could help so many people because it meets a huge unmet need that's out there.  The hidden demographic represents a lever for social change.  How do social norms shift?  When people are empowered, given a way into a process, and a way to connect.  Please help me get these ideas to as many people as possible by helping me get the book finished and marketed.

He paid the ultimate price at the Battle of Spotsylvania, \"The Bloody Angle\" May 12, 1864.\nThis record will be featuring my 2nd great-grandfather, Rev. Thomas P. Proudfit, who was a Presbyterian minister that traveled out west to Nebraska in 1863. He would give a sermon at one church and ride on horseback to his next sermon, sometimes traveling many miles the same day.\nHe and his wife and family followed The National Road, Route 40, all the way to Nebraska. I thought this story would be a perfect fit and analogy to what is happening in our nation now. I wanted to explore many angles. We do live in the most amazing country on Earth, though not perfect, it is these trying times that test our faith and hope for the future.\nI can't do this record on my own. So it really is up to you how much we can do together to make this record. The budget is very tight, with studio costs, paying musicians, and giving rewards; Any money raised above my goal will be used for tour support and promoting the record.\nHere is my budget plan to make the album for $5,000.\nProduction, studio time, engineering mixing, and musicians $3,000\nMastering CD pressing, $1500\nFees and reward fulfillment. $500\n**If we do not reach $5,000, the project will not be funded (your credit card will not be charged) and no prizes will be sent out. **\nPlease help SPREAD THE WORD through Facebook, Twitter, Emails, etc. I can't do this alone. I truly need your support.\nI thank you sincerely, from the bottom of my heart. Making music, protecting the environment, and our nation mean so much to me. The only thing more important is my family and God. I would like to think that your support makes you part of my musical family.\nPeace, love and blessings,\nMitch\nmitchbell.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major challenge on this record will be maintaining the high standard that were set with my last record.\n\nI will be working with a small budget on this recording so I will have to be very frugal. So I will need to find the following to work with me: studio, producer, engineer and musicians that can work within the time frame and budget I have allotted.\n\nI may have to raise more money for promotion and tour support once the record is finished, but that would be another project.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! We made the goal, and it took only 16 days -- not the 25 days that I was worried would be too short. Kicktracker says this project has the potential of reaching $5,500 by its conclusion.

This is $1,500 more in Pledges. It amazes me to realize that this is possible.\nAnd I would like to add an extra 'thank you' to every Backer, if we make this stretch goal. The extra 'thank you' I will send you will vary, depending on what the reward is that you initially requested, but it will either be a set of greeting cards (if you didn't order greeting cards) or it will be a limited edition print (that is different than the one you ordered).

For thirty years, I've given my work away as gifts -- which I will continue to do -- but this Kickstarter campaign will allow me to print a limited-edition set of my art so that I can share it with many more people, including you.\nYour Christmas and holiday cards and gifts\nI'm running a brisk 25-day Kickstarter campaign, and I'm doing it for a reason. I want you to be able to use these Amish quilt watercolors as your Christmas and holiday cards. Among the rewards I'm offering, I'm printing this set of paintings on beautiful art greeting cards, and I've kept the campaign short enough to deliver 6 or 12 or 24 or 48 or 72 (or even 144) Christmas/holiday cards to you, and get them to your mailbox before Thanksgiving.\nAmong the other rewards I'm offering -- and do, please, check all of them out on the right side of your screen -- are limited edition, signed and numbered art reproductions of these paintings in their full size. I'm also offering the original watercolor painting for each of the six, and also a set of reproductions of the \"studies\" I did for each of the paintings (pre-paintings, as it were, that show my process). I would also love to paint a custom lone-star painting for you, in color schemes that you select, to fit just right in a place you might have in mind. And I'm also offering other rewards, small and large, which I hope you will like.\nWhat else?\nAs I said, offering these Amish quilt-inspired paintings, greeting cards, limited-edition reprints, and such is exciting to me in its own right. But success with this campaign will accomplish the first step in a larger project -- capturing all of my art in art-quality reproduction prints so I can bring my lifetime work forward. Getting this project funded and accomplished will be beautiful in its own right, AND it will be an important stepping stone for my work in the future.\nYou saw glimpses of my larger work in the video. The painting beside my daughter Emma (a painting of Emma) is one of a large set of large-scale semi-abstracts I've done over the years. I'm excited to show them. I've always also done semi-abstract landscapes, which I hope to share in the future. Also, I've been studying and practicing traditional Eastern Christian Iconography over the past ten years, working with traditional egg tempera, and I hope to share these in the future, also.\nThere's more, and all of it brings together my love for light, color, and the play and interplay of image, texture and color that communicates feeling, mystery, and beauty.\nThank you!\nYour patronage of my art through this campaign means a great deal to me. Thank you for supporting me, and please share this link with your contacts, link to it from Facebook, and so forth. I'd love to go well past my goal -- overshooting my goal simply means being able to share my art with many, many more people.

Through that I was introduced to Mari-Lynn Evans, the executive producer of the movie Coal Country. I am forever grateful for being asked to perform at a number of environmental organization events which are listed below. \nThe concept for this album came out of my experiences and observations at some of these events.\nI have had a number of songs that fit together really well but some needed more work and a way to tie them all together. I think I have achieved that. The demos are all completed and the plan is to record the album at Sputnik Sound in Nashville working with producer/engineer Mitch Dane.\nSputnik Sound is the home of two grammy award winning producer/engineers, Mitch Dane and Vance Powell. Mitch Dane's assistant, Joshua Vance Smith co-produced/engineered/mixed, sang background vocals, played accordion, and wrote string arrangements on my last record \"The Ballad of Philo Paul\". Vance Powell mastered it. Joshua is now employed by Jack White III at Third Man Records and has worked there with Vance Powell on numerous releases including all of Jack White's last three projects.

I talk to middle school and high school students. I write real songs about real things.  I am passionate about what I do. I am passionate about connecting with people through the arts. I am passionate about creating lasting change in our communities through the arts. I believe that the arts are a lifeline to community revitalization. I believe words, when shared thoughtfully, and with love and conviction, are powerful and can change a heart.  I just want to live my life fully alive!  And I am about to record my 3rd Full-length album! And I can barely wait!\nA LETTER FOR YOU\nDear Friends!\nThe time has come!   As I write to you, I'm currently overflowing with so much anticipation. I am truly, truly excited for the things to come even though I don't exactly know what they are . \nI am 3 weeks away from starting a brand new project and have been writing these songs for nearly 2 years now.  This album will be a bit different. It will be produced by Saul Simon of The Lovely Light studio in NYC.  It will be a album of primarily love songs. And i don't know how to say this except that \"I put alot of tears into this album.\"  This album and its songs hold a very special place in my heart and i really want to share them with the world...and YOU!\nThis album, in full, will take roughly $10,000 to record. $8,000 seemed like a good place to start when recording the video, but after the doing the math, it was necessary to set my Kickstarter goal at $10,000. The funds will be well be spent on producer, musicians, tracking, mixing, mastering, CD duplication, and rewards for funders.  You can bet that I will put ever last cent to good use!\nMy \"ask\" is that you would support this venture and that you would tell the people in your networks about it, in return for some incredibly, excellent rewards(look to your right)!   And the biggest reward is that you can finally stop asking me \"So hey, when do we get to hear your new stuff?\"  :)\nThank you all for your support and encouragement over the last 7 years and to God be the glory in all that we do!\n-Joy\n\u201cWe all die.

Boccella and I am an independent recording artist. My two greatest passions in life are music and bringing people together.\nI am seeking $2,500 for my first-ever music video. (That\u2019s the bare minimum that I think I need to make something nice, so any extra will just give us more options.) The song is called \u201cUNSTOPPABLE\u201d and it explores the idea of accepting the inevitability of change \u2013 in life and society.  The song will be featured on my second full-length CD.  The video is set 30-40 years in future, and imagines what changes in societal norms and law will have taken place by then.  Here are the lyrics to the chorus:\nYou can\u2019t stop an idea whose time has come\nNo use runnin\u2019, cause where you gonna run?\nDon\u2019t fear change \u2018cause it\u2019s bound to come\nIt\u2019s UNSTOPPABLE.\nAs a songwriter, I like to blend musical styles and try to create a unique sound out of this mix.  Lyrically, I write about life and love, as do many songwriters, but I also often write songs about race relations.  This song was a fan favorite from my first recording:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYMOGI/ref=dm_dp_trk2?ie=UTF8&qid=1317592650&sr=301-4\nIt\u2019s called \u201cIf a Dog Bites You\u201d and explores the idea of TRUST \u2013 how it\u2019s lost and possibly regained.  The vignettes in the verses are based on real events that took place in my hometown of Pittsburgh, PA.\nThat first full-length CD was a \u201cconcept album\u201d :-0  called, \u201cThe Divided States of America\u201d and was an attempt to explore U.S. race relations from a different perspective.   You can hear it, and more of my music, here:\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-divided-states-of-america/id6272826\nThis is my single called \u201cCHANGE\u201d\nhttp://itunes.apple.com/us/album/change-single/id394057968\nI have also explored these ideas in workshops that I have developed over the years and, currently, in a lecture series and book project called \u201cThe Conversation We COULD Be Having.\u201d\nI am also a painter.  You can see some of my work here: http://www.zazzle.com/gifts?ch=modomio \n GOOD PEOPLE\nI am so excited to be working with my Modo Mio Band-mates to record this, and also with some amazing film and video friends.  I know that all together \u2013 you, me, the band, and the film/video/visual artists \u2013 we can make this a GREAT, high-quality, evocative, jammin\u2019, and thought-provoking piece.\nWHAT YOU GET FOR WHAT YOU GIVE\nI\u2019m also so excited (as a music fan myself) to offer these great thank-you\u2019s for your pledges of support.  Check it out!\nFor just a one dollar donation, you can download our live EP, \u201cLive from the Guild.\"  \nAnd, for just a five dollar donation, you can get the live EP download plus my full-length debut album, \u201cThe Divided States of America,\u201d as a digital download!\nThen, there are the signed CD\u2019s, the private concerts, the original painting.  Check it all out, on the column on the right.\nFINDING MY AUDIENCE\nI remember a Bruce Springsteen quote where he was talking about how, now that he had finished making his record, he felt like he had to literally go out and FIND his audience.  That\u2019s what I am trying to do now.  I want to find people who are really feeling this music.  And, my hope is that the video \u2013 as well as the Kickstarter community \u2013 will be able to help get my music out there to find the people who would be most moved by it.\nAll I want to do is make great music and bring people together.  Please help me find my audience.  \nMany Thanks.\nPEACE&BLESSINGS,\nJG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "J.G.

I would like you to come with me on this journey.\nSome Background: In early 2010 I said this little prayer, \u201cDear Lord, please give me the gift of songwriting\u201d. (I highly recommend this \u201csongwriters\u2019 prayer\u201d to anyone who writes.) Though I have written songs for many years, since that day, the songs began coming together in a new way. Simple\u2026but powerful! Ask\u2026and when it is the right thing for your life...Receive. This CD is the outgrowth of that request and my way of honoring the music that has come.\nAbout the CD: I have named the CD \u201cLife Jacket\u201d because the CD will help me continue on that path I have been on since 2008 when I began to pursue art and music on a full time basis. I have written most of the music on my own or with co-writers like my wonderful husband George Salamacha. Stylistically, most of the songs are country/pop with a rock edge, like Keith Urban and Taylor Swift. If you like the rowdiness of Delbert McClinton, the heart-felt lyrics of Patty Griffin or the honesty of Lucinda Williams, I do believe you will like what I am doing.\nAbout Recording: Phenomenal musicians in Nashville are doing most of the music tracks and there are Pittsburghers too like, Joy Ike on vocals, Bob Kardacz on keyboard, Bob Bannergee on the mandolin, George Salamacha on bass.\nProject Info: So dear friends, family and fans, thank you for considering contributing. I have estimated that \u201cLife Jacket\u201d will cost between $6-$8000. I'm raising $3000 and am taking responsibility for the other half.\nHere are all the expenses I will need to cover: *studio time *paying musicians *mixing/mastering *artwork, design, packaging and duplication of CD *promotion\nTHANK YOU for the support you have given me in the past several years. I will do my best to be a good steward of your money, give you an account of how I've spent it, and also give you EXCELLENT REWARDS in return (see rewards to your right). The names of all who pay-it-forward on \u201cLife Jacket\u201d will be on the liner notes of the CD jacket. If you are an individual or even a corporation, there\u2019s a way to contribute.\nKickstarter Project Caveat: I need to mention that if the full $3,000 is not raised over the next 90 days, I will not receive any of the pledged money (and your credit card will not be charged). In other words, if I raise $2,995, that money will not come to me. If I meet or exceed $3,000, I will be eternally grateful and your name will be engraved in my heart forever.\nAt the completion of this project, we\u2019ll have a big party\u2026and there will be joy!
