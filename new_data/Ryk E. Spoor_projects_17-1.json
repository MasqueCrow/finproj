[{"backer": "Ryk E. Spoor", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "PLAY\n\nIn the Time Before Time, everyone and everything was together as one. But that was before Beazt slew the Children, and Abominous, his creator, broke the world. Scattered, the remaining Children struggled for survival, trying to tame a paradise that had turned against them.\nFor millennia they have been separated from one another by Sorogoros, the worldwyrm, which wraps it's huge serpentine coils around each continent on the planet. Controlling the sea and sky, the Sorogoros ensures that no fish, no fowl, no ship can cross from one \"coil\" to another. And so have the Children been trapped on their continental islands, the knowledge of their brethren fading with each passing day, their desire to travel the open sea long all but lost.\nBut things are changing.\nThe Children are thriving. They are restless. And they once again hear the calls of their ancestors from across the churning seas. Tales abound that the Sorogoros has by tamed. Ships are appearing in ports outside of the safe harbors and the inland seas. Their destination - new lands. Their guarantee - Adventure.\nAre you brave enough to board one today? Are you brave enough to discover what lies beyond the horizon? Are you brave enough to explore Denoa? \nBehold The Doorway To Adventure\nDenoa is a world built for storytelling. It contains a rich mythology and history that inform adventures without overwhelming them with detail. An official campaign story plays out in real time, with key events hosted at kitchen tables and game stores around the world. However, DMs and players can take things at their own pace, and choose to play the meta story, or use it's ideas to tell their own stories.\nBehold a world that feels like home. Whose paths and plains, forests and fields, cities and landscapes feel familiar. Like something you know, and understand, because you've been there before. \nBehold a world that feels fresh and new. Where familiar ideas and common tropes are upgraded, updated, and never stale. Where the familiar is just different enough to excite your senses, and invite you to explore it.\nBehold a world that is strange, and magical, and unlike any world you have seen before. A world where the unfamiliar and uncomfortable clash with the fantasy that you know. Where any - and every - fantasy idea has a place to grow. Where continents, cultures, monsters, and magic have evolved separately from each other. Where each location is amazing, wondrous, and completely unique.\nBehold a world made up of worlds, where all of your favorite settings come together - and clash. Imagine a green world, where humans, elves, and dwarves band together to fight a common foe. Imagine a savage world, where tan, magic-hating barbarians tread the land on sandalled feet. Imagine a frozen world, where snowbound creatures draw magic by singing to the northern lights. Imagine a fairy world where fey folk and talking animals are commonplace. Imagine a burning world, where hell has literally come to earth, and demons, devils, and insect races dominate the harsh landscape.\nBehold Denoa. The world where these worlds - and others - are on the edge of discovering each other.\nDenoa and it's official campaign will bring modern technology to bear in it's story telling. Through the use of in-store-only events, online surveys, and a dedicated app, we hope to gather your experiences and use them to shape our story. What you share with us could shape our official campaign, our next official event, or even a future product! \nUnofficially you can shape the world in any way you choose. We've even built it so that you can add your own world TO Denoa. So if you like worldbuilding, there's no need to abandon your work to play Denoa. Use one of the provided options to put Denoa into YOUR world, or YOUR world into Denoa, making the story you tell uniquely yours.\nDenoa is in every way a collaborative effort. Designed by Danny O'Neill, it will be created by some of the best talent and game companies in the industry (for a full list, see the bottom of this Kickstarter). And that design is guided by YOU and the actions you take during Organized Play events.\nOne of the key collaborators on the project is DGNFOG who will help us build all the maps for Denoa. Another is the community we hope to build around World Anvil and our Organize Play efforts. If you are a retailer, a designer, a writer, or interested in contributing to Denoa in ANY WAY, reach out to us through our social media. We might not have room for your particular talent or idea, but we'd love to include you any way we can. \n There are three major components to this project - the Book, the Denoa App, and the Organized Play. We have set a low goal in order to help with internet marketing algorithms. For the book to reach it's full potential, this Kickstarter will have to earn approximately $15,000. \nThe Denoa app has 3 Tiers. Tier 1, the Basic App is already funded. Tier 2, the Advanced App is our true goal. We will need this Kickstarter to fund between $25,000 and $30,000 for this app to be fully funded. \n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nDenoa is a broken, magical world. In the time before time, it's continents were separated by a titanic sea serpent know as the Sorogoros. As a result, the ecology of each land evolved without the others. Each now sports it's own peoples, it's own cultures, it's own magic styles, it's own monsters. Your job is to uncover them all. But for now, things are secret, and information is purposefully made scarce.\nTo discover as much as you can about Denoa, head to World Anvil.\nColarwyn\nOur story starts in Colarwyn, a region which acts as a hub for this project and future ones. Colarwyn is one of 5 regions in the continent known as Ostarwyn. Almost all of the countries in this region border an inland sea, known as Merala.\n\nThe Free City of Arbor\nWe are extremely proud to be partnering with some of the most talented companies, writers, and artists in the business. \nAuthors\nEd Greenwood is a Canadian worldbuilder, writer, game designer,  and librarian who creates imaginary worlds; his best known one is the  Forgotten Realms\u00ae fantasy setting, which he began creating when he was  six years old, and is still expanding  and enriching more than fifty years later.

With World Anvil, take your creativity to the next step.  Throughout the campaign and beyond we will be updating our World Anvil world for Denoa with extra content you can explore at your own pace outside of game sessions. \nPartnering up with World Anvil makes us very proud creators and we encourage you to try the same! \n\nWe've saved the most boring for last! Denoa will be fulfilled via professional services TBD.\nPlease note that freight will be added to all pledges through the use of BackerKit which will launch immediately after the Kickstarter. We will add a freight estimate chart below as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of this time, the risks to this project are minimal. The primary artwork for the book is already completed, and writing has begun. We're in a good place with how the capsules and OP work, and we'll be playtesting within a few weeks.\n\nThe largest challenge we have is making sure Denoa fulfills it's potential by fulling funding the app. The basic version will be enough to stay connected and play Denoa events, but the full version will allow for players to integrate their characters into the storyline with ease. That will allow a lot more players into the collective story we are telling. So although Denoa will survive with even the Basic app, the Full App is what we are truly shooting for. The goal for this is high - we need this Kickstarter to hit $40K to be able to get to this plateau. And that's why we consider this our largest challenge.\n\nThe next challenge we have is to get enough stores into our network hosting Denoa events. If your local game store hosts role-playing games, and if you think they are interested, please tell them about us! With their assistance we can tell a bigger and better story.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Danny O'Neill - Hammerdog Games\n5 created \u00b7 23 backed\nDanny has been organizing, creating, promoting, hosting, selling, and distributing games for over 30 years.

To add one of the below onto your current pledge, just click on the \u201cManage Your Pledge\u201d button at the top right of the page, click in the \u201cPledge Amount\u201d box, and change the pledge amount to reflect the addition of the amount of the add-on you want. Example: if your current pledge amount is $10, and you want to add a $5 add-on, you would click into the \u201cPledge Amount\u201d box and change the pledge amount to $15. At the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019ll send out a questionnaire to find out what add-ons you contributed for. NOTES: all ebooks listed available in .epub, mobi, or .pdf, unless indicated. Also, we can autograph a book to whomever you want and you can order more than one copy of the same book when doing an add-on.\n$5 \u2014 Add a limited edition cloisonn\u00e9 \u201cAcross the Universe\u201d pin.

I\u2019m better at the 101-key keyboard, which makes words rather than sounds.\nAs a publisher, I frequently have authors approaching me with ideas for books. Some interest me, some don\u2019t. In a swimming pool last summer, Randee Dawn said \u201cwhat about an anthology of alternate Beatles stories?\u201d I said it might be a good idea, but she\u2019d need to flesh out the idea before I could say yes, do it. And besides, I was in the midst of another big project (Release the Virgins). At a convention soon after, Michael Ventrella approached me with an idea: \u201conce we\u2019re done with Release the Virgins, how about an alternative Beatles anthology?\u201d I couldn\u2019t respond. I just grabbed his arm, dragged him over to Randee, and said \u201crepeat that.\u201d\nSo I put the two of them together, saying \u201cobviously, this is an idea whose time has come. I see a synergy with your two backgrounds.\u201d And in a very short time, it went from a \u201chey, this could be neat,\u201d to this fully fleshed-out plan.\nThe responses they got from the authors they asked\u2014even those who didn\u2019t have the time to participate\u2014were almost unanimously \u201cwhat a great idea!\u201d So we\u2019re presenting it to you.

Spoor", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Villains & Vigilantes\u2122: the Origin Story\nJeff Dee and Jack Herman first met in high school in Cary Illinois way back in 1977. Our shared interest in comics and gaming led to the argument which gave rise to our Villains and Vigilantes\u2122 superhero role-playing game: who would win in a fight, Spider-Man or the Human Torch? We decided to game it out... which meant coming up with game rules for superhero combat!\nSoon we were running our newly created superhero RPG, which we named \"Villains and Vigilantes\" (V&V\u2122 for short), for our own local gaming group. Our player's characters called themselves... the mighty Protectors!\nThe first edition of V&V was published in 1979, followed by a revised and improved edition in 1982.\nVillains and Vigilantes was the first complete superhero role-playing game. Its second edition featured random character generation, d20-based combat and 'hit points' reminiscent of other early tabletop RPGs, and the option for players to make characters based on themselves. Because superheroes and role-playing games are awesome! It's an unabashedly old-school approach. Read reviews of V&V here!\nIn 2010, we set up Monkey House Games\u2122 in order to release V&V 2.1: a re-publication of the '82 second edition with some corrections, new material, and all-new artwork. This was followed by a series of new V&V adventures, including \"Infinity Lounge\" which you can download for free.\nBut MHG's ultimate aim was always the publication of a fully updated 3rd edition of V&V. After an unfortunate delay due to legal problems (which have now been successfully resolved), this brings us to...\nV&V 3.0: Mighty Protectors!\nThe new 'third edition' has a name, and not just a number: it\u2019s called MIGHTY PROTECTORS\u2122 after the player group from the very first V&V campaign in our official setting \u2013 the Mighty Protectors Multiverse.\nMighty Protectors features a new streamlined and expanded revision of the V&V rules, an intro to the Mighty Protectors Multiverse (about which we've only provided scattered details before), and all-new artwork.\nWe\u2019ve posted about the new rules extensively on the Monkey House Games website. Expansions and changes include: refined character generation (supporting campaigns at Low, Standard, or High-powered ability levels, and allowing optional character construction in addition to random generation), improved game balance, new super-abilities (such as Arsenal, Grapnel and Communicators), greatly improved rules for old abilities (such as Special Weapons and Vehicles), and new rules for customizing abilities! Check out this sample conversion of the villain Bandit and his Race Car, from the V&V supplement Most Wanted!\nDespite these additions and changes, converting characters from Revised / V&V 2.1 is relatively simple. Monkey House Games is also committed to supporting the previous edition of V&V, and so we will include Revised/2.1 stats in all of our 3.0/Mighty Protectors adventures and supplements.\nV&V 3.0: Mighty Protectors also includes an extensive overview of the Mighty Protectors Multiverse. Play alongside its greatest heroes, such as the Crusaders, Shatterman and Condor, or the mighty Protectors themselves! Prowl the streets of Central City, explore the fabled Secret Land, travel among the planets of the Sphere, or visit the Interdimensional Library! You can read all about the Mighty Protectors Multiverse on our forums.\nProject Status\nOver 5 years in development, Mighty Protectors has been heavily play-tested. The new rules are finished, solid, and awesome. The remaining text work consists of a final editing and usability pass, examples of play, and final page layouts. We also need to create all of its artwork. We estimate that the book will be 140 pages in length. The money we raise will fund this effort, plus the work necessary to complete our stretch goals. We're extremely proud of the work we've already done, and thrilled to finally be able to bring the finished product to you!\nAdd-Ons!\nYou may add any combination of these choices to your pledge.

The crooks are a little ticked off to find out that Bean's flat rate fee accounts for almost all of the proceeds, but business is business.\nShe's gonna need a bigger stun-gun...\nThe next day, Bean and his heavily-armed assistant, Rally Vincent (deadly with both gun and frying pan), receive a visitor with a young girl in tow.\nMinor character Morris gets Majorly Messed Up\nThe visitor barely has time to beseech them to return the girl to her father before a hit-team swiss-cheeses Bean's apartment. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't have Bean's taste in clothes (all Kevlar, including his underwear!)\nProfessional Driver... Do not attempt!\nBean and Rally bundle little Chelsea into the car and make tracks. Alas, what they don't know is that the kidnappers have already made off with the $2,000,000 ransom, leaving them to take the rap. Will Bean discover the ruse in time and get the money for himself? Will he be able to evade the relentless pursuit of Inspector Percy? And most importantly, how much will the Chicago P.D.'s insurance company raise their rates?\nThis limited-edition Blu-Ray release is a \"High Octane Edition\" for a reason. We will be using the same uncompressed HD transfer as the recent Japanese release, but using a BD50 instead of BD25 for a higher bitrate. It will contain both the original Japanese soundtrack and the English dub, plus English subtitles in multicolor, greyscale and SDH variants (or you can watch with no subtitles if you prefer). The disc will not be region-coded, and we can ship it anywhere in the world except for Japan, China and Taiwan.\n(possible poster image; backers will vote on which one we use)\nOther bonus materials include a 9-panel insert sheet with mini-poster, printed program notes and other cool stuff, as well as color artwork, line art (settei), after-recording script, and more. As much as possible, everything will be available both on the disc and online. And of course, all backers will be credited on the disc!\n(Actually, we prefer credit cards and PayPal)\nThe High Octane Edition will only be sold via crowdfunding and direct sales on our website. It will never be available for less than the crowdfunding price. While we currently do not intend to release a regular commercial version of Riding Bean on Blu-ray, if we do it will be in different packaging and will not include any extra physical stretch-goal bonuses.\nRegular Reward Levels\nDigital backers ($5) get access to the data archive, which includes high-resolution graphics, settei, and the original after-recording script.\nRegular backers ($25) get the basic Blu-ray in a premium transparent Amaray case with a reversible sleeve, so there will be two cover variants to choose from, and a 9-panel printed insert with liner notes and a mini-poster. It also includes a custom embroidered patch. There is no \"early-bird\" level because everyone is getting early-bird pricing -- we don't want anyone to feel like they missed out.\nPatches we did for the first two kickstarters\nPremium backers ($50) get everything in Basic, plus a packaging upgrade to a chipboard case with new original art by Mr. Sonoda and an artbook (approximately 180 pages in color and black&white) that fits in the case with the Amaray.\nSupreme backers ($75) get everything Premium backers get, plus a keychain designed by Mr. Sonoda and a personalized on-disc \"Rally Vincent Gun Safety Course\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code.\nThe embossed keychain we did for Bubblegum Crisis\nHere's a demo of how the custom easter-egg works on Otaku no Video:\nNitrous-Injected backers ($110) get everything the Supreme backers get, plus two additional rewards: a 30mm-scale polyurethane garage kit of Buff the Roadbuster, and a personalized on-disc \"Bean Bandit Offensive Driving School\" completion certificate, accessible via a custom easter-egg code. Note that Nitrous-Injected backers get both certificates!\nOriginal design drawing of Buff the Roadbuster\nPatron backers ($200) get everything Nitrous-injected backers get, plus their name also appears on a startup screen every time the disc is played (as part of the copyright screen; you can skip right to the menus).\nInspector Percy backers ($300) get everything Patrons get, plus they will receive one of the actual production check discs to test and keep -- and thus, be the first to see the (hopefully!) finished Blu-Ray.\nNote about Extra Copies: If you want an extra copy or two, don't worry; we will make addons available after the campaign ends (it's just simpler to do it that way rather than have a ton of different reward categories).\nSimilarly, we will be able to provide a limited number of assembled and painted car models -- and since we're making a 3D model as the first step in the production process, we may be able to do some custom 3D prints as well.\nSpecial Limited Reward Levels\nWe also have several special support levels that will gradually go down in price until someone snaps them up.\nCel backers get everything a Patron gets, plus one of 9 original Riding Bean production cels. Here are the cels:\nCel #3 was signed by Mr. Sonoda in 1996! (Click for larger version)\nSonoda Sketch backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they get a sketch of their favorite Riding Bean character or scene -- personally inscribed if desired.\nHere's an example of one of the sketches Mr. Sonoda did for backers of the Bubblegum Crisis set. Note that these kind of rewards will be shipped from Japan and customs duty may apply.\nIllustration backers get everything a Patron gets, plus they also get a full-color B4-size (250 x 353mm / 9.8 x 13.9\") original illustration Mr. Sonoda is creating for this release -- personally inscribed if desired. The number of rewards in this category will depend on what stretch goals are chosen and achieved -- see below for more details.\nHenchmen backers get everything Patrons get, plus have characters in Mr. Sonoda's manga modeled after them. Similarly, Innocent Bystanders have background characters modeled after them.\nAnd finally, the Criminal Mastermind backer gets everything a Patron gets, plus he/she gets listed as the Criminal Mastermind on the packaging! And we'll include 4 extra sets as well.\nOur shipping department will treat your rewards with great care...\nShipping Details\nOn this project, we're charging a shipping fee on all orders, as opposed to giving US backers \"free\" shipping (which isn't really free, it's just bundled in). One reason we're doing this is because it helps establish the correct customs value for international shipments.\nCustoms costs, VAT and \"processing fees\" are a major annoyance for international backers, and we want to do everything we can to minimize or eliminate this hassle. That's why we're pleased to announce that this project is EU and Canada-friendly.\nThis means that we'll be shipping copies directly to fulfillment houses in Canada and the UK (who will then reship to backers in the EU). The extra cost of doing this (and the customs fees we pay upfront) have been baked into the shipping charge on a country-by-country basis:\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $5 shipping.\nEverywhere else: $15 shipping.\nPremium Sets (and higher levels or multiple sets):\nUS: $7 shipping.\nCanada/UK/EU: $20 shipping.\nElsewhere: $25 shipping.\nShipping costs have had to rise since our previous projects because of increased costs. In particular, USPS First Class Mail International rates have hugely increased for packages over 8oz (and the Premium Set will be over 1lb).\nNote that the shipping cost is a flat rate; if you later add on extra sets or other goodies, the maximum shipping cost is the Premium Set cost.\nWe will ship to non-CA/EU international backers directly from the USA using USPS International First Class Mail. Backers in Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland and Norway should not have any extra fees because the price of the basic set ($25) is below the personal exemption for those countries.\nWe will check into possibly doing local fulfillment for countries with significant order sizes (based on previous projects, the most likely candidates are AU/NZ). Whether or not it is cost-effective depends on a lot of factors, but if it can save some money we'll either refund the difference or give credit that can be used for addons.\nWe have created a Customs Estimator spreadsheet that backers in other countries can use. If your country is not listed, we would greatly appreciate it if you could research how costs are calculated in your country and let us know so we can update it.\nYou can help tune this project...\nCrowdProduction\nAs with our previous limited-edition releases, there are going to be opportunities for you to get involved in the actual work of producing the set. Backers who do substantial work on the project will get credit on the packaging and on the disc, an IMDb listing, extra copies of the set for family and friends, and a special CrowdProduction bonus item.\nCrowdProduction opportunities include (but are not limited to):\nCleaning up and curating the images.\nTranslation of the commentary track(s).\nSubtitle proofreading.\nPackaging, Disc Art and Logo design.\nLiner Notes Research.\nArtbook Design.\nContact us when the project makes its basic goal if you're interested in taking on the challenge.\nHow it feels to manage a crowdfunding project...\nAchieved Stretch Goals\n$40,000 - REACHED IN 2 HOURS! New Sonoda artwork for the Amaray case sleeve. Mr. Sonoda will create a new cover illustration for the Blu-ray case. This stretch goal unlocks an \"Illustration\" reward that delivers the original artwork.\n$60,000 - REACHED IN 8.5 HOURS! New Riding Bean Manga. Mr. Sonoda will create a new 4-page manga ministory for the insert and artboook. This stretch goal unlocks 3 \"Henchman\" rewards -- backers will be used as models for characters in the manga (and knowing Sonoda, will probably die horribly) -- these rewards will go live at 4pm ET on Monday, March 7th.\n$90,000 - REACHED IN 3.1 DAYS! Japanese Commentary Track featuring Mr. Sonoda and 1-2 other Japanese commentators.\n$110,000 - REACHED IN 21 DAYS! Expanded Sonoda Riding Bean manga - 8 pages instead of 4; unlocked additional \"Henchman\" rewards\nRemaining Stretch Goals\n$130,000 - English Commentary Track with Anime Historian Gilles Poitras\n$135,000 - Reprint of Riding Bean Manga (in both digital form and in the artbook) - Reduced from $140k as a special thank-you!\n$170,000 - New Riding Bean Song by David Garfield and Phil Perry!\nYou've got questions... we've got answers...\nCan I sign up using PayPal?\nNow that the campaign has reached its basic goal, PayPal signup is available on our website. We ask that people only use this if they cannot back the project via Kickstarter.\nWhat about subtitles in other languages?\nA major reason the Bubblegum Crisis set had authoring delays was that it had so many subtitle tracks (6 languages x 2 variants) that it caused the authoring system to crash! So we'd prefer to keep it simple(r).\nCan I order extra copies?\nWe will make additional copies available (at a discount) as an add-on after the campaign ends.\nWhat about doing a Challenge Coin?\nWe love the challenge coin we did for Bubblegum Crisis, and we'd like to do one for Riding Bean as well, but we think it's best to do it as a separate add-on. After the campaign is over, we'll poll people to figure out how many would like a coin, and if it is feasible, we'll do one. Note that we are definitely doing a keychain, and the Bubblegum Crisis one came out great!\nCan I get one of the previous Limited Edition Kickstarter Blu-rays?\nYes! We still have a few of the Bubblegum Crisis Utimate Edition sets left, and you can still sign up for the Otaku no Video Otaking Edition, which is about to go into production!\nWho is running the project?\nRobert Woodhead is one of the founders of AnimEigo, one of the original wave of Anime releasing companies. Over the years AnimEigo has released hundreds of Anime and Samurai film titles in both dubbed and subtitled form. He's the creative and technical guy.\nUEKI Natsumi is Robert's wife and partner. She's a level-headed businesswoman who describes her career as \"a quarter-century of successfully preventing Robert from bankrupting the company.\"\nTrivia: Okada Toshio of Gainax once told us that \"Everyone wants to be the second person to do business with you.\" Riding Bean was the first title AnimEigo licensed directly from Japan; its success paved the way for everything that came later.\nCredits: Thanks to Google, Freepik, Vaadin, Dot on Paper, and Flaticon.com for icons used in the campaign graphics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are confident that we will be able to meet or beat the December release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays.

Local eateries will be given an ingredient to use in a culinary creation of their imagination. Judges and festival goers will visit each competitor in their native shop to taste and toast.\nRCHS will host a children's scavenger hunt called \"lions, tigers and bells.\" Participants will walk the historic streets of Troy and learn the identity and history of some of the most interesting exterior details of its Victorian architecture.\n Hudson Mohawk Industrial Gatewaywill host a steampunk trolley tour of Trojan history. \nTech Valley Center of Gravity (TVCOG) is presenting the 'Inventors Challenge' contestants and piting them against each other in races against time, space and gravity. \nThe Theater Institute at Sage will perform two showings of 'The Stinky Cheese Man' \nLight Up Troy Circus Theatrics will perform, walk on stilts and juggle for our crowds pleasure. \nThe Broken String Band, Rigliacci, Good Day for Upand many other musicians will take to the streets of Troy and fill the air with music. \nVendors and Crafterswill line the streets of the Enchanted City and sell their one of a kind wares. \nTCP (Troy Civic Players) will perform guerilla theater in the streets, audience participation is demanded!\nPlus we have an amazing after party with unbelievable musical guests and performers lined up:\n\nRasputina\nOur Headline Stars: Rasputina\nPioneers in the use of cello as the sole instrument within a rock band, Rasputina has been inspiring young string players to commit a number of musical sins since 1996. The group's concept was written as a manifesto, and manifested accordingly by directress Melora Creager as  a wily subterfuge for a plot to open audiences to adventure. The funny, the sad, the heavy, the tender-- it can all exist together.\n Employing elaborate costuming spanning a number of historical periods, Rasputina brings marginalized historical female figures and stories to light in the pop form, using archetypal\ncharacters such as Indian princesses, Hawaiian handmaidens and Medieval queens.\n Over the years, Rasputina has performed/recorded with Marilyn Manson, Porno For Pyros, Cheap Trick, Goo Goo Dolls and many others.

Note that when you pledge, there will be additional shipping charges for Canada and the EU above what's posted below. This should be clearly marked in the interface when you pledge.\nCOMPANY COMMANDER + $10 ($85.00 total) gets EVERYTHING: Pledge as a Company Commander, and add $10.00 for the RiPP tokens.

Pledge as a Commodore, and add $10.00 for the RiPP tokens.\nThose are our most popular pledge levels. Are you just here for the Maxims?\nSeventy Maxims  ($20 total) That's all you need to know, really. If you want that book, this is the pledge. Ignore the noise of the MAXIMILLIAN levels. They're broken.\nNow let's cover special cases and the broken things you can ignore (or un-pledge.)\nADMIRALS AND FIELD MARSHALS are spending $500 or more, and will get special treatment.

As long as you're backing at some level by the time we close, you'll be able to add funds afterward to ensure you get what you want.\nYour pledges have unlocked everything. Wow.\n Seriously. Wow.\nThe Planet Mercenary RPG is set in the Schlock Mercenary universe. Howard Tayler has been publishing Schlock Mercenary to the web since June of 2000. This science fiction setting is tooled up for those with a sense of humor and a sense of wonder, and the comic has been capturing reader imaginations for fifteen years now. The Planet Mercenary RPG is designed to let readers and non-readers alike exploit that depth as they role play stories of their own creation.\nThe Planet Mercenary book is an in-world artifact. The R&D team at the galaxy's largest independent reseller and distributor of weapons and materiel created this \"old-timey\" role playing book as a sneaky way to educate their clients' grunts, who are often unwilling to read briefing materials, let alone actual reference manuals. With this book those grunts will \"accidentally\" learn about their weapons, their enemies, and the places where they may draw their last breath. \n\nThe body of the book is written from the point of view of writers in the Planet Mercenary corporate office, and the margins are sprinkled with comments from the CEO, who was assured that the book absolutely would NOT go to print until the comments had been stripped.\nEarly draft of a page from the Sophonts section\nThe cards in the game will inform your role-play, flesh out your story, and add the Schlock Mercenary universe's ubiquitous humor to your game. \n(Not an actual MAYHEM deck. Thank you, Photoshop.)\nThey're drawn at random following roughly 25% of the player characters' successful skill checks or combat rolls. Here's a sample:\nThose cards are from the \"good, permanent\" and \"good, temporary\" categories. There are also \"bad, temporary\" and \"bad, permanent\" cards which you will learn to love just as much.\nHoward Tayler is the lead writer, canon-checker, and art director. He has fifteen years of writing and illustration experience in this setting, and countless hours of RPG play and GM experience in a dozen different settings and systems\nAlan Bahr is the game designer, and he both coordinates and runs the play-testing. He is intimately familiar with numerous RPG systems, though large portions of his resum\u00e9 remain redacted due to non-disclosure agreements.\nSandra Tayler is the operations chief, editor-in-chief, and production lead. She has overseen the packaging and delivery of tens of thousands of packages shipped to all seven continents.\nThis is not our first book. Howard and Sandra have published eleven print collections of Schlock Mercenary comics, plus XDM: X-Treme Dungeon Mastery (by Tracy and Curtis Hickman), two children's books, and more. \nThis is not our first Kickstarter. Howard and Sandra funded and delivered a very successful project back in 2013, which you can read about here. One deliverable was significantly delayed, but all the paid rewards went out on time.\nIf you're looking for crunchier information about the game, start with the Game-Play Primer page at schlocktroops.com, home of the Planet Mercenary RPG development team. \nA particularly popular post has been Howard's explanation of our design principles. For extra crunch, check out Howard's post on the D6\u00b3 Mayhem engine, and Alan's description of character generation. \nIf you need still more, the schlocktroops.com site has an RSS feed so you can stay apprised as we talk dice, stats, game theory, and post lots of samples from our work in progress. That site will be updated regularly long after this project closes.\nHoward can draw, yes, but just because he's been drawing Schlock Mercenary for 15 years doesn't mean his art style is right for this book. We have already begun contracting artwork, and Howard's job is to work with the artists and ensure that what they create fits the setting and the spirit of the book. \nIf you're familiar with the comic, think of it this way: The art in Schlock Mercenary is a caricature of the universe described in the Planet Mercenary RPG. The comic is a comic, the RPG is reality.\nHere are just a few of the pieces that have already come in.\nCaptain Murtaugh, by Rodolpho Langhi\nWe'll post more samples here as the project progresses, but the majority of that stuff is going to go up alongside our development notes at schlocktroops.com.\nThe Seventy Maxims book is a project that has been close to Howard's heart for a decade now. He's always meant for it to be an in-world artifact, and with this Kickstarter we can make it correctly.  \nThe book will be a hard-bound, saddle-stitched, 80-page volume with nice, sturdy paper. Seventy of those pages will have maxims on them, one per page, with some editorial commentary from the scholars working at the company responsible for creating the 3001CE Special Edition. The remaining ten pages will be front matter, introductory text, and stuff Howard hasn't thought up yet. \nAs an in-universe artifact, this book will be the copy that Karl Tagon received as a gift when he was a young enlistee. His handwritten notes will appear in the margins, as will the notes of various other people through whose hands the book has passed. Have a look!\nMockup of the page for Maxim 4\nWe do not plan to release this as a PDF as part of this Kickstarter. We realize that this may disappoint many of you, but the margin writing is an important part of the book's story, and we don't want to design that for both PDF and hard copy at this time. We might do a PDF or eBook at a later date, but that's not part of this project.\nWhat Does the Rest of This Stuff Look Like?\nWe're still in the design phase on the dice, but we've got suppliers lined up who can give us SIX custom faces rather than one. The current Mayhem die design is purple with bullet-pocks for pips and the MAYHEM text on the six. The non-Mayhem dice will probably be green with manufacturer logos on the six, and we might even do something to distinguish the two green dice from each other if you want to go house-rule crazy with permutations.\nHere's an early draft of the RiPP tokens. The $10 RiPP add-on gives you twenty of these. They'll be aluminum, anodized for color, and will be about the size of a US quarter (25mm in diameter, 3mm thick).\nEarly RiPP Token draft by Howard Tayler\n\n\nHere's what the pins and coins will look like (though there will be some tweaks, like the addition of the missing hyphen.)\nPin and coin proofs by Joey Visser, Signature Coins\n  Joey is the designer who did such brilliant work on our coins two years ago, and I'm happy to be entrusting him with the design work again this time around (though not for quite as many pieces of metal.)\n  We don't yet have images for the Game Chief Screen or the \"All The Ships To Scale\" art. The screen will be 6.5\"x26\", tri-fold. It's smaller than most screens, but it will have everything you need just a glance away.\nHere's a conservative take on our schedule. If it goes faster, that's nice. These are dates we're confident that we can hit while delivering a product that we'll be proud of and you'll be thrilled to own.\n\nApril-May 2015: Project launch! In the 34 days this project runs we'll be updating this page, polishing some rule text, and writing furiously.\nMid-May 2015: After we fund, we start contracting art. Writing and editing continues in parallel.\nAugust 2015: By August all of the commissioned art should be turned in, and the final writing should be done as well. At this point we begin editing and layout in earnest.\n\nNovember 2015: At this point the core book will be ready to be sent to the printer, and all other materials will ready for manufacture (some may have already been completed, but the book is the big one.)\nFebruary 2016: All product components have been manufactured and delivered to us. We begin building packages to ship to you.\n\nApril 2016: Your stuff arrives! \n\nThat's a twelve-month schedule. A year is a long time to wait, we know, but we'll keep this page updated as we plug away on this. \nWe want to create something that remains engaging for you and your players for years to come. Depending on the success of this project, that engagement will almost certainly include Planet Mercenary community pages for sharing your adventure designs, swapping custom equipment, and of course regaling each other with stories of grunts who beat all the odds (or who beat none of them repeatedly.)\nWe are also considering producing some of what the RPG industry calls \"splat-books.\" These would be additional source books that add playable races and additional equipment along with a collection of pre-made adventures in a set of new locations. We don't have a schedule for these yet, let alone pricing, but if this game works as well for you as it has for our play testers, we will all be wanting them.\nThis section might best be described as the \"we are not doing miniatures\" section. \nIf there's one thing we've learned over the last several years of making stuff, it's that a focused project is a more successful project. Here is a list of things that will not be included as stretch goals:\nMiniatures\nClothing\nComputer games\nMobile games\nBags\nDrinkware\nReplica Weapons\nAn MP3 Soundtrack\nKitchen Sinks\nWe might do T-shirts at some future date, but they're not part of this project. Similarly, while Sandra and Howard do have plans for more Schlock Mercenary themed items, like steins, shopping bags, and major appliances, those are not going to be bundled with this project. \nPlanet Mercenary needs, first and foremost, to be a fantastic role-playing book. We are going to spend all of our energy making sure that's what you get. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are three principal risks associated with this project:\n1) Team Complexity\n2) Print Complexity\n3) Unknown Unknowns\n\nTEAM COMPLEXITY: We're working with over a dozen illustrators to create this book. Each of those individuals plays an important role, and is creating things that we want to include. Any team this large and complex is going to run into schedule problems--computer failures, illness, etc. Our April 2016 delivery date accounts for some of this, and makes allowances for rotation of team members if necessary. \n\nMANUFACTURING COMPLEXITY: We're printing thousands of copies of the core book, 50 different cards, and if we hit our stretch goals we'll be making some other things as well. We will be working with at least four different manufacturers. Fortunately, we've worked with each of these manufacturers before, and are confident in their ability to deliver. There may still be schedule issues depending on the size of the final project, but these manufacturers have scaled way up for us in the past with minimum slippage.\n\nUNKNOWN UNKNOWNS: In the field of military intelligence, this is the stuff that sits outside of what we can make contingency plans for. All we can do is set aside time to make those contingency plans if the truly unexpected happens. We know that things we cannot plan for might happen, and we're prepared to adjust in order to deliver the project in spite of hurricanes, earthquakes, or alien invasions.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Final Update", "update_content": "Greetings Backers,\nPlanetmercenary.com has now been updated with a Shared Resources page and FAQ section.

Thomas Derringer Jr.\nA boy growing up in 19th-century upstate New York finds out that his father was a professional adventurer, and determines to pursue the same trade -- but where to begin?  That's the beginning of the story for Tom Derringer, only son of the late Jack Derringer.\nWhen I created Tom I set out to write a young adult steampunk adventure, but I got caught up in making it true to the period, and the result... well, it's not what I'd intended to write.\nFor one thing, I wrote it in the first person, with a narrator who is an educated (and slightly pompous) young New Yorker of the 1880s, so it's in the style of the 1880s, which most modern young readers won't find salubrious.\nFor another, I got caught up in my historical research, and while it's set in a world of lost cities, professional adventurers, secret societies, and so on, it's still a world very much like our own was in the 1880s, a world where Andrew Carnegie and Porfirio Diaz play the same roles they really did, and where science and technology generally (there are exceptions) don't diverge much from what was really possible at the time.  That's not exactly steampunk in the usual sense.\nThe style and the restraint made it impossible to sell to the major markets, but it is still a grand adventure story.  You can read the first chapter at http://www.watt-evans.com/tomderringer01.html\nIf we reach our target, I'll have the money to publish the novel, have it professionally edited by Deborah Hogan (who edited Vika's Avenger and several of my other novels), and commission a cover.

An historical event that YOU can help make happen!\nHave you ever wanted to hear and EXPERIENCE the music of Godzilla films live in concert? We have, and that is why we are embarking on this ambitious campaign. It is dedicated to honoring a dynasty of film composition at the culmination of three gigantic landmarks in Godzilla series lore. This concert has the approval of Toho Music and will be licensed through ASCAP (American Society of Composers Authors and Publishers). That is why \"Ifukube and Godzilla: A Musical Celebration\" needs your help.\nThis year marks the 60th anniversary of Godzilla. Additionally it is the centennial of the man who is known as being THE quintessential Godzilla music composer, Akira Ifukube. With the new interpretation of Godzilla hitting theaters nationwide on May 16th this year courtesy of Warner Brothers and Legendary Pictures, Godzilla\u2019s fans have a great reason to celebrate. And with the 100th birthday of Mr. Ifukube, fans can be a part of an event unlike any other. There has NEVER been a concert like this in North America and the time to celebrate the man and the monster is NOW.\nAkira Ifukube (1914-2006) was one of Japan's most famous classical composers. His most known works, however, are his wonderful scores for Tokusatsu (special effects) films for Toho (a genre also referred to as Daikaiju Eiga in Japan). While Mr. Ifukube worked with greats like Akira Kurosawa, it is his collaborations with director Ishiro Honda which gave birth to some of the most recognizable music in cinematic history. Credited as being one of Godzilla\u2019s founding fathers, the musical scores to these inventive but often misunderstood films have become an integral part of what makes them unique. Enhanced by Mr. Ifukube\u2019s unforgettable and dynamic themes, the Godzilla series has brought wonder and awe to audiences worldwide for sixty years.\nGodzilla Series Composer Akira Ifukube. Photo Courtesy of www.akiraifukube.org\nFor decades now, fans have been celebrating their love of the Godzilla character through fanzines, conventions, and film screenings. The longest running and most successful convention has undoubtedly been G-FEST, a wonderful show that is fun for people and fans of all ages.\nSince the mid-1990s, it has been the absolute epicenter for western fans of the genre to come together and meet special guests from Japan, attend movie screenings, and enjoy like-minded company. Twenty years and twenty conventions later, the show is going stronger today than ever before. Last year saw attendance of over 2000. That is what makes this opportunity so momentous and there is no better place to have it than in conjunction with G-FEST on the weekend of July 11-13th, 2014. For more information about G-FEST please visit www.g-fan.com\nDid you know that Akira Ifukube himself created Godzilla's famous roar and footsteps through the use of a contrabass and a primitive sound amplifier respectively? These sounds were then manipulated afterward into the cacophony of fury that we know today! Let's take a look at what his orchestral notation looked like for those two things!\nIfukube's Hand-Written Manuscript for the Creation of the Roar and Footsteps of Godzilla. Photo Courtesy of Erik Homenick at www.akiraifukube.org\nThe job of reconstructing the music of Akira Ifukube is that of composer and co-producer John DeSentis. John has an intimate knowledge and understanding of Mr. Ifukube's style (Ifukube being one of John's everlasting influences) and has once before provided his music for an orchestra to perform. In 2007 The Austin Wind Symphony, now known as The Cinematic Symphony, asked John to arrange a suite of music from Akira Ifukube's legendary score to KING KONG VS. GODZILLA for their annual \"Creature Features\" concert program. This was a rare treat at the time because Mr. Ifukube's score to that film was almost entirely excised in the American release. \n\nAs an example, John has provided a midi-version of the reconstructed \"Main Titles\" from GODZILLA (1954). Please excuse the quality of the midi as this is not meant to represent the true sound of the orchestra but rather a small taste of what is ahead.\nTHE NITTY GRITTY:\n\n$25,000 is a lot of money. But it's also not a lot of money. Not when you consider what it takes to produce an event like this. Where does that money go? Music of this caliber needs first class musicians and those don't come free. First and foremost, you need that orchestra because unfortunately the local high-school marching band won't quite make the cut.\nIfukube is seen on the far left playing violin with the Sapporo Philharmonic String Quartet in 1933. Photo Courtesy of www.akiraifukube.org\nProfessional musicians are worth every penny. They are highly skilled, able to sight read with ease, and are the single most important element in making this music move. They take what is written and through years of dedicated practice and education, literally form something out of nothing. Those notes can look pretty on paper, but themes of our favorite Kaiju come to true life with booming brass and sublime strings. Then there is cartage fees (that piano won't walk itself to the venue), instrument rental, audio set-up, renting the venue for rehearsals plus the main event, and don't think for one second that those chairs and music stands appear out of nowhere! \nAkira Ifukube's Personal Violin.

More musicians, some cool bells and whistles, anything to bring the experience to the next level for everyone.\nPutting on this concert will be a mammoth operation and no easy task. None of this will be possible without your generosity and support in raising the necessary funds to put on this show. Our funding will be able to cover all costs associated with the event. No donation is too big or too small. There is a funding tier that is appropriate to everyone's budget, but donations alone are only as good as how far and wide the word spreads on this event. So don't be shy about bombarding your social media with a link to this page every single day during the month-long campaign!\nREWARDS:\nSo what does your generosity get YOU, the backer? If you navigate to our rewards section, you will see that we are offering truly one-of-a-kind keepsakes and collectables that will ONLY be available to our backers. None of it will ever be for sale in any way after this campaign is done and they will only be made if we reach our goal. And lets be honest, how many opportunities are you gonna get to have an exclusive art-print by Bob Eggleton?!!? For our top backers attending the concert, you will also enjoy premium seating at the event.\nA recent example of Bob Eggleton's work for the IDW Godzilla comic book series. NOTE: This is NOT the print that will be made available for backers.\n\n\nFor the fans of Mr. Ifukube's music who are unable to make it to the live event, your generous donation qualifies you to own a CD or DVD of this once-in-a-lifetime event that is EXCLUSIVE to project supporters. These recordings are STRICTLY for posterity and non-profit purposes and will ABSOLUTELY NOT BE FOR SALE. They will allow you to enjoy the event at your leisure, for years to come. \nAkira Ifukube in the recording studio with a good friend. Photo Courtesy of www.akiraifukube.org\n\nBut that's not all. In the event of our project becoming successfully funded, we're gonna tell you how you can get a hold of some exclusive swag from Legendary Pictures relating to their upcoming Godzilla film as well as some cool toys from companies like X-Plus and Bandai.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE:\n\nFriends, whether or not this concert happens is entirely up to YOU. It is a show being put on for the fans, by the fans. It is dependent upon your support, generosity, and spreading of the word. We all have a unique chance to be a part of something special. It's a huge undertaking yes but ONE thing is certain: if this project reaches it's funding goal, then G-FEST in Chicago is THE place to be in July!\n\nAnd you will have helped to create something that will go down as a massive, powerful, and memorable event.\nPhoto Courtesy of www.akiraifukube.org\n A VERY special thanks goes out to Erik Homenick and his web page www.akiraifukube.org.

Spoor", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Phoenix Project is the effort to bring new life from a world laid waste, the name given to an idea that would not be silenced, an idea whose time has come. The idea that a game is more than just a game or a revenue stream. It is a community, a home. Missing Worlds Media, Inc. was the first element of this idea, founded by the project to provide the foundation, the structure for that effort.\nMissing Worlds Media presents City of Titans, the superhero MMORPG being developed by The Phoenix Project in the spirit of City of Heroes. Our goal is to deliver a unique massively multiplayer online roleplaying game, created from the community of a lost universe, to build a new community for a new world. A brave new world containing a wealth of player choices, from costumes to powers, it continues the traditions found in its spiritual predecessor, daring to reach for new innovations no other game will touch, while standing firmly on the feel and spirit of the old. Players will be able to choose their own adventure, tell their own tales, and have their own agency in a superhuman world.\nCity of Titans is set in a world where there is always hope, even in the darkest of times. The tradition of brightly colored costumes, brilliant heroics, and daring struggles to stand against the shadows cast during times of darkness and corruption. New heroes, your heroes, rise to make their mark on the world while their villainous counterparts lurk in the corners of alleys, behind governments, and even in the boardrooms of the wealthiest corporations. Humanity honors the fallen, and takes inspiration from the selfless sacrifices of heroes who have gone before.\nIt is an age where heroic ideals stand tall, where words such as \"truth,\" \"justice,\" \"freedom,\" and \"honor\" have never lost their meaning. And it is an age where a villain may rise to power despite the heroes, where epic clashes of good vs evil are as common as seeing a brilliant costume fly through the sky on the way to save a kitten stuck in a tree. The world stands on the brink of change, at a time when magic, high technology and incredible scientific feats bring out the best and worst in the everyday human being. Individuals with supreme strength of will and training can become forces of good or evil. Heroes with astounding powers patrol the streets and skies alongside those whose only special abilities are the dedication in their hearts. Villains scheme and plot with the help of scoundrels and rogues, caring only for power, wealth or control - their motives are their own and dynamic battles between the two sides are frequent.\nOne city has risen above the rest as a place where costumed heroes are welcomed, where devious villains seek to add to their roster of minions. In Titan City, the opening setting, an old guard stands watch on both sides. They have issued calls to action, welcoming new heroes to their ranks and inviting old heroes to return to duty. New villains mask themselves amongst the rich and famous along with the poor and destitute, while experienced evil-doers lure the unsuspecting with words of clever cynicism.\nDo you have what it takes to join the ranks of good? Or will you choose to stand in the shadowed courts of villainy?\nBring the City of Titans to life.\nThey said there was no chance. They said we should find a new home. We have. We just made it ourselves. Because we dare to think the impossible.\nWe are heroes. This is what we do.\nKickstarter offers new opportunities for what would previously have been impossible without the demanding hand of a publishing studio. Thanks to Kickstarter, new ideas, new approaches, and new innovations can be developed, ones which do not fit the traditional model of investment. And, luckily for us, new studios can develop projects that no publisher would take on.\nThrough Kickstarter, the customers have direct access to the creative group, allowing new companies with fresh ideas to prove their concepts to their future customers. This in turn results in products which remain true to the vision of the developing studio, and true to the expectations of the players. The chance for a studio to make the game they know is ready to be made, that new and innovative idea, or an old idea which has been forgotten in the publisher push for the latest trend. Star Citizen. Shadowrun Returns. Even Double Fine Adventure. No traditional game funding source would have taken those on. But they\u2019re coming, and so are many, many more.\nIf the customer does not want what is being offered, they simply find somewhere else to spend their money. But, as these other offerings have shown, people know what they want. And thanks to Kickstarter, they can speak directly to the studios. Gone are the days of conventions past, when publishers would taunt the audience. \u201cDo you want Megaman? Show us twenty dollars!\u201d And while the audience, their customers, would wave money in the air, it never came.\nNow, it\u2019s simple. Want to prove that your game has an audience? Put it to the test. If the public wants it, it will get funded. Mighty No. 9 is funded at nearly three million dollars, now. All thanks to people like you, who know when something deserves to be built.\nWhen we lost our City, no amount of traditional investment would bring it back. The safe money for MMORPG investment goes to traditional titles, revamped versions of classic fantasy realms, grind-fests featuring pay-to-win, or ones tied to popular role-playing, movie, print or television properties.\nThe Phoenix Project is none of these things. It is a new home for the heroic spirit, but not a clone or replica. We have an opportunity here to build a modern game, respectful of the play style, lessons, and fun of the old game, while taking advantage of the more than ten years of industry development since our spiritual predecessor started development.\nCity of Titans is a game rising from the death of another, being built by the community for the community. Kickstarter gives the opportunity for such a project, one designed by the people who enjoyed the game, to see the light of day. It enables you to be directly involved with the making of this game, which ultimately is for you in the first place.\nAfter all, a game without players is not much of a game at all.\nThe vibrant, thriving metropolis of Titan City is home to costumed crooks and crimefighters of every imaginable description, and some you won't believe until you see them!  From the shining, sun-washed spires of its skyscrapers to the depths of its desolate slums, this city forms the stage on which these larger-than-life characters play out their adventures.  As you explore Titan City, you\u2019ll encounter beautiful vistas, from glorious Art Deco monuments to villain-dominated broken tenements to ultra-high-tech bio-domes to much more.  Forged in the ashes of a devastating fire and tempered by decades of superpowered danger, Titan City enjoys a rich and engrossing history.  It shines as a beacon of hope and opportunity to those who seek justice, a magnet for those who want to make themselves rich and famous - an irresistible lure to those who would do evil!\nYou never know who you might meet around the next corner in Titan City.  It's inhabitants range from heavily armed gangsters to honor-bound dinosaur men to reclusive spell-slingers, not to mention plenty of \u201cordinary\u201d citizens with their own mysteries for you to solve and stories to explore.  Titan City is more than just a blank game board.  It is a living canvas, rich in history and detail, and you hold the artist\u2019s brush.\nTo support this, we needed a solid grasp of how to reach this ambitious goal.\nPlayers will find their choices built around a flexible framework. Instead of the typical class based system found in some games, or the skill based system found in others, our focus has been on attitudes. How do you want to do, what you want to do? Pick that, and we give you all the powers we can. Players pick a primary power, with that power determining the options available for their secondary powers. Then as you progress, and level up, you grow these powers as well as gain new ones. And even further, we let you customize those powers with a signature style, your Mastery, that enhances and alters how all your powers behave.\nThat approach, a flexible framework, is how we approached most design decisions. Powers are split into effect and animation, allowing us to mix and match to offer more to the player. You pick \"Fireball.\" You then pick how you want to throw this fireball, from the hand, mouth, a wand, or a 12-gauge shotgun. Same power, different look, all through the framework designed with our custom Socket System. Even two people with optic blasts can have their own unique look, depending on the powers chosen, the colors selected, the effects added and the animations picked for the power.\nThe goal in the end is to give you the ability to create your character. Want to be a vine swinging Amazon warrior who attacks by using her hair as a whip? We're working on that. Want to be the wizard warrior with a pet raven who can spit fire? It\u2019s in the cards.\nBut, powers and characters do not an RPG make. There needs to be a story. Unlike a traditional CRPG, MMORPG's are notable for growing over time. What we have done is conceptualize what we want our game to be like at 5-years post-release, and worked backwards to our initial beta release, planned for in mid-to-late 2015. By having that years-in-the-future target, we can design the systems, stories and plotlines now with that in mind.\nTo build these plots, we have plans to build the tools necessary. But, our plans for these tools is to make them available for you to create your own stories, plots and schemes as well, and to share them with other players. The era of user generated content is here. Rather than try to integrate a system on top of the system used by the developers, our plan is to create a system which is used by both players and developers. Show us your creativity.\nWe will make the framework, you will bring it to life.\nPeople have asked what the plan for the money raised with this Kickstarter.\nWe have been working together for over a year now. During this time, various tools have been tested, telling us what works, what doesn\u2019t and what we need.\nOur first expense is the cost of the Kickstarter itself. This goes to various companies such as Amazon, to Kickstarter, as well as the cost of the perks and add-ons. This comes to about 10% of the total.\nThen there are taxes, which we estimate can run us up to 12% of the total. \nSo, before anything else, we\u2019re out $70,000.\nSince we are developing the game using the Unreal Engine, and the Kickstarter counts as revenue, we owe Epic Games, the company which makes the Unreal Engine royalties. That comes to about $70,000, as well.\nWe\u2019re rounding up, of course, and estimating based on the best numbers we have available. By rounding up, we buy margin in case an unexpected cost, tax or fee enters the picture.\nThis cuts $140,000 right off the top, leaving $180,000 to actually build the project.\nThat $180,000 is mostly going straight to software. \nAutodesk's Maya and 3DS Max. They\u2019re not cheap, and we need them to do the work. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses, and we need at least 24 copies for the art and tech teams to be able to do their jobs. There are several different versions, each targeting different levels of needs, and the 24 total copies are split between the various members to their need, based on the tasks they have.\nWe\u2019ll need multiple copies of a few tools like zbrush, Allegorithmic, 8DIO, Photoshop and Illustrator.\nThen we have the costs for the website servers and bandwidth. The more you love us, the more expensive it\u2019s going to get.\nAnd, finally, a little cash to put a tax lawyer, book keeper and legal professional on retainer. Purely fee for service, but they will pay for themselves in troubles solved and money saved.\nThere are a few smaller items, such as RAM for some rendering, some 3D mice, drawing tablets, depending on individual artist needs.\nAnything that makes us produce better and faster.\nIf we go beyond that with stretch goals? Additional middleware to help us make the game. Purchasing of assets, saving our team the time needed to develop. Licensing premade systems from other game developers. There is a world of options out there, and all of it means we make a better game for you.\nBut what about the flipside, how do we expect to support this game once it ships?\nThis game has to pay for itself. As an employee owned and community driven effort, we had a meeting and came to some conclusions. There were a few people that felt the game should be free for all, but the numbers just do not work for it. Once the game ships, it will need people working full time to support it, and it will cost us in hardware, software, and bandwidth. It is unrealistic for any game company being developed and promoted in this way to deliver the option of a free game for everyone, forever. It had to be put aside.\nWe do not, at this time, have any plans or ambition of putting this game in physical stores. The costs for doing so puts that out of reach of independent game developers. However, a collector's edition is possible down the line. \nTo support the game, we will be charging for what we call 'the box.' It may be a purchase via an online service such as Steam or through our website, but there will be a fee for the game itself. This fee, however, will effectively cover the first three months of subscription. There's some simple reasons for why. First, it means that people who come into the game to grief or farm gold, are essentially paying us to ban them. And if they want to come back again and again, they're limited by the costs they incur. Secondly, and more pragmatically, it means the people playing the game will, at least in theory, be able to use our cash shop.\nYes, we are going to have a cash shop, but we're going to hold very tightly to certain rules. 1: A good value for money. 2: No Pay To Win. 3: Something for Everyone. We're going to want you to use it, but we're going to want you to want to use it, too.\nAs for Subscriptions, yes, the plan is to offer them, but not require them. Once you have purchased the game, you can play the game. You will get a few months of the VIP Subscription with your game purchase off the bat, and will have the option of continuing to subscribe, or to play as a free player and purchase from the cash shop a la carte. The final details of the VIP Subscription are not hammered down, but some areas are settled: At no time will you lose access to something you had access to and VIP Subscribers will get a stipend for the cash shop of greater value than the cost of the subscription.\nOne of the ideas we have passed around is that Subscribers get assured access to issue betas. They might get earlier access to new powersets as well. We're going to find the right thing to do, and we're going to make sure it's fair for everyone.\nAt all points in the budgeting and the post-launch support, the goal is to focus on results, what will give us the most bang for the buck. Autodesk software is expensive, but offers plug-ins, extensions and tools which greatly improve the speed at which we can work. By selling the initial install of the game for the price of a few months subscription we can keep the servers running once we launch without forcing a monthly subscription on to our players.\nBecause in the end, that is who we are making this for, you, the player.\nMissing Worlds Media is a virtual studio, staffed entirely by volunteers. We met online, shortly after it was announced that the doors were to close on the game which we had played and enjoyed for years. When a campaign to prevent the closure was sadly unsuccessful, we turned our efforts to creating a new home, where those heroes, vigilantes and villains left homeless could once again defend \u2013 or take-over \u2013 an entirely new world.\nWe have over 100 developers on our books, working on everything from organisation, business, marketing, artists, modellers, composition, coding and programming, PR, web development, law, social media, forum moderation, community outreach, HR, music, financial planning, gameplay, sponsorship, mini-games, powers and combat, progression and rewards, world-building \u2013 including the history of our universe, city districts, factions, and NPCs, graphic design, language translation and localization, accessibility, user interface, props and places.\nWe are headed up by S. Quinn, our elected president, the glue who holds us all together. She has 15 years of Process Efficiency experience, and has a passion for making systems work without sacrificing the human element. She is also a longtime comics and superhero fan, who has been attending fan conventions since she was fifteen years old.\nShe is supported by Chris Hare, our lead developer. Chris has a long pedigree of both comic fandom and video games, from working behind a comic shop counter to being involved with a company called InVideo Systems back in the days of Nick Arcade - kinect style gaming back in 1990. Chris\u2019 connections all over the world have helped fill out the studio, as well as the ability and desire to help people work together that resulted in Paragon Studios making Chris a founding member of PERC (Player Events Resource Committee). Chris was a part of City of Heroes(r) from beta to shutdown, and has gone on to embody the vision of the Phoenix Project.\nWhen dealing with complex systems, it is good to have a rocket scientist onboard, or at least someone who has worked with them. We are lucky enough to have Nate \u201cDoctor Tyche\u201d Downes, our tech lead \u2013 one of the founding developers of Gentoo Linux, his technical background includes UI systems, operating system kernels, and yes, he has even worked with rocket scientists, helping to design launch system proposals. This is complemented by work he has done in the the world of film and TV, with several credits to his name including Time and Fate, Phobia and December. His beard has managed to achieve a cult following of it's own amongst our community, even without the help of our PR team.\nOur husband-and-wife team head up our game design and art departments, ensuring a close relationship between both departments at all times. David Bolack is a programmer and systems administrator, which comes coupled with his experience as a role playing game designer. He has worked on titles including Mage: Dark Ages, the Exalted Player's Guide, True20 Adventure Roleplaying, and Nobilis. Jen Bolack has served us beautifully as art lead, as her eye for detail and perfection, based in her experience in set design, heterodynes with her skills with 3D art programs. Her vision, and the talents of those under her command, have helped to give City of Titans a familiar but evolved look that will set it above the other superhero MMOs currently on the market.\nOur composition team is one of our largest, and already they have been prolific enough that we have years of content just waiting to be bought to life. We're very proud to have Kaylan \"SithRose\" Lyndell-Lees on the team, who spent years as a leader in White Wolf's live action roleplaying organization, the Camarilla, but she's only one among many. We've got more, and they all have their stories to tell \u2013 we have published authors, experienced role players, journalists, even college professors, all working together to create a world with a carefully-woven history, populated by unique characters, even before our players get to start creating their own tale in-game.\nOur funding and support team \u2013 well, that'd be you. From the outset, Missing Worlds Media have done everything we can to make sure we're building a game that you'd like to play, and a world you want to be a part of. Our community have done everything they can to support us, and to make sure that we're on the right track. They have told us if there's something we haven't got quite right. They have cheered for us when we've hit the nail on the head. Many of them have gone on to become signed-up volunteers on the project, because their advice has just been THAT good.\nWe are not legends - we are not rock stars of the gaming world - we are players, coders, writers, artists, technicians, engineers. We come from all walks of life. We are motivated. We have the capabilities, the skills and a growing community behind us. And with your help, we are going to make a new world, and then we\u2019re going to let you save it - or try and take it over.\nThe future is in your hands.\n\n\n                  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an all-volunteer effort, we have already had our fair share of mishaps. We have had setbacks; from game engine licensing to loss of precious volunteer hours, we have persevered past them each and every time. \n\nFrom the beginning we've worked towards a professional outlook, always keeping in mind that every person involved is doing so at their ability to do so. This does mean that we have to prepare for the eventual loss of availability for any volunteer, from jobs, new responsibilities in their home life, school, etc. As a result we have people able to pick up for any single person at all times. \n\nIt also means we have a larger than average group of volunteers, which we have sorted into central volunteers, those who have the time to dedicate dozens of hours per week to the project, and community volunteers who have time to help out every so often or who have talents which we have too many volunteers for, but otherwise are simply more active members of the community. Any single person may move between the two, and many often times do. We have had artists who were able to volunteer heavily in January who then had school pop up in February who became available again in July. We have writers who suffer from writers block for months on end but then inspiration hits and become writing machines. At every point, we have a large pool of people who are available to pick up slack.\n\nTo manage this balance, we have a pool of people who act as coordinators, managers of the volunteers. These core people have been with the project for a long time, who understand the goals, and who have the time to dedicate to a full-time volunteer effort. For many, this is a second job, occupying as much time as full-time employment while others have this as their main focus. And they do this not for a paycheck, but for the drive to get this completed. This core group is the heart and soul of the project. While some have had to step back, every one of them works with a second, someone able to step in should the worst case happen. We jokingly call it \"Bus insurance\" as in, if the person steps in front of a bus, there is someone able to step in at a moments notice. We have only needed to use this a few times, not for anything so drastic as a death, but due to unexpected events in our real lives such as paying jobs taking over free time that had been set aside for the project or an illness in the family.\n\nDelays can happen in any project. We had hoped to be further ahead now, but things happen. We have always been honest when issues arose, such as when we had to change our game engine due to licensing issues. We come from a larger community, and are here for you, the player. Life happens, it stinks when it does, but we understand it, and adapt to it. \n\nWe are learning to find a balance without hurting the progress of the project. We learned to roll with the punches, and incorporate the changes in a way which made us better for it. \n\nThe key is communication on all levels. It is when communication breaks down that the real problems happen, and that is why we work our hardest to keep up the flow of information. Things happen, everyone knows that. But when something does happen, we figure out why it happened and how to address it. Then we let the community know. We don't hide when issues happen, we just persevere to make sure it does not happen again.

Chapter One of THE WAY INTO CHAOS is posted right here on my blog.\nA Strange Beginning:\nIf you've watched the video you know this trilogy started as a homeschool project for my son and me. I introduced a language arts unit that had him planning, writing, and revising a fantasy \"novel.\" Because there was no way he would tackle such a big project on his own, I agreed to do one along with him.\nFor him, the end result was a 10,000-word comic fantasy that I published on my website (and I paid him a penny a word for the privilege). For me, the end result was a planned 120,000-word novel that ballooned into a 350,000-word trilogy.\nEpic fantasy, go figure.\nThis is an adventure fantasy written for adults, full of chases, cliffhangers, fight scenes, weird magic, and the threat of human extinction. At the same time, it's a story I would not hesitate to hand to my own pre-teen son.\nAn Empire At Its Peak:\nOne of the long-standing tropes of epic fantasy is the Fallen Empire: a nation that once ruled most of the known world but has since vanished, leaving only scattered ruins (and a common language for the characters to speak). Essentially: Rome. I thought it would be interesting to write about the fall of one of those fantasy empires, especially since it would give me the chance to show just how awful they could be.\nThe capital is Peradain, a city that controls a very specific trade route: every generation a portal opens and the Peradaini are visited by a delegation from a race of powerful, ageless beings called The Evening People. The royal family puts on a huge festival with feasting and music, theater and acrobatics... anything that might please their guests. In exchange, before the delegation returns home, they teach the humans a single magic spell. \nThe Peradaini empire was built with this monopoly on magic. \nThe Story Opens:\nThe first book opens on the morning of the next Festival. Food has been laid out, musicians and other performers await their turn on the stage, and the royal family is dressed in their finest clothes at the front of the dais. Everyone is nervous and excited, hoping they will impress their guests and receive a really powerful spell.\nThen the portal opens and, instead of the expected delegation, monsters charge through.\nThe king and queen are killed in moments. The city falls in a day. As the empire collapses into civil war, the otherworldly invaders spread across the continent, destroying every human they can find.\nWere these monsters unleashed on Peradain accidentally or was it a deliberate attack by The Evening People? And how can they be stopped before they wipe out human beings entirely?\nWhat do you get when you pledge?\nWith all the unlocked stretch goals, there are additional pledge reward that are not listed in the sidebar on the right. Let me run down them quickly:\nEveryone who pledges at $12 or higher will get ebook copies of three extra books. Two are novels and one is a short fiction collection. See Stretch Goal: Text and Stretch Goal: Mask for more details.\nEveryone who pledges at $30 or higher will get a second FATE Core game supplement, for the urban fantasy novel A KEY, AN EGG, AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK, which is one of the unlocked stretch goal novels.\nEveryone who pledged at any level will get desktop wallpaper art mentioned in Stretch Goal: Monitor and the music offered in Stretch Goal: You.\nThere are other prizes in Stretch Goal: You that have yet to be unlocked. Check them out.\nAdded: New Reward Levels:\nPer your requests, I've added new pledge levels below for people who want to receive the entire trilogy in trade paperback. Now you can get the whole series signed or pristine, depending on your preference.\nStretch Goal: You\nThat's it! We've unlocked all the stretch goals I can swing. However, maybe there's a stretch goal you would like to create? A piece of art, or music, or fiction that you would like to share with the backers? Check out Update 14 for more details.\nAlready offered:\nAn expanded Voidcallers (aka Twenty Palaces) role playing game using the FATE system\nMusic (UNLOCKED!)\nAudio fiction\nA Voidcallers/Twenty Palaces writeup for a game set during Napoleon's invasion of Egypt\nAnother one set during WWI, w/ possible Pathfinder stats, too!\nanother novel\nthree Twenty Palaces fanfic short stories\nThere might be even more since I posted this. Check them out and maybe add your own!\nStretch Goal: Image (Unlocked)\nGoal reached! We reached the target of $34,000. The books will have Christian McGrath covers! \nI've already managed to convince artist Priscilla Spencer, who has created maps for Jim Butcher, Saladin Ahmed, Kevin Hearne, and Myke Cole, to create a map for this project. So I know the inside of the books will look just as good as the outside. \nThere's a little more detail in Update 4.\nStretch Goal: Text (Unlocked)\nGoal Reached! Everyone who pledged at the SPEAR level or higher gets the extra books described below!\nIf we reach 50 new backers counting from Monday morning, September 30th, all backers at the SPEAR OF THE EMPIRE level and above will receive DRM-free ebook copies of:\nTWENTY PALACES, the prequel to the series I published with Del Rey\nTHE TWIN SWORDS OF ZORDAIN, the short, funny comic fantasy that my son wrote for his part of the homeschool project that started this whole thing. I have managed to convince the wonderful fine artist and children's book illustrator Kathleen Kuchera to do the cover.\nA KEY, AN EGG, AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK, my pacifist urban fantasy with the working title \"The Auntie Mame Files.\" Artist Duncan Eagleson has agreed to do the cover, but I'll talk more about about the book in a future update.\nFor more about this stretch goal--and which new backers count toward the total--check Update 5.\nStretch Goal: Key (Unlocked)\nGoal reached! Everyone who pledged at $30 and above will receive a second FATE Core supplement!\nIf we reach 850 backers total, everyone who pledged at $30 level or higher will receive a FATE Core supplement for the setting of A KEY, AN EGG, AN UNFORTUNATE REMARK, the pacifist urban fantasy promised in Stretch Goal: Text.\nStretch Goal: Monitor (Unlocked)\nGoal reached! We passed 925 backers so everyone is getting desktop wallpaper of the cover and map art!\nIf we reach 925 backers, everyone who pledges at the $12 level or higher will receive the Chris McGrath cover art for all three books as desktop wallpaper, and also the map that Priscilla Spencer is creating (here's a map she created for Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series) and also the cover art created for my son's novella by fine artist and children's book illustrator Kathleen Kuchera.\nStretch Goal: Mask (Unlocked)\nGoal reached! We passed 1,000 backers with 33 hours left to go, so everyone who pledged at $12 or above will get an ebook copy of my upcoming short fiction collection.\nIf we reach 1,000 backers, everyone who pledges at the $12 level or higher will receive an ebook copy of my upcoming short story collection, which will include the Twenty Palaces short story \"The Homemade Mask\" (along with other unreleased fiction).\n-----\nStretch Goal Art:\nThis project started as a homeschool unit and it continues to be one. My son made this artwork to show the progress of the stretch goals.\nChris McGrath covers unlocked!\nEveryone gets an extra book!\nYour Support:\nYour support will help bring this project to life. Your pledges will pay for cover art, interior art (an epic fantasy needs a map!), copy editing, typesetting, ISBNs, and more. That will make the difference between a book created by a guy who only real skill is telling stories and a book that has clearly been prepared by a team of professionals.\nPlus, you get to read my new book before anyone else.\nThank you very much.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I mentioned in the video, the first draft of the entire trilogy is written.

Spoor", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Story\nBack in 1971, in high school, I started planning out a setting -- Ragbaan, the oldest city on a far-future colony planet, with twelve thousand years of history. It was built by a high-tech civilization that collapsed into barbarism, then recovered, and has gone through this cycle several times, until the remaining old technology is considered magic -- in fact, the terms \"tech\" and \"magic\" are used interchangeably -- and the city is a patchwork of ancient glories and modern improvisations. Half-drowned skyscrapers stand in the harbor, airships provide intercity transport, and the city is run by assorted guilds and factions, with no functioning central government.\nI thought this was cool, but it was decades before I finally came up with the story I wanted to set there -- Vika's Avenger.\nIt's the story of a young man named Tulzik Ambroz who comes to Ragbaan looking for the man who murdered his sister.  The only tool he has to find a single individual in a city of three million is the portrait his sister drew of the man who would later kill her.\nHe's lucky enough to find the information brokers Azl and Hrus, and to catch the interest of a creature called the Ilm, but will that be enough?\nAnd if he finds the killer, what will he do about it?\nWhy I'm Here\nI'm an award-winning author with more than forty novels to my name, but no New York publisher wanted this one.  \"It's science fantasy,\" they said.  \"We don't know how to market that.\"\nUm... John Carter of Mars is science fantasy.  Star Wars is science fantasy.  Hundreds of the classic pulp stories are science fantasy.  Apparently, though, the folks in New York have forgotten how to market the stuff if it doesn't have a major motion picture attached.  Most of the editors my agent approached wouldn't even read it.  No one ever said it wasn't a good story, only that they didn't know how to market it.\nI think it's a cool story, and I bet you will, too, marketing or not.  Aliens, airships, secret societies, genetic engineers...\nSo help me publish it, and you'll get to read it!  Not to mention some of the cool extras.\nThanks!\nA little dialogue to whet your appetite.\nStretch Goals:\nNow that we're funded, what else can we do?\nWell, here are a few ideas:\n$8,000:  The cover and interior will be professionally laid out, and there will be a frontispiece.  Made it!\nActually, I think we're looking at a total of three pieces of interior art.\n$10,000:  More interior illustrations!  Details not yet determined, but if we reach this total there will be interior art, in black and white, in addition to the three illustrations already promised.  Backers who are getting the ebook will receive them as separate PDF files; they will not be incorporated directly into the ebooks.\n$12,000:  I'll write an appendix, \"A Traveler's Guide to Ragbaan,\" which will be included in the book.  This will describe a few of the city's features; since I haven't written it yet, I don't know just what it'll say.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe novel is entirely written, but I need money for a professional editor and a decent cover -- the more money pledged here, the better the cover artist I can afford. (No, I can't use the Pulp-O-Mizer cover I have here; even if I had the rights, the resolution isn't anywhere near good enough.)\n\nI have an editor lined up -- Deborah Hogan, who edited several of my novels for Del Rey, back when. I've talked to a few artists, and found out what they would charge, but I'd need more than my minimum for most of them -- much more, for some -- and I haven't worked with any of them before, so commissioning the artwork will be uncharted territory for me.

I don't foresee any problems -- but of course, by definition, the unforeseen can crop up anywhere.\n\nBecause I'll be working with artists, and things can always go wrong, I can't promise delivery by a specific date, but I think I can promise everything will indeed get delivered.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "New editions", "update_content": "Hi, folks!\nI know, I said I was all finished, but...\nSeveral people, including me, thought the type in Vika's Avenger was a bit small for those of us with older eyes; I am pleased to report that a new edition with larger print (still not all that large) has been uploaded to Amazon, and should be available shortly."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Tidying Up", "update_content": "Hello, folks!\nI am pleased to report that the audiobook of Vika's Avenger is now available at http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Vikas-Avenger-Audiobook/B00NUD8S94/ref=a_search_c4_1_3_srTtl?qid=1411709895&sr=1-3 \nAlso, the reader (Paul Licameli) caught a grand total of fifteen small mistakes in the text, mostly punctuation typos.

Once the project closes you can add more money and get as many coins as you care to. We'll mint whatever you need. If you can't make up your mind, this is the low-risk path.\nTwo coins of your choice ($25.00, unlimited): Just what it sounds like.

You'll specify which six using the pledge manager after we close. And again, you can raise your pledge at that time. \nHead over to the right side-bar and pick the option that works for you.\nWhat's that? You want to take the time to read about the whole project? Well, then...\nThe Long Version\nWe've done all sorts of merchandise for the Schlock Mercenary comic strip over the years. It's time for something new: challenge coins!\n\"What is a challenge coin?\" I hear you ask.\nLet's drop the word \"challenge\" for just a moment and simplify the discussion. Many military units mint coins, non-negotiable, as commemorative souvenirs for those who serve. Ultimately, it's a shiny thing that says \"thank you,\" or perhaps \"we can't believe you agreed to this.\"\nThey get traded, sold, dropped, lost, flipped, and on very rare occasion used as ammo. Anybody can own one, and anybody can mint one. It follows, of course, that mercenary units in the 31st century would have them, which naturally means Tagon's Toughs should have them.\nIf the Toughs have these, that means that YOU might just want one. Mercenary cartoonist that I am, I shall oblige.\nBack to that word \"challenge.\" In some organizations, unit members might challenge one another to produce their coins. Fail, and you're buying the next round of drinks. Sometimes special coins, awarded by ranking officers, are produced, and the bearer of the highest-ranking coin drinks free. \n(Please note that challenge coin traditions vary quite widely by organization. In fact, they vary SO widely that an established, codified rule-set, whether inside or outside the military, is currently impossible to agree upon. More on this later...)\nHere is the unit coin for Tagon's Toughs. It's pretty straightforward, and there's even a \"head\" on the front so nobody will dispute which end is up should you use it for coin tosses.  This is a standard 1.5\" coin minted in brass, colored with enamels, and then sealed with an epoxy dome. Feature-wise, it's identical to the Hickam AFB coin I tossed in the video.\nThis first run of Tagon's Toughs Challenge Coins, numbered serially on the face, is sold out, mostly to Officer's Club pledges.\nThe second run, also numbered serially, is still available to NCO pledges. If you want a numbered coin, pledge there!\nShould you, as fans, decide to challenge one another to show your coins when drinks are on the line, I will not stand in your way. In fact, I'll go out of my way to make sure there are enough of these to meet demand. (Yes, we can mint a third series.)\nWe've funded more than 55 times over (5571% of the original goal and counting) allowing us to auto-include some other coins with the Officer's Club and NCO Club pledge levels. Here's what those look like right now:\n(Note that some Officer's Club levels include two Series One coins)\nAdd-ons\nThe following coins are only available add-ons. Your pledge level doesn't automatically get them -- you need to increase your bid by the appropriate amount, and then (after the project closes) specify which of the add-ons you want. \nThe 7-23 Tool (a 2.75\" diameter bottle opener coin featuring Maxim 7 on one side, and Maxim 23 on the other) \nThis coin is almost twice the diameter of all the others. It's no thicker, but it dwarfs them. For coin selection and shipping purposes, this one counts as two coins.  For grip purposes it will not have an epoxy finish. It is, after all, a tool.\nIt's so big Schlock is scared of it.\nThe Officially Licensed XDM D2\nBlack or white? 1 or 2? OOH-RAH or Uh-oh? You flip!\nThis is a 1.5\" coin, epoxy-finished on both sides.\nMaxim 11 Keydrop (complete with ring)\nThis is a 1.5\" coin, epoxy protecting Schlock from your keys, while the crater side features a 3D sculpt.\nFOUR SHIP COINS. The Serial Peacemaker, the Post-Dated Check Loan,  the Touch-and-Go, and the Kitesfear. These were unlocked right here at the end, and I'm racing to get the designs done in time for shipping. They're $10 each if you want to add them to your order.\nManaging Your Pledges\nKickstarter is a great way to get interested parties and entrepreneurs together for the advanced commission of commerce.\nIt's a terrible shopping cart. And this project illustrates that quite effectively.\nOnce the project has closed, we'll open up a shopping cart called a \"Pledge Manager\" that will allow you to define your order, and which will help us all ensure that you're getting what you pledged to get.\nUntil then, here are some tips and caveats:\nIf you have a limited-item reward locked in, hang on to it for dear life! The Series One coins are sold out.\nIf you want to add other coins to your reward, just up your pledge by the appropriate amount.\nIf you're getting eight coins, whether or not shipping was included in your reward level, and you want to ADD coins, you need to increase your pledge by $5 for US shipping and $8 for overseas shipping. We have to ship TWO packages to you.\nEvery coin you add is $10, but for backers, at every $50 we'll throw in a sixth coin free (the 7-23 tool counts as two coins in this calculation.)\nIf you want to bulk-order something, we can make those arrangements after the project has funded. I'm sure SOMEBODY out there is going to want a nigh-literal barrel of not-my-monkeys. \n\nWe don't have a tool available yet to specify which add-ons you get. Because of Kickstarter restrictions, we can't actually give you access to the Pledge Manager until the project closes. We will make enough of everything to fill all the orders, though, so don't panic. If you're in the Company Mess, for instance, and want a Tagon's Toughs coin, but the NCO club sells out and Series 2 is gone? We'll print a Series 3, and you can get one of those.\nHere are some examples of how you might up your pledges now:\nQ: \"I got in early at $25, and have two Series One coins. How do I get the auto-includes?\"\nA: Since there are six auto-includes, up your pledge by $50 (five coins and one freebie) and that'll cover it. \nQ: \"I got the NCO package, but I'm going to need more monkeys.\"\nA: \"For $10 you can add one monkey, and be at the eight-coin limit for the first package. \nQ: No, I need a LOT more monkeys. \nA: Add $10 for each monkey, and $5 ($8 int'l) shipping. Upping your pledge by $45 ($48) would get you four more monkeys. $55 ($58) would get you six more. $75 gets you eight more monkeys.\nQ: I just need one of everything. What should I pledge?\nA: Pledge for the NCO Club ($60) and increase your pledge by $75, or $78 outside of the US. The total will be $135 or $138.\nRemember, we'll get your order details after the project closes. There's no way right now to specify which add-ons you're getting. \n\nA Quick History of This Project\nThe funding progress of this project was stunning. Literally, stunning. You stunned me. I sat at my keyboard speechless, motionless, unable to process what I was seeing.\nI expected to fund within a day or two, and I figured we'd max out somewhere between $10k and $20k after a month. Well, we funded inside of sixty seconds, and shot through the stretch goals like a breacher missile through ballistics gel. Here's the timeline as I've been able to reconstruct it:\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: (unlocked at $3,000, about three minutes in to the project)\nThe Strohl Munitions Maxim 34 Challenge Coin!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: (unlocked at $5,000, within 15 minutes of project launch.)\nThe \"Not my circus, not my monkey\" coin.  \nSTRETCH GOAL #3: (unlocked at $10,000, roughly an hour after project launch)\nThe Partnership Collective Drone Token. \nSTRETCH GOAL #4: (unlocked at $18,000, just two hours and 5 minutes after launch.)\nThe Maxim 2-3 Flip:\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: (unlocked at $27,000, around six hours from project launch)\nSergeant Schlock's Moral Compass \nSTRETCH GOAL #6: (unlocked at $40,000, right around 12 hours after launch)\nThe Series 2 Tagon's Toughs Challenge Coin.\nThe NCO Club reward option\nThe Company Mess reward option.\nSTRETCH GOAL #7: (Unlocked at $60,000, roughly 55 hours after launch$60,000)\nThe 7-23 Tool (an oversized add-on coin with bottle-opener functionality!)\nSTRETCH GOAL #8 (Unlocked at $82,057, almost exactly eleven days to the minute after the project launched.)\nThe Officially Licensed XDM D2 (an add-on coin)\nThe Pius Dei/Parnassus Dom coin (the last auto-include for the Officer's Club and NCO Club rewards levels)\nSTRETCH GOAL #9 (Unlocked at $100,00, a little under twenty days into the project.)\nThe Maxim 11 Keydrop\nThe currently untitled unofficial anecdotal history of challenge coins (see below)\nSTRETCH GOAL #10 (Unlocked at $115,000, with almost exactly three days left of the project.)\nThe Series 3 Tagon's Toughs coin (but no pledge level specific to that series). These will be used to fill orders for TT coins where series and number were not specified.\nA ship coin, currently undesigned, for the Post-Dated Check Loan. \nSTRETCH GOAL #11 (Unlocked at $125,000, with 70 hours remaining)\nA ship coin, currently undesigned, for the Serial Peacemaker. \nOutstanding Stretch Goals\nLet me be frank here: many, many many Kickstarters fail through over-reaching when they over-fund. I have dozens of cool coin ideas, but I don't want to crater your wallets, and I don't want to fail to deliver the project as it stands. \nStill, I'm going to put stakes in the ground.\nIf the project hits $135,000 I'll do a commemorative coin for the Touch-and-Go.\nYou have got to be kidding me. Seriously? \nFine. I don't think we'll come anywhere NEAR this, but if we hit $145,000 I'll reach deep into the archives and do a ship commemorative of the Kitesfear. This will almost certainly be the best that ship has ever been drawn. \nThe Unofficial Anecdotal History of Challenge Coins (working title)\nThis document is a way for all of us to say \"thank you\" to everyone who has ever earned a coin from their command, and to anyone who has ever fumbled for a coin at the bar and wondered what in the name of guided fire was going on.\nIt is a 100-man-and-woman-hour project, and that's not counting the hours you'll put into it helping us out.\nSandra and I will collect challenge coin traditions from you, from our friends in the military, from friends of friends... we will collect anecdotes, horror stories, and house rules. \nWe will assemble these into a definitive, unofficial (because there can be no official) guide to challenge coins. \nI will do spot illustrations, including single-panel comics featuring irony, absurdity, and hilarity. \nContributions must be sourced. That means if you have an anecdote to share, it needs to be YOUR story, and you need to put YOUR name on it. We don't want \"I heard about this one guy...\" tales. We want \"I was standing at the canteen in Kuwait, back in 1998 when...\" or some variation thereof. Tell us what happened. Tell us how your unit used coins. \nWe totally understand that certain details may need to be omitted from your story in the interest of operational security. Tell the story as best you're able to legally tell it. If you can still put your name on it, that would be great.\nIf you want to contribute, email schlockmercenary@gmail.com with the subject line \"STRETCH 9 SUBMISSION.\" Sandra and I will be editing these for spelling and grammar, and perhaps polishing the prose a bit for clarity. And please! If there are details that need to be omitted for security purposes, omit them BEFORE sending.\nFull submission guidelines are here (this is a good link to share if you have friends who may wish to contribute.)\nThis project will entail at least 200 hours of work for me and for Sandra, and we can't do it all at once. The first finished draft of the document will likely take us at least five months to complete. It's going to be a lot like writing a book. \nWhen it's done, it will be freely available, publicly linked, and we will encourage its distribution. The document will include our suggestions for managing your own organization's challenge coin traditions. We are not trying to codify or support a single tradition -- we're trying to elevate awareness of all the traditions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks were the unknowns -- an unknown (to us, anyway) design and manufacturing process, and an unknown demand.\n\nYou've let us know what the demand is. Loudly, even. Fantastic! \n\nFor design and manufacturing we've partnered with a company that has made challenge coins for the US Armed Forces, assorted diplomatic corps, municipal police forces, and a host of other organizations. They made coins for Myke Cole's S.O.P. (another fictional military organization.) I'm confident in their ability to refine my designs for suitability on coins, and to manufacture these in a timely manner, and to the posted specifications.\n\nAnother potential risk is the shipping process. We've looked into shipping, and the plan is to send these as 1st-class mail, or in large envelopes. We've tacked $5.00 onto the coin price for all rewards for US shipping ($8.00 outside the US), and will be able to get as many as 8 coins into a single mailer. \n\nNote that when we ship these to you, they won't be labeled as \"coins.\" They're not currency, and never have been. As far as the postal services (who don't like shipping legal tender) are concerned, these are \"commemorative medallions\"\n\nThere are still some extant risks. Suppose our supplier goes belly-up? (Note: I doubt an established firm with their track record will go belly-up, but it's a contingency we have to allow for)\n\nIf this happens before we pay them, no problem! I already have other suppliers and designers beating down my door. We attracted attention! We'll lose some time, but no money. The delivery dates slip to July.\n\nIf this happens AFTER we pay them, we still have enough money left over to make coins through somebody else. Sure, our profitability drops to zero, but we can make good on our commitments to you. Again, the delivery dates slip. \n\nWhat if the coins arrive, but some of them are badly flawed and not suitable for sale? Or what if the wrong shipment arrives at the Tayler Corporation? \n\nThis is actually the most likely of the unlikely problems we might have. Obviously we'll pressure the manufacturer to make another run, and to make them correctly, or to ship us what we're supposed to have. Our delivery dates to you would slip, probably into July. Worst case, they refuse to fix what's wrong, and we're looking at a variation of the eat-into-our-margins solution above.\n\nTo make a very long story short, this is not the first time we've tried to mass-produce something and ship it to thousands of people we've never met. Good customer service is our stock in trade, and we WILL find a way to take care of you, even if it means we don't make money on this endeavor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "This is The Last Update!

Both jobs seemed simple enough, but I've been hung up on the words for over a year now. In January of 2014 I wrote an introduction that was all over the map, and wrong, and I lost hope (and then track of time) for quite a while.\n\nThis morning I realized what the problem was. I was trying to use my own challenge coin story as an introduction, and that was artificially inflating my story's importance. It was ego-bloat, and this document is not the place for that.\n\nThe solution? I wrote an introduction that serves as an introduction. It's not a story, though it's got story stuff in it. It is written to properly introduce the stories that follow. \n\nAnd THEN I went ahead and told my story, which will get tucked into the meaty parts of the PDF along with everybody else's account. So you get to hear from me twice. After this long of a wait, it seems like the least I can do.\n\nBoth of my documents have been handed off to Sandra for editing, which means that everything this document needs from me has been delivered, except the pictures.

She learns she's a Namesake, uniquely connected to this world by the power of her given name, and now she must act as the story's protagonist as she figures out how to make her way home. But as Emma travels, she discovers that those controlling her story have their own selfish goals in mind \u2013 and her fate is the key to everyone\u2019s happy ending.\nBook 2 covers Intermission #1 and chapters 6-10, which is the second half of the Oz arc. If you would like to read them, the first Intermission begins here. If you've never read Namesake before, you can start at the beginning here! The comic publishes every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, and you can read the entire comic online.\nIsabelle Melan\u00e7on is a French-Canadian artist who came up with the idea behind Namesake in 2007. It evolved from a series of parody comics she did for her friends. Megan Lavey-Heaton is a U.S. writer who poked Isa until she began to further develop Namesake. They combined their powers and launched Namesake in 2010. \nIsa lives in Montreal, Quebec, and when she's not drawing, she's selling comics and educating kids in schools about the power of comics and graphic novels. Meg lives right outside Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, and is a web/mobile producer and SMO specialist for PA Media Group (PennLive/The Patriot-News). She's also an editor for The Unofficial Apple Weblog. \nIsa and Meg were contributors to the Womanthology: All-Female Comic Anthology. They will be contributing a short story to another anthology in summer 2013. They are also part of Hiveworks Comics, which includes other great comics such as Sister Claire and Go Get a Roomie.\nWe're raising the money to print volume 2 of Namesake. It's a 172-page sewn-perfect softcover book and contains chapter 6-10, plus the first Intermission and a 5-page bonus story. The goal amount will cover the print job for 1,000 books, shipping, and Amazon/Kickstarter fees. The funding goal is higher than vol. 1 because we increased the size from 144 pages to 172 pages.\nWhat will the extra funds go toward?\nIf we exceed our goal, as with book 1, we will roll the money back into the comic. So far, Namesake is slated to appear at three cons (TCAF, Anime Boston, and one to-be announced) in 2013, and we're hoping to appear at more. Depending on the amount raised, we might be able to do a second print run of book 1 as well.\nWhat are some of the extras?\nIf you bid $10 and above: You'll not only get a PDF of book 2, but a completely new side story that relates the tale of Chadrick (Chiseri) and Adora, the parents of Warrick and Selva. \nIf you bid $25 and above: Thanks to our amazing printer, Cross Blue, we'll be able to give everyone who orders a print version of book 2 will get a limited-edition postcard featuring Emma and Elaine:\nIf you bid $50 and above: You'll get a complete set of Namesake charms! These are 2-inch acrylic charms that are 1/16\" thick. Share them with your friends!\nOther rewards are specific to their levels, such as the Tumblr icon commissions, the original pages, and the Calliope employee tier. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!\nWhat if I want a higher bid level than $40, but I would also like book 1?\nIf you also want book 1, please add $15 to any goal $50 or above, and we'll make sure you get a book! If you are an international bidder, please add an extra $5 to cover the shipping of the two books.\nDo you have any stretch goals?\nWe do, yes!\nIf we make $30,000, we will be able to do a full print run of book 1 in addition to book 2! This is a good thing, because we will be extremely low on vol. 1 after this Kickstarter.\nIf we make $40,000, we will be able to do a tier where hardcovers of book 1 and 2 are offered! \nThank you!\nWe couldn't do this without your help.
