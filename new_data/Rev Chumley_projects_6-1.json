[{"backer": "Rev Chumley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "My name is Kevin Reaves and I am the creator of Rumble Kings. The idea behind the game was to create a simple pocket fighter that's fun, plays fast, and travels well. The Rumble Kings box is compact and the game itself plays easily on any 30\u201d X 30\u201d surface. \nAll of the sculptures for the Rumble Kings miniatures shown on this page have been completed and will be cast in resin.  Having miniatures cast in resin is significantly cheaper than having them mass produced in plastic for various reasons. I am working with a reputable US based caster and I've already received a large number of castings for more than half of miniatures listed on this Kickstarter page. They look fantastic!  The Master Prints for the remaining miniatures are on their way to the caster. I am having a healthy number of each miniature produced and will have more cast, if required,  following the Kickstarter. By following this model I am able to control the cost and take care of this part of the process myself.  All of the funds from this Kickstarter campaign will be used for manufacturing the actual Rumble Kings board game. Which is being produced in China.\nOver the past year I have play tested and invested much of my own resources into the creation of Rumble Kings. The rules and artwork are complete and all of the funds from this campaign will be used to have the game professionally manufactured. I have a significant portion of the funds to have this game produced, but I need a little help to see it through. The $2500 pledge goal is not the total cost of what it is going to take to have the game made, but it is the amount that I need to make this game a reality. I love this game and with your help I will be able to move forward and have Rumble Kings professionally manufactured and delivered to your table.\nRUMBLE KINGS \nRumble Kings is a 2 to 4 player fighting game, but can easily expand to more players when creating tournaments. The game plays very fast and single round matches generally take about 5  minutes while multiple round matches take about 10 to 15 minutes to play.\nIn Rumble Kings players face off against each other using a variety of fighters with various special abilities. The game can be played by creating quick random matches or it can be played using tournament mode. Regardless of how you play you always have the option of playing single round, or best two out of three matches. Single round games are fun, furious and play extremely fast! While multiple round matches tend to be more tactical due to a higher priority placed on managing your fighter's limited resources.\nAt the beginning of a match players draw Rumble Cards to customize their fighter for the upcoming battle. Rumble Cards have special abilities that augment attacks, boost defensive capabilities, or may offer some needed health benefits during a round. It\u2019s up to you to prepare your fighter and bring out their full potential.\nPlayers attack and defend with five combat dice that form their dice pool. This dice pool can change significantly during the fight depending on the amount of punishment your fighter suffers. Players compete by rolling dice, building attack sequences, and unleashing tactical combinations of punches, kicks and critical blows against the opponent. Learning to maximize your dice rolls and understanding when to utilize your signature ability and Rumble Cards is integral to victory. Throw too much, too quickly, and your fighter may end up exhausted fighting an uphill battle!\nRumble Warrior Pledge\nRumble Pack Pledge - Miniatures Only\nRumble King Pledge - Game and Miniatures\n\n\nGaltero Barbosa Add On\n\nRumble Columns Add On", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have dedicated myself to researching and learning everything I can about production and manufacturing and I\u2019m working closely with an experienced manufacturer to make sure that everything proceeds as smoothly and timely as possible.\n\nI will do everything in within my power to minimize any issues that may cause delays with this project.

Each faction has a distinctive play style and every model is loaded with its own set of potent abilities. \nThe combat system is built around six different types of dice and each die has a different statistical layout. Learning to optimize the dice facings in conjunction with the character\u2019s abilities and the landscape are significant keys to victory. \nThe battlefields are littered with dangerous terrain features and they are just as brutal as any adversary. Spikes, pits, saw blades, tentacles and fire spewing skull columns have the ability to cause massive amounts of damage, so positioning and board control are extremely important. Many heroes and villains alike have fought valiantly only to succumb to the blood thirsty landscape.\nThe game features a randomized activation order that continuously creates opportunities for new tactics and strategies and offers a special bonus for the player that is first in the lineup. During the maintenance phase the player whose token is first in the activation order has control over the terrain features and may be able to shield their models from harm while delivering punishing attacks and damage to their adversaries. \n Click here for Pit Howler .stl\nBasic Game Play\nTerrain Setup\nCharacter Deployment\nThe Maintenance Phase\nBuilding the Activation Order\nCharacter Activation\nMega Dude \nFigures come unpainted\nMega Dude is a fearless combatant and one of the most powerful heroes in the Motleyverse! He is loved by his people and his countless acts of bravery and heroism has earned the favor with the benevolent and powerful Skull Queen. Rumors of an undead monster carving a path of destruction across Krahgen has captured Mega Dude's attention and put him on a collision coarse with the horrible menace.\nThe Skall Warriors \nFigures come unpainted\nThe Skall warriors are comprised of the clans strongest, fastest, and most highly skilled fighters. They are a selfless unit of soldiers that live to protect their people and their homes, and every member of the clan begins training, from an early age, in hope of one day joining their ranks.\nLord Dreadcore \nFigures come unpainted\nLord Dreadcore is a ruthless abomination with an insatiable appetite for war and destruction. His actions and path are chaotic and unclear and no one seems to understand what his goals or intentions truly are, or if he even has any at all. He is a menace and a threat to all that oppose him and it may very well take a coalition of heroes to stop his reign of terror. \nBone Warriors \nFigures come unpainted\nBone warriors are the most common henchmen among the ranks of the undead. They are relentless warriors that never tire, never quit and feverishly wade into battle with zero hesitation. They are the perfect soldier.\nThe Board\nThe game board is double sided and each side delivers a different experience and has its own challenges to overcome.\nSide (A) - 18\" X 18\"\nSide (A) is great for larger games with more miniatures and tons of terrain. This side of the board offers players a wider area to set up and opens up a slew of tactical possibilities. Playing a full game with all four factions on this side of the board generally takes 45 to 120 minutes.\nSide B - 12\" X 12\"\nSide (B) is great for fast games, micro tournaments and is great for learning to play the game. Side B also has version of gameplay that is specific to it called \"King of the Arena\" This side of the board is ruthless, and one poor defense roll more often than not leads to doom. Four player games generally last about 15 to 30 minutes. \nSHIPPING\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign ends during the pledge management phase and will be based on actual shipping costs. \nWe cannot ship these packages to PO boxes domestically or internationally.\nThe shipping estimates below are estimates based off of the \u201cLords of the Motleyverse\u201d box size and weight.

This long-awaited game will be the sixth in the adventure series, which includes the award-winning games Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive and Overseer.\nProject Fedora will reunite creators Chris Jones and Aaron Conners and feature their trademarks of rich interactive storytelling and immersive gameplay. The new game will incorporate the very best of the classic Tex Murphy elements - sci-fi, film noir, witty dialogue, great characters, beautifully integrated FMV, and a deep, engaging story - but it will also enhance the experience of the former games with stunning new graphics, a sleek new interface, and other updates.\nThe detective-style gameplay takes place in a fully 3D world where you search for clues, solve puzzles, investigate crimes, and question witnesses and suspects. While the gameplay will be fun and challenging, you'll never get stuck with the free, built-in hint system.\nOne of Project Fedora's most exciting features is how the game and story can unfold in different ways. As you play, your actions and choices will change events, leading to new story elements and gameplay. This \"narrative pathing\" not only allows you to customize your experience, it will provide unique replayability, as the game will have at least three or more story paths leading to multiple endings.\nLong-time Tex fans may be curious if the new storyline will pick up where Overseer (and its infamous cliffhanger) left off. The short answer is YES, but this game will be just as enjoyable for people who have never played the earlier games. While we can't give too many details yet, just be prepared for an incredible opening sequence!\nProject Fedora promises to be the best Tex Murphy adventure ever - even better than the last three Tex Murphy games (Under a Killing Moon, The Pandora Directive, Overseer), which were met with critical acclaim, won \"Adventure Game of the Year\" awards, and are consistently ranked as some of the best adventure games of all time.

If we get to $1 Billion I will buy Greece and install sea to sea carpeting!\nHi\nIn 2006, I launched a show called \"The Show With Ze Frank.\" It was one of the most strange, exciting, difficult, and amazing things I have done so far. I think it is time to do something similar, what with the economy in the crapper and the election coming up. If Newt can do it, so can I. So can we. \nSame Same but Different.\nSome things will be familiar. My face, my voice, politics, news, science, whatever else is happening in the world, the celebration of the spontaneous... and surprises. \nBut the core of the original show was never really about what I did. It was about what you did. And I have no idea what is going to happen there. It's risky, unknown and awesome. I will be asking you to make things, to do things, and to surprise me. We will use the world as our playground and I have the technology to back it up. If I don't, I will make it. \nThe Plan\nTo start, I want to produce around three episodes a week for a year and take it from there. I want this to be fun and to last for a while. I figure that I will launch sometime at the end of March, near to the 6th anniversary of the original show.\nAll of the funds raised here will go towards the production of the show - equipment, salaries for people that will help me, rent. I will find other ways to pay myself. \nRewards: \nIf you have a thought for a reward that you don't see listed, send an email to ze@zefrank.com and I will see if I can include it. Here are some additional details about some of the rewards listed on the right:\nThese are the babies you will be saving. If you save one it will be sent to you in a jar. You get to name it. There is a webcam setup here. Save a baby!\nThis is the \"young me, now me\" book. Click here to see the project!\nThis is the lenticular greeting card! It moves like MAGIC! Based on this.\nThis is sort of what the black on black fuzzy felt duck shirt looks like. More here.\nThis is what the jar of encouraging words will look like when you receive it. Open at your discretion.\nThis is what your portrait by the scribbler robot will resemble. They look great framed! More info here.\nHere are what the signed signatures look like :)\nHere is a potato stamp painting..\nHere is the black on black stamp painting..\nThis is what Cherish's 4\"x4\" paintings look like!  So beautiful!\nThanks:\nThis is going to be awesome.

I have inherited a school bus and am converting it into a mobile live/work.  The plan is to travel around to art communities of all types, explore, and create.  Most residency programs have long waits and application processes.  All of them are basically in one part of the world.  This project is about making my own residency space to take where I need it and in the process seek answers. \nI've already started by going to Houston, Texas to pick up the bus and have driven it to El Paso where I'm doing my first residency.  I had to act quick to get the bus, so I had to go on a leap of faith for the first leg of the journey.  I'm in the bus now, but have limited resources.  That's where you come in. \nI need money to finish the conversion and fund the program for at least a year.  The bus will be complete with everything I need to live and produce art.  The more money I can get the farther I can travel and the more I'll have to put into the art I make along the way.  I will be doing art shows, performances, and other events to raise money along the way, but the initial start up is very important.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "thank you's", "update_content": "thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you,\nthat's 7 thank you's,\nand there's more where that came from,\nI've made the minimum and can now get the bus converted and ready to go,\nbut I still need to make some traveling money,\nso if those of you that donated know anyone who might be interested in this project,"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "37 backers pledged $2,415"}, {"Project launches": "SEPTEMBER 28, 2011"}]}], "comment_no": 5, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/233442979/artist-without-residence", "project_name": "Artist Without Residence"}}]
