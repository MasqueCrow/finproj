[{"backer": "TheSheDM", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Mock up of the book. Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

All the dinosaurs and other animals featured will be shown in a fantastical way based on real and popular culture. Like many other artists I've always had a huge affinity for dinosaurs, and while I am no paleo artist, I do my best to do justice to both the realistic and fantasy dinosaurs we know and love. This is a follow up of my Disappear Kickstarter from last year which featured animals recently, and currently extinct, and I thought what better way to follow that up than with dinosaurs! \n\nHow Does it work?\nIf you are new to kickstarter here is something you should know:\nWhen you back a kickstarter the money is not taken from you right away. It is only taken when the KS is fully funded and AT THE END OF THE TIMER. Which means not until February for this specific kickstarter!\nLike most pin Kickstarters the funds go directly into manufacturing and shipping. My last three Kickstarters I made sure to use all funds appropriately and make sure every pin was packaged well and was shipped correctly. The funds go to packing supplies, postage, taxes as well.\n\nWho am I?\nI am an enamel pin artist who has been working with pins as an art form for over 8 years. I have designed over 500 pins for various clients all over the world and am well versed in vector design and illustration. I also dabble in children's books from time to time. This is my fourth kickstarter of my own and was the artist for a friends kickstarter.  I hope you will help make it just as successful as the last! \n\nWhat about the pins?\nAll pins will be 2\" - 2.5\"  for the standard pins; that's why they're a little more pricey than most. Most pin tiers will unlock four pins: A main animal and a glow or special variant, and a mini pin and it's variant, a few tiers later on won't but will be bigger pins. If we unlock all goals more pins will be added until we reach 10 main creatures!

I'll put the 24 instrumentals that go with d20 into its download package (for the Digital Vinyl support tier and everyone who ordered the vinyl) and I'll put all the instrumentals into another package for everyone who pledged at Deluxe Edition or higher.\n\nAt $33K, a New Video\nLet's make a very nice music video for any track on d20 that hasn't already had a very nice music video! I'll poll all of you to find out which one we should make.\n\n\nThanks.\nI'm very keen to get this project rolling! It's something I've wanted to do for a very, very long time.

Each creature is presented like those you would find in a monster manual complete with lore, artwork, and the notes of the infamous demi-lich Zargoth.\nUnlike a traditional monster manual, these creatures are each designed not simply as foes to be encountered, but as companions to accompany players on their adventures.\n\n\nThe tome not only includes a myriad of new variant familiars for the find familiar spell, but focuses on creatures that can be taken as pets and companions by any class. These unique pets can be gained through new Feats, to become a core part of a character's identity -- both thematically and mechanically.  \nEach new feat gives access to a specific type or family of these new creatures. Some of these categories are very close to the traditional idea of a familiar; the Necromancer feat gives access to a wide variety of undead creatures that can be summoned by the find familiar spell in place of its standard options. Other feats give access to creatures that are very different from the traditional idea of a familiar; the Alchemist feat allows a character to grow strange alien creatures in jars and consume or release them for powerful effects. \nIn creating each of these feats and types of companion creatures, balance was as important to us as strong thematic elements. Each familiar has a unique power or ability and can help to define a character at any tier of play, from 1st to 20th level.\n\n\nCornered in the alleyway, a ranger backs against the stone wall as shadowy assailants advance. A low growl comes from the unusual dog at her side. She rests her hand reassuringly on its fur, and, in a swirl of blue mist, they are gone, bounding side by side along the city rooftops.\nThe bonded feat gives a character the ability to form an unshakable bond with a young creature, raising it as their own.\nExamples: Blinkdog Pup, Flailing Snailing, Displacer Cub\n\n\n\n\nAn artificer clicks a lens over her eye as she turns a delicate mithril tool, making a final adjustment to the ornate clockwork on her workbench. Warm amber light begins to glow in the eyes of her creation, a fox made of gears and sleek silver plates.\nThe Tinker feat allows a character to use artificer's tools to create clockwork creatures, each with a specific function and the unique ability to transform.\nExamples: Quicksilver Fox, Clockwork Spider, Bronzeback Armadillo\n\n\n\nA warlock treads carefully on the ancient stones of the tomb, buried beneath burning sands. Behind him walks a cat, its ancient bandages falling away to reveal a white fire in its eyes. In the darkness of the tomb, the ancient guardians recoil in the shadows as the ankh around the cat's neck glints in the pale light of its eyes.  \nThe Necromancer feat allows characters to use the find familiar spell to raise an undead minion as their familiar.\nExamples: Mummified Cat, Floating Skull, Ossuary Hound\n\n\nThe barbarian's cloak unfurls to reveal the arm he had told his companions he had lost in battle -- huge and grotesque, it writhes and pulses, a mass of eyes and gibbering mouths. With a great heave he grips the portcullis, and slowly begins to lift the iron bars.\nThe Symbiotic Host feat links a character to an aberrant symbiotic creature, granting them great powers at a horrifying cost. \nExamples: Gibbering Arm, Silent Lurker, Spine Worm \n\n\n\n\nA wizard careful pours a dark bubbling liquid from a glass vial into a strange jar. In the murky liquid of the jar a dark shape floats, suspended in the green fluid. With sudden speed, it darts through the fluid, tentacles and teeth, pressed against the glass.\nThe Alchemist feat allows a character to use alchemy supplies to grow creatures in jars, creating powerful and dangerous potions.\nExamples: Green Ooze, Sanguine Lampreys, Pickled Watcher\n\n\n\nIn a crowded market, a bard juggles a cascade of brightly colored balls to the cheering of a crowd. Her accomplice, a small, four-armed imp, moves nimbly through the throng,  alighting only to liberate certain treasures; a pearl earring, a gold signet ring, and a coin pouch almost as large as the creature itself.\nThe Devil's Pact feat enables a character to strike a bargain with a dangerous devil lord, gaining the service -- and vices -- of one of its imps in exchange. \nExamples: Thieving Devil, Feasting Devil, Flayer Devil\n\n\n\nWe need your help to bring Zargoth's Tome of Familiars to life. Funds acquired during the Kickstarter will go towards making a beautiful, full color, hardcover book. Money will be spent on lavish illustrations and a professional layout, as well as funding the actual printing of the physical books. The more support we can raise, the more content, additional material, and polish we can bring to the finished tome. We want Zargoth's Tome of Familiars to look good on your bookshelf alongside your collection of core books.\n\n\n\nUNLOCKED - Monster Sketches. Many of the creatures with alternate forms (a phoenix in its egg, a mechanical fox that can transform into a sword, a parasitic aberration that latches onto a host) will be given alternate art sketches to enhance their full color illustrations.\nUNLOCKED  - Bonded Race. We will include an all new race that begins the game bonded to a powerful familiar that shares their soul.\nUNLOCKED - Magic Items. We will add a section of magic items, specifically designed to interact with the familiars in this book. Includes artwork.\n$35,000 - Artificer\u2019s Dungeon.

Neoprene Playmats to make any flat surface a quality gaming table.\n2. Premium Bags for taking several options to game night with great style and protection.\n2. Lightweight Bags as a smaller sized option, meant for quick trips or a short night with friends.\n4. 2021 Weekly Desk Calendar with 53 beautiful board game photos taken by members of the community.\nThe Playmat is a premium play surface designed with the help of over a thousand gamers who participated in surveys and provided insightful feedback.\nWhether you're a casual or diehard gamer, there's no doubt this will elevate gaming experiences for you and your friends and family, at home or on the go.\nBased on survey data, it will come in two sizes:\n 3 x 5 ft (91 x 152 cm)\n 3.5 x 5.5 ft (107 x 168 cm)\nThe smaller size will fit on 75% of your tables and the larger size will fit on 45% of your tables. These two options should be a good balance between fitting on as many tables as possible, while giving you as much room to play as possible.\nAs an added bonus, the small size will fit in the play area of our affordable and available-for-purchase Jasper Board Game Table, and the large size is the same size as the Jasper's dining topper.\nExtra Thick Padding\n         Our premium Playmat is 5mm thick, a noticeable improvement over typical 3mm options. This makes it closer to a real gaming table feel designed to elevate your tactile experience. It's not just a pretty backdrop.\nInset Edge Stitching\n         The edge stitching really takes the Playmat from basic material to a fine product. We've also made sure the stitching has a lower profile than the rest of the mat, so it won't catch cards if they slide to the edge.  \nNo-Slip Rubber Backing\n         Few things are worse than a board sliding across the table and pieces falling to the floor. We've tested this. Trust us. The Playmat won't be sliding anywhere.\nEvery Playmat will come with a carrying case specifically designed for it. We want it to go with you to a friend's house, a community game night, a con, or a weekend getaway.\nI'm always a little skeptical of \"gift-with-purchase\" items companies use to increase interest, so it was important this wasn't just a cheap add-on. We've made sure the quality of the case matches the quality of the mat. The Playmat slides into the case easily and the adjustable straps make it comfortable to carry. We bet you'll end up using it even more than you think!\nWhy do I need a board game bag, you ask? We agree you could use a small grocery bag or precariously bungee-cord a big stack of games together - but wouldn't you and your games feel much safer with something made exclusively for them?\nWhen we first launched these bags, we had no idea just how much you'd love them and how important they'd be. From going over to a friend's house or even traveling (yes, this will happen again!), having a durable and padded bag has saved countless boxes getting lost or ruined and pieces exploding all over the floor or car. Now, with a bunch of real-life product testing, the Premium Bag is even better with upgraded shoulder straps and limited-edition colors.\nDurable water resistant exterior with reinforced seams \nRubber feet\nHeavy padding on all six sides\nMultiple compartments\nTough metal zippers \nSeveral options for different carrying methods\nDifferent situations (or hand cramps) call for different transport methods, so your new Premium or Standard bag is built for several options.  You can wear it as a backpack, secure it to your luggage, or carry it the good old fashioned way. The backpack straps even hide under the luggage handle slip so that everything is tucked away when you aren't using them.\nPremium Bag Bonus: A removable shoulder strap with heavy-duty metal parts and a padded strap.\nOne of the most popular requests  was to add more colors and we definitely agreed, so here they are: Ruby Red and Fern Green. These are limited edition colors so if you like them, now's the time to get them!\nPlease note, Heather Blue bags are not available in Europe for this campaign.\nYou're only as good as your weakest link, so they say. And whoever \"they\" are, they're probably right.\nWhich is why we're adding all metal parts to the Premium Bag. Now, the weight capacity has increased and you can be certain that you'll be able to carry any ambitious packing list.\nPlus, doesn't metal just look way better, and well, more premium?\nMetal parts!\nThe Premium and Standard Bags are both the same shape, but the main differences are the upgraded materials, colors, carrying options, and weight capacity.\n Fabric & Colors: Premium bags are made with a high-end soft-touch blue, red or green fabric. Standard Bags are made of a basic woven fabric and are only available in grey.\n Carrying Options: Premium bags offer a heavy-duty and removable shoulder strap. \n Weight Limits: Premium Bags are rated at 65 pounds for every carrying method while the Standard Bag handle is rated at 50 pounds for the handle and the backpack straps at 40 pounds.\n**Upgrade: The premium bags have been upgraded from our previous bags. They now have metal clasps and clips instead of plastic.** \n\"Chad really listened to his customers and his reviewers and went back to the drawing board and redesigned it and you can tell he is also a game player because he made the perfect game bag. Price point - perfect. The quality - for what it is, for what it does - it's a spot-on perfect.\"\nSometimes you don't need everything our Premium and Standard bags have to offer, so we're excited to launch a completely new and very affordable companion product, the Lightweight Bag.\nIt has the solid construction of our Premium and Standard offerings but is a bit smaller.\nFolds flat\nDual-layer water resistant fabric exterior\nWraparound handle straps to fully support game boxes\nI realized I needed this because grocery bags aren\u2019t built for games. The proportions aren't right for games to fit comfortably, no lid meant everything falling out in the car, there was no protection from light rain, and they weren\u2019t built for the weight.\nI also felt it wasn't quite appropriate to bring a big imposing bag when going to dinner with friends and they asked me to bring over \"just a couple of games\". \nPriced at only $6, its dollar-to-value ratio will definitely impress you!\nNote on weight limits: The Premium, Standard and Lightweight bag weight limits are based on factory testing. These bags are made for board games not for bricks, gold bars, or dirty laundry, so please use them responsibly. Weight limits also may vary depending on the weight distribution and how the bag is handled.\nOur 2020 Weekly-View Calendar was a huge hit (little did we know how many board games we'd actually end up playing) so we're bringing it back for 2021 with updated photos.\nThis is a feature-packed calendar that will include weekly gaming prompts, gamer profile cards, full year overview, 10x10 Challenge, weekly tracker, habit tracker, and space for notes.\nHave you seen some great board game photos that should be in the calendar? Recommend a specific photo (with link to original photo and/or photographer profile) in the comments section and we'll choose some photos to include! (assuming the photographer is on board).\nIt's basic business that if you're using someone's work, they should get paid. All photographers will be paid a royalty based on a percentage of calendar sales and will receive a free calendar. Each photo will say the name of both the photographer and game. \nAnytime before your items ship, you may cancel your order for a full refund, no questions asked.\nAnd when you do get your items, if you don't think what you ordered lives up to expectations, we'll also refund you 100% and even pay for return shipping.\nWe are quite confident you should receive your items by the end of December, before Christmas. There's also the possibility that, depending on your order, our inventory and fulfillment speed, you may receive your items as early as October (We'll caffeinate our elves and try our best!).\nNo additional duty or taxes will be due when your rewards are delivered to US, Canada, UK & European Union, and Australia locations.\nFriendly shipping means your package will ship from your own country or region. This is done to expedite delivery and eliminate taxes and fees.\nUS Friendly Shipping\nEU/UK Friendly Shipping (Will ship from Germany)\nAustralia Friendly Shipping\nCanada Friendly Shipping\nDo not manually increase your pledge amount to pay for the shipping now.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign in the Pledge Manager. You will get an email and an update from us after the campaign with instructions for the Pledge Manager. If you pay for shipping now, it will make things much more complicated during the Pledge Manager.\nBoardGameTables.com was founded in 2014 by me, Chad DeShon. I'm a gamer who wanted a nice table for playing board games and figured other people might as well.\nNow, in addition to selling high quality custom board game tables, BoardGameTables.com also sells a less expensive, some-assembly-required, solid wood table called The Jasper Board Game Table, and a line of quick but deceptively strategic board games.\nWe started selling board game bags for a similar reason. I needed something to carry my games in. No off-the-shelf options worked for me. They were too big, too small, or not protected enough.\nI published a board game calendar back in 2011, simply as a hobby, and sold 100. It was the first time I sold a product online, and it planted a seed of things to come; starting a business that would serve the board gaming community.  It's so rewarding to still be doing that.\nFirst: Choose the pledge level you want.\nSecond: If you want to buy lightweight bags or calendars, you will need to manually increase the price to pay for those.\nAdd $6 to your pledge for every lightweight bag.\nAdd $14 to your pledge for every calendar.\nYou can also add additional regular/premium bags or small/large playmats by adding $29/$46/$59/$69 to your pledge for each.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this Kickstarter consists of several different products, I am confident we can deliver them on time.

Our differences make us strong.\nWith the Stonehaven Adventurers 2020 project, we are creating a variety of adventuring parties. Some will include variations of a single fantasy race, others will be a mix of different fantasy races. The parties will not all include the same number of miniatures becuase of the difference in the cost of production due to size, and not all of the parties will be included in the Core Set. Some are only available as add-ons.\nThe miniatures will be made in the USA. They will be cast in 100% lead free pewter (or polyurethane resin in the case of the dragon) and some assembly will be required. They will be sculpted on the standard 28 mm scale. Slotted round bases will be included with miniatures that are pictured on round bases.\nAnd now we present the Core Set:\nPictured from top to bottom, left to right: Grippli Warrior ($4), Grippli Samurai ($4), Kobold Archer ($5), Half-Dragon Wizard ($7), Pygmy Lizardfolk Rogue ($5)\nCold Blood Clan!

As the common room fills up with merchants and laborers, a few more faces stand out to Cyragnome: A man carrying a strange contraption who talks loudly about it's enormous value, an overconfident tiefling with a long bow, and a gang of half-orcs who are clearly working themselves up to some violence. \nIn addition to the Core Set, we've got some other stuff that is only available as add-ons. This is that stuff!\n\nPictured from top to bottom, left to right: Male Orc Fighter ($9), Female Orc Cleric ($9), Female Orc Archer ($9), Male Orc Wizard ($9), Male Orc Warrior ($10)\nThe massive mountain Orcs have formed an uneasy alliance with the mountain queen. Orc warriors, once feared and killed on sight, are now commonplace among the caravan guards and mercenary companies that come down from the northern steppes. (Party add-on cost: $37)\nThe Mushroom Folk have lived under the dark trees for as long as time has been counted. Mercurial creatures, they can change their form to best suit the needs of the coming day. Although many will prefer to maintain a single form, others will change form each night: from simple form to warrior form, or from spore form to mage form. Each form has its strengths and drawbacks.\nThe Mushroom Folk have interchangeable parts and can be assembled into thousands of different combinations. \nPictured from left to right: Seedy ($5), Mushroom Sporeling with Leaf Scroll ($6), Mushroom Warrior with Hammer ($8), Mushroom with Bean Blade ($6), Mushroom with Sweetgum Mace ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset A  (Party add-on cost: $25)\n Pictured from left to right: Mossling ($5), Mushroom with Beanbow ($6), Mushroom Snail Rider ($9), Mushroom Mage with Crystal Staff ($6), Mushroom with Maple Blade ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset B  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nPictured from left to right: Carrote ($6), Mushroom Druid with Oak Club ($6), Mushroom with Blowgun ($6), Mushroom Mage with Seedy Staff ($6), Mushroom with Thorn Daggers ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset C  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nPictured from left to right: Vinesnake ($6), Mushroom Warrior with Slate Sword ($8), Mushroom Sporeling with Satchel ($6), Mushroom Mage with Moon Staff ($6), Mushroom Druid with Briar Club ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset D  (Party add-on cost: $25)\n\n\n\nPictured from Left to Right: Porcupinecone ($4), Mutoe ($5)(Locked), Mushroom Warrior with Axe ($8), Mushroom Mage with Seed Fan ($6), Mushroom Sporeling with Stick ($6)\nAdd-on: Mushroom Folk Subset E  (Party add-on cost: $25)\nMushroom folk unlocked by stretch goals will be added to the Mushroom Folk Set.\nThe Reclining Dragon rests comfortably on your tabletop, awaiting delicious adventurers to walk into its jaws. Or you could barter with it, or whatever, he's pretty chill that way! \nThis dragon is big! It measures 105mm across and will be cast in polyurethane resin. The wings come unattached. (Add-on cost: $25)\nAs we hit these stretch goals, more miniatures will be added to the Core Set, Mushroom Set, and/or made available as add-ons!\nFirst up:\n\nWe reached $12,000! Cyragnome the gnomish swashbuckler will be added to the Core Set. He will also be available as a $4 add-on. Cyragnome is a fearless fighter with a flair for the dramatic. Many a bandit has had his knees bloodied by Cyragnome's flashing blade!\n\nWe reached $14,500! the Male Goblin Warrior will be unlocked and added to the Otker and the Mob adventuring party in the Core Set. He will also be available as a $4 add-on. Goblin warriors are fearless in battle. Often facing much larger foes, they often triumph through a combination of lucky crits and really bad attack rolls from lvl 1 adventurers!\n\nWe reached $17,000! The Female Goblin Ranger will be unlocked and added to the Otker and the Mob adventuring party in the Core Set. She will also be available as a $4 add-on. Ricochet the goblin ranger got her nickname by bouncing a bolt off a guard's shield and into another guard's exposed back. \n\nWe reachd $19,500! The Male Human Mad Scientist will be added to the Core Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. He's been tinkering with that handheld lightning cannon for years and he's reasonably sure it won't explode when fired . . . well, pretty sure any way. I mean, he wouldn't just be carrying it around like that with his finger on the trigger and everything unless he'd tested it first. Right?\n\n\nWe reached $20,000! The Female Tiefling Ranger will be added to the Core Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. Tieflings are universally mistrusted and occasionally feared, but Sen has tried hard to do the right thing, though it has often enough lost her both wealth and friends. Maybe she just never had the right friends?\n\nWe hit $20,750! The Mushroom Warrior with Axe will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as an $8 add-on. This guy means business. Warrior form is inherently tougher than the other forms, and mushroom folk will often take this form if they know a fight is coming in the next few days. \n\nWe reached $22,000! The Male Human Lordling has been unlocked and added to the Core Set and available as a $9 add on. The Lordling is still very much trying to prove himself to his father. He's not really a bad person, just self-centered, priveledged, and full of the overconfidence of youth.\nWe reached $22,500! The Mutoe will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $5 add-on. To create a mutoe, a mushroom person must carefully carve the figure as a single piece from a living oak tree. The final stroke of the carving blade separates the mutoe and imbues it with the consciousness of the oak tree from which it was cut.\n\nWe hit $23,275! The Mushroom Mage with Seed Fan will be added to the Mushroom set and will be available as a $6 add-on. This wind mage carries the chosen weapon of his order, using it to strengthen the summoning of his gales and dustdevils. \n\nWe hit $23,877! The Male Half-Orc Ronin will be added to the Core set and will be available as a $7 add-on. He's not a real samurai. He's clearly part of the peasant class, and everything from his accent to his brutal fighting method give him away as a fraud. You'd be a fool to say it to his face though!\n\nWe reached $24,500! The Spore with a Stick will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. Spore Form is ideal for travel, carrying messages, or for fleeing combat. When mushroom folk are defeated in combat, they revert to this form. \nWe reached $25,000! The Mushroom Druid with Glaive (Octopus Stinkhorn Head!) will be added to the Mushroom Set and will be available as a $6 add-on. \"Old Devil's Fingers\" they called him. But he showed them. He showed them all . . . by being really kind to everyone!\nWow! You scrolled so far!

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Storyboards, animatics, a soundtrack, 3D models! Back at the Goodie Bag level and higher to grab all these cool bits 'n' pieces. The perfect backer level for folks who wanna see how the sausage is made. Higher levels even grant special thanks in the credits!\n ALL IN! Really wanna become an indispensable part of the project? Maybe even make animation history? The very highest tiers of support grant in-story cameos, personalized Lackadaisy-sona designs, original art from Tracy and the crew, and MORE. \n There's something available at practically every level of support!\n $85,000 is the minimum we would need to make sure this one-of-a-kind project comes to fruition. But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture!

Design your color scheme online and have your miniature sent directly to professional artists who will recreate your digital color designs by hand!\nWe are working with top-notch painting studios like Den of Imagination and Mixed Dimension to bring you high-quality display-worthy professional paint jobs that are true to your digital design.\nOur favorite painters will work from your saved color design, replicating your color scheme choices by hand-mixing paints to match your digital design.\nToken Maker Unlimited\nDesign and export unlimited custom \"tokens\" for use in your favorite virtual tabletop platform.

While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge. Backer reward redemption will be facilitated by digital voucher codes redeemable on www.heroforge.com.\nWe have been developing exciting new tools to fully utilize the most revolutionary 3D printing technology and hardware. It is a big job, but who better to do it than the makers of the original 3D printed custom miniatures?\nHigh-Quality Web-Based Rendering\nWhether you want to fully paint your design with a couple of clicks or hand-tune unique digital 'paints' to capture your character's aesthetic perfectly, we have you covered.\nWe wanted users to be able to do more than apply flat colors, so we looked to traditional, real-world painting techniques to inform our designs. Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures. Since then, we\u2019ve shipped hundreds of thousands of miniatures to dozens of countries around the world. We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options. We've added over a thousand new parts, two dozen new fantasy races, and ever-improving materials in both plastic and metal. In 2019, we began adding fresh content every single week. \nTens of thousands of users have visited every \"Treasure Tuesday\" to see what we\u2019ve added from our ever-growing \u2018user wish-list\u2019 of content requests. And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added. Your backing will help us in the process of updating our library of thousands of parts to support rich, in-depth color customization, and launch exciting feature additions sooner.\nThe Future of Hero Forge\n\n                       Hero Forge 2.0 will expand and enhance the design capabilities that Hero Forge is famous for. You can expect us to continue our tradition of innovation, setting the bar for customization and artistry for custom miniatures. \nPreview just a few of our planned additions and advancements in the hero featured in our splash image: XL epic wings, dynamic and detailed bases, magical weapon effects, and cute new companions represent just some of the exciting new features we have planned, so even more people can design their perfect miniature.

Established in 2014 after the runaway-hit Hero Forge crowdfunding campaign, we continue to grow our cutting-edge web-based design application and explore the latest in 3D printing manufacturing. \nSpecial thanks to Fantasy Grounds for letting us feature screen captures of their virtual tabletop program, Kraken Dice for providing the dice featured in our photography, Izzy Gramp for color design, and Kate Elliot at www.kvephotography.com for editing our Kickstarter video.\nWe are lucky to work with incredibly talented artists all over the world, and would like to thank them for their contributions to Hero Forge. In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

Go to the Reaper Pledge Manager to see how much you should add. You can always add more to your pledge later, but only money added right now during Kickstarter will count towards unlocking future stretch goals!\n We've taken the Core Set and broken it into smaller chunks, so if you want a specific miniature you can just add the amount shown to your pledge and select it as a reward in the Reaper Pledge Manager.

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

But not any miniatures. Our expert team of Gnome Wizards work tirelessly to bring the most customizable and powerful figures for your character. Our sleek, seamless, flash-less miniatures are unrivaled in appearance and each is blessed by a team of Clerics. \n    Can\u2019t find the perfect miniature for your Dwarven Fighter?  \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Are the only miniatures available carrying a broadsword instead of a warhammer? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Is the figure\u2019s beard too short for your perfect avatar? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Through dark and forbidden rituals, we have given you, the player, the ability to select everything about your character. Complete customization is now in the hands of the player. Whatever hands, head, tail, wings, clothes, weapons, and practically anything else you can think of, we can do. Even the most mundane of coin purses will look amazing on your character \u2013 through our high-quality 3D printing.  \n This project combines everything you want from a miniature - the original creative art, with the best quality that can be found for a customized unique printed miniatures.\n*Warning: Miniatures may contain bonus Experience Points \n     The Eldritch Foundry has partnered with the leading US 3D printer manufacturer, 3DSystems, and our in-house printers utilize the most advanced technology available on the market. As such, we are printing at a quality that is substantially higher than anyone else. We print at about 40% higher definition than anyone else on the market.\nMost miniatures currently available on the market are printed at around 50 microns. An Eldritch Foundry miniature is printed at around 32 microns. In addition, we use wax supports. This process means your miniatures will have no flash, no mold lines, and no seams. \n       Our character creator interface is like nothing you\u2019ve seen before, except perhaps in video games. We have developed a one-of-a-kind character creator to a look and feel that closely resembles the character creators in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Planescape, Torment, or even Skyrim (well, at least the starting bit). The interface is intuitive and easy to use, while providing for a maximum level of customization for your miniature.\n    Each and every character choice, from race and class, to armor and weapons, has a unique lore associated with it. We have partnered with several brilliant writers (most notably- the amazing Patrick Stuart!) to create a lore that is as unique as our character creator. \n    This process, from the unique character creator to the expansive and in-depth lore,  makes creating a high quality and custom miniature more immersive and helps create a world-building experience.\n       We have developed the first and only conditional marker base for your miniatures. This base allows for the quick and easy identification of conditional statuses of your character, without the need for conditional rings or milk jug rings. The conditions available on your unique Eldritch Foundry miniature base include poisoned, restrained, concentration, deafened, petrified, grappled, blinded, and frightened. We have even provided conditional marker bases that are blank, if you prefer to draw your own. We\u2019ll even have an option where you can choose which conditions you want on your base (but that\u2019s a bit more down the line).\n      In order to bring you the finest quality miniatures, every piece is first individually drawn by gentle hands of our Tiefling concept artists. Then, these sketches are animated, given sentience, and turned into 3-dimensional models.  Our miniatures are then crafted from these models by an expert team of Gnome Wizards. This process is designed to bring you the highest-quality, unique, and magically enchanted miniatures possible. \n      To bring you more, we must first provide offerings to the lords of darkness and miniatures, who enslave hapless concept artists for no less than 99 years. These concept artists provide us with all the exquisite art, in order to bring the most realistic and beautifully rendered miniatures to you, the player.  Through this project we intend to bring you more items, races, mounts, perhaps a campaign setting, and even a little thing we think of as \"the bits box\".\n       The Eldritch Foundry's founders are gamers, like you. We would like to let gamers take their character from the imaginary and make them a reality. To provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of the model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing quality available. More than that, table-top gaming is a community experience. As such, we provide services both with online sales and through friendly local gaming stores.  \nEnjoyable and intuitive site - for the quick and easy customization of your characters.\nUnique and original craftsmanship -of all the items, armor, weapons, clothes, and accessories your character will ever need.\nBuilt-in status indicator bases - for quick and easy identification of character status' \nNew origin lore written for Eldritch Foundry - making the character creation process much more immersive and interesting. \nQuality 3D printing - showing the finest detail available on the market, exactly as designed by you, the player.\n      The Eldritch Foundry, a group of nerds and geeks dedicated to bringing the most unique and customizable miniatures available. We are committed to improving your games. And we are enthusiastic about our mission.\nThe Eldritch Foundry loves the TTRPG community- and acts on it with a business model that is geared towards helping your local gaming store thrive. We incentivize foot traffic by offering free shipping if you send your avatar to your local gaming store. We share in every miniature sale made within store grounds, and for every miniature sent to stores.\nRetailers- feel free to reach out, we'd love to discuss this in person!\nOur partner FLGS, Knight's Watch Games:\n  \"Eldritch Foundry is a revolutionary company that bridges the gap between producers, retailers and customers.  The ability for a customer to design, purchase and pick-up their customized miniature at the brick and mortar store facilitates better relationships between buyer and seller, guarantees a better shopping experience, and higher customer satisfaction. The immersive process of personalizing a character and reading the powerful descriptions for the various options makes building your dream character super entertaining!\" - Brenda and Paraic Mulgrew of Knight's Watch Games\nThe Eldritch Foundry is a firm believer that the TTRPG community is just that- a community. We strive to work with everybody- from stores, to local artists, to gaming streams, and beyond. As such, we've begun partnering with the D4 D&D stream (go check them out!) to provide their gaming miniatures.\nWe've also started working with artists from the community which we love- first and foremost- the Griffon's Saddlebag (you can see his Retaliating Shield on some of our minis, even!).\n      Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nUS shipping (to your local gaming store)- FREE!\nRest of the world - shipping will cost $10.\n What is the Eldritch Foundry?\n      We are two friends, who quit our day jobs, and founded Eldritch Foundry. We provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of your miniature\u2019s model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing technology available. This process will give your miniatures a sleek, seamless, flash-less appearance not available in any other product on the market.\nHow do the miniature coupons work?\n      All rewards for \u201ccustom miniature coupon(s)\u201d are presented as coupons, and as such, are good indefinitely. This allows you to redeem at any point and even for future releases and features.  \nWhen will the Miniatures Ship?\n      Tricky question! Our full Character Foundry will be up and running August 1st, when we debut at Gen Con. We are currently gunning for a weeks turnaround (1-2 days to print, 3-6 days of shipping in the US), but a two week turnaround is a bit more likely (especially if we have a huge backlog). \nIt should be noted that we will be adding more and more items, races, weapons and\u2026 stuff(?) as time progress, so if you have a specific idea for your mini, look up our development schedule on our site!\nWhat about international shipping?\n      Shipping to the US is free of charge. Shipping to Western Europe is going to add about 10$ on top of your pledge level.\nHow do I select more than one pledge goal?\n     In Kickstarter you can only really select one pledge goal, but no worries. If none of the pledge levels are just right, pick the one closest to what you want, and you can adjust upwards later in our backer kit. \nRetailers - What are the typical cost of an Eldritch Foundry miniature in a retail store?\n      Our current pricing point for a single miniature is about MSRP 35$. The conditional marker base should add another 10$ on top of that.

As such, we have a hard deadline to have our character creator site up and running by August 2019. With this in mind, our current plan is to launch as soon as possible, with various additional features being introduced later on in the development phase. These additional features, which are being considered non-essential for initial launch, are thus marked down as a phase 2. For example, these additional features consist of features like \u201cbits\u201d purchasing and social media sharing with cool filters are lower on our priority list.\n In all regards, development of the product is largely complete with high-quality highly detailed miniatures. This project is intended to raise capital in financially reasonable way.\n\n\n2) Asset creation:\n\n Our asset creation timeline is very much dependent on how successful the Kickstarter campaign is. Our current funding is enough to let us reach Gen Con 2019 with an already assembled asset library of high Fantasy weapon and armor sets, and the base races of Humans, Elves (& half-Elves), Dwarves, Goliaths and Halflings.\n The greater our success, the faster we hope to add additional assets and features to the system. However, there is an upper limit to how fast we can add additional assets, while still maintaining a high-quality of production. We will have a production schedule posted on our home website once we see how far ahead, we are. This will allow Eldritch Foundry fans to come and see new products and plan ahead for when their favorite race and genres come online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

It's about polyamory and queer families and safe havens in a world that wants to hurt us. It's about seeing problems that others refuse to solve and taking the matters into our own hands. In this game, we will take on the role of the titular Dust Wardens, people bound together by a force called Limerence which allows us to draw upon potent magical powers.\nHow does it play?\nDust Wardens has a similar structure to powered by the apocalypse games, with the caveat that there are no playbooks, and it uses a tarot deck instead of dice.\nCharacters in Dust Wardens have four stats:\nGuts measures your forcefulness and how comfortable you are enacting your will on others.\n\nGlamour measures your dramaturgy and how comfortable you are putting yourself on display for others to see.\nGuile measures your cunning and how comfortable you are manipulating others.\n\nGive measures your tenderness and how comfortable you are acknowledging other people's struggles.\nWhen you do something that corresponds to one of the Basic Actions or would be cause for a moment of tension, you draw a number of cards equal to the stat that most closely aligns with the action being taken. The outcome of your action is determined by the value of the highest card drawn:\n2-5: You suffer a major setback and don\u2019t accomplish your goal.\n6-10: You succeed at a cost or face a difficult choice.\nFace: You succeed, gaining exactly the outcome you wanted.\nAce cards and Major Arcana cards are special cases:\nAces: You succeed, and activate a special ability based on the Ace drawn.\nMajor Arcana: When you draw a Major Arcana, something weird and magical happens. Additionally, if the card is upright, treat it as a face. If it's reversed, consider it a 2. Interpret the card as a group, and decide on its consequence together.\nAdditionally, you'll swear Vows to each other at character creation. These inform your party dynamics, and are also a crucial part of creating your Coven together. Your magic is powered by love and trust, so upsetting the balance between members of your Coven may have dire consequences! On the other hand, if you work together and hold each other in your hearts, even miracles are possible...\nSo what's the money for?\nDust Wardens is, essentially, complete. It's currently on its seventh revision, and is awaiting contractor writing, some layout work, and a cover. Primarily, the money from this Kickstarter will be for paying for that labor, as well as ordering and shipping physical copies of the game.\n$750: kickstarter fees and \"just in case\" money\n$250: self compensation\n$1500: budget for contractor writing and layout\n$1000: producing and shipping the Zine Edition through Strikethrough Press\n$2000: producing and shipping  the Book Edition\nAll money beyond that which is needed to pay for contractors and fulfilment will go to myself, because I need to pay rent.\nWhat are your rates?\nAll contractor writing and layout will be compensated at a rate of 40 cents per word.\nStretch Goals\nFor every $1,500 beyond the goal, all contractor rates increase by ten cents a word.\nWho's on the team?\nMy name is Nora Blake (she/her & zi/zin), and I'm a podcaster and game designer and one half of Happy Rebel Tapestries! I have been working on Dust Wardens for just shy of two years now, and I'm very excited to bring it to the public eye! \nHere are some examples of my work!\n Facade, a Sparked by Resistance RPG about vampires and the pressures they live under in a society that marginalizes and exoticizes them\n Seeds of Rebellion, an anti-fascist RPG of emotion and memory magic\n Delver by Happy Rebel Tapestries, a surrealist dreamscape RPG of meaning-making and dungeon crawling\nI've also contributed to a number of RPG Kickstarters in the past, including:\nThe Hunted playbook from Interstitial: Our Hearts Intertwined by Riley Hopkins\nThe Zalmoxis playset from Thirteen Demon Princes by Taylor LaBresh\nThe Fallen playbook from Exodus by Erika Shepherd\nI'm also joined by a number of fantastic contractors!!\nNatalie the Knife (she/her) is a tremendous designer with an eye for delicate and specific writing. You may know her as the other half of Happy Rebel Tapestries. She'll be contributing a chapter about safety at the table and what it means to keep each other's wellbeing in mind when we sit down to play together.\nSasha Reneau (they/them) is a spectacular artist and designer who excels at stirring and evocative language. You may know them as the creator of Spindlewheel. They'll be contributing a tarot glossary to help interpret Major Arcana cards at the table and make sure your game stays weird and magical even if you don\u2019t know tarot!\nErika Shepherd (she/her) is a wonderful writer and designer whose passion and earnestness are a constant inspiration of mine. You may know her as the creator of Exodus. She\u2019ll be contributing a chapter about road trips and vulnerability and what it means to put yourself in the hands of your companions and the people you meet along the way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne way or another, the game is coming out.

It envisions an utopian enclave hidden so deep in the wilderness that it is considered forbidden territory. The tribe is focused on preserving an ancient magic with the help of gods and dinosaurs. Be the first to explore it!\n\"Bloodsail Island\" is an established line of ruthless ogre pirates. Upon discovering the Temple of Serpent they have became overpowered by the desire to plunder its treasures. They are going to need every hand on deck for this one, so the line is getting a massive extension! \nOur products are in 28mm scale and come with square bases. Check rotating pictures at the bottom of our campaign to see all the details. All miniatures are made from high-quality resin that ensures highest details, durability and flexibility. \nBased on our Kickstarter experience and community feedback we have came up with the simplest Reward System to date. You can choose one of the following pledges.\n***UPDATED - Now every backer that pledged at least $1 will receive a free .STL file with the Dwarven Swashbucklers. 4 amazing miniatures for 3D printing!\nDeckhand Pledge is for you if you are not sure what you need but you want to be a part of the campaing. It will give you the access to the Pledge Manager where you will be able to spend your additional funds on any miniatures you want. \nBasic Pledge is for you if you do not want to pick a side. It is really simple. You plede $99 and you receive $99 to spend on addons. But on top of that you will choose and receive either a set of Serpent Freebies OR Ogre Freebies. The more SG we unlock the more value will come with those freebies packs.\nIn Captain Pledge you become the commander of ogre pirate army! Pledge $199 to get Captain Krabor in special offer for $40.

In order to get them you need to choose Basic Pledge and pledge $117 (3x $39) for it. This will allow you to spend that $117 in Pledge Manager and choose 3x Raptor Riders. On top of that you will be able to choose a set of freebies (either Serpent of Ogre one).\nExample 2: You want Captain Krabor, 3 units of Sharkman that are $39 each and 5 units of goblins that are $12 each. In order to get those you should choose Captain Pledge and pledge $217 for it. In this pledge Captain Krabor is in a better price and you will also get $159 for other addons. You need 3x $39 + 5x $12 = $177 so you need to pledge $18 on top of the pledge price to cover everything. \nIn case of any mistakes, there will be no problem with make a correction. You will always be able to add funds in the Pledge Manager via PayPal, so if you do not pledge enough through Kickstarter, you will still be able to get everything you need after the campaign ends.\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager after our campaign ends.

The only problem is, nearly all of the tastiest snacks are unhealthy. And when we turn to healthier snacks, most of the choices are bland and taste like cardboard (we're looking at you, kale chips!).\nWe've worked for over two years to bring to life a snack without any tradeoffs. To do that, we had to throw out potatoes and tortillas and create a chip out of an entirely new base-- egg whites! \n As Featured In:\nWith notes of salsa and spice, our signature flavor combines the eggcitement of gourmet huevos rancheros with the convenience of a bag of chips. With only 2 net carbs per bag, it fits right in to the Keto lifestyle. Did we mention it'll get you jacked, too? Each bag of Rancheros has 10 GRAMS of protein. And as if that all weren't good enough, this flavor has 6 grams of fiber. If you watch your macros, you need some Quevos Rancheros!\n\nSour Cream & Onion, like all our flavors, is lactose free, but you would never know it! If you're looking for a delicious, creamy flavor with a hint of onion zest, this one's for you. Sour Cream & Onion has the same stellar macros as Quevos Rancheros-- 10 grams of protein, 2 net carbs, and 6 grams of fiber. \n\nA NEW FLAVOR LAUNCHING RIGHT HERE ON KICKSTARTER!\nFresh off the grill, this flavor provides the classic Barbeque chip experience. On the sweeter side but with a hint of smoke, this one on is a snack lovers dream! We pack in five grams of protein and five grams of fiber into every bag of Sweet Barbeque so you can indulge without any of the guilt of a conventional BBQ snack! \n\nThis flavor is also a NEW INTRODUCTION to the Quevos family specially released for kickstarter! Cheddar has the same macros as Sweet Barbeque, but with a strong cheesy punch. If you like cheese, order these, please! Incredibly, despite the powerful flavor on this chip, Cheddar Quevos are lactose free.\n The T Shirt (only available in select reward tiers)\nMost delicious snacks are cursed with one or more nutritional weaknesses. Often, they have artificial ingredients, high levels of sugar and unhealthy fats, and/or they're loaded with starch from sources like potatoes, corn, and white flour. On top of that, they're typically fried. And worst of all, most tasty snacks usually have deceivingly small serving sizes, making a quick snack into something close to a MEAL if we're not careful. \nQuevos were created as an answer to these nutritional problems. But we spent a painstaking amount of time making sure we didn't lose out on deliciousness as we crafted our product. After all, we wanted people to EAT our snack, not just think it was a cool idea! What we came up with is a revolution in the snack category. Quevos pack over twice as much protein and fiber into each serving than conventional snacks like potato and tortilla chips do. We get fats from superfood sources like avocado oil and chia seeds. Our chips are gluten free, lactose free, and soy free. Quevos don't have artificial ingredients, and they're not fried. And to put a cherry on top, each bag (one serving) is over 30 chips! Quevos leave you satisfied-- happy with a delicious snack and full and nourished from our incredible nutrient composition! \nAlso Contains: Milk (ghee)\nPlease note: Our facility also processes tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans. \nZack, our co founder, is type 1 diabetic and frequently cooks egg whites as a low carb snack. His favorite part of any egg dish he makes are the crispy pieces left in the pan. In June 2016, he was eating some egg white crispies and couldn't help but think about how they crunched and cracked just like potato chips. He wondered, \"Is it possible to make a chip out of egg whites?\" He saw the potential for a higher protein, lower carb, and overall more nutritious snack. So he called Nick (his best friend since age 9!) over and they began formulating in Zack's kitchen. \nJune 2016: First prototype batch. Our baby was ugly!\nThings got serious when Nick took the idea for Quevos and our early prototypes to the New Venture Challenge at University of Chicago. Ben, David, Nick, and Zack spent 10 weeks in a rigorous business development course that taught us about customer discovery, market sizing, financial projections, and creating a business plan. At the end of the course, we pitched to a panel of 19 investors who judged us against the 9 other teams in the class. We won first place, taking home $15,000 from the Booth School of Business.\nMarch 2018: We took this to the bank and they didn't accept it :(\nFor most of last year, our main focus was perfecting our product. We used our early seed funding to buy hundreds of ingredients, which we tried out in over a thousand different combinations. Plus, we experimented with different cooking processes at a pilot production lab we rented space in. To get feedback on each new version, we sampled with healthy snackers in gyms and health food shops around Chicago. Slowly, but surely, Quevos were improving.\nJune 2018: David, Ben, and Nick sampling product at the the IDEA Fit convention in San Diego\n\nFeedback on Quevos had become very positive by the fall of 2018 and we knew we were ready to go. Zack and Nick were working long days during the summer, and it was clear that we wouldn't be able to commit to both Quevos and our education fully. So we dropped out of college to work on Quevos full time! We found a commercial kitchen space, began production, and launched our market test around Chicago stores and online. It was tremendous to finally have a product in a package on a shelf. Our idea had become a reality! \nNovember 2018: What a crazy feeling to finally get Quevos on store shelves! @Freshii in Chicago\n\nThe reception of Quevos has been phenomenal, so much so that we sold out of our entire inventory in March. Now we are scaling up to produce at higher volumes so we can get our snack out there to every healthy snacker in need of a better option! We can't do this alone, though. WE NEED YOUR HELP to fund our first large scale production run so that we can make thousands of bags to sell online and in natural food stores around the country!\n\nMarch 2019: SOLD OUT!!\nSupport us! We don't want to live and work in our parents' house forever\n\nThanks for reading!! If you choose to support our growth, we really really appreciate it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are abundant risks with any startup company bringing a product to market. Thankfully, we have already gone through a good portion of them. We completed a market test over the last 4 months, selling online on quevos.com and in ten stores around Chicago. The reception Quevos received was fantastic, which is why we are scaling up our manufacturing facility and launching in earnest now. We need your help fronting the costs of a large production run we want to do in May. If all goes according to plan and we hit our goal in this Kickstarter, we will ship out your rewards in June!\n\nSince we need to buy new packaging equipment and that has a lead time between 3-6 weeks, there could be delays which cause our shipments to arrive at your door in July. But rest assured, if we hit our funding goal we'll go straight into squaring everything away for production and then start manufacturing bags of Quevos by the thousands!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "A few Quevos", "descp": "Try a 6 pack of Quevos!\nOptions:\n-Mix of our Keto flavors (Quevos Rancheros and Sour Cream & Onion)\n-Mix of our new flavors (Sweet Barbeque and Cheddar)\n-Mix of all our flavors\n(We'll ask you for your flavors later)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["786 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "International Pack", "descp": "The demand from overseas was overwhelming, so we lowered the international rates for THIS REWARD TIER ONLY!\n10 bags of Quevos.\nOptions:\n-Mix of our Keto flavors (Quevos Rancheros and Sour Cream & Onion)\n-Mix of our new flavors (Sweet Barbeque and Cheddar)\n-Mix of all our flavors\n(We'll ask you for your flavors later)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["147 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "More Quevos", "descp": "15 bags of Quevos!

He spent his time fine-tuning his craft and figuring out how best to convey a story. Nick moved to Portland in 2007. After years working at Barnes & Noble, he joined Katie's team to open Books with Pictures in 2016, first part-time, and then full-time.

Some of her favorite comics include Blue Monday, Giant Days, and Kiss Number 8.\n  Katie and the BwP Crew!\nThe building at 1401 SE Division St was built in 1927 to hold the Crucciola family's grocery store and butcher shop, with an outbuilding for keeping chickens just behind. Patriarch Antonio Crucciola passed away in 1946, but the neighborhood grocery carried on. By 1964, the building was in the hands of J.P. Wilder, who started advertising for shop workers and delivery personnel for his business, J.P. Wilder Company, repairing automobile brakes and clutches. The chicken coop became a machine shop, and the dirt lot was paved. The last ad for shop workers ran in 1968. By 1975 the building was tied to ads in the Oregonian for \"BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS.\" Since then--nearly half its life--this two-story wood-frame live-above retail shop has been a spot for literature.\n\n                             In 1976 the shop, Serendipity Corner Books, was purchased by Jean Bader and her friend and \u201csilent partner\u201d Frank Barst; it was already a \u201ccluttered old bookstore, then filled with empty soda bottles and sloppy stacks of musty books and magazines,\u201d Jean told the Oregonian. Serendipity sold used books, as well as both used and new comics, until 1986, when Jean moved to Lincoln City to manage a bookstore there.\n\n                             From 1985 to 1991, the shop was leased to Pegasus Books, the multi-branched comics chain that would eventually become Things From Another World. In 1991, Jon Hagen bought it and moved his decade-old store Longfellow\u2019s Books and Records there from its Moreland neighborhood location on SE Milwaukee. Longfellow\u2019s specialized in rare and antiquarian books, and also carried extensive runs of old magazines and rare folk records collected on Jon\u2019s scouting trips up and down the Oregon coast. For the past decade, Jon\u2019s son Nile had been helping him run the business, especially its online presence. In 2016, the Oregonian voted Longfellow\u2019s a \u201cuniquely Portland experience,\u201d and their \u201cfavorite bookstore.\u201d Jon died on Jan. 25 of last year, at the age of 80, and Nile put the building up for sale in the fall.\n\n                             Katie first spoke with Nile about buying it on November 6, Election Day: \u201cWhen Nile told me he was selling the building, I thought, \u2018there is no possible way I can do that.\u2019 And then I rushed home and called a bunch of people to figure out how to do it.\u201d She wound up forming the limited liability corporation Building for Books LLC, and bringing together about twenty friends and supporters to help make the purchase. Her plans for the space include not just a bigger, better Books with Pictures, but also a record store in the basement and a food cart pod in the parking lot. The new plans for this Building for Books touch on many of its roots: food, comics, books, music. But most importantly, it will bring new life to this beloved neighborhood corner.

It has been ruled for generations by the birdfolk who inhabit the Great Tree-City of Alderheart. Humblewood has endured for centuries thanks to the industry and compassion of its people...\n...but now the fires have come, and the Woods have been thrown into chaos. Flames ravage the land and destroy the homes of the humblefolk, stoking a growing resentment against the birdfolk, whose cities have managed to avoid the worst of the fires so far. Hatred burns in the hearts of those who have lost lives they cherished, and these once peaceful peoples now take up the sword and turn to banditry. The disaffected turn their gaze on Alderheart, and threaten to reduce an age of peace to ashes... \n...yet there is still hope. Even in these dark times, brave heroes can be found within the Wood. Only they can quell the raging flames that have been unleashed upon the land, and restore balance to the realm. Will you answer the call?    \nResidents of Humblewood\nThe Birdfolk \n\nThe birdfolk races have ruled over Humblewood from their canopy villages and fortified cities for as long as anyone can remember. Play as one of the five core birdfolk races:\nThe astute crow-like Corvum who safeguard Humblewood\u2019s knowledge\nThe dignified fowl-like Gallus who have faith in the power of community\nThe aloof pidgeon-like Lumas who use their gifts to bring joy into the world\nThe agile hawk-like Raptors who blaze new trails through the forest\nThe powerful owl-like Strig who defend what they believe is right\nThe Humblefolk\nThe humblefolk live in small villages throughout the Wood, but are occasionally found in birdfolk cities. Play as one of the five core humblefolk races:\nThe hearty deer-like Cerva who strive to achieve their goals \nThe sensitive hedgehog-like Hedges whose empathy lets them see what others cannot\nThe brave mouse-like Jerbeen who inspire those around them with deeds of heroism\nThe resourceful raccoon-like Mapach who can craft a solution to any problem\nThe cunning fox-like Vulpin who are always one step ahead of their foes\nThe Bandits\nOnce a loosely organized confederacy of crime, its ranks have swelled with humblefolk displaced by the spreading fires who have turned to banditry to survive. Under the guidance of a new leader, they seek to exact retribution upon the birdfolk cities and sow discord throughout the Wood.\nMonsters of Humblewood\nThe Oozes\nDeep within the murk of the Mokk Fields live several species of this most resilient life-form. Battle your way through caustic slimes whose touch is a deadly acid, sticky slimes that can suck a weapon right out of your hand, and the rare shifting slimes which feed on magical energies to become ever stronger. \nThe Beasts\nHumblewood is home to a variety of beasts whose size, strength, and abilities can only have grown thanks to the Wood\u2019s magic. Face craggy skinned mountain lions whose roar can summon rockslides, hunt the deadly forest prowlers in their woodland lair, and tangle with the giant sea monster (art coming soon!) in a battle on the high sea!\nThe Elements of Flame\n\nThe great calamity which produced the part of Humblewood known as the Scorched Grove also made the area an ideal home for fiery creatures. Withstand the searing heat of an emberbat swarm: a vortex of tiny flying creatures, each one a smouldering ember with wings! Confront the terrifying ashsnake and it\u2019s deadly pyroclastic breath! Legends say there may even be a primal elemental force lurking within the Scorched Grove.

It's a dive into pre-colonial Africa for all the rich lore you've never heard of. It's an exploration into a world where the majority of the faces are dark, yet isn't constrained to one corner. It's a world where women hold power equal to men and the merit of ones soul is what propels them through life. It's a world where spirits aren't to be feared, they are to be embraced. In a time where we know that representation matters, this project is an effort to add to that spirit in the way I know best. Narrative fiction in the nerdiest of flavors. \nSwordsfall is made up of three key parts; World Anvil, Tabletop RPG and Stories/Novels. Each of them telling a different part in the lore that is the world of Tikor. This Setting and Artbook is part of that synergy and the first step toward realizing the Tabletop RPG.\n For the Full Plan - Check out the Swordsfall Patreon\n Read our Feature in Kotaku!\nFinal Concept Piece for the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Story So Far...\nIn the beginning... Tikor is a world where deities and spirits are as real as the nature that surrounds them. Since the earliest writings of mankind, the gods have been there with them. They are a vital part of the makeup of human societies across the globe. This is in a way to be expected. Humans were in fact, created by the gods. Various great deities created cultures of their design and ethos. As time marched forward, these various cultures and groups co-existed. Sometimes contentiously, sometimes harmoniously, but always striving to co-exist. \nConcept Art for the Dihoma - Artwork by Tumo Mere\n\nHistory, however, would change over the course of a tragic day and its horrific night. Mime, the Garuda deity of Wisdom, is assassinated at the hands of an alleged Vinyatian assassin. Mortal hands had never slain a deity. As tensions between the rival nations of Garuda and Vinyata soared under a long Tikor night, a bloody battle erupted between the two sides. A truce was called once the truth was revealed, but not before irreversible damage to both sides was done. \nDespite the armistice between bitter enemies, the wounds of that day will forever linger. The world heaves as the one constant, the gods themselves, waver and a new struggle begins.\nSwordsfall Logo Designed by Taylor Ruddle\nTHE YEAR 10 A.R\nAs the world still recovers, ten years after the bloody events that ended the Era, its fallout begins to appear. Rumors begin to give rise around the world of the arrival of a new kind of weapon. Instruments capable of killing gods, Grim Arms. Could this be related to the unsolved assassination of Mime? \nIn Garuda, a power struggle is in full effect as the current ruler of The Divine Order of the Phoenix, Amma Zencora, vies to hold onto his ill-gotten throne. How far will the ruler go to defend the throne he so desperately wants to hold on to? \nKevin Hou has allowed his art be used in Swordsfall\nVinyata is adjusting to a world with one less major city and cultural hub. The Eastern Node having been destroyed during the bloody war at the End of the Era. An unpleasant surprise emerges as they rebuild and a rash of malevolent spirits now roam the region. The souls of those lost 10 years still attached to the mortal plane, hungry for vengeance and retribution.\nHawklore's neutrality during The Longest Night has finally paid dividends. Literally. The God King, Hawken, basks in the increasing wealth of his nation. On the outside, it seems like a rich paradise where any want can be attained. Yet below, in the dingy streets of the capital city, High Perch, dissension stirs.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nRumors abound that the desolate stretch of land known as the Ebon Cascade has stirred with a new form of horror. Something cunning. And it's uniting the monstrous beings that call it home. Whispers say a Raksha is on Tikor, hiding away, building an army. None want to believe the horrifying rumor, yet none dare to confirm it either.\nIn the boundless waters of The Grand Divide, new forces stir as the largest pirate fleet of them all, Heaven's Fall, begins to marshal. With the cold genius of Nubia leading them, her power has begun to make those on land to take notice. The law of the sea changes as rumors of an alliance between her and the tech genius, Ken Musa begin to stir.\nIn all corners of the world, events are in motion.\n Visit the website - Official Swordsfall Website\nThe Book\nWelcome to Tikor will be an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book, printed on premium color for the richest and vivid colors. With this being an artbook, the quality and feel of the book is important.\n*Update* Due to the overwhelming support of our backers, we hit the goal for OFFSET PRINTING! The book will be printed by PrintNinja, with the solid binding and paper quality you wanted!\nThe main point of this Kickstarter is to raise money for the art. Being able to see the dynamic characters and unique setting with your own eyes is something that can't be replaced. The goal represents the minimum needed to make that happen.\nAs for the book, the length will be around 150 pages, though it could be longer depending on the amount of money raised. The max page count will be around 200 pages no matter what. \nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\n\nThe Setting and Art Book will be a combination of T'umo's art, and Brandon's lore. Each piece of detailed full-color art will be accompanied by information about the person, place or thing it depicts For those only interested in the art, this lore will help bring the art to life and give it meaning. The kind of book you can sit down and just read.\nHowever, for those interested in the setting for their own games of the future Swordsfall RPG, then this serves as your window to the Afropunk setting. Throughout the pages, you will find a living world that easily makes the backdrop the right Tabletop System. However, this Setting and Artbook contains NO RULES. Just pure, sweet narrative world-building and fantastic art.\nSwordsfall itself has its own custom system that is deep into development.  Much of the art from the artbook will be used in the Corebook itself. Supporting this Kickstarter makes the Corebook's development even faster.\nAn early concept sketch of the Minos - Art by T'umo Mere\nThe Wallpapers\nAs a bonus to our backers all of T'umo's gorgeous work will be turned into amazing high-quality Wallpapers for your PC and phone. While the art will be used in both the Art Book and Corebook, I also want to share it with you the fans. And nothing is better than a gorgeous wallpaper on your home screen.\nThe World Map of Tikor makes for a sexy wallpaper\nAlmost every piece of art that is generated through this Kickstarter will be turned into a vivid piece of wallpaper. As well, there will be multiple resolutions available so you can always have the right size for your screen. We'll be conducting a poll after the Kickstarter to find out what the most used resolutions are. (I doubt we'll be able to do 15 resolutions for all the art)\nThat means you're not just getting the World Map as a wallpaper, but a ton of different ones with different art on it. Do you have a favorite profession? Or a favorite city in Swordsfall? Well, I'm sure there will be a wallpaper with it on it. We plan to have over 50 wallpapers in the bundle. \nA big ol fat zip of Wallpaper goodness.\nA Work in Progress shot of the Griot Wallpaper - Art by T'umo Mere, Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe Poster\nFor the Kickstarter there will be a Limited Edition run of a full-color Poster of the final book cover. The final art cover hasn't been finalized yet, but watch for updates on Kickstarter or the Swordsfall Patreon to see what the final image is. As well, a digital version will be included with all Kickstarter PDF's as part of the Digital Stretch Goals!\nThe Poster of the Minos, currently available on Redbubble!\nIf you like the art, like the poster, then check out our shop! We already have shirts, stickers, and more already available. Buying Swordsfall swag also supports the artists! All our artists receive royalties on shirts their art is featured on.\nCheck out our Official Merchandise: The Swordsfall Shop\nSo, what exactly is the world within the pages of this book? Well, Tikor is a world divided, both in idea and land. Yet, hope remains as the two halves are only divided, not separated. The Northern Hemisphere of Tikor sports much more moderate temperatures and expansive grasslands in the center. The tip of the northern region is snow-capped, with the furthest tips permanently covered in ice.\nThe Southern Hemisphere of Tikor, on the other hand, is essentially a desert wasteland. Or at least that's what some will say. Despite the harsh conditions and cunning predators, various cultures have made a home among the barren sand and oppressive heat. With dunes that sing hypnotic lullabies, mammoth beasts and a second sun that relentlessly bakes the land, the southern half is worlds different from the North.\nThe World of Tikor\n Garuda - The largest nation in the Northwestern Hemisphere of Tikor. A land of green and grasslands, it's headed by the Order of the Divine Phoenix. The organization itself was created by the deities of the land, The Divinity.\n Vinyata - The eternal rival to Garuda and the largest nation in the Southern Hemisphere of Tikor. The desert land is home to the Dracon, a culture descended from the only heroic dragon in history, Ryuu-jin. Despite the unforgiving landscape, the people of the desert have found solace underneath enormous domed cities.\n Hawklore - On the eastern edge of the Northern half of Tikor, lies a nation sitting singular. The country is embroiled in no battles, sieges or upsets to the throne. Instead, it's been lead by one single man, a god in fact. Hawken. And within his cool and steady grip, the nation has remained at the forefront of Azurean mining and economics.\n Grimnest -The living mountain, Enkai, separates Garuda from the western portion of the Northern Hemisphere.  The wrathful deity hasn't allowed a single person to cross his crags in a millennia. It's in this isolation that the rule less land of Grimnest sits. With no official government or ruler, its a land truly free. And also home to pirates, raiders and the spirit powered bounty hunters to reign them in.\n Ramnos - Nestled in the southernmost part of the Southern Hemisphere, this reclusive nation avoids attention at almost all cost. For them, being forgotten is the best thing they could do. Trade in and out of their nation is limited, and trust is a temporary arrangement in Ramnos. And with it being located between the horrors that wait in Ebon Cascade and the Outskirts of Vinyata on the other side, most who are born there stay there.\nSecond set of concept art for the Dihoma - Art by T'umo Mere\n\n Independent Freeland of Teslan - A small island located off of Grimnest. Tucked away in the turbulent ocean, Crystal Priest train to control their gift, all while studying the secrets to Hekan itself. The school for these Azurean molders, Druse Academy, rarely allows visitors into its halls. And the ring of Sentrylocks guarding the island makes it a place people only come to by invitation.\n The Grand Divide -The vast ocean that almost splits the land in two has its own personality. Its sparkling blue and green seas can turn harsh at any given moment. With hellish winds and torrential rain coming on seemingly at its whim. And if the weather doesn't get you, the pirates may. Yet millions flock to the sea everywhere. In search of glory, freedom, and prizes on its sea.\n Ebon Cascade - This perilous zone has swallowed up a chunk of the western part of the Southern Hemisphere. The air near the plagued lands seem to make every pore cry out, threatening to vomit. The waters run yellow with poison and the air feels stiff with suffering. Yet throughout the harshness, humans continue to visit the lands. Pushing their luck, and eventually their lives.\n The Canopy -  Located on the very western quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, this mountain region is unlike anything on Tikor. The peaks of the half a dozen mountains can't be seen from the ground level. Even if you could see them, these majestic peaks are not safe for visiting or habitation. Tales float around about mysterious creatures that whisk away anyone that dares venture into these lands.\nMinos Concept Bust - Art by Tumo Mere\n For More Lore: The Swordsfall World Anvil\n $4,000 \nMoar art from T'umo Mere\nA Deadquiver in action - T'umo Mere\nAt this Pledge level we'll be able to add more fantastic artwork to the Welcome to Tikor. Drawn by Swordsfall team member, T'umo Mere. We'll be adding in more characters to help further illustrate Tikor's diversity with more their detailed illustrations.\n\n $7,000 \nLandscapes and Cities from Sabina Lewis\nSphaerum (Previous Work) - Art by Sabina Lewis\nA world simply isn't complete without vivid scenery to immerse yourself in. To accomplish that, we've enlisted the help of a master in landscape design. The amazing Sabina Lewis! She's agreed to be a guest member on the Swordsfall to help bring the luscious world to life. When we hit this pledge level she'll be able to bring Tikor's incredible world to life.\n\n $10,000 \n Second PDF \"Tikor: The Professionals\"\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nWith your continued support we will be able to release a SECOND PDF as part of the Kickstarter. In the future this will be sold separately, but this and any other unlocked PDF's will be included as part of your Kickstarter!\nTikor: The Professionals will detail the 34 unique professions used in the Swordsfall Corebook. However, they are not classes, they truly are Professions. They are a symbol of not what someone is, but truly what they accomplish in life. The Professionals will talk about these professions in detail including history, location and important figures within each. Each Profession will be accompanied with full page art from T'umo Mere.\n\n $12,000 \nChibi Profession Art and Pins\nA Chibi Celestial Shield in the middle along side two other examples\nSwordsfall team member Taylor Ruddle has long had a love for Chibi art, even studying in Japan to hone his art. He's bring those skills to Tikor by designing Chibi versions of all 34 of Swordsfall's Professions. \nThen we're going to take those adorable creations and craft quality pins from them. They're cute, and fiercely adorable.\n\n $15,000 \n10 page Comic \"The Rise of Nubia\" Prologue\nThe story of Tikor's most famous and powerful pirate is one that needs more than just words. To describe the true depth of the character, only a comic can suffice. And so if we hit this goal Brandon and T'umo will credit a comic of Nubia, leader of Heaven's Fall.\nNubia has become a fan favorite among those who have read the Swordsfall World Anvil. Her strong spirit and fire has made her a often talked about character. The story of her rise may be known by some already, but it's never been shown in this kind of detail or color. \n $20,000 \nThird PDF - \"Pantheons of Tikor\"\nNot the Final Version - Art by T'umo Mere | Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe world of Tikor would not be where it is without the help of its divine beings. Almost the entire world is covered in various spirits and deities. Some influencing the people, and some hindering them.\nIf we reach this goal another PDF will be produced. This one all about the Pantheons that exist on Tikor. From the The Divinity in Garuda to the Orisha in the Outskirts of Vinyata, each pantheon will be detailed. Each pantheon will have gorgeous art alongside of it to show you the lives the divine live.\n$26,000 \nTop Notch Editing and Formatting\nAt this point with now three books in the lineup, we've more than maxed our ability to edit in house or within our circles. It's official become time to bring in the experts.\nIf we hit this tier we'll be able to commission the help of a number of freelance editors to help make the books truly shine. And most importantly, be effortlessly readable (because sometimes English is hard).\n $35,000 \nDragons and Creatures from Jonah Lobe\nDragons from Elder Scrolls: Skyrim - Designed by Jonah Lobe\nA true legendary figure has joined the Swordsfall team for a limited engagement. His creatures are ones you've certainly seen before. Jonah was the genius behind many of the Tamriel's most famous creatures such as the Dragons, Giants, and Draugr. He was also the whiz behind the grotesque Deathclaw and freakish Super Mutants from Fallout 4.\nIf we reach $35,000 the master Jonah himself will apply his dragon scales to the Afropunk style of The Wretched Ones. Swordsfall's own winged horrors. As well, he'll also draw other varied creatures from Tikor's wildlife.\n\n$50,000\nCharacter Design From Venus Bambisa\nTitan Slayer: Tinishi (Previous Work) - Art by Venus Bambisa\nThe look and feel of characters is important to Swordsfall, we want to create truly something unique. To help make the Tikor as rich as possible, we're bringing one of South Africa's most talented Character Concept artist, Venus Bambisa.\nHer design's are just jaw dropping in the way they same to flow an anime style with black faces. Her Artstation has character designs of all sorts, each of them elegant, sleek and badass. I especially love how she shows a characters increase in power. Who doesn't love transforming heroes?\n\n $70,000 \nFourth PDF - \"The Animalists' Guide to Creatures\" - Art by Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere\nNot the Final Version - Design by Taylor Ruddle\nThe final and ultimate goal. A FOURTH book through this kickstarter, and the most expensive. That's because this book will be the most art heavy of them all, featuring art from both Jonah Lobe and T'umo Mere.\nAt this final amount we'll craft a trip through the wildlife across Tikor. From the monstrous Nandi Bear to the adorable and house trained Aardwolf. Each animal will be drawn by one of these dynamic pair. This is not a Monster Manual however, this, like the other books, will be narrative journey through the world. Instead focusing on the the animals and how they fit into the world. Their tales and even their bestial gods.\n\n$100,000\nThe Azurean Finish\nArtist Rendering of the Boxset, not ANYWHERE close to the final design. (The final version will be way cooler, and full of T'umo art)\nWhen we hit the $100,000 goal, I can do what people have wanted for over a week, ALL of the books printed. However, I'm going to do one better and not just print all four books, but print them in stupid high quality. And put in a few little extras. Lets see what your getting!\nThe Details\nAll four books printed\nTwo Variant covers for the Setting and Artbook\nEmbossed covers on all books\nSilk Ribbon bookmark on all books\nAll tucked in a Custom Slipcase with special art\n\n$130,000\nUnleash the Beast\nSwordsfall Studios can come to life\nWhen we hit $130,000 the Formation of Swordsfall Studios will begin! This will allow the core team to work full-time on future projects! Brandon and T'umo will be able to devote their full time and energy to the world!\nThat means more content, the RPG sooner and more! We have so much stuff planned, short run comics, adventures and even modules.

They are the culmination of months of research and development.  They are an expression of our company's mission to create products of uncompromising form and function that do more than hold all your gear. They are a personalized expression of you.  \n\nThe Deluxe, Standard & Double Dice Boxes in Black Limba\n\nWhat sets our dice boxes apart?\n A Tremendous Holding Capability \u2013 the boxes house multiple sets of dice, pens, pencils and minis.  With our multiple sizing options, you choose the size and capacity that works for you. \nHolds 2, 4 or 5 Sets of Polyhedral Dice\n Functionality \u2013 not only do the boxes help organize your gear, but the lid serves as an integral rolling tray.  \nPLAY\n\n\n High Quality Materials \u2013 from hand selected wood, to the luxurious flock adorning the inside pockets, we use the best materials available to protect your gear.\nDouble Dice, Standard and Deluxe in Purple Heart\n Extensive Engraving Options \u2013 your box should be uniquely yours. As such we have compiled an extensive catalog of engraving options to choose from.  Of course, we also offer a custom option if you have a design of your own. \nFrom Top Left: Walnut, Bubinga, Cherry. From Lower Left: Purple Heart, White Oak, Purple Heart\n\nThe Boxes\nThere are three sizes intended to fit your personal gaming gear needs.  From the mighty Deluxe 8, to the just-right Standard 7, to the compact Double Dice, there is a box to fit your indivdidual preference.\n\nThe Deluxe  The 8\" Deluxe Box holds 5 sets of standard polyhedral dice, 2 pencils or pens, and 2 standard miniatures with base.   The lid of the Deluxe also serves as a rolling tray.   This is the perfect box for Game Masters, dice addicts or anyone who needs maximum dice carrying capacity.  \nThe interior pockets and lid are professionally flocked resulting in a velvety look and feel. Rolling dice in the flocked tray has an acoustically gratifying sound that will make you excited to roll again just to hear the sound!  All surfaces of the pockets are flocked to protect your gear.  We know how important it is to ensure your lucky dice are pampered. Happy Dice = Happy RPG Life. \n8 Inch Deluxe Box in Black Limba\n\nThe Standard  The  7 inch Standard Box is designed to be the perfect size for transporting a significant amount of your game gear, while still fitting comfortably into a purse or bag.  It holds 4 sets of standard sized polyhedral dice, 1 pencil or pen and 2 standard minis with base.  Much like the Deluxe Box, the Standard Box interior pockets are flocked, and the lid couples as a rolling tray with the same impeccable acoustics.  \n7 Inch Standard Box in Bubinga\n\nThe Double Dice   Designed for the player on the go who values customization and quality  on a smaller scale, we are proud to offer our compact Double Dice Box.  Just as the name suggests this stunning box holds 2 standard sets of polyhedral dice and a made-to-fit pencil, which is included with the box.   The lid is also pocketed to serve as a rolling tray. Unlike the Deluxe and Standard boxes, the Double Dice Box does not have a flocked interior. \n4.5 Inch Double Dice in Padauk\nWood Options\nWe have selected wood options that complement your box and engraving.  Choose from a variety of Domestics (included in the base price for each reward level) or upgrade to a Premium wood option:\n\nDomestic wood options are included in the base reward price.\n\nPremium wood options available as an upgrade. See reward descriptions for details.\nFor backers of The Ultimate reward we've sourced the rare woods presented below.  Are you an Ultimate backer and have another wood species in mind that you'd like us to find?  Let us know and we'll see what we can do!\nPlease note that these are currently available only for backers of The Ultimate reward\nEngraving Options (The Fun Part!):\nThis is the core of your expression.  One of our primary goals is to ensure that your box represents and is an expression of you. We compiled an extensive (and growing) catalog of engraving options to choose from so we can do just that.  Click over to the catalog on NadarraCreations.com/pages/engraving-options to explore them. We've placed a link on each page of the catalog so you can easily come back to Kickstarter when you're done.\nWhile navigating the catalog, hover over a graphic of interest to display the name of the graphic, whether it is standard or premium and any box size limitations.\nPlease note that each graphic is evaluated for complexity and the time needed to engrave.  Simpler graphics are classified as Standard while those that are more complex have been marked as Premium.  Whenever possible, we have leaned toward Standard.  \nDo not wait to pledge because you are unsure about which engraving to choose. Every Nadarra Creations Dice Box is custom made to your specifications, and we will be producing them in the order that pledges are received.  Rest assured that you can adjust your pledge options throughout the campaign and inform us of your specific wood and engraving choice via the post-campaign survey.\nCustom Engravings:  Have something unique you'd like engraved on your box?  That's great!  Let's do it!  We have just a few key requirements so that we can engrave it for you.  \nWe will need the artwork to be provided in a 'vector graphic format' (.eps, .ai, .svg) with no open or duplicate vectors.  \nWhen the image is scaled down to the engraving dimensions for your chosen box (engraving sizes are 3\" for double dice, 5\" for standard, 5.5\" for deluxe), the line thickness within the vector must be no less than .015 inches. \nWe will evaluate the vector you provide us to ensure the format and parameters are correct, and we will get back to you with additional guidance as needed.  \nWe also reserve the right to request an alternate graphic should the provided artwork be viewed as offensive or inconsistent with the values of our company. \n\nHow to determine your total pledge\nComing up with the total price is simple: Take the pledge amount of the reward you have selected and add each upgrade option price to the total.  We will ask you about your specific prefefences with regard to wood type and artwork in the survey sent to you at the end of the campaign.\nShipping\nThe estimated shipping time frame for each reward is August 2019, but we intend to begin shipping well beforehand.  In the order that pledges are received, box production and delivery will begin at the conclusion of the campaign and continue until all orders are filled.\nInternational Shipping - Please message us for assistance If you are outside of the United States and your Country is not listed as an option, or you need help determining shipping costs.\n\n                                                      OUR STORY\nWho we are \nBased in Portland, Oregon, Nadarra Creations was founded by Scott Weinstein and Alecia Sensor with the idea that superior quality tabletop gaming accessories should be not just beautiful but exceedingly functional and, most importantly, reflect a player\u2019s individuality. We are thrilled to have created a line of dice boxes with a naturally inspired aesthetic that allow us to stick to our core value: form and function without compromise.  \n(Images captured from our first campaign video attempt!)\nHow we started\nThe very first dice box was crafted as a gift for our favorite DM and good friend, Dylan.  He needed a way to organize and transport his gaming gear more easily and in style.  After exploring many of the available options, all of which either limited the amount of gear he could bring or require that he separate it into multiple cases, he worked with us to design something special. Something not only incredibly functional, but beautiful and an expression of him.  This very first box was delivered back in June 2018 and was an instant hit.  It was clear to everyone that there was something different and special about the design and we were immediately commissioned to create several more.  We knew we were onto something and so we got to work!\nPLAY\n\nWhy Back us?\nYour pledge will make it possible for us to continue to grow.

Because we are not outsourcing any of our production, we have complete control over quality and tempo. \n\nWe have successfully developed processes that will scale with increased funding and order volumes and established funding thresholds that, when reached, will enable us to increase our tooling and staff to minimize the increase in time needed to fill the larger number of orders. We intend to deliver in the order that pledges are received and communicate proactively so that our backers are routinely updated as to the status and timing of delivery. \n\nAdditional risks include: Sourcing materials - we have addressed this by identifying multiple sources for lumber, and other consumables. Potential impacts on shipping natural wood products to different climates - We have anticipated this from the beginning and accounted for it with unique innovations in our core product design that stand up to environmental influences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you for your support!", "descp": "We can't thank you enough for your help!

Please be sure to stay tuned to our backer updates page for behind-the-scenes production and rewards updates.\nHave a question? Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page.

Now, with the introduction of our new parts, well over 8000 painters in more than 50 countries are using the Hobby Holder as part of their painting arsenal!\nWe have talked to hundreds of painters across the globe at conventions, online and in person, and we have listened to your wants and needs. Now we are back to add two new pieces to the Hobby Holder system: the Ergonomic Grip for even greater control and comfort and the XL Stability Bar for more support with a wider range of miniature sizes. We are also adding more color to your desks with New Colors of the original Hobby Holder parts with a second production run!\nAll 11 Colors are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nThe Hobby Holder is the World's Most Versatile, Comfortable and Precise Miniature Holder and the ONLY All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip. \nThe translucent blue parts are resin printed prototypes.\nAttach Miniatures to the Hobby Holder with Standard 28mm Bottle Caps or Even Wine Corks for Pinning.   \nAccepts 28mm plastic caps; Citadel \u2122 Paint Caps; Formula P3 paint caps; and 20mm wine cork.\nWith the innovative bottle cap attachment method, just stick your miniatures, based or unbased, to a standard soda/water bottle cap with your favorite sticky stuff (we use Loctite Fun-tak, the best blue-tak on the market!) and you can quickly and easily screw them on and off without ever touching the miniature! Perfect for batch painting because you can switch even wet miniatures without smudging. \nBatch paint with ease and never touch a wet miniature again!\nPin your miniatures? No problem! The center hole of the Hobby Holder is perfectly sized to press fit standard wine corks or any 20mm cork. Just push them in, place in the pinned miniature and get painting! Done with the cork? Insert a paintbrush through the middle hole in the bottom of your Hobby Holder.\n360 Degree Rotation in Any Position for Ultimate Precision\n360 Degree Rotation Overhead Stability Bar Mode with the New XL Stability Bar\n360 Degree Rotation Stability Bar Grip Mode\n360 Degree Rotation in Ergonomic Grip Mode\nWith our unique patent pending design, the Hobby Holder threaded base can easily rotate 360 degrees in the Overhead Stability Bar mode, with the Stability Bar functioning as the grip in Grip Mode and now when clicked into the Ergonomic Grip Mod, with or without the Stability Bar attached, in Ultimate Support mode. This affords more control and the ability to get all around your miniature without letting go!\n New Ergonomic Grip Provides Even More Control and Comfort Tailored to How You Paint. \nClicked into the Ergonomic Grip rotate your mini 360 degrees easily with one hand!\nThe new Ergonomic Grip gives even more support when attached to the bottom of the Hobby Holder Base and allows the use of the Stability Bar and Grip at the same time. Simply click in your Hobby Holder Threaded Base and start painting. The QuickClick design allows for Full 360 Degree Rotation of the Threaded Base with one hand while attached to the Ergonomic Grip.\nThe Ergonomic Grip is two pieces and can be taken apart and weighted if desired. It also has the option to add two standard nuts to screw in the original #6-32 bolt to lock down the Hobby Holder Threaded Base and now a 1/4\" bolt to attach larger platforms if desired.\nNEW XL Stability Bar Offers More Room For Larger Miniatures With the Same Superior Support.\nThe New XL Stability Bar uses the same QuickClick design as the Standard Size Stability Bar and attaches right onto the Hobby Holder Threaded base in Upright or Grip modes.\nThe XL Stability Bar accommodates miniatures with up to 70mm bases with ease and the offset finger support design allows you to attach miniatures that are even taller than the bar itself. The angle of the XL Stability Bar has been adjusted slightly so that even with the taller profile it is comfortable and easy to use with large or small hands.\nUltimate Support, Brush Control and Comfort with the Original Stability Bar and NEW XL Stability Bar  \nThe stability bar rotates 360 degrees so you never have to let go of your miniatures.\nPaint with ease with unparalled acces all the way around your miniatures, even the top!\nThe original offset Stability Bar allows you to paint miniatures with up to 50mm bases in Overhead Stability Bar. Now with the XL Stability Bar you will be able to paint miniatures with up to 70mm bases. \nWith the offset design of the Stability bar you can even paint taller miniatures. And with the multiple pinch and finger rests built into the Stability Bar there is always a comfortable way to hold your Hobby Holder while getting even the trickiest areas painted.\nWant to paint even larger miniatures? Simply flip either Stability Bar over into Grip Mode or click on the new Ergonomic Grip and the Hobby Holder will accept any size miniature.\nEasily Switch Between Base Only, Holder, Grip and Ultimate Support Modes with the QuickClick Connection.\nHigh-strength ABS plastic means durable, longlasting QuickClick connections\nThe Ultimate All-in-one Painting Handle and Grip Now Has Even More Customization with Hundreds of Holding Positions\nAs the Hobby Holder can be customized so can your support and comfort!\nMore Great Features\nMade from strong, yet lightweight ABS plastic\n4mm center hole for removing corks. Just push a brush, file or cork popper through and out pops the cork.\nErgonomically designed and tested for maximum comfort while painting or sculpting\nDishwasher and Simple Green safe for quick cleaning\nReduced mess! Keeps your hands and work space cleaner\nMade in the USA\nGreat for everyone \u2013 from those just getting into a hobby to seasoned professionals! \nCheck out some amazing painters who use the Hobby Holder!\n\"As essential as a brush and pallet, the Hobby Holder is a must.\" - Sam Lenz\n\"I have been painting for over 20 years  and one of the things I advise everyone on is how to hold your miniature while painting. The Hobby Holder is the best on the market for this. You customize the grip to how you paint and it has endless options to personalize your painting experience. Hands down the best holder I have used.\" - Neil Hollis\n\"You can't paint miniatures without a brush, shouldn't paint without a lamp and you won't want to paint without the Hobby Holder once you have tried it.\" - Watch It Paint It\n\"Well, in short, it's really dope... I'm doing all sorts of flips with this beast and got mad angles sniped with the brush with fluid ease. Highly recommended y'all!\" - Malev Minis\n\"I've been painting for about a decade now, and one thing I've always struggled with was holding the miniature well; to help stabilize it, I always pinched down on the top of the model, which often lead to rubbing away some paint. The Hobby Holder has been a game-changer here - the vertical stability bar takes the place of that pinch, without needing to touch the model at all. The handle is comfortable and easy to use, and you can modify it to suit your needs - I've filled mine with a bit of wine cork for holding pinned models.\" - Mike Cousins, Epic Duck Studios\n\"From the first use, I fell in love with Hobby Holder, and MANY of my viewers in my stream have also fallen in love with theirs as well. Now with all of these great accessories available, how could you not use and love these products? Hobby Holder is the perfect tool for commission painters like myself, who need to quickly switch from model to model while batch painting, or get in tight on a competition piece. Hobby Holder is for literally anyone and everyone, and I feel it will help elevate any skill level!  Thank you Kit, for such a great set of products!  They really have changed my painting in a great way!\" - Impending Duff\n\"The Hobby Holder has truly been a game changer for me! Not only for improved comfort while painting, but an overall improvement in the quality of my work. The handle is just amazing! I no longer have to touch my minis messing up the paint, and the handle has an area wide enough for me to stabilize my pinky on while I paint the tiniest of details. If that isn't amazing enough,  the addition of the large hand grip is just icing on this already amazing cake. I highly recommend the Hobby Holder and the super comfortable grip for every mini painter!\" - Super Sarah\n\"The Hobby Hobby is hands down my favorite way to hold miniatures.  It gives me a consistent, adaptable way to hold just about anything.  I've used it for everything from mouselings to large terrain pieces due to its flexibility of use. With the large grip mod attached to the bottom I always have a perfect hold on my piece, no matter the size.  It's the tool I reach for with every mini.\" - Spotted Painter\n\"The Hobby Holder is seriously the best holder I have used; for my shaky hands, the Hobby Holder miniature holder, gives me the stability, control, and comfort I needed.\" - Brushforhire\nThe Hobby Holder does exactly what it says on the tin with its grip, handle and bottle cap base! It is easy to use and quick to swap bottle caps over while batch painting troops and even holding bigger models. - Garry's Workshop\nThe Hobby Holder is the perfect addition to any hobbyist's table. Whether you're clumsy of a good ol' perfectionist, it allows for comfort and precision for massive painting sessions as well as a handy way to switch between projects. I am so glad I discovered them!\" - Samriel Painting Studio\nCheck out #hobbyholder and be sure to follow us Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to see all the amazing painting happening on the Hobby Holder!\nAll pledges will let you select the exact parts you want in the pledge manager based on the number of parts you pledged for.\nMix, match and personalize your choices so you get the exact painting support you need and want from the Hobby Holder, All-in-one Miniature Painting Handle and Grip! \n*All pledges now include the \"Hit The Ground Running\" Pack that contains 5 bottle caps, sticky-tak and a custom button!* \n_____\nAvailable Parts\nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, New XL Stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip \nThreaded Base, Standard Stability Bar, XL Stability Bar, Ergonomic Grip Mod\nAvailable Colors\nAll four parts (Threaded Base, Ergonomic Grip Mod, Standard Stability Bar and XL Stability Bar) are now available in Sky Blue, Fresh Green, Black, Purple, Orange, Red, Silver, Midnight Blue, Copper, White and Yellow!\nAll 11 Colors Are Available in All 4 Parts - Mix and Match\nNumber of Parts Choices Per Pledge Level\n Just A Taste: Choice of ANY 1 PART \n The Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 2 PARTS \n The Discerning Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 3 PARTS \n The All-in Hobbyist: Choice of ANY 4 PARTS \n The Wargamer: Choice of ANY 6 PARTS \n The Professional: Choice of ANY 8 PARTS \n The Ultimate Painter: Choice of ANY 12 PARTS \nYou can choose any combination of parts (Threaded Base, Standard Stability bar, New XL stability Bar, New Ergonomic Grip Mod)\nReward Selection Example:\nIf you pledge at the The All-in Hobbyist level, you get your choice of any four Hobby Holder parts in any configuration and color you choose.

Once the go-ahead is given, we will see injection molded samples in about 15 days.\nPressure testing and quality review\nDuring this time, we will be sending out surveys through BackerKit for you to select the various painting handle and grip parts and add-ons you would like. Once the surveys are completed, we will place the order with the manufacturer and anticipate receiving the new parts at the first half of February, with pledge fulfillment starting the beginning of March.\nAfter fulfillment is complete, the entire Hobby Holder system will be available on the Game Envy website at www.gameenvy.net\nMy wonderful, supportive family <3\nAs many of you now know, my name is Kit, I am the founder of Game Envy Creations and creator of the Hobby Holder and many unique hobby accessories. I am a husband to a wonderful wife, father to two sweet boys and one cute kitty. I am self employed and dedicated to bringing amazing hobby products to life through Game Envy Creations and creating beautiful design through my freelance graphic design business. Making makes me happy and being able to share it with the world makes me even happier!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn our first Kickstarter campaign we learned a lot about the manufacturing process and acknowledge there is always the risk of delays. Working with a US-based manufacturer means we have better communication, only being one timezone apart. It also means we can get changes and parts done in several days, rather than months.\n\nWe are using our same trusted vendors who we are in close communication with to make sure everything is on track and have backup plans available if there are any hiccups. This combined with open and quality communication with our backers we were able to start delivering rewards within three months (two weeks early) in the original Hobby Holder campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Cool Project!", "descp": "Show some support, follow along with updates and access the add-ons.\nINCLUDES:\nA Nice Feeling in Your Heart", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["84 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Just A Taste", "descp": "Choice of ANY 1 PIECE of the Hobby Holder system.

Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship and in enmity, and they suffer toil and hunger and hurt of body more hardily than all other speaking peoples; and they live long, far beyond the span of Men, yet not forever.\"\n-J. R. R. Tolkien\nDwarves really are the best! While they're often a bit rough around the edges, they have the best accents, are insatiably loot-hungry, and will fight anything that moves\u2014so we are going to make a bunch more of them! The dwarves will be cast in lead free white-metal pewter and will be on a 28mm scale.\nWe've assembled them into adventuring parties to make it easier for us to pack and ship. You can add an additional adventuring party to your base reward for $22. Additional individual dwarves can be added to your base reward for $5 each. For a slightly larger view of the minis, check them out on our blog. Here are the adventuring parties:\nFrom Left to Right: Male Dwarven Brawler, Female Dwarven Bard, Male Dwarven Deathknight, Male Dwarven Druid, Female Dwarven Warrior\nThe League seeks out the ancient dwarven knowledge hidden deep within the lost caverns. They hope that, in time, civilized dwarves will once again inhabit those hallowed halls. \nFrom Left to Right: Male Dwarven Rogue, Female Dwarven Sheildbreaker, Male Dwarven Battlerager, Male Dwarven Mage, Female Dwarven Archer\nHogg's Tavern is not the sort of place that anyone should visit . . . at least not anyone who values their life or health. Surprisingly, it has regulars. Its patrons are usually adventures past their prime or looking to make a name for themselves. \nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Mechanist, Male Dwarven Automaton, Male Dwarven Gunslinger, Female Dwarven Automage, Male Dwarven Investigator\nNot everyone has embraced the \"advances\" made in the Steam Valley workshops. When the Savages descended on the valley, the Seigebreakers and their constructs helped turn the tide against the invading armies.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Vampire Hunter, Male Dwarven Undead Elite, Male Dwarven Necromancer, Female Dwarven Huntsman, Male Dwarven Warlord\nThe lands beyond Raven's Gate are shrouded in perpetual mists and haunted by the undead. Only the very brave or the very foolish venture there. Why not both? \nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Barbarian, Female Dwarven Berserker, Female Dwarven Wandsmith, Male Dwarven Fighter, Male Dwarven Barbarian\nThe Iron Hills are not an easy country to grow up in. There's bitter cold winters and orcish armies locked in perpetual combat. That's not even mentioning the greatwolves. No one ever mentions the greatwolves.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Sorceress, Male Dwarven Gray Warden, Male Dwarven Buccaneer, Female Dwarven Cleric, Male Dwarven Barber\nMad Harry defends the eastern shores from the goblin flotillas that wash up nearly every spring. His fiercely loyal crew have learned that insanity doesn't necessarily make you unfit for command.\nFrom Left to Right: Female Dwarven Belsnickel, Male Dwarven Dancer, Male Duergar Dungeoneer, Male Dwarven Hammersmith, Female Dwarven Monk\nThe Underking has many agents in his employ that serve to further his plans in the lands beyond the Dwarvish Domains. Some are well known ambassadors, others have a more subtle role.\nGREENS:\nEvery Stretch Goal we hit will add more dwarves (or dwarf-related miniature items/companions) to the Completionist Set.

Made in the USA by BoardGameTables.com.\nYou could write the next great novel on your phone, but you'll type faster on a laptop. Things go smoother when you have the right tool for the job.\nA board game table is the perfect tool for playing board games. \nThe biggest difference between a \"normal\" table and a board game table is the recessed playing area. There are 3\" wide armrests around the perimeter of the table, and you play games in an arena. \nThe Jasper has a one-piece padded, polyester felt surface in the play area. It is about 6mm thick with a rigid back so that it lays flat without bunching. Soft and smooth so cards slide across it, the play surface is heavy enough that it won't slide around. \nEvery table comes with a gray play surface. You will also have the option to buy additional felt playing surfaces in different colors if we hit some stretch goals (more info later).\nDrinks and board games are the ultimate frenemies. They go so well together. A long gaming session needs some refreshment. But they cause so much drama. Even if you don't spill your drink, it can be a constant source of worry, threatening to damage your game, or mess up your game state.\nCup holders bring harmony.\nMost of us aren't lucky enough to have a room dedicated to gaming. If you are, that's awesome. But The Jasper is also designed to work as your everyday table in your kitchen or dining room.\nComplete list of all dimensions at the bottom of the page.\nA sleek timeless design that doesn't scream \"look at me!\", but patiently waits for you to discover its beauty, in your time, while eating dinner or playing a game.\nIts 3' x 5' playing area hits the sweet spot for board games. Six people fit very comfortably. Any game except the biggest monsters fit. But you don't have to strain to reach across it.\nThe Jasper is a budget conscious table, but that doesn't mean cheaply built. You won't find any particle board or MDF in your Jasper. It's made from solid wood. Malaysian Oak (also known as Rubberwood or Hevea brasiliensis). It is a wood that has similar hardness characteristics as North American hardwoods, but is less expensive.\nBut using solid materials doesn't automatically mean a solid table. That's why we are making The Jasper in the USA (in Jasper, MO). This gives us the tightest possible quality assurance process, and a quick turn around time if problems need to be fixed. Production will be overseen by the same woodworkers who make our high end custom tables.\nTables will be shipped in backer order. The earlier you back, the sooner you get your table.\nThe price will be higher after the campaign ends.\nBuilt on Experience. We've been building custom game tables for 4 years, and sold over 3,500 Duchess gaming tables in our previous Kickstarter. We are avid gamers. We know what gamers need. Benefit from everything we've learned.\nChad founded BoardGameTables.com four years ago. He (I?) plays games every Thursday on the very first prototype we (Kyle) built. I love Age of Steam, Haggis, Napoleon's Triumph, and Indonesia.\nKaty is our customer support champion and logistics maestro. If you email us (jasper@boardgametables.com), you will be hearing from Katy. Her favorite game is Castles of Mad King Ludwig. She was super happy about the table's name selection, as it's also the name of her pup (complete coincidence since the table is named after Jasper, MO). \nRuss has a degree in Wood Technology. He can look down the edge of a board and tell you if it is straight, even while wearing a blindfold.\nKyle has built enough custom home poker, craps, and blackjack tables to open a casino. Now he's (mostly) converted to games that rely on victory points instead of money. Most woodworkers use glue, but Kyle just squeezes the boards together, commands them to stick, and they obey him.\nRuss and Kyle will oversee the production of The Jasper, but it will take a whole team of workers to cut, drill, sand, stain, sand, finish, sand, and pack your Jasper.\nAdditionally, this would not be possible without our talented freelancers. Anca Gavril who made all the graphics and drawing on this page. Digital Lunchbox who shot and produced the main video. Max Kreutzer who made the behind the scenes video. And my many friends who help me test prototype tables and volunteered to be in videos and photoshoots. \nNo matter how many pictures or videos I show you of The Jasper, it is never the same as touching it. Feeling it. Crawling under it. Shaking it.\nSo we did the next best thing. We shipped a few early Jaspers to some lucky backers so we could test the shipping process and make sure the table lived up to their expectations, but also so they could share their thoughts on the table form an unbiased perspective.\nHere's what they had to say:\nWhen I got home last night my 9 year old daughter proudly showed me how she could take the topper off by herself and get a game set up. That should give an indication as to how easy the topper is to handle.  --Aaron Rasmussen\nThe packaging the table came in did a great job. The instructions were super easy to follow too. Chad and team have done an amazing job. The table is sturdy and beautiful. I wouldn't hesitate for a moment having a second one in the dining room (which has been discussed...). We are really loving the table! --Jason Curtis\nThe Jasper table costs $599 and has the following optional add-ons:\nUPDATE: WE ARE DOING CHAIRS!! See update #2 for a picture of the first prototype. You will be able to add them in the pledge manager. I don't have final pricing yet.\n We don't have shipping prices for the stretch goal items yet.\nA chief goal of The Jasper is that it would be both easy to assemble and foolproof to assemble.\nEasy to assemble means that you don't have to push, beat on things, or stretch too far. It means that the table holds itself together for you as you go. We added extra screws that aren't really needed structurally, but they help you hold things in place during assembly.\nFoolproof assembly means that it is almost impossible to assemble it wrong. Similarly sized screws are color coded. Boards naturally fit in obvious places. Things that need to be tight are naturally tightened correctly.\nThe only tools you will need are your own Phillips head screwdriver and an Allen wrench we provide.\nCheck out the assembly instruction pdf.\n*Extra charges for shipping to non-contiguous US states and territories (Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, etc).\nTables are big and heavy to ship. We've worked hard to keep the price down while still protecting the table.\nIn order to keep things streamlined and make sure we stay on schedule, we are only able to offer shipping to the US and Canada right now. It is our hope and plan to run another Kickstarter campaign with shipping to many more countries after we deliver on this campaign. Right now we think adding overseas shipping might cause unforeseen complications.\nThe Jasper has Canadian friendly shipping. It will ship to you from inside Canada. You will owe no duty.\nWe are already pretty far along in the development lifecycle of The Jasper. The prototyping and much of the prep work has already been done. We are ready to start building your table.\nPrototypes\nFirst prototype: Assembly was too hard. Felt was ok, but not great. Play area corner issues. Not happy with stain color.\nSecond prototype: Much easier to assemble. Corners fixed. Felt was better, but color wasn't good. Not happy with stain color.\nThird prototype: Testing wood from the final source. One more tweak needed to ease assembly. Felt great. Not happy with stain color.\nFourth prototype: Testing wood from a cheaper source. It isn't as good. Final table will use wood from same source as prototype three. Assembly is amazing. Happy with stain color.\nPilot Production Runs\nFirst batch: Building 20 tables. Creating all the jigs that will be used during mass production. Setting up the physical assembly line and defining the processes. We are almost finished with this step. We will be shipping these tables to test the packaging.\nPilot production run: Building 200 tables. Testing the process. Fine tuning it to make sure we are ready for mass production. We have the wood for this step and will begin soon.\nWe are not counting on any timeline with these pilot run tables. They are part of the learning and setup process. However, if some of them are ready before the main production tables, then we will create a higher priced \"deliver immediately pledge level\" after the campaign and give you the option to upgrade to that new pledge level in the pledge manager.\nShipment Schedule\nAs of 34 hours to go, it looks like we are on pace for people who back now to get their table in March, 2019.\nAll that prep work should really help make our estimates more accurate, but there are a lot of variables. These are our best realistic estimated dates. Tables will ship strictly based on the order you back the campaign (so don't delay!). \nThe \"Backer Number\" that Kickstarter assigns to you is a good estimate of where you will be on this list, but you will be higher on the list than your backer number would have you believe, because people with $1 pledges or canceled pledges also get backer numbers.\nWe have some backup plans in place to increase capacity if this Kickstarter really takes off. Namely building or renting more space, hiring more employees, etc. If it looks like we aren't going to get everyone their table by November 2019 (either because we aren't meeting our predicted pace or because we sell so many tables), then we will start putting those plans into place.\nThis is Kickstarter. There are many unforeseen things that could happen. However, we are much further along in the process with The Jasper than we were with The Duchess at this point. Detailed plans are in place, suppliers are lined up, molds have been made, test orders have been placed, machinery has been purchased, and we are refining the production process right now. We will have challenges. Nothing comes easy. But we will communicate with you frequently and honestly through the whole process.\nBoardGameTables.com's flagship product is Custom Board Game Tables.\nWith custom tables, we don't start building anything until you order. And then your table goes through a one-off build process. Over 60 different sizes are available. Over 30 different wood and stain combinations. Two dozen fabric colors. And more options and accessories than you can shake a stick at (what does that expression even mean?!).\nThis means you get the perfect table for your situation. In fact, I don't think we have ever built two identical tables. It means that each table is essentially a custom woodworking project. So, the typical custom table costs between $2,500 and $5,500.\nYou can build your dream table at https://www.boardgametables.com/builder/size.\nThe Jasper greatly reduces costs by:\nReducing the options and standardizing the build process. We took the most popular/versatile size/features from the custom tables and designed the one table that will work for the most gamers.\nRequiring some assembly at home. Will assembly at home ever be as good as professionally screwed-and-glued joints done by wood workers? No. But we can get pretty close and it provides excellent cost savings.\nReducing shipping costs. Custom tables have to be shipped on a pallet by a semi-truck. It costs about $300 for shipping. Home assembly means we can fit the table in a smaller box that can be shipped by UPS. It allows shipping costs to start at $69.\nAbout 2 years ago, we ran a Kickstarter campaign for a game table called The Duchess. That campaign raised over $2.5 million. We sold over 3,500 Duchess tables.\nThe Duchess was the first mass produced board gaming table ever. It was about 1/3 the price of anything else on the market. It made gaming tables accessible to people who never thought they'd be able to get one. I am very proud of The Duchess.\nHowever, we had some challenges along the way. We were not able to produce the tables as quickly as we had planned and the percentages of tables damaged in shipment was higher than it should have been. We replaced everyone's damaged pieces, and have made changes to The Jasper to directly address these issues.\nRead the campaign FAQ for more details about the difference between The Duchess and The Jasper.\nMore Info\nHaven't seen enough pictures?

Delicious. Satisfying. \nIce Cream for your Keto Journey. \nAbout Us\nWe're Gabby & Chris, the founders of Keto Pint. We create innovative and healthy dessert options to fit into your everyday healthy lifestyle. Our mission is to reduce levels of cardiovascular disease by providing the lowest sugar dessert options on the market. Crowdfunding keeps us independent of outside investment, letting us prioritize revolutionary dessert innovation, customer satisfaction, and an extraordinary experience. \nKeto Pint was born due to our frustration with ice cream offerings while on our low carb, no added sugar diet. No ice cream was low enough in carbs and every low carb option had added sugar in the pints. We were determined to change that. So, we created the first premium, small batch, Keto Ice Cream, made with no added sugar.\nFirst Micro-Creamery\nWe are the first Micro-Creamery in the U.S. based out of Portland, Oregon. This makes us different from all of our competitors. \nWhat is a Micro-Creamery\nA Micro-Creamery refers to our small batch process of making our ice cream. We use a revolutionary long-time, long-term pasteurization process, which drastically changes the texture, quality and scoopability of our ice cream. You deserve the best and that is what we promise to provide you. You will definitely be able to taste our Micro-Creamery difference.\nNew York Times Recognized Product Development Team\nThe most humbling experience. Our Product Development Team was recently featured in a New York Times best selling article.

We are making every Keto and Diabetics dream come true... ICE CREAM WITHOUT SUGAR! Don\u2019t let the no added sugar deter you, we have been in development for the past 12 months to bring you the best tasting ice cream, packed with flavor. \nWhat unique flavors are we talking about?

What is Keto Ice Cream? \nKeto Ice Cream is an ice cream that follows the macro nutritional values of a keto based diet. Keto Ice Cream uses an ice cream base that has low net carbs, high fat, and no added sugar, while maintaining impeccable flavor and texture. \nThe Keto Pint uses ingredients that PHDs and Dietary Nutritionists recommend for a Keto Based Diet including Unadulterated Heavy Cream, Erythritol, Monk Fruit Extract, Stevia, Whole Eggs, and Chicory Root Fiber. \nIt is critical to select food that has not been processed and tampered to ensure its nutritional integrity. That is why all of our products will be Gluten Free, Non-GMO, Organic, No Added Sugar, No Corn, No Soy, and No Artificial Ingredients.  \n7. What is Keto and how will it benefit me?\nAs explained by Scott Keatley, R.D. of Keatley Medical Nutrition Therapy, states Keto \u201cis all about minimizing your carbs and upping your fats to get your body to use fat as a form of energy. While everyone's body and needs are slightly different, that typically translates to: 60-75% of your calories from fat, 15-30% of your calories from protein, and 5-10% of your calories from carbs.\u201d\nThe predominant storage for energy comes in the form of sugar and carbohydrates, which our body transforms into Glucose. This form of energy, glucose, is use and stored as glycogen in liver and muscle tissue.\nThe goal of Keto is to put our bodies into a state of Ketosis, a normal metabolic process that shifts our energy source from glucose to ketones. Ketones are an alternative energy source when you don\u2019t have enough insulin in your body to turn glucose into energy. Instead, your liver turns fat into a secondary energy source, called Ketones. \nThere have been many studies conducted on the benefits of the Keto Diet, which include, but not limited to:\nWeight Loss by suppressing appetite \nIncreased Sustainable Energy\nIncreased levels of HDL (\u201cGood\u201d Cholestrol\nReduced blood sugar and insulin level (Improve Diabetes)\nDecreased Blood Pressure\nReduce metabolic disorders\nEliminates Cancer Cells\nWe highly recommend reading the following articles explaining the various research conducted on the Ketogenic diet and its various benefits:\nKetogenic Diet Basics: https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19434332/what-is-the-keto-diet/\nKeto Diet, A Dietician\u2019s Perspective: http://theconversation.com/keto-diet-a-dietitian-on-what-you-need-to-know-99867  \nKeto Diet Transformations: https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/Keto-Diet-Weight-Loss-Transformation-44173272\nKeto Diet Benefits: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319196.php\nKeto Diet Increases Memory: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/319287.php\nKetogenic Diet Helps Endurance Performance: https://www.perfectketo.com/use-ketogenic-diet-physical-performance/\n8. Why do you incorporate additional protein?\nThe Keto Diet is known for being low-carb, high fat. But what about protein?\nProtein is a building block of life, essential amino acids necessary for any diet. Protein is critical for:\nBuilding muscle mass through protein synthesis\nCutting Body fat and building lean muscle\nSkin and Bone health\nHealthy Brain Function\nReduce appetite and hunger\nBoost metabolism and increase fat burning\nMany ketogenic dieters are fearful that excess protein will kick them out of a state of ketosis, however, protein WILL NOT affect Ketone levels. \nThe Keto Pint team places a large importance on nutritional components that make healthy living as easy as possible. We believe that a healthy diet can change the trajectory of one\u2019s life, and protein is a vital source that sustains critical bodily functioning to its optimal state! \nFor more information, please read the following article: https://www.perfectketo.com/how-too-much-protein-is-bad-for-ketosis/\n9. How do you ship ice cream without it melting? \nKeto pints are shipped in an insulated box with a block of dry ice. Considering dry ice has a temperature of -109 degrees Fahrenheit, this will keep your decadent ice cream frozen while in transit.\n\n   To ensure your ice cream arrives frozen, we ship via two-day delivery to all 50 states.\n\n   What\u2019s better than having ice cream arrive at your front door? And the crowd went silent\u2026", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any new product development, considerable risks must be acknowledged, including, but not limited to:\n\n1. Finding a commercialized Co-Packer with experience in like-minded products\n2. Scaling an ice cream recipe from small batch to commercialized batch\n3. Not being able to source ingredients on a large scale\n4. Miscalculation of overrun percentage when producing ice cream for the first time\n5. Pint suppliers delay the approval of packaging designs and color schema\n6. Complications in LTL shipping from Co-Packer\u2019s facility to Cold Storage, resulting in obsolete inventory \n7. Issues with Direct-To-Consumer shipping, as Dry Ice has the potential of melting before shipment is received\n\nWe have taken the following measures in order to remediate any potential issues arising above:\n\n1. The Keto Pint Team has structured an agreement with Alpenrose Dairy, a family owned dairy since 1916, that has produced ice cream for over 50 years, including Baskin Robbins! In addition, our team has over two years of experience in producing remarkable ice cream.\n\n2. The Keto Pint team has worked with one of the nation\u2019s most notable product development experts who has been featured in the NY Times best selling article! She has scaled over 15 companies from homemade, to commercialization, and has not experienced any issues along the way. \n\n3. The Keto Pint team has partnered with an ingredient sourcing team that blends and agitates our unique formulation, offering a turn-key solution for our Co-Packers to use on site. We have two years of experience sourcing the best, all natural ingredients, and will provide the same operational processes to the Keto Pint.\n\n4. As mentioned in #2, we have worked with one of the nation\u2019s most notable product development experts to ensure our overrun and viscosity is precisely calculated. We feel confident in our ability to determine the correct overrun to ensure the best tasting Keto ice cream! \n\n5. The Keto Pint has outsourced its pint packaging design to a Portland Graphic Designer that has over 10 years of experience designing and developing like minded packaging for other product lines. In addition, the Keto Pint team has all of the connections and templates in place to ensure appropriate approval is received by our pint suppliers. \n\n6.

Perfectly scaled for roleplaying, the PVC miniatures come fully pre-assembled and ready to paint and play right out the box.\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed roleplaying game set in Exandria, which is the world created by veteran voice actor and Dungeon Master, Matthew Mercer. Each week, Matthew leads his friends (also fellow voice actors!) on epic adventures.  \nThe first Critical Role campaign centered on the ragtag group of heroes in Tal'Dorei known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot, the Gnome Cleric, Keyleth, the Half-Elf Druid, Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo, the Human Gunslinger, Grog Strongjaw, the Goliath Barbarian, Scanlan Shorthalt the Gnome Bard, Taryon \u201cTary\u201d Darrington, the Human Artificer, Vex\u2019ahlia (and her animal companion, a bear named Trinket), the Half-Elf Ranger and Vax\u2019ildan, the Half-Elf Rogue. The first campaign ended in November 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nCritical Role is now in its second campaign, in which the Mighty Nein begin their adventures together in Wildemount. The Mighty Nein consists of Yasha, the Aasimar Barbarian, Beauregard, the Human Monk, Mollymauk Tealeaf, the Tiefling Blood Hunter, Fjord, the Half-Orc Warlock, Nott the Brave, the Goblin Rogue, Jester, the Tiefling Cleric, and Caleb Widogast, the Human Wizard. Shak\u00e4ste, a human cleric, has proven himself to be a trusted ally of the Mighty Nein.\nVox Machina Party\nFrom Tal\u2019Dorei they hail. Whether cleansing the underdark of an aberrant scourge or preventing a would-be god from destroying the globe, this motley troupe of wayward souls - Keyleth, Vax'ildan, Vex\u2019ahlia (and Trinket!), Grog, Scanlan, Percy & Pike - are the greatest heroes the world of Exandria has ever seen.\nMighty Nein Party\nFjord, Beau, Caleb, Nott, Jester, Mollymauk, Yasha, and their ally Shak\u00e4ste... names that breed fear into the hearts of Wildemount\u2019s foulest foes. On a mission for fortune and glory, these fledgling adventurers may one day be the saviors of the Dwendalian Empire - if they can outrun the shadows of their storied pasts.\nCRITTERS PLEDGE $60/\u00a345\nWe anticipate that many of you looking at this Kickstarter are brand new to crowd-funding. Which means we took the decision to keep things as simple as we can. Historically most Kickstarter projects tend to charge a little bit more for the initial offering than they strictly need to and then \u2018bump\u2019 up the perceived value through stretch goals and other complicated ideas like that\u2026it can end up being very daunting to work out what pledge levels go with what and how much you need to commit etc. \nSo to avoid this confusion, for this Kickstarter we have simply given you one pledge level at an amazingly good price. This means that pledge level already includes all the Kickstarter exclusives and no Stretch Goals will be available during the campaign. What you see, is what you get...simple! \nHowever, the world of Exandria is a rich and detailed place with many wonderful characters worthy of making into miniatures. Rest assured, this is just the beginning of this journey for all of us...and don't forget, we're all ridiculously excited about this project and working hand in hand with CR over the coming years to bring the for world of Tal'dorei to your homes. And hey, who knows what random encounters might happen over the course of the KS campaign. \nSo just one question remains: How do you want to do this?\nCaleb Widogast and Frumpkin\nAfter investing heavily in our advanced miniatures development pipeline and working closely with carefully selected manufacturing partners, the quality and detail produced in our industry-leading miniatures is simply world-class. \nKickstarter Exclusive miniatures\nEvery highly-detailed mini is a fully pre-assembled PVC model, ready to paint and play straight out the box.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping. \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs: \n\u2022 United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers)\n\u2022 USA (US backers)\n\u2022 Canada (Canada backers)\n\u2022 Germany (EU backers)\n\u2022 China (Asia Pacific backers)\n\u2022 Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the sets (2kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates, and may change: \n\u2022 UNITED KINGDOM: \u00a36. Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a36-\u00a313 \n\u2022 USA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a317-20 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \n\u2022 CANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \n\u2022 EUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a320-\u00a330 to non-EU countries. \n\u2022 LATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \n\u2022 ASIA: \u00a315-\u00a325 to most countries.\n\u2022 OCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia and New Zealand. \n\u2022 AFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs.\nBelow is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends \n\u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n\u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n\u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n\u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n\u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders.

These stories can include sorcerers with dark secrets, rogues who covertly steal from paladins and clerics, or waifs who fall in love with high elf nobles. Parties that create conflict, fascination, and spectacle are built out of contrasts and compliments.\nHere are the miniatures planned so far!\nWith the Stonehaven Adventurers 2018 project, we are creating Adventuring Parties that have a mix of races and classes. We want to make a lot of miniatures, so we will be adding additional minis via stretch goals as the total pledge amount grows. The minis can be added individually with prices dependent on size. \nHuman, dwarf, half-elf, and owlfolk sized miniatures: $5\nKobold and goblin sized miniatures: $4\nGrippli, mechanical, and child sized miniatures: $3\nDwarf riding a Yak sized miniatures: $12\nThe miniatures will be made of 100% lead free pewter, and some assembly will be required. They will be sculpted on the standard 28 mm scale. Round bases will be included. \nAnd now we present your Adventuring Parties!\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Ranger, Male Goblin Archer, Female Human Sorcerer, Female Grippli Druid, Male Human Adept.\nWhen the west gate was breached, a handful of citizens held the gap for hours while the city's beleaguered engineers moved the chevaux de frise into place. The survivors of that fateful day still meet yearly at the Westgate Tavern to commiserate and remember those who fell. \nPictured from left to right: Male Kobold Monk, Male Human Berserker, Male Owlfolk Wizard, Male Grippli Mage, Female Half-elf Monk.\nEver since the hordes of Orcs swarmed from the great city following the call of the All-Render, Ermcrest, once an Orcish slum, has become a haven for criminals and others seeking to avoid the watchful eyes of the law. Despite the borough's ill-repute, efforts are being made to establish a semblance of order. The Ermcrest Volunteer Watch does its best to keep the peace, to little effect.\nPictured from left to right: Female Human Thief, Female Half-Elf Witch with Ferret, Male Owlfolk Rogue, Male Kobold Fighter, Male Dwarf Ranger.\nThe Skull Stabbers are a ragtag group of thieves and would-be assassins looking to make a name for themselves. Assembled by the now infamous Ralph the Old, they are available for hire to stab things, especially skulls, and all at a budget rate!\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Loremaster, Mechanical Berserker, Female Owlfolk Fighter, Mechanical Wizard, and Female Half-Elf Cleric.\nFor those in need of extra security (. . .against the Skull Stabbers?), the Protection Services Adventuring Party can act as bodyguards and consultants. They take your security seriously, because if you die, they are contractually obligated to offer a full refund to your surviving relatives.\nPictured from left to right: Male Human Hireling, Male Kobold Warrior, Female Human Elementalist, Male Human Guardsman, and Female Human Apprentice.\nThe Silent Eye watches all. It observes, learning from its surroundings and from the acts of others. The Temples of the Silent Eye are open to all who seek healing or wisdom, for what is learned should be shared and used for good. The members of The Silent Eye Adventuring Party seek to do just that: to learn through observation and to apply that knowledge, increasing the goodness of the world. Is there some sinister element secretly directing the actions of this outwardly virtuous group for their own nefarious purposes? Probably.\nThis last group is not officially a party, but you can get them all by pledging for the Completionist 2018 reward! You can also get them as individual add-ons!\nPictured from left to right: Male DwarvenTeifling, Owlfolk Child Archer (locked), Male Dwarven Wizard, Yak Mount, Male Mounted Dwarf Brewmaster, Male Dwarven Musician, Owlfolk Child Mechanist, Male Grippli Undead.\nWe've already reached a lot of stretch goals! Here are the ones that are coming up soon:\nWe reached $18,125! Celinia Di Loreto the Female Human Apprentice will be added to the Silent Eye Adventuring Party and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Celinia entered the service of the Silent Eye as a child. Although she is now of age to join the Sisterhood, she is still very much a child in many ways.\nWe reached $18,750! Serra Kayakomsin, Half-Elf Cleric, will be added to the Protection Services Adventuring Party and available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Who is Serra Kayakomsin? The Kayakomsin family has run the Strymian smuggling tunnels for generations, growing rich and powerful from their ill-gotten gains. Serra has left that life for one of faith, but sometimes skeletons just won't stay in the closet. That's what turn undead is for I guess.\nWe reached $19,375! Halfdan Borgarson, Male Human Guardsman, will added to the Silent Eye Adventuring Party and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). While fighting in the Dark War, Halfdan was taken prisoner by drow mercenaries. Seven months later he was spotted in the upper tunnels, wide-eyed and feral. Though weaponless, it took five dwarven patrolmen to subdue him. Servants of the Silent Eye took pity on Halfdan and brought him to their sanctuaries, where they have begun to heal his shattered mind.\nWe reached $20,000! The remaining members of The Silent Eye have been unlocked!  They are available to add individually to your reward as well. This ]includes the Male Human Hireling ($5.00), The Male Kobold Warrior ($4.00), and the Female Human Elementalist ($5.00).\nWe reached $21,000! Brewmaster Grymm, Male Mounted Dwarf Brewmaster and Esmeralda, Yak Mount, have been added to the Completionist 2018 reward level and available to add to your reward for $12(combined). The pair will count as 2 miniatures for the purposes of rewards and will come as separate parts. Brewmaster Grymm and Esmeralda make a formidable fighting team with Grymm hurling insults and carefully brewed ales and Esmeralda pretty much destroying everything in their path. \nWe reached $23,000! Jedrian Earthbreaker the Male Dwarven Wizard has been added to the Completionist 2018 reward level and available to add to your project as a single miniature ($5.00). From a young age, Jedrian felt the call of the stone. Like decent dwarves, his parents steered him away from the arcane. But the lure of the ancient knowledge was too strong, and the voice of the mountain could not be ignored.\nWe reached $25,000! Darvinius Winderchime, Male Dwarven Musician, has been added to the Completionist 2018 Reward level and is available to add to your reward as a single miniature for $5. When Darvinius first laid his hands on a harp as a mere child of ten, it was as if he already had the knowledge that only years of practice can acquire. Minutes later, he had stolen that harp (having lulled the original owners into a peaceful slumber with his newly-discovered harpsical prowess!).\nWe reached $27,500! Orvinir Relsch, Male Dwarven Tiefling, has been added to the Completionist Set and is available to add to your reward as a single mini ($5.00). Orvinir's bloodline has been cursed through their mercantile dealings with the infernal plane. That being said, Orvinir is the first in a long time to manifest the curse physically, and the rest of the family is doing extremely well for themselves.\nWe reached $30,000!

We are a very small family business in Fort Collins, CO.\nThe DoorAjar replaces the normal strike plate on an interior door and allows the door to be easily secured in two positions - slightly ajar and fully closed.  The part requires only the two normal strike plate mounting screws and allows the door to be opened and closed like normal.  Though simple, the DoorAjar holds the door very securely in the slightly ajar position - the door can't be pushed open or closed by a pet or person.\nDoorAjar in place of normal strike plate\nPLAY\n\nBackground\nThe idea for the DoorAjar came from a very simple need - gerbils and cats.  We wanted our youngest son's door open for air circulation, but closed to keep the cats away from the gerbil cage.  Also, we wanted to be able to easily close the door at night for fire safety.  I needed to find a way to easily latch the door in two positions - slightly open and the normal closed position. I was disappointed to find that the solutions available on the market were complicated and clunky. All of the solutions required a strap that had to be disconnected, a jamb that had to be moved, or an extension that had to be removed to allow the door to close fully. There were no solutions that allowed you to simply close the door in two different positions.  \nWe started experimenting with different prototypes - gluing together strike plates, designing on our home computer, and endless plastic prototypes on our 3D printer.  We love the process of inventing! \nMany design iterations and prototypes\nEventually we landed on an incredibly simple, patent pending, one piece design. To mount it, you simply remove the standard strike plate screws and use the same two screws to attach the DoorAjar in its place. The design allows you to secure the door either fully closed or slightly open simply by turning the doorknob - no other motions or steps are needed. While simple looking, the shape and angles of the product are quite exact and required a lot of design and iteration to allow the DoorAjar to function properly. The flexible material means that you can accidentally run into the DoorAjar without breaking it or injuring yourself.   \nPLAY\n\nKeep the Pets Out and the Air Moving\nOur testers have found two primary uses for the DoorAjar: keeping pets out of a room and maintaining good air flow.   Perhaps you have...\nA room that you\u2019d like closed off, but you want the door slightly open to maintain air flow and keep the room from getting stale - like a spare bedroom or laundry room \nA house with roommates where you\u2019d like to close the door for some privacy, but not be totally closed off\nA dog or cat that you need to keep out of a room\nA bedroom that you\u2019d like to have a little open during the day, but able to easily close at night.\nOnce you have a DoorAjar, you realize how nice it is to have two possible closed positions.   \nOur Project Goal  \nWith our design complete and prototypes working in many homes of friends and family, all we need now is a true injection molded part. This will help us reduce the cost, further improve the material properties, and allow us to make higher quantities. That is where this Kickstarter project comes in. We are raising enough money to pay for the injection molding tooling and to run the needed number of parts. It\u2019s important to us to produce the product locally, so we\u2019ve partnered with a local tool maker and molder here in northern Colorado and have secured a quote for our mold tooling and parts. Once our goal is reached, the tooling will be ordered and parts will be ready to ship in 6-8 weeks.  \nAbout Colors  \nWe plan to produce the DoorAjar in two colors that you can choose from in the Rewards - \"White\" and \"Nickel\" (for a plastic approximation of Brushed Nickel).\nPrototypes \nYou'll notice two versions of the DoorAjar in our videos and pictures - a slightly transparent and \"rough\" version, and a white, precise, and well-formed version.  The white version is a purchased stereolithography (SLA) part that we purchased to check exact dimensions and show what the final molded parts will look like.  The slightly rough, slightly transparent versions are fused deposition modeling (FDM) parts. They are printed on our 3D printer at home out of a flexible and tough nylon that is closer to the functionality of the final part.  Our 3D printer was critical in developing the exact shape and material choice to get just the function of the DoorAjar that we wanted.  \nSLA and FDM Prototypes\nEuropean Customers\nGiven interest from Europe, I've added this shipping option.  Note that shipping to Europe adds $11 and make sure to check your door hardware to ensure that the DoorAjar will work.  \nThank You!\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed hearing about our project. We\u2019re confident that you\u2019ll find the DoorAjar very useful in unexpected ways, just as we have. Thank you very much for your support and please pass this along to friends and family.

While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nRefunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nReplacements \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nExchanges\nSometimes you may get a set of PolyHero Dice and realize that, even if there isn't anything wrong with them, you don't like them as much in person. That's OK! In this case, you'd cover the cost to ship them back to us, but we would ship you a new set of dice in your chosen color at no additional cost to you.

First, press lightly on top of the \"wings\" in the center of the battery holder to make them bend slightly downward.  If that does not improve connectivity, try using a small metal file or similar object to scrape off any oxidization on the pad below the battery holder. See the pictures below. How you remove the battery depends on how you installed the Grimlight. If you can access the circuit, simply pushing the battery gently from the side with a blunt object is enough. You can also use your magnet to remove a battery if you cant access the circuit itself (i.e. if you mounted in in a miniature base). When you mount it, you can either place it upside down for easier access to the battery or mount it so that you leave the maximum amount of space available for the battery to slide out."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Store is up!

Don't see your favorite RPG system on this list? Let us know! We may be able to add more compatible systems based on backer feedback.\nWhen playing tabletop RPGs, there are lots of different actions you can take. This can be daunting for new players. Take out the guess-work and confusion. Our Action Cards provide an easy reference. Use them as a general guide or play them onto the table during your turn.\nThe set shown above is designed for Fifth Edition (5e); it provides cards for standard actions, movement types, bonus actions, and reactions. 5e Action Cards have the standard combat actions (\"Combat Actions,\" Player Basic Rules, page 71)--everything from making a melee attack to casting a spell. Don't play 5th edition? Let us know what other game systems you'd like to see supported as an alternative set for this kickstarter.\nIf you play Savage Worlds, we will be providing an alternative set of Savage Worlds Action Cards!

There are lots of different dice in role-playing games. Quickly find the right one by using our dice system. We've designed a color-coded set that makes it easy to pick the right die every time. It's great for both new players and seasoned players in order to quickly find the right die. Get multiple sets to make rolling damage rolls even easier.\n    Because rolling dice is a such core part of any role-playing game, you need a place to roll that can keep the dice on the table.

The comic follows Binwin as he attempts to teach four level-none Minions what it means to be adventurers. In return, they'll teach Binwin what it means to be a family... or something.\nThis Kickstarter collects the first season of Binwin\u2019s Minions into the gloriously antiquated hardcopy format. But have no fear digiphiles, you can read Binwin\u2019s Minions every Friday on TableTitans.com where it is permanently entombed in the interwebs.\n  Only the mightiest, fightiest, dwarfiest, dwarf to ever wield an axe. Binwin Bronzebottom has lived an epic life and is known far and wide by many names: Bane of the Frost Giants, Puncher of Dragons, Slayer of Ale, the list is extensive. He has traveled the land on many dangerous quests and acquired more loot than any one dwarf can spend, unless that dwarf happens to be named Binwin\u2026 because he spent it all and now he\u2019s broke. A little older but not much wiser, Binwin has set out to assemble a group of fresh-faced adventurers to take on all the risks while he reaps all the rewards.\n  Unlike Binwin, there\u2019s not much to say about the Minions. There\u2019s a Warrior, a Wizard, a Druid, and a Thief, but don\u2019t bother learning their names--they\u2019ll all be dead by the time you finish reading this.\n  Beautiful books designed by famed art director, Keith Wood, in both a Softcover Retail editions and a glorious Collector's Hardcover. There are also Extras and Add-ons, but seriously get dem books!\n                          To each their own! Pick the loot that's right for you.

We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels or confusing options.

After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow. All we need is your support!!!\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nBones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade. Inexpensive, high quality, soft gaming models that are easy and fun to paint and won't break when you actually use them for games! \n  All Backers must use the Reaper Pledge Manager to select their rewards and provide shipping information\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories: \n1) Overall Non-completion \n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates \n3) We do not produce a specific model or change a specific model\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and delays. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is with within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored. \n \nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by July 31 2018 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after July 31, 2018. \n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after July 31, 2018) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit. \n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery.

In the book we're producing with this Kickstarter, Alison investigates a string of murders, encounters a mysterious figure from her past, and tries to make a difference in a world where the problems are much bigger and more complex than simply punching supervillains. \nSFP is a webcomic written by Brennan Lee Mulligan and drawn by Molly Ostertag, and has updated twice weekly online since 2012. You can read all six chapters for free at www.strongfemaleprotagonist.com! \nWe've done this before! In the summer of 2014 we successfully Kickstarted the first volume (chapters 1 - 4), raising $60,974 from 1,967 backers, and producing a beautiful graphic novel. Bringing the first book of Strong Female Protagonist to print made it easier to share with others, brought in new readers, and helped us to continue making the webcomic. \nWith this Kickstarter, we hope to publish the fifth and sixth chapters (300+ pages), as well as bonus content, in a full color paperback volume. Strong Female Protagonist is and has always been a labor of love, and Kickstarter is the perfect platform for us to fund this book. We are both artists and paying printing costs up front is not an option - we need you, readers old and new, to take SFP from the web to the printed page. \nIf you're a fan but can't contribute financially, we really appreciate when readers spread the word about the comic and this Kickstarter! We don't advertise anywhere, so the only way people can find us is through word of mouth.\nClick to see larger version\nAlison Green used to be a superhero. With her seemingly unlimited strength and invulnerability, she was one of the most powerful around, fighting crime with other teenagers under the alter ego Mega Girl. All that changed after an encounter with Menace, her mind-reading arch enemy, who showed her evidence of a sinister conspiracy that made battling giant robots seem suddenly unimportant.\nMenace retired and the remaining supervillains were put behind bars, and left with no one to fight, Alison unmasked herself on national television. Now she's going to college in New York City, trying to find ways to actually help the world while making friends and getting to class on time. It's impossible to escape the past, however, and trouble comes in the form of mysterious murders, ex-teammates with a grudge, robots with a strange sense of humor, an inconvenient crush, a cantankerous professor, and many different kinds of people who think they know the best way to be a hero.\nYou can read the whole comic here and check out the cast here. \nBrennan Lee Mulligan (@BrennanLM) is a screenwriter and house improviser at the Upright Citizen's Brigade theatre. Molly Ostertag (@MollyOstertag) is a cartoonist, illustrator, and SVA graduate, with books coming out from First Second and Scholastic. We met at a LARP camp when we were teenagers and have been creatively collaborating ever since. We started Strong Female Protagonist because we both wanted to make a story that portrayed a female protagonist in a way we felt was missing from mainstream media. Also, we wanted an excuse to spend hours discussing the mechanics of how an invulnerable person would get her hair cut!\nWe're partnering with Topatoco and Make That Thing to fulfill this Kickstarter to make sure shipping goes smoothly and efficiently. They're total pros and we're excited about working together!\nWe partnered with Top Shelf/IDW Publishing to distribute Volume 1, and we'll be doing the same for Volume 2, so in 2018 this book will find its way into bookstores everywhere! (Kickstarter backers will get it first, though)\nAll rewards include US shipping costs. There are additional costs for outside the US, which we've tried to make as low as possible. \n Here's what you can get with each reward tier!

Here's what some cool people have said about our comic:\n\"What could be a gimmicky setup rises far beyond cliche, bringing new questions about vigilantism, justice, and heroics to the field ... Humor is hard to get right, but humor with a serious message is even harder. Mulligan and Ostertag's creation strikes just the right balance. It's super.\"\n-Cory Doctorow, Boing Boing\n\"Strong Female Protagonist ... is the perfect superhero comic for people who aren\u2019t really interested in the superhero genre. Actually, it\u2019s also a pretty perfect comic for people who are interested in superheroes.\"\n-Mey Rude, Autostraddle.com\n\"Brennan Lee Mulligan and Molly Ostertag ... deliberately shatter some stereotypes with a story of their own\u2014a story about a young woman who is strong in every sense of the word.\"\n-Joshua Rivera, Entertainment Weekly\n\"A smartly written and emotional exploration of the morality of superheroes.\"\n-Lauren Davis, io9\n\"Over the four-plus years that SFP has been running, both Alison and the comic have grown and developed in complex and remarkable ways.\"\n-Charlotte Reber, Book Riot\nThanks so much for reading!\nMolly and Brennan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is a safe bet!

But after several years, my erasable tiles are getting pretty scratched and gummed up from transport and use ... so, it is time to retire them.\nShopping for replacements I've found some thin knock-offs, some really large tiles, and some extremely expensive sets ... but nothing that fit both my needs and my budget.\nThis reminded me of the predicament that led to the initial development of Gaming Paper back in 2009. So I began to wonder if, with everything I've learned over the years, I could make a quality, affordable gaming tile product to fill the niche I'd found in the market? \nHello, I am Gaming Paper Tiles!\nWe interviewed GMs who used erasable tiles to find out what other folks thought was important, and then we started designing. What we've come up with is pretty amazing and I am proud of the design and the functionality.\nThe tiles are 8\"x11\".

And now, Doug Kovacs will illustrate the endsheets to HTWAMTDS!\nMany years ago, when Goodman Games was first starting out, many sage elders in the industry gave Joseph Goodman advice on what to publish. The most common advice received was: \"Don\u2019t publish adventure modules. They don\u2019t sell.\"\nWhat we have learned since then is that advice is largely true. Poorly written, uninteresting, uninspired adventure modules do not sell.\nBut the good adventure modules \u2013 the exciting ones \u2013 that ones that read well and play well at the table \u2013 they become treasured memories for us all. They become legends. These adventures are the shared experience that builds our community. We remember our exploits, ask each other how a different group handled that encounter, and lament the secret doors we may have missed. We tell our friends about the climactic finale; we are in turns surprised and devastated and thrilled as we navigate the encounters. And most importantly, if an adventure is fun to play \u2013 if the game master and the players both have a blast \u2013 then we tell our friends, and they play, and they tell their friends, and that adventure becomes a community builder. It is played thousands and thousands of times. It becomes a legend.\nThis book is about how to create tabletop RPG adventures that become those legends. This book is about how to write great adventure modules \u2013 the ones that gamers can\u2019t stop talking about.\nWhat Is This Kickstarter For?\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of a printed book called How To Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck. Depending on stretch goals, it will be published in either softcover or hardcover format, possibly with other stretch goals as well. The estimated length is 160 pages. In addition, another book called The Adventurers Almanac is funded by this Kickstarter. The Adventurers Almanac, by Michael Curtis, provides a wealth of additional material to inspire a gamemaster in the direction of their campaign.\nGoodman Games has published more than 200 adventures and built an institutional knowledge on how to write adventure modules that don\u2019t suck. Many of our adventures are \u201cmodern classics\u201d that have been in print for many years, in some cases earning a 2nd, 3rd, or even 4th printing as they continue to sell year after year. For years we have run seminars at Gen Con and other conventions by this same name, How to Write Adventure Modules That Don\u2019t Suck.\nThe book How to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck consolidates all that institutional advice, all those great seminar discussions, all of our hard-earned lessons and experience, into an easy-to-digest format. Twenty five authors, all of them with impressive credits in RPG adventure design, have written themed articles addressing a wide variety of topics. Along with each article, each author has provided a fantasy RPG encounter that demonstrates the concepts they address.\nThe book is designed to be usable with any RPG, in any genre, under any rules set. Developer James M. Ward has hand-selected the authors and managed the topics to maximize the utility of the book. You can read the book straight through, or flip to the section that addresses your specific concerns. By the time you\u2019re done reading the book, your own adventure-writing efforts will improve. Mr. Ward says it best in his introduction:\nThis is the primer that every game designer needs to have on his bookshelf. I\u2019ve been in the role-playing game design industry for more than forty years. In many of those years my products were the best selling products out that year. I learned many new things from this set of articles. I have learned things that have improved my design skills, so I know they will improve yours as well.\n Not Just Essays: Adventure Starters, Too\nAs part of the writing process, we asked each contributor to write an essay with adventure-design advice. We also asked each contributor to write a short encounter that put their advice to use. These encounters are \"adventure starters\" - ready-to-go material for you as the game master to use! If you're stuck on while writing your own adventure, you can use the essays of advice, or utilize these \"adventure starters\" to build out your own scenario.\nAbout the Contributors\nHow to Write Adventure Modules that Don\u2019t Suck represents the distilled wisdom of a pool of great adventure writers. Fans of Goodman Games and TSR will recognize many of the names and backgrounds. This is certainly not every great adventure writer in the business, but it\u2019s a darn good cross-section. Here is the list of contributors in alphabetical order:\nJobe Bittman has worked as a freelance RPG writer and game designer for nearly a decade. His writing has appeared in publications by Wizards of the Coast, Goodman Games, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, and Kobold Press. Jobe has been privileged with the opportunity to work on professional projects with such gaming legends as James Ward (Metamorphosis Alpha) and Steve Crompton (Grimtooth\u2019s Traps). Goodman Games recently announced Jobe\u2019s latest project, a new RPG adaption of Jack Vance\u2019s Dying Earth.\nMike Breault began working on RPGs in 1984 when he was hired at TSR. Over the next eight years, he contributed to more than 80 games, modules, and hardback rules books published by TSR and Milton Bradley (HeroQuest).

Michael lives in Long Island, NY, with the requisite number of cats for a writer and far too many books.\nChris Doyle began freelance writing in the game industry in the early 1990\u2019s through volunteer efforts with the Role Playing Game Association (RPGA). He has since freelanced for several companies such as TSR, West End Games, Wizards of the Coast, Atlas Games, and Goodman Games. Although he has designed and contributed to RPG source material, the majority of his projects have been the design of adventure modules.

The only difference now is the paycheck. Jon is very passionate about the people who comprise the role-playing and tabletop game community, and they have been very kind and supportive of the work he has created. Jon is by far a Call of Cthulhu guy, and has been fortunate enough to have work published by a variety of Call of Cthulhu publishers, including Goodman Games. His most recent Cthulhu adventure is Age of Cthulhu 9: The Lost Expedition.\nKevin Melka was hired as the RPGA Network\u2019s Tournament Coordinator after a decade of writing and running adventures .

He lives in Salem, MA, with his wife, cat, and puggle.\nLloyd Metcalf began gaming in the early eighties when he and his friends all pitched in for the Basic Red box D&D. From then on, he was always dreaming of other worlds, heroes and spells. Now as an adult, he can hardly believe it is his work to create, illustrate, and produce RPG supplements. It has been just over 30 years of immersion into the game and in the last few, he has been humbled and honored to have worked with many of the people who created and illustrated the game that changed his life. Lloyd\u2019s website is at http://FailSquadGames.com \nBill Olmesdahl has been a DM and player for almost 40 years.

He is grateful to every judge that has ever run one of his adventures; you guys are the ones that make these words alive. \nJim Wampler is currently a writer, editor, and occasional art director and layout monkey for Goodman Games. In addition to the forthcoming Mutant Crawl Classics RPG, Jim has written several Metamorphosis Alpha adventures and two sequel adventures for the DCC RPG Purple Planet series for Goodman Games. As overlord of the Dungeon Crawl Cabal, Jim has also overseen a secret cabal of talented writers and artists who have created three DCC RPG tournament funnels for use by the Goodman Games Road Crew.\nJames M. Ward on James M. Ward: I had the distinct pleasure of learning how to play D&D on Gary Gygax\u2019s side porch in 1974. Gary must have seen some spark in me because he allowed me to try my hand at writing Metamorphosis Alpha, the first science fiction role-playing game. I went from writing MA to writing Gamma World, the first apocalypse role-playing game. Over the last forty years or so I\u2019ve written many RPG things with my latest being the 77 Lost Worlds RPG campaign setting. Goodman Games has been kind enough to revive the MA intellectual property and now there are lots of MA adventures and accessories to enjoy; and I thank them for that.\nSkip Williams started running role-playing games in 1975, shortly after meeting a fellow named Gary Gygax.

I wanted something that would excite my players and capture the joy of random loot in video games like Diablo while preserving the wonderful tactility of tabletop gaming. With that goal in mind, I have designed and created item cards which will take the treasure in your game to new heights!\n$3000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock 3 new very rare items for the card pool. Backers at the completionist level will receive the 3 new cards, and they will be added to the card pool for the random loot decks to increase diversity.\n$4000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a digital guide with recommended rarity distributions for each character tier. This will let you fine tune your random loot decks for your players.\n$5000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock signature weapons for either The Warriors (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue) or The Spellcasters (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard), based on popular vote. Two powerful, character-defining weapons will be added for each of the classes chosen. Backers at the completionist level will receive the 12 new cards and an add-on will be made available to add these 12 cards to other orders.\n$6000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock blank, fillable cards. Backers at the completionist level will receive 5 blank cards. An add-on will be made available to add 25 blank cards to your order.\n$7000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock signature weapons for either The Warriors (Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue) or The Spellcasters (Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard) - whichever was not unlocked at the $5000 level.\n$10000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a lair pack for either The Alchemist\u2019s Workshop, The Forgotten Crypt, or The Wizard\u2019s Tower. This will contain 10 cards that would be appropriate in the lair chosen by a popular vote.\n$13000 [UNLOCKED]: Unlock a lair pack for either The Alchemist\u2019s Workshop, The Forgotten Crypt, or The Wizard\u2019s Tower - one which was not chosen at the 10000 level. This will contain 10 cards that would be appropriate in the lair chosen by a popular vote.\n$18000: Unlock the last lair pack - the one not chosen at the 10000 or 13000 levels.\nYou get 90 item cards printed on high-quality card stock with a linen finish. The decks feature classic magic items such as Potions of Healing and Bags of Holding as well as powerful relics that your players have never seen before. The deck is well-distributed with items ranging from simple treasure to very rare artifacts.\n36 common items\n22 uncommon items\n10 rare items\n4 very rare items\n18 treasure cards\nUse the deck as a game master to give out loot! Your world will come alive as rare and magical items now live in every forgotten keep or noble house. Simply shuffle the deck and deal out a card or two when your players find some loot. Treasure chests, merchants' wares, and wizards' bookshelves can all be filled quickly and on the fly.\nDon't worry - the border misalignment on the card backs has been fixed!\nMy players love these cards. In our last session the rogue of our group was exploring a shady nobleman's house and crept into the study. Inside he found what he was looking for and then turned to me and asked \"Is there a safe in the room?\". I had not even prepared for him to be in the house, let alone a safe, but sure - it made sense that there would be a safe. He found the safe, opened it, and instead of scrambling for an answer I was able to pull out a card from the loot deck to the cheers of the players. Acquiring physical, tactile random items is a wonderful experience that sparks enthusiasm and encourages exploration.\nI simply couldn't fit in all of the items that I wanted to at a reasonable price point, so in the end each item deck will have a selection of cards randomly chosen from a larger pool. Each deck comes with a full 90 cards and is completely usable straight out of the box, however for those who want extra loot you can order extra decks and receive additional unique items!\nThe item selection has been carefully tuned to ensure that a random draw won't turn a level 1 Fighter into a monster-slaying superhero at the expense of their teammates. Each loot deck contains exotic and powerful magic items, but static modifiers that provide potentially unbalancing power boosts have been largely avoided. This allows the deck to be useful at all levels of play and in any campaign!\nThe cards themselves are printed on premium 305gsm black-core matte card stock. A linen finish makes for easy shuffling and helps prevent water damage and staining. The cards are built to look incredible and hold up to the abuse of many long nights of dungeon delving.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there are some timing risks when creating any physical product, I have been through a print run with a trial version of the loot deck and through that have worked out the kinks with the process. A second trial print run is planned before the final run to ensure that the production process has no issues. The cards will be printed through The Game Crafter, who are based in the US and have an excellent reputation. With this experience on hand I expect the production process to go quite smoothly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Loot Deck", "descp": "Get one deck of 90 semi-randomized loot cards.

Our first Kickstarter was a huge success and we've picked up a lot of new fans since then, so with this Kickstarter we're offering both Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters and Table Titans Volume 2: Winter of the Iron Dwarf as beautifully oversized KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE hardcover books!\nThough our reward tiers with Table Titans Volume 1: First Encounters are VERY LIMITED there's no need to worry; we will always keep the whole comic series FREE TO READ ONLINE AT TABLETITANS.COM!\n  WHAT IF I'VE NEVER PLAYED D&D?\nNo problem! If you like high adventure, swords and sorcery, action, drama, comics, laughing and a whole lot of fun, then Table Titans is for you. It DOESN'T MATTER if you've played D&D. No... seriously, it doesn't matter, but don't be surprised if this comic makes you want to try it out. Whether you're a hardened RPG vet, a casual reader with a slight interest in D&D, or if you just love comics, Table Titans, like any roleplaying game, is about telling good stories.\nBUT I'M NOT IN THE UNITED STATES AND SHIPPING & CUSTOMS FEES ARE OUTRAGEOUS!\nFortunately for you, we've arranged for rewards to ship from various locations around the globe and we're covering the costs of any additional customs fees.

Back through Paypal here.\nMaybe it was some sort of bureaucratic oversight on the part of the divine penitentiary system? Maybe the waning health and advanced age of the Giant's High King caused his children to begin their machinations to seize his power? Perhaps they were awakened by the coming of an even greater threat? Whatever the reason, the Giants have returned! \nEver since we made our second Troll back in 2013 I've wanted to do a project that is all huge-sized characters. I've daydreamed for years about the kinds of shenanigans that a party of trolls, giants, and ents would get up to: What would their motivations be? Who would dare take on a balanced party of huge-class creatures? What kind of force for good (or evil) could they become?\nThis project is our chance to find out! We're going to make a bunch of giants and stuff so we (...and um you too I guess) can create a ton of awesome epic encounters and adventures!\nIn addition to making new huge-sized creatures, we'll also be offering our previously made huge-sized miniatures. You'll be able to get all of these oldies through this project (or on our website during this campaign while supplies last) for their original kickstarter prices! You'll also be able to get a 20% discount on everything else in our store during this kickstarter campaign by entering the coupon code GIANTKICK during the campaign!\nWe've already created 7 Huge Adventurers through our previous projects, and we are planning to make even more through this project, some of which Mike has already begun sculpting!\n    They are, for the most part, trolls, full of personality and charm, but not all huge creatures are so friendly. The ancient race of giants is one of majesty and might. For centuries beyond counting, they have ruled the mountaintops, aloof and apart from the petty races that squabble below. The more majestic of these giants are proportionally closer to humans, but are still much bigger than your average 28mm figure! They will be the same 65mm to the eyes that the trolls have been.\n  The huge-sized miniatures above will all be produced by this Kickstarter if we meet the base goal, cast in urethane resin, and will be available as choices for any of the reward levels that include giants.\n      Unlocked companion miniatures will automatically accompany one of the huge miniatures.\nExtra bases can be added for $2.00 each.\n    Companion miniatures unlocked will automatically accompany one of the huge miniatures.\nWhen we hit $29,000, the Modron Paladin will automatically accompany the Troll Mechanist. This morning, I didn't even know what a modron was! It turns out, they are pretty awesome!\n  When we hit $33,000, the Enting Sprout will automatically accompany the Treant Shaman. Who said there were no more entings! (It was Treebeard, he was wrong!)\n  We hit $35,000! The Sporeling will automatically accompany the Giant Barbarian. Once he's put the guards to sleep, he and the Barbarian will creep out into the underdark, his bio-luminescent head lighting their perilous way.\n  When we hit $37,000, the Rust Beast will automatically accompany the Dire Owl. Dark Sun players, you guys are probably safe. Everyone else: just throw a wizard at it!\n  We hit $38,500! The Kobold Bard will automatically accompany (No pun intended!) the Storm Giant. \n    It's difficult to chase those sheep down by yourself! Take this Labrador Retriever! We hit $40,000 so the Labrador will automatically accompany the Hill Giant Rustler on all raids. \n  When we hit $45,000 (Either during the funding period or afterward through Paypal donations) the Giant Children will be added to the Completionist Rewards. When that happens, they will also be available as a $15 add-on for the group of 3. They will be cast in pewter and the biggest of them will be about the size of our Half-Orcs. \nThanks!\nThe Stonehaven Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are fairly familiar with the process of sculpting and casting miniatures by now, there is still some small risk that our project will be significantly delayed by factors beyond our control.

Now it's time to get together and summon a series of special dice for spell-casters! The Wizard Set is once again the classic 7-piece set of RPG dice (plus special Kickstarter bonuses - see below), and this time we are also going for fancy and fittingly magical looking materials. \nYou will be able to choose your colors and Level Up Packs pledged for after the campaign with a pledge manager we will send you. Check out the FAQ at the bottom of this page for more information.   \n         PLAY\n\n         Dice Specifications\n   \n3D prototypes\nPLAY\n\nNote: the 3D printing process leaves small artefacts on the models (visible in the video) that won't be present in the final production. \nPolyHero Dice are modelled and tested using 3D modelling software, then 3D printed for further testing. We don't claim the dice are as balanced as casino machined dice, but we design them using principles such as centre-of-mass and lines of symmetry, to make sure the dice are fully functional and randomized for general use. \nFrom Warrior to Wizard... what's new and why? \nWe are reducing the price per set, and once again offering growing discounts when backing for multiple sets. The Wizard Set won't be packed in a multi-purpose hard case like the Warrior Set (for Kickstarter or at retail). As cool as it is, the case adds a cost to producing the product that understandably many people might not see the value in. So the Wizard Set (and eventually the Warrior Set) will now be packed in a bag or clam shell. \nWe are using fancier, more expensive materials and ink for the dice, including pearlized, and transparent materials. \nWe are charging $4 shipping worldwide (proportionately decreasing as you back for more sets). We've decided it is a lot easier for us to manage our budget with the shipping costs upfront and scaling to the number of sets backed for.\nWe will deliver the dice to backers at least a month prior to retail or convention release. This was always the intent with the Warrior Set, but there were extenuating circumstances that meant the dice were available at GenCon while they were still on the way to some backers. Game Salute kindly air freighted the dice from the factory (for their booth at GenCon, and also for the Kickstarter backers). As a result Kickstarter backers got their dice two months earlier than if we'd had to sea freight them, but it meant that there was a small amount of overlap in where they were available first. The plan moving forward with this and future campaigns is that backers will always get their dice well before retail or convention goers.\nWe are adding a matching 2-sided spell book to every Wizard Set purchased as part of the Kickstarter (the spell books won't be in the retail version of the dice)! \nStretch Goals \nWE added...\nWe added the Spell Book as an \"instant stretch goal\". As soon as we hit the base funding goal it was added to every Wizard Set purchased (in a color matching the Wizard Set). The spell book is a special limited die that won't be available in the retail edition, but may down the track be available at conventions or as a promotion in limited quantities.\nWe unlocked 10 unique colors, including two Adventure Colors. \nWe're retooling and creating more moulds so we can offer of specific dice, such as d6 or d20. See Wizard Level Up Packs.\nWe have added the option to pledge for a special Wizard's Hat d20 at a discount price. \nWe unlocked a bonus Electrum and Alabaster spell book die to every Wizard Set and one for any Level Up Reward level pledge of $15 or higher (not including shipping).\nQuest Goals\nThe success of this campaign, your enthusiasm and your ideas, have us looking to future sets with a clearer purpose and confidence, and wanting to invest the momentum and funds raised in this campaign towards that vision and those future sets. A goal being to be able to work on more ideas and designs, and take a lot less time to produce and deliver them to you. \nWe think if we can design the dice with your feedback, make all the moulds, and get deep into the production sampling, all ahead of a campaign, then we could radically increase our capacity and turnaround for delivery, and go from 1 set a year, up to 2 or 3. It would also make for better campaigns as we would have all the moulds at the start and make Level Up Packs available immediately, then focus on different kinds of stretch goals. We'd essentially be able to start from deeper into the campaign and then build from there. \nSo we\u2019ve scoped out two \"Think Big\" stretch goals. Even if we don't hit these grand goals, the campaign has been a huge boost to the future of PolyHero Dice, and extra funds from the Wizard campaign will still be invested into future sets, but these \"PolyHero Quest Goals\" mark the levels of funding where we can officially and publicly set the listed expectations for the next set/s.\nPolyHero Dice Games\nLast campaign we created Knight Fight, a game to play with the Warrior Set (available from PolyHero.com). Once again we have our ideas to get the Wizards in the mix, though we aren't at the same stage we were with Knight Fight. We are now developing a game that we think could be pretty awesome, but it won't be ready for a little while!\n-\n\nThe Warrior Set\nDuring the Wizard Set campaign the Warrior Set (in the deluxe hard case) will be available from PolyHero.com. You of course won't need to wait for the Warrior Set as it is already made! Knight Fight is also available. If you want the Warrior Set sent to you with the Wizard Set, then see the FAQ below.\n        Credits\nPolyHero Dice are the result of a creative collaboration between brothers Dann and Greg May. We've worked together in the visual arts for more than 20 years, as graphic designers, artists and 3D animators. We've also played Dungeons and Dragons (and other RPGs) together from an early age, starting with the red boxed Basic Set. This project is a labour of love for us; to create imaginative, 3D-sculpted custom dice for a favourite hobby, and for the pure joy of holding and rolling them.\nDann May is a visual artist, animator and graphic designer. Since 2015 has been the resident art/creative director and artist at tabletop game publisher Game Salute, where he has worked on numerous board and card games including Nothing Personal, King's Forge, Legends of the American Frontier and Planetarium.\nGreg May is a professional 3D Animator and Modeller with over 20 years in the industry working on projects including children's television programs, medical animation and live event installations. He also freelances creating high end rendered images of board games, and created the art for the upcoming board game Planetarium.\nFor more information visit polyhero.com\n\nDice Maniacs' Club\nWe're members of the Dice Maniac's Club!

That's why we've completed all the 3D modelling up front and allowed until May 2017 to complete production and deliver the dice. Our goal is to deliver them as soon as possible, and ultimately we would like to be able to produce a new set every 6 months, but until we have proven that is possible, we won't presume to set a tighter target date.\n\nWe are also once again keeping this campaign very simple, with one set of designs in a growing variety of colors and ways to package them.\n\nWe'll as always provide you with updates at each major milestone of production and delivery.

Choose from any of our amazing Adventuring Parties. The goal here is simple: get the miniatures sculpted, cast, and distributed to all of you!

Dwarves were painted by James Wappel (who also made the scenic bases and took the photographs)\nWe want to make as many halflings and halfling-related stuff as we can stand.

And I can tell you right now - it's beautiful.\nBEHOLD!\nThe chest portion will be embroidered, and the clocktalk on the sleeve and lower back will be screen printed, black-on-black.\nClose up of embroidery\nSo a couple of things to note:\n1. Everyone has been asking me what hoodie \"type\" this will be made of, and I was told it would be the same as the Thanks Obama hoodie we sell on the store. Well, the designers decided to upgrade it to a more expensive type, but unfortunately we lose the thumbholes. So if you were dead set on the thumbholes, we understand if you have to change your pledge BUT...\n2. ... The upgrades to this hoodie are now have an athletic, water resistant, tight weave to it (water beads on it, rather than soaks it up). Although it is obviously a very cool and useful feature, the reason for it was more aesthetic - the sheen to the material was decided to be more thematically appropriate for Automata, and it really made the black-on-black design pop. For sizes 4x and above, it'll be the same design but with a slightly different hoodie blank (same color).\n3. If you have not purchased the hoodie yet, you still can via our add-on offer ($70 per hoodie for domestic, $75 for international). If you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click \"Manage\" on the right side. Add $70/75 per hoodie to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Hoodie you wanted. (Yes, you can add on as many hoodies and add-on pins as you'd like - we will sort it out at the survey process)\nAnd as with all the stuff here, this hoodie will NEVER be made or sold again outside of this kickstarter campaign.\nThank you everyone! We've got 6 days to go!!\n----\n7/28/2015: 2 Weeks Left! ANOTHER PIN DESIGN!\nWait, what do you mean another pin design? You only have one pin available on this campaign, right?  \nThat was true... UNTIL NOW!  \nWe're offering a Second, Completely Different and Unique pin design for those pledging at the PIN DESIGN tier or higher as an optional ADD-ON. If you'd like this new design, add $25 per Add-On pin (regardless if you are shipping internationally or domestically).  \nThis pin is DUAL LAYER, so the broken Carl mask will sit on top of the base level. This pin will NEVER be made or sold again, so not only is it exclusive for the next two weeks, but the quantity made will be limited to that actually ordered for this Kickstarter Campaign. The quantity made will be stamped on the back of the pin.  \nSo if you'd like to take advantage of the add-on offer, go to this page and click on \"Manage\" on the right side. You can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $150 tier, there's a little box with your pledge amount in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it). Add $25 to that amount, and then when we send out the surveys, we'll ask you how many of the ADD-ON Pin you wanted.  \nAlso! If you added on the Hoodie already, you can stack that as well! No worries, we'll get it all sorted in the Post-Campaign Survey stage!  \nTwo weeks left and 10k to go! We should be able to close this out soon, and then it's stretchgoal territory! Thank you everyone!\n----\n7/22/2015: HOODIE ADD ON UPDATE!\nWe've been getting tons of emails and messages asking us to open up more hoodies... so the best way to do this without messing with the rarity of the pins is to offer it to you as an add-on at ANY LEVEL. What this means is if you want a hoodie (or an additional hoodie), INCREASE your pledge level by $70 for U.S. addresses and by $75 for International addresses, and we'll make sure you get the exclusive hoodie. (do it again if you want additional) When it comes time to issue out our surveys, we'll ask you if you pledged for an additional hoodie and what size you asked for etc.\nClick on \"Manage\" on the right side, you can change the amount at the top without changing the reward. So, for instance, you are currently at the $55 tier. There's a little box with $55 in it (it says \"It's up to you. Any amount of $1 or more.\" to the right of it) - you can change it there.\n----\nSix years ago, we released this comic.\nPage 1 to the original Automata series.\nSince then, it's spawned two additional mini-series (Blood & Oil and Silverside), a dedicated base of fans, and even interest from Hollywood. The goal from the beginning - with any of our side projects - is to find someone who loved it enough and could dedicate the time necessary to fully flesh out the Automata universe. That happened pretty quick: before we knew it, we were in talks with a number of different movie studios. To us, it became not a matter of if, but when, we'd be able to buy a ticket and watch a very, very large Carl and Detective Regal brooding on a movie screen.\nBut after spending four years trying to do things the \"Hollywood Way,\" we've learned one thing: It's really really hard to get a movie made. The negotiations, the moving parts, the politics\u2026 Even when we had a property optioned - another project called The New Kid - it's not really a guarantee that anything will ever happen. The words \"Period Piece\" and \"Sci Fi\" together in close proximity give that town the hives. We found ourselves right back where we started. \nBut, maybe that isn't such a bad thing. \nWe went back to the drawing board, and with the help of friend and filmmaker Van Alan, we laid out the most pragmatic plan for what it would take to make an Automata series ourselves. Locations visited, scripts written, test footage shot - after two years of work from Van and his team, it started to seem like something we might actually be able to pull off.\nMaking a live action mini-series is expensive, and maybe not a very good \"investment\" in the classic sense. An actual movie studio would have a \"portfolio\" of films where one or two hits covers the losses for the rest of their lineup. Well, THIS IS THE ONLY ONE WE HAVE. And it doesn't have to make money - it just has to pay for itself. Its only responsibilities are:\n1. Get made, and  \n2. Be cool \n ... We'll handle the second one, if you can handle the first. Sound good? \nTELL ME MORE\nTest Footage Wireframes\nThe series will tell an original Automata story over five webisodes, each episode roughly 10-12 minutes long. Van has been working closely with Tycho/Jerry Holkins (that's, um, me) on the script. I don't really want to spoil it in, like, the Kickstarter pitch, but...  \nRead at your own intense risk for spoilification:\nSam & Carl are hired by a wealthy businessman to spy on his wife. When she winds up dead, and an automaton goes missing, Sam & Carl find themselves wound up in an intricate plot of sex, intrigue, and deception. It will be rad. The end.\nLighting for Test Footage\nIf the project funds successfully, Van and his crew are going to get started on this IMMEDIATELY. They will begin casting the key roles, building sets, working on the VFX, etc. They're raring to go.\nThey'll \"shoot\" (movie term) before the end of the year, and those that back via the digital download reward will get to view it in the Summer of 2016, 3 months ahead of the worldwide release.\nTell me about Van and his crew!\nVAN ALAN : Van is a Seattle-based filmmaker originally from Houston, TX. He has directed numerous music videos for bands such as The Presidents of the United States of America, Better Than Ezra, and Copeland. He has written and directed four short films and has been selected as a participant in the Texas Filmmakers Showcase in 2009 and 2010. In 2010, Van moved to Seattle to work with Penny Arcade to produce and direct their reality web-series and became the go-to guy to capture PAX conventions and other video projects.\nWILL LUMMUS : Will is an independent film producer originally from Nacogdoches, TX. In 2009, he moved to Seattle and became integrated into the Seattle Independent Film Community, working as a production and location assistant and eventually location coordinating and producing. His recent production credits include films such as Touchy Feely, Laggies, You Can\u2019t Win, Captain Fantastic, and Ridley Scott\u2019s The Man In The High Castle.\nLACEY LEAVITT : Lacey is a Seattle-based producer. She has produced and co-produced many of the best Seattle indie films of the last five years including Colin Trevorrow's Safety Not Guaranteed (Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson), Lynn Shelton's Laggies (Keira Knightley, Sam Rockwell, Chloe Grace Moretz) Megan Griffiths' Lucky Them (Toni Collette, Thomas Haden Church, Johnny Depp), and Todd Rohal's The Catechism Cataclysm (Steve Little, Robert Longstreet). She's a Sundance Creative Producing Lab alum and also co-directed the roller derby documentary Blood on the Flat Track.\nCompositing for Test Footage\nThat's a really... interesting... funding goal.\nWe think so, too. After running two decent sized Kickstarter projects, we now know more about the tiny details of running them. We've seen how expensive rewards get, we've backed projects that failed, and we wondered if there wasn't a clearer way to handle it.\nIf you're interested in the nuts and bolts, business guy Robert Khoo put together this summary.\nYou\u2019ve probably noticed that the goal for this project is a weird number. $322,637.09 is an oddly specific figure, some might say. Well, let\u2019s break down that number to make sure you, as a backer, know what your money is actually going toward. \nLet\u2019s first start with this: $251,842.46. That\u2019s the ACTUAL cost of producing the series. The breakdown of this budget, put together by Van, are as follows. \nAutomata Webseries Production Budget\nYou may have heard that Van was able to secure funding from the State of Washington which reduced the budget by $46,000. So we can go ahead and deduct that amount right off the top from $251,842.46, which leaves us with $205,842.46 that we need to raise from backers via Kickstarter. \nBut wait! $205,842.46 doesn\u2019t match up with $322,637.09 we\u2019re asking for. Where did that extra money go? Well, two things. \n1. Based on our previous Kickstarter projects, we now know our average Reward Cost Rate is 27.7%. That means for every dollar you kick in, it actually costs us (on average) 27.7 cents to produce and fulfill the reward you asked for. This includes design, production, warehouse labor, and even the box and tape that is necessary to ship the thing. \n2. The Kickstarter Fee is 5%. The average processing fee is 3.5%. \nSince we know it\u2019ll cost us 27.7 cents for every dollar we raise AND we need to pay Kickstarter and CC companies their fees, we need to raise more than $205,842.46. In fact, after accounting for Rewards and Fees, you can see where we reach our actual goal of $322,637.09. \nThis makes more sense if we do it in reverse: \n$322,637.09 is what we\u2019re asking for. \nKickstarter and credit card fees knock off 8.5%. That leaves us with $295,212.94 \nTo fulfill the rewards of $322,637.09, it\u2019ll cost us 27.7% of that. That breaks down to $89,370.47. $295,212.94 less $89,370.47 is... <drum roll> $205,842.46. \nPLEDGE LEVELS!\nFull level descriptions found on right side of page!\nStretch Goals!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI would say the biggest risk we will run into are with budget overruns and unforeseen delays in productions.

Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our two Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2014-2015 longshoreman west coast work slow down that delayed all of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to buy it verses the cost to produce it. This event did not occur in either of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount of the model.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #110", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

I had skimmed through some of the books on the making of Star Trek and felt there was so much more to explore about the birth and evolution of Spock. And the timing seemed right, as the 50th anniversary of Star Trek: The Original Series was not that far away. Dad agreed that now was the right time, and that he was 100% committed to collaborating with me on this project. He also reminded me that we were (then) just days away from the 50th anniversary of the start of production on \u201cThe Cage,\u201d the original pilot for Star Trek in which Dad first appeared as Mr. Spock.\nPlease participate in my Kickstarter campaign and help me complete a project that was important to my dad and has become extremely important to me.\n\nThanks again for your time and consideration.\n\nLLAP,\n Who Is Involved With This Project?\nEarlier this year, my father and I reached out to 455 Films to help us produce this project. 455 Films is made up of producers David Zappone, Kevin Layne and Joseph Kornbrodt. Dad chose this company because he was familiar with the Star Trek related films they have produced with William Shatner and was impressed with their work. David, Kevin and Joseph are also very well versed in the Star Trek tradition, and have worked previously with all of the important players in the world of Star Trek. \nWith their background in production and my experience in directing over 45 hours of network television, I'm very confident that we're going to deliver an entertaining and enlightening film about the lives of Leonard Nimoy and Mr. Spock.\nIn addition, I'm excited to announce that Zachary Quinto has generously agreed to narrate the film about the famous Vulcan, a character he now knows quite well himself.\n So, What's Next?\nWe're only just beginning our campaign on Kickstarter, but we're not coming to the table unprepared. In addition to having already completed a considerable amount of research on this film, I have personally compiled a treasure trove of pictures of the Nimoy family and of Dad in his many roles before and after Mr. Spock. And, of course, we have some great pix of Spock as well.\nThe funding of this film through Kickstarter will enable us to continue with production -- which will mostly take the form of filming interviews of Dad\u2019s friends, colleagues and family members. It will also enable us to license the hundreds of film clips and still photographs of Mr. Spock as he has appeared on television and in feature films over the last fifty years. Funding will then buy us time in the editing room, where I will be poring over the film clips and photographs and never-before-seen home movies as well as Star Trek artifacts -- some of which have not seen the light of day for nearly fifty years! \nOnce the edit is complete, we can then start working with a composer for a score which will play alongside the prerecorded music -- which we will also have to license. (Can you imagine referring to Dad\u2019s recording career without hearing a few seconds of The Ballad of Bilbo Baggins? Unthinkable!) We also need funding for a sound editor and to pay for a final mix of all the elements.\nWhat is this film really about?\nThis film was originally conceived as a tribute to Mr. Spock to help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original series. Now, with Dad's passing on February 27th, the film will also explore the incredible career and artistry of Leonard Nimoy. But what has become increasingly apparent as I continue to work on this project is that it's also a personal journey. \nAlthough I had initially intended to take a somewhat detached, objective view of the subject matter, more and more people involved in this film have urged me to interject some of my own perspective on what it was like growing up with Mr. Spock in the house, and how Dad's new-found celebrity and meteoric career affected my life. \nHow can I get more involved with the project? \nSpread the word via social media! While the fundraising is a critical part part of our focus right now, we also want to engage the community in any way possible. Follow us on Facebook or Twitter, share our story on your own blog or social media (tag us at @LoveOfSpock!), and keep an eye out throughout our campaign for other messages of how to get involved.\nCheck out content with our hashtag #SpockDoc and #SpockStories and share your own!\nReward Fulfillment\u2026 Or, When Do I Get My Stuff?\nPlease note, most digital rewards will be fulfilled through our website, www.ForTheLoveOfSpock.com in a special \"Members Only\" section. Assuming that our goal is fulfilled, we'll be reaching out to everyone shortly after the end of the campaign with details about claiming your rewards.\nThe digital screening will be hosted here as well, through the magic of VHX.tv. While we won't know the premiere date(s) until much closer, we're hoping to have the film ready to go in early-to-mid 2016. Once it's ready to be released, you'll receive information with a specially generated link.

But we're confident that through YOUR support, we can accomplish it in the time allotted -- but now IT'S UP TO YOU! As stated above, our $600,000 goal will help us pay for the interview process and most of the elements we need to license for this film. After processing fees and mailing, we\u2019ll actually only net somewhere around $530,000. Enough to do what we promised to do?

We've worked together in the visual arts for more than 20 years, as graphic designers, artists and 3D animators. We've also played Dungeons and Dragons (and other RPGs) together from an early age, starting with the red boxed Basic Set (oh, and even before that a game Dann made up and tried to make Greg play). \nThis project is a labour of love for us; to create imaginative, 3D-sculpted custom dice for our favourite hobby, and for the pure joy of holding and rolling them. We are very motivated to run this Kickstarter well and get the product into more hot little hands than our own. We'd love you to consider the pledge levels and rewards to the right, and if you'd like to order more than 4 sets, or for other details see the FAQ at the bottom of this page.\nWe needed your help to produce the Warrior Set! And not only have you helped us do that, thanks to your support and stretch goals we've already sized up the dice, added Knight Fight: A PolyHero Dice Game as an extra reward and unlocked Vorpal Purple and Amber and Steel Grey with Molten Copper dice sets! You've also helped us add a Grey and Copper Knight card to every copy of Knight Fight! Over the last few hours of the campaign only two potentially miraculous stretch goals remain unlocked, two more additions to Knight Fight: a set of multi-player battle-royale cards and rules ($88,000) and 6 new magic items ($99,000).\n Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next...\nPLAY\n\nAre These Dice Balanced, Sir?\nWe've worked to make these dice balanced, through using lines of symmetry and weight and number distribution -- through testing in both computer simulations, with 3D printed prototypes, and samples of the final dice -- and they work very well. But we certainly don't claim they are as accurate as casino machined dice. If you want a guarantee of high precision and statistical clarity while you lop off a Troglodyte's head then these dice aren't for you. But if you just like fun and different dice for whatever reason, and don't care if you roll an extra 20 every 1,000 rolls then we'd love to raise a flagon together and share our dice with you. \nWhen we reached $40,000 it made it possible to \"chunkify\" the dice (for every set and with no cost to backers). We think it will make the dice look and feel even more impressive and Warrior like. Check out the end of the Rolling Prototypes, Production Samples and What's Next... video (higher up on this page), and Update 2 for more details. The below figures are a good guide, but we'll be printing new prototypes to get the feel of the larger dice in hand before locking in the percentage increase of each specific die.\nA PolyHero's Journey\nWhen I, Dann, first played Dungeons and Dragons I can remember the exact moment I learned that I needed to roll a certain one of these strange but cool dice to \"do damage\". I was in a class room at lunch time and I was examining the strange pyramid of the 4-sided dice, trying to work out how the numbers worked on it. As I rolled that \"d4\", I'm sure I can remember my 12 year old self imagining using the dagger that dice represented against whatever monster my friend had pitted against us. It may be a false memory, but I'm sure I remember part of me wanting the dice to more \"be\" the weapon in some way. But how could a dice also be a weapon...? (Well, I mean, besides just chucking it at someone)\n[Insert spooky video wipe]\n...to 30 years later and my team mate in the creative department at Game Salute, David MacKenzie dreams up and produces Rocket Dice for his excellent new edition of Alien Frontiers. Greg and I worked for David on the 3D sculpts for the dice, and as we were working on them David had the idea of doing an RPG set of Rocket dice. I suggested to him that maybe we do the higher number dice as flying saucers. The idea of saucers didn't \"take off\", but time passed and I got to thinking about custom dice in terms of my own love of RPGs, and soon dreamed up the idea for the 20-sided shield dice. I took the idea to Greg and we began working on the other designs.\nWe worked together on the designs and 3D modelling for almost a year in gaps between our regular work. Settling on the final designs was a bit of a journey. The first decision was to build a set themed around a Fighter. We had and still have other designs for other characters, but a Warrior just seemed like the best place to start. \nOne of the biggest decisions was whether to make the sword a d6 or a d8! In D&D long swords traditionally do d8 damage, short swords d6. What clinched it for us is that a d6 is a much more widely used dice and we felt like a sword would be a more iconic d6 for that reason. It would allow the possibility of people using handfuls of swords as their d6 in a variety of fantasy games, that seemed cool. Of course, it doesn't really matter, they are fun whether they exactly match the weapon you are using them for... but as you do, we wonder these things. And we can always do d8, or d10 swords in the future if things go well. (Plans for sets of d6s are on the cards, but not as part of the funding goal for this campaign, see the FAQ at the bottom of this page).\nIt actually took us the longest to come up with an idea for the d10 and d10 percentile dice. I'd started thinking about the dice in terms of a possible game, and the idea that the more faces a dice had the more defensive it would be, that all made sense, we had a shield and a helmet at the top of the scale and a dagger at the lower end. But what weapon would go in the middle...? Then somehow we got onto the idea of Gauntlets, which seemed to fit the bill as a transition between attack and defence, but also because there needed to be two of them... Coming up with the idea was the easy part in the end. Trying to arrive at a design for the d10 dice and modelling them in 3D took longer than any other design. We restarted multiple times on the design and ended up with more of a leather armoured glove look to the gauntlet. It's fun that we even have a right and left hand. We decided to use a simple dot beneath one of the number sets so they could together be used as percentile dice. Just think of it like a decimal point, or full stop.\nThe Production Process & Progress\nWe live south of Melbourne, in Australia, but thankfully Dann also works with Game Salute, who have been able to help us out with setting up this campaign, sourcing a manufacturer for the dice and seeing to their distribution internationally after the campaign completes. The plan is that after delivering to the backers, the dice could go on to be sold at retail in partnership with Game Salute.\nGame Salute's experience with the manufacturing of Rocket Dice taught the company a lot, and we've been able to benefit from that experience. We were adamant that the manufacturing process be bedded down before we went to Kickstarter, and Game Salute agreed, and agreed to foot the bill to guarantee it. They sourced a new manufacturer and went ahead and paid for a full production mould for some of the dice to be cut, so we could test the designs all the way through to a first round of production samples ahead of the campaign -- so that we anticipate no issues with the molding and manufacturing process.\nAfter the campaign we'll continue to refine up the finish of the dice, and implement a slight size increase (thanks to a stretch goal)... and then it's on into production. We'll update you as that progresses.\nFREE International Shipping! (Yes, that means Australia too!)\nBecause our dice are mercifully small compared to a big box board game, we can cover the shipping cost for you to locations all over the world! (using www.ShipNaked.com). \nStretch Goals and Extras?\nWe've unlocked a lot of stretch goals (see the introduction above)!\nBecause we have been so careful in testing the designs and the manufacturing process, we won't be adding new dice designs to this campaign. We'd absolutely love to do more dice design, and have some great ideas bubbling away, but that will happen as part of a new campaign if this campaign does well, with newly tested designs and due preparation on our part. (If you have ideas for the future leave them in the comments!!)\nWe don't want to add in extras like dice bags. As super-cool as they would be, there are lots of awesome dice bags out there and we would be honored if you chose to buy a special dice bag to hold your Poly Hero Dice, that would awesome!! But by us not offering that sort of thing here, we can concentrate on the task at hand and not end up with delays in our attempt to become dice bag creators and merchants. Maybe one day, maybe if this thing takes off we can offer custom PolyHero Dice bags, but not this day. The main concern for us is we deliver on time.\nKnight Fight\nAs part of the design process Dann created a dice game -- Knight Fight --- with a set of 18 cards to use with 2 sets of PolyHero Warrior dice! We're now making it part of the campaign! Check out the update.\nIf there are other game designers out there that feel inspired and work up games using PolyHero Dice, the easiest way to let us know is via the Submissions page at Gamesalute.com. We'd love to hear your ideas!\nCredits\nHere we go for the weird credits section where it's just us... but just so you can see the split of work...\nConcept and Design: Dann and Greg May\n3D Modelling and Animation: Greg May\nStoryboarding, Art Direction and Graphic Design: Dann May\nProducer: Dann May\nDann May is a visual artist and took on the role of Chief Creative Officer at Game Salute in January 2015.

These take a long time to make. We started this project about a year ago.\n\nWe know that it will take time to get these dice done right. That's why we've done all the 3D modelling up front and paid for a test mold with the factory producing the dice. We have gone to the extent of having actual samples in hand before the campaign begins to be sure that the designs didn't encounter in any issues during the moulding process. \n\nThat's also why we're keeping this campaign simple, with just two different colored sets. Game Salute learned that lesson from the ballooning of options with Rocket Dice and we're dedicated to keeping it simple for this one. If this campaign does well, we can always look at doing more options in the future, but we want to focus on delivering the first sets first.\n\nWe're being realistic by setting a year timeline for production and delivery. Of course we hope it takes less time and if it does Ship Naked will ship the dice out to all backers as soon as they have them.\n\nWe'll provide you with updates at each major milestone of production and delivery.\n\nWe love your comments and feedback. We'll provide any changes inspired by your feedback in our updates. If you've got a question or comment, whether it's in person, by phone, via email, or on this project page, we appreciate it.\n\nGame Salute have seen that sometimes, after a campaign successfully funds and the thing being funded is actually being produced, life happens and a few people will want to cancel their pledge before the estimated delivery date. If that happens, just contact us and we'll be happy to make arrangements to process a refund to you.

Since then it has spread across the known world, a waking nightmare that takes hundreds of horrible forms. Ghosts howl in the night. Skinchangers lurk in the wilds. Fallen soldiers rise to slaughter the living. Entire cities fall to a Chant that turns all who hear it into mindless killers. We don\u2019t know why this is happening. We don\u2019t know how to stop it. All that we know with certainty is that we are fighting a war and we are losing. Over a third of the Empire has been lost to the Dread, and each day brings new horrors. In this dark time we have one hope: Phoenixes are returning. Every citizen knows tales of the Phoenixes, champions who can face death and return stronger than before. In the centuries following our brutal civil war the Phoenixes have become legends\u2026 and now you are one of them.\nPhoenix: Dawn Command is a card-based roleplaying game with a unique approach to character death. In Phoenix, players assume the role of supernaturally empowered champions bound together to defend a fantasy world under attack by threats that no mortal could withstand. These heroes face harsh odds every mission, and many won\u2019t survive. But death isn\u2019t the end of your character\u2019s story; it\u2019s the start of the next chapter. Phoenix is also a new fantasy setting, and you can learn more about the world of Phoenix here.\nCARD-DRIVEN ROLEPLAYING\nPhoenix is a story-driven roleplaying game that uses cards to resolve actions. Every player has a deck of cards that represent a character\u2019s abilities. To accomplish an action, a player needs to lay down a set of cards with a total value that equals or exceeds the difficulty of the task. A player can get an extra push by using a trait - a card that describes a unique aspect of a character. If the player can explain how that trait applies to the current challenge, the value of the card is increased. This encourages cinematic storytelling, driving players to describe an action beyond the simple numbers. In addition, each player has Sparks - a pool of mystical energy that can be used to boost the value of an action. This allows a character to succeed at a normally impossible task\u2026 but when that pool of energy is exhausted, the character dies. You can see a video example of this system here.\nWhile Phoenix has a gamemaster who drives the story and controls the challenges the characters face, the card-based system places a significant amount of narrative control in the hands of the players. Success isn\u2019t based on the roll of a die; it\u2019s a question of what a player is willing to sacrifice to make an action succeed. Because death isn\u2019t the end of the story, character survival isn\u2019t the most important part of a mission. Instead, the challenge is to make each death meaningful, and to achieve the objectives the Phoenixes are willing to lay down their lives for.\nThe Phoenix system is simple and flexible, and even someone who\u2019s never played a roleplaying game before can master it within thirty minutes. The story and setting of the game give players a clear purpose and reason to work together, and the mechanics of the game encourage teamwork. While the options provide depth of play for experienced gamers, it\u2019s very accessible to new players.\n DEATH MAKES YOU STRONGER\nIn Phoenix: Dawn Command, you don\u2019t gain power by killing others; you gain power by dying. After each death, you add additional cards to your deck and new abilities representing the lessons you learned from your previous life. However, there\u2019s a catch: you can only return seven times. So each death makes you stronger, but it also brings you closer to the end of your story. In addition, you don\u2019t return right away and you don\u2019t return in the place where you died. The fate of the world is in your hands and should you and your friends fall without completing your task, your mission will fail. Friends may be lost, regions may fall, and when you return you\u2019ll have to deal with the consequences of your failure. Because death isn\u2019t the end, the odds will often be stacked against the characters; to succeed, players must take risks and make sacrifices. \nWe'll provide more information about the setting of Phoenix in updates, or you can read Keith's updates on Phoenixes and the Story.\nWhat\u2019s In The Box?\nPhoenix: Dawn Command will include the following components.\n280 Tarot-sized cards, including Action cards, Lessons, School cards and Challenges.\nA softcover book (approximately 120 pages) containing the rules to the game, a guide to the fantasy setting, and a seven-mission story arc.\n32 Health tokens and approximately 70 Spark tokens.\nCondition tokens to track temporary effects.\nPlayer booklets will be provided as a free PDF download. These provide an overview of the setting and the rules, giving each player easy access to everything they need to know to get started.\nAll together, this is sufficient to support a gamemaster and a group of four players. The missions provide an initial story arc, and the manual provides all the information a gamemaster needs to develop new stories.\nAll materials shown in these images and the video are prototypes and may change in the final product.

The system has had over a year of testing with hundreds of playtesters. Approximately 90% of our art assets are complete and in hand. We have sourced manufacturing and fulfillment partners. The work that remains ahead of us involves finalizing the missions that will accompany the game and continuing to add depth to the game setting. \n\nThere are always things that can go wrong.

But whether it will be a time travel comedy or a serious drama is up to you.  That's because when I started working on this project and I had two great ideas of where I wanted it to go. \nCitizen George as a Serious Drama\nI had this idea I loved where Citizen George would be a straight drama in the vein of Citizen Kane.  It would be about the rise and fall of a man who is a hero to many in geekdom and villain to others, just as William Randolph Hearst was to many in an earlier age of media.\nThe Director in his earlier years (Photos by Phil Rose))\nCitizen George as a Time Travel Comedy\nBut at the same time, I also had an idea where Citizen George would be a sci-fi time travel comedy like Bill and Ted or Austin Powers.  In that story, The Director would time travel twenty years into the future and 1970's-Director would make the prequels instead of 1990's-Director.  Unlike future-Director, past-Director has not had decades of being surrounded by \"yes-people\" but he does have the added difficulty of missing out on twenty years of cultural change.  That version would be a lot lighter and more of a wish fulfillment fantasy but at the same time it too would also be a great way to explore how power effects people.  \nI was trying to decide which of those two versions I most wanted to make when the idea hit me; why not let the backers decide?  Kickstarter is all about letting the fans choose what they want to see.  So why not take that to the next level?  Why not let you decide if Citizen George is going to be a comedy or a drama?  So that is exactly what I am going to do.  \nSpace Rogue (Photos by Phil Rose)\nOn your right are rewards for Team Comedy as well as rewards for Team Drama. Whichever team ends up with the highest total dollar amount at the end of the Kickstarter, that is the team whose version will get made.  So, if at the end of this Kickstarter the total number of dollars from all Team Comedy rewards to the right is $75k and the total number of dollars from all Team Drama rewards to the right is $50k, then the entire $125k would be used to make Citizen George into the best darn comedy it could be.  And if the numbers were reversed (if it was 75k from Team Drama backers and $50k from Team Comedy backers) then the entire $125k would be used to make Citizen George into the best darn drama it could be.\nSpace Queen (Photos by Phil Rose)\nI want to make clear that regardless of which side wins, you will still receive the backing rewards from the level you pledge at.  Victory for one side does not affect the rewards themselves; not in the slightest.  The only thing it changes is what type of movie Citizen George ends up being made as; either as a comedy or as a drama.  And It won't just cover the Space Saga.  There will be very important scenes from other aspects of the Director's life, such as his popular game company named after him.  \nLike all Kickstarters you have the option of withdrawing your pledge any time before the end of the KS.  I will be continuously posting regular updates on how much each side has raised so if you decide that you only have an interest in one version, and it looks like the other side will win, you can always withdraw your pledge.  This Kickstarter will end at 11:59 PM (Pacific Time) on May the fourth.  If you want to check back on that day, then May the fourth be with you in your thoughts so that you can remember it as the day when this Kickstarter ends.  \nBut I promise you that no matter which version wins, you the fans will be getting a full length biographical film about a great Sci-Fi Director and his work that has touched us all.  It will have professional production values, a great script, fantastic acting, and the best special effects our budget allows.  \nPlease decide if you want Citizen George to be a comedy or a drama and select the appropriate reward to your right.  And if you want to make sure your team wins, please be sure to tell all your friends about it on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, or any blogs and forums your read.  \nThank you very much and I can\u2019t wait to give you a great film!\nPS.  See the trailer for my last film,Dark Dungeons, here.\nPSS.  Legally speaking, Citizen Kane was not a film about William Randolph Hearst.  And legally speaking, this film is not about anyone now living or dead.  In fact, the \"George\" in Citizen George doesn't even refer to the main character.

I will not rest until you are able to say the same about this project as well.\n\nIn partnership with Zombie Orpheus, the making of my last film, _Dark Dungeons_, was one of the greatest experiences of my life and I worked very hard to make sure all my backers got their rewards.\n\nNo matter which version you choose to get made, my team has the skills and the dedication necessary to do so. Most importantly we have performed well in the past and have impressed everyone from my backers to Wired magazine ( http://www.wired.com/2014/05/dark-dungeons-movie/ ). You can purchase my last film, funded from KS, here www.darkdungeonsthemovie.com and see what we are capable of. And keep in mind that we did that film with a budget much lower than that of _Citizen George_. \n\nWilson Large, of Dark Darkness fame ( http://www.darkdarkness.com/ ), did a great job of producing this video with a minuscule budget and is planned to be the producer of _Citizen George_ as well. \n\nNow, my last Kickstarter film was delivered nine months late. You deserve to know why. _Dark Dungeons_ was late because I ended up with twice the money and vastly more resources and allies than I thought I would. As such, the film grew in scope and as a result it naturally grew in the amount of time needed to make it. I had to choose between making a better movie and making a movie on time. And you should know that if the same choice is given to me with _Citizen George_, I will always choose to make a better movie. If that means delays to Citizen George then, while I don't like them, for me the most important thing is to make the best movie possible with the resources at hand. And that is what I will do. \n\nBut one thing I promise, I will insure that _Citizen George_ gets made no matter what. Making movies is the best job I have ever done in my life. It is the only job I have ever unconditionally loved. It is the only profession I have ever engaged in where I could not wait to wake up in the morning to face any difficulties with every last ounce of energy and intelligence I could bring to bear. I would do anything to keep making movies and I will ensure that you see every dime that _Citizen George_ raises up on screen in the best possible way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "JR Ralls\n4 created \u00b7 23 backed\nI'm JR Ralls the writer and executive producer of the previous Kickstarter film, Dark Dungeons ( www.darkdungeonsthemovie.com ).

Able to draw from innate magic, powerful fighting abilities, and honed skills, you alone are equipped to step from the shadows to fight the darkness. Each Agent will be assigned, or be able to craft, artifacts to aid you in your missions. These items are of lesser power than the Fae relics of the past; nevertheless, they are potent boons in The Glamour War.\nPlayers will tackle their missions on a variety of fronts. You may be sent to uncover information from a high ranking official at a gala, or to cleanse a battlefield from Kormil corruption. Or, perhaps, you will need to engage in rooftop battles to recover a Fae relic, or delve ancient ruins for secrets of the past. As an Agent in The Glamour War, you have to be ready for anything.\nShadowcraft: The Glamour War takes place in Arcadia, a land of inherent magic. Not the crude magic you might find in other realms, but the subtle, pervasive magic befitting the Lands of the Fae. This power has imbued the land and peoples of Arcadia, blurring lines between the physical and spiritual. Thus, though the Fae are now gone, their influence is still felt.\nThe Lost Ones, descendants of those kidnapped to Arcadia by the Fae, rule from the ancient Fae city of Lancastle. Manipulated and changed by the Fae, the Lost Ones became more suited for the life of servitude their new masters required of them. Forced to become more than mortal, they found the power to rise up and claim Arcadia for themselves. However, the expected peace was not found after the Fae had been expelled from the land.\nPhilosophical differences fractured the Lost Ones, resulting in civil war. The followers of Kormil, an unpopular philosophy that venerated the Fae, went into exile. Ten years ago, these Kormillians returned, at the head of a nightmarish horde. Their dark armies swept over the southern reaches of Arcadia, corrupting the very land beneath their feet before the Lost Ones could even mount a defense. After a brief but bloody struggle, the Lost Ones were able to bring the Kormillians to a stand-still. To this day, neither side is able to make any real gain in the war.\nThus, the war has shifted. Each side now seeks to subvert and undo its enemies through a secret war. Though peace seems to have come to Arcadia at last, The Glamour War rages on - hidden from view, but no less deadly.\nThe Core Book: This is everything you need to create characters and play the game. All reward tiers that get a copy of Shadowcraft: The Glamour War will receive a digital copy of the book, downloadable through DriveThruRPG.com. If you like the book, you will have the option to print and ship a copy at cost (you only pay the printing and shipping costs; see Fulfillment, below, for more details on how that works). The book will be laid out in full color with a 6.14 x 9.21 trim size, and will have an estimated page count between 200 and 250 pages.\nIf you want options to print additional copies of the core book, add +$15 to your pledge for each additional core book print option (maximum of 5 total core books per order).\nThe Missions Manual: This is perfect for the GM who wants to sit down and start running a game of Shadowcraft. It gives you 20 missions, in a story order that you can choose to follow or not. Each mission is outlined on two pages of the book, and includes quartermaster outfitting and villain write ups, where appropriate. As with the core book, the Missions Manual will be in digital format with the option to print (see the Fulfillment section, below).\nIf you want options to print additional copies of the Missions Manual, at cost, add +$10 to your pledge for each additional Missions Manual print option (maximum of 5 total Missions Manuals per order). Note: Only a GM will likely require a Missions Manual.\nThe Player's Guides: Since Shadowcraft: The Glamour War is a game about espionage, not everything in the game master's section is going to be appropriate for players to read, as it could ruin some of the fun knowing the forces and motivations behind the threats the GM intends to throw at the group. As such, the optional Player's Guide is the perfect book to hand off to players. It includes a setting primer taken from the core book that describes everything a shadow agent would know about Arcadia and the Kormillian threat, as well as all the rules to create a character. This is the same information from the core book, but with the rules for running the game and the game master's section removed.\nAll tiers that offer the Player's Guide will come with the option to print 4 copies.\nExclusive Mission: If you backed at a level that includes a Kickstarter exclusive mission, you will receive a mission that is exclusive to our Kickstarter backers. For more on missions, see the Mission Manual reward, above.\nLikeness Art: If you backed at a level that allows you to receive your likeness in the art, we will send you a digital copy of that art, plus the option to print, at cost, 2 copies of it as a tarot-sized card at DriveThruCards.com.\nRunning Games for You: If you backed at a tier that includes us running a game for you, one member of our team (chosen at random) will contact you via Google+ to set up a time where you and any of your friends (up to a total of 5 players) can jump in with pre-generated characters (either yours or ours) and run through a 2-3 hour session on Google Hangouts.\nWhat Does \"At Cost\" Mean?\nBasically, what we are doing in this Kickstarter is asking you to pay the profit of a physical copy (the cost of a PDF) in the Kickstarter. After we fulfill the PDF rewards, you will have the option to print a physical copy without paying us any additional profits (you only pay what it costs to print and ship the book). When we send out the Kickstarter surveys, we will ask you which print options you want. By default, you get a single print option of any book in your tier (or 4 print options of the Player's Guide, in tiers that feature it). Purchasing more copies of the same book gives you additional options to print the book at cost (essentially paying us the profits of those printed books here, and then deciding which quality of book you want to print later).\nFor more on print options, see the Fulfillment section, below.\nWe are using Drive Thru RPG to fulfill the all of the rewards for this Kickstarter. This means that anyone, at any tier, only pays us the cost of your DRM free (non-watermarked) digital rewards here. After checking out those digital rewards, if you decide that you want a print version, you can log on to DriveThruRPG.com and print out a copy of the book and only pay the cost for printing and shipping.\nIf you like it, print it for what it costs us to print it! If you don't, stick with the digital copy of everything. You could even mix and match, printing the core book but leaving any Player's Guides or Mission Manuals your reward tier may have as digital rewards to email to the players at your table.\nHere's why this is beneficial.\nThis gives you the maximum amount of control over your rewards, from start to finish. If you like the digital book, but are running short on funds, you can print a softcover in standard color. If you want to see every detail in the richest color possible, and protect your investment, you can print a hardcover in premium color. Either way, we don't see a dime. You paid us here through the Kickstarter, which covers our creative costs to make the book. \nWe will ask you for your printing preference when we send out the Kickstarter surveys.\nHow Much Are Prints Likely to Cost?\nWhile shipping is depending on your location, we can give you a price range that the prints will fall in (this is only a ballpark because the book is not finished yet and we don't know what the exact page range will be). Listed below are the print options we will be including for the book.\nSoftcover in standard color: $6.20 \u2013 $7.45\nHardcover in premium color: $24.30 \u2013 $28.80\nAgain, you will make this decision when we send out the Kickstarter surveys.\nA Note to International Backers\nDrive Thru RPG prints through Lightning Source (also known as Ingram). They have printers in the United Kingdom, Australia, and here in the United States. As such, international shipping is much cheaper than if we were to ship it from our warehouses locally. We've used Lightning Source to print our books through the Reroll Store, as well as natively through DriveThruRPG.com, with Jadepunk to great success.\n$12,500 is a lot of money. So, what do we need it for? Fortunately, because of the aforementioned method of fulfillment, we only have to worry about creative costs. Here's a breakdown.\nPaying our talented writers and editors is expected to cost us $4,100.\nAnd that's some very pretty art, so add an art budget of $5,875.\nFinally, we're going to need someone to put it all together. Layout costs are expected to be just under $1,150.\nThen we have our Kickstarter fees, which are are between 7% and 10% (we'll use the 10% to be safe), which is $1,112.50.\nThat's a total of $12,237.50, which we're rounding up to $12,500 for a nice, clean number.\nOur Stretch Goals", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince we are handling fulfillment through Drive Thru RPG, there is no danger that we will not be able to fulfill due to unexpected shipping or printing costs.\n\nThe only real risk will be on our side, post-Kickstarter. If we just hit our funding goal, we will be able to cover all creative costs and get our backers the products, but we may not have enough to launch a large print run and expand our distribution channels. All profits from this Kickstarter are dedicated to increasing the reach of Shadowcraft.

Be it a shadow in the mists, a form in the tree line or a shape in the night the mind creates monsters and creatures to explain them. These explanations lead to stories, stories lead to songs and songs become legends. These monsters of legend take on the shape of the fears of the people that tell the stories. The Greco-Romans tell stories of misshaped cannibalistic demigods, the people of northern Europe have sagas of giants that live in the ice and dwarfs that live in the mountains and in the Far East there are tails of club wielding demons and dragons that swim through the air like a fish moves through water. The native cultures of the Americas and the islands of the Pacific also have these monsters that have been formed by fear, but with few gods, creatures of hope and courage took shape to bring balance to the world.\nIn the realms of games and models, the monsters and spirits of Europe, Egypt, and the growing popularity of Asian Culture has led to these subjects being well covered by several model companies. Paymaster Games is addressing the lack of Native American and Polynesian models on the market place with our Going Native line of models and games, this includes the spirits and monsters of their myths and legends.\nAbout the Project\nThe Spirit Beasts for the Going Native line of models are gaming miniatures set in the 28mm scale. These models will be cast in either white metal and/or high quality resin (depending on the model) by the brilliant casters at Valiant Enterprises Limited. All of the models will be supplied with a new style plastic base that will be appropriate for the size of the model \u2013 30mm base for small models, 40mm base for medium models and 50mm base for the largest models.\nHere is a scale chart that will help you determine the true size of the different New World Monsters and beasts\nhttps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/107285147/Spirit%20Beast%20Designs/Spirit%20Beast%20Scale%20Chart.pdf\n25% Discount off Retail Price\nSince many of the models featured in this Kickstarter Campaign already have pre-production models (Greens) and/ or molds, Paymaster Games can offer a fair discount to all of the products we are bringing to this campaign.\nFree limited edition Ai Apaec the Decapitator model\nAt certain pledge levels, Paymaster Games is offering the mad god of the Moche people, Ai Apaec the Decapitator, as a free Kickstarter Exclusive model to certain pledge levels.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

Lovecraft's mind.\nEirhavir\nEirhavir is a delicate, slender font more than suitable for magic texts, elvish, or other mystical communiques.\nGuldroun\nGuldroun is a solid, engraved-feeling font that smacks of ancient greek inscriptions on marble pediments.\n\nAkahake\nAkahake is a swirling, brushy font useful for pseudo-asian cultures and other groups that use brush and ink for their writing systems.\n\nFont Details\nThe fonts will be offered in OTF, TTF, and WOFF, just to make sure you get what you need.\n\nEach of the five base fonts will have English and non-English characters for you to use.\n\nStretch Goals\nNote: Stretch Goal fonts will be added to every \"All Fonts\" reward level automatically.\n$500 - Base Goal: Ruvahl, Noxzuat, Eirhavir, Guldroun, and Akahake.\n$1000 - Bonus Font: Aluminite, a Sci-Fi Font\n$1500 - Bonus Font: Sigil, a DIY personal sigil-making font\n$2000 - Bonus Font: Urosial, a voice-marked, phonetically organized conlang font\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't my first font rodeo, but there may be some challenge to be found in making sure that the english letters mesh and match well with the made-up glyphs.

No matter how good your phone's camera is, its ability to focus on close-up objects is limited.  With Easy-Macro, you can get even closer to capture the details you've been missing.  No cropping or software tricks will give you the super sharp detail that Easy-Macro's optical magnification offers.\nGet super close with Easy-Macro...\n...for amazing photos like this!\n Why We're The Best\nWhat exactly distinguishes Easy-Macro from other smartphone lenses?

This is where Easy-Macro's unique ability to be kept in your wallet comes in.  When that opportunity comes along, you'll be ready.  \nOne of the earliest stories we heard from a customer came from an optometrist.  A patient had come in for an exam and needed a detailed photo of their eye taken for their medical record.  The doctor's fancy camera recently broke and he was preparing to ask the client to come back in a few weeks.  He then remembered the awesome new Easy-Macro lens he had just purchased.  He produced his Easy-Macro and captured a photo of the patient's eye in just seconds, saving the client from the hassle of returning to the office.  Stories like this are a huge reason why my team and I have continued to work hard to make Easy-Macro the best, most convenient macro lens on the market.\nHere are a few more ways our customers are using their Easy-Macros:\nTake incredible up-close photos of everyday objects\nShow kids the tiny details in the world around them\nTeach up-close photography in schools\nRecord plants and insects for ecological field studies\nKeep records of dermatological concerns\nShow of their amazing manicure art\nPhotograph fine details in jewelry and crafts\nInspect electronics\nThe uses for Easy-Macro are only limited by your imagination!

It has this precious sense of wonder to it that brought me back to the early 1980\u2019s when I first discovered the artwork of the Fab Four of TSR I mentioned above.Stephanie is a big fan of pewter fantasy miniatures and has been collecting them since she was young.So she was thrilled when I approached her about creating a range of miniatures based on her artwork. She has been involved in the creative process with us every step of the way on these miniatures. Stephanie and I are happy to present to you what we hope is the start of a wonderful new Dark Sword miniature range that we need your help on launching.\nPatrick Keith has sculpted up the wonderful new miniatures for this range. Patrick has a proven track record with Dark Sword Miniatures, Reaper Miniatures and his own company Bombshell Miniatures.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with Dark Sword Miniatures and the style of our gaming scale miniatures (what would be referred to as 28mm Heroic Scale from many companies), you can check us out on our Web site at: www.DarkSwordMiniatures.com You can also scroll down the page to some gallery pictures of a small sampling of the miniatures we have released over the past 12+ years. Please note - these are painted studio model examples \u2013 all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or resin and will require minor assembly. You the hobbyist will get the pleasure of assembling and painting our miniatures in whatever color schemes you wish to see them in. It is a wonderful hobby indeed..\nDark Sword has already run and fully delivered on two Kickstarter projects we ran back in July/August 2013 and February/March 2014. We aim to once again exceed expectations on delivery of this project both on the quality of our miniatures and speed of delivery for our backer rewards. Like our last Kickstarter projects, we have a very simple campaign backer structure you can see over to your right. Early Bird Core Set and Core Set Backers will be rewarded for their support with special Kickstarter pricing. Other perks will include stretch goals that can be unlocked along the way for more free bonus miniatures added into the core set and access to other cool add-ons after the initial funding goal is exceeded. Once again, we already have the core set fully sculpted and have been running test castings of these miniatures to ensure everything is ready to crank into high gear on the production front once we get underway. Everything is cast in lead-free pewter. We aim to have backer rewards delivered very quickly after this campaign is finished so people can enjoy these amazing miniatures.\nBelow is a small sampling of our existing George R.R. Martin Masterworks Pewter Miniature range from the Song of Ice and Fire Book Series that inspired the hit HBO show Game of Thrones. These miniatures were created working closely with GRRM himself from how he envisioned the characters from the books in his mind - they are not from the HBO series. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Elmore Masterworks Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Visions in Fantasy Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nBelow is a small sampling of our Visions in Fantasy Anthropomorphic Animal (I call them critters) Pewter Miniature range. Please note - these are painted studio models - all of our miniatures come in bare pewter or bare resin and require minor assembly and of course painting.\nWe have included the above galleries of images to showcase a small sampling of what Dark Sword Miniatures has delivered over the past 12+ years as we approach 600 miniatures produced. You can see for yourself the quality and care we put into every aspect of our small boutique miniature company.  You can check out our Web site at: www.DarkSwordMiniatures.com to see more examples of what we have done and also read customer testimonials about the quality of our miniature ranges and the speed of our shipments all over the world. I bring these things up to call attention to our proven track record of delivering on projects in a consistent methodical manner.\nSome folks asked for size comparison pictures next to Reaper Miniatures during our last Kickstarter project. So I have taken some pictures (forgive the rough lighting here as it was simply sun coming in the window for our light source) of some of our new and existing GRRM miniatures next to some Reaper Bones and Reaper Metal minis.\nMale Miniature Sizes Comparison between Dark Sword Miniatures and Reaper Miniatures\nPlease keep in mind that GRRM goes to great lengths to differentiate and describe his characters in regards to their heights and overall sizes/shapes. You have the extremes from Tyrion up to Ser Gregor \"The Mountain That Rides\" and a good number of very tall strong men in between like Jaime Lannister, The Black Fish and the Old Bear. Tom Meier and Jeff Grace go into exacting detail to get this across on very small miniatures. Even differences between Dany and Sansa compared to the much taller Cersei or Melisandre are evident in these minis.\nFemale Miniatures Size Comparision Between Dark Sword Miniatures and Reaper Miniatures\nThank you very much for checking out our Kickstarter Project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we face is getting the backer rewards shipped in a timely and affordable fashion. I want to exceed expectations on this front once again like we did on our first two Kickstarter projects. So to once again help support this goal, we have already completed sculpting and initial master molding on the core set of miniatures. We have also performed test castings to ensure everything is dialed in from a pewter quality perspective. We have already had our pewter miniature caster set aside casting time and packing time so we can quickly get a head start on production as this campaign is underway. Just like with our first two Kickstarter projects, we will keep our backers in the loop with frequent updates throughout the run of this new Kickstarter project. All of our production and packing/shipping will take place in/from the Midwest USA.\n\nMany Kickstarter campaigns also run into shipping issues \u2013 especially international shipping issues. We are in our 12th year of business and have shipped orders out all over the world in the past 12+ years. We also completed and fully delivered on our first two Kickstarter projects. International shipping is expensive and this large release will be no exception. Dark Sword Miniatures has built a reputation of top notch quality and dependability over the years in regards to both our miniatures and our shipping turn times. And we aim to build upon that reputation once again with this new Kickstarter.\n\nAnother challenge many Kickstarters face is sorting the surveys after the project completes. Just like our last two Kickstarter projects, we have purposely built our project with simplified backer levels in order to simplify surveys so they are easy to complete and return quickly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Final 48 hours on the new Stephanie Law Masterworks Kickstarter Project!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nI wanted to drop you all a quick note and let you know that our new Stephanie Law Masterworks Kickstarter project is down to our final 48 hour push.
