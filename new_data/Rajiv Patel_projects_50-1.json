We design and make products. To preorder this Travel Tripod and bring it to life, click Back This Project. Or scroll on, scroller. \nTake a closer look at the Travel Tripod with Lawrence, Peak Design's boy genius:\nAnd, check out the host of optional accessories that you can add onto your pledge (instructions at end of video):\nSo why redesign the tripod? Because traditional travel tripods have a critical flaw: tons of wasted space. The result is a tool that is inherently difficult to carry with you into the field. We fixed that, and more. \nWe spent 4 years redesigning the tripod from the ground up to eliminate dead space and minimize packed-down size. \nBut we didn't stop at space savings. \nWe made a tool that deploys and packs down rapidly\u2014nearly twice as fast as a traditional tripod. We made it intuitive and delightful to use. We engineered professional-quality stability and performance. And we added thoughtful features to help you get the shot\u2014 with any gear, in any environment, from any point of view.  \nWe built the Travel Tripod around the photographer's workflow. How? We are photographers.\n\nWe loaned pre-production samples of the Travel Tripod to some of our favorite creatives on Youtube. Here's what they had to say:\nPeter McKinnon compares the PD Travel Tripod to the Gitzo Traveler:\nManny Ortiz goes ham on the Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod in downtown Chi-town:\nKitty Peters of Atola Visuals goes deep on the Travel Tripod and shares footage from our media unveiling event we hosted in San Francisco:\nTechCrunch interviews Peter Dering and Art Viger on the design considerations behind the Travel Tripod:\nAlright, let's dive deeper into every crevice of the Travel Tripod's functionality:\nPro performance. Half the size.\nThe Travel Tripod takes up half the volume of a traditional travel tripod. We also eliminated bulky, protruding knobs. The result? Every water bottle pocket on your bag is now also a tripod pocket, and you're carrying a full sized tripod with professional capabilities.\n\nSet it up (and pack it down) faster.\nWith traditional travel tripods, slow setup may mean a missed shot. Not with the Peak Design Travel Tripod. We designed strong, easy-to-use leg cam levers that can be operated together (no tedious twist locks!). With our architecture there's no need for the legs to flip up/down when packing and unpacking.  And, we topped it off with lightning-fast camera quick-attachment/release.\nCurrent office record: 9.4 seconds from packed to legs deployed.\n\nLove thy ball head.\nNo more guessing which knob to turn or how far to turn it: a single and precision-engineered adjustment ring gives total articulation. Our locking ring gives you further stability and vibration reduction. But even without it, your camera is locked securely in place. The unique head design gives you greater range of articulation, and incorporates 3 portrait mode cutouts instead of 1.\nMade for the camera in your bag.\nMake no mistake: the Travel Tripod is small, but it's ready for big jobs. High-performance materials and precision machined parts yield weight capacity, stability, and vibration dampening comparable to much larger, more expensive tripods. The Travel Tripod is designed to handle pro photography gear, easily handling a full-frame DSLR with a 70-200 lens. Combining a 20lb weight capacity with a 60\" max height, the Travel Tripod performs as well as any other in its class. \nAlso made for the camera in your pocket.\nThere's a reason that phones are already the most used cameras in the history of cameras: mobile devices take incredible pictures,  they're only getting better, and you always have it with you. That's why we gave the Travel Tripod a brilliant, stowable, universal mobile mount hidden in the center column.\nMore points of view. More environments. \nIt takes just seconds to switch to Inverted Mode, perfect for macro or product photography. Or, with a few turns of the included hex wrench, you can reconfigure into Low Mode. The Travel Tripod goes lower than any other tripod in its class, enabling unmatched ground perspective shots. Plus our separately available add-ons give even more versatility: the Universal Head Adaptor lets our tripod with any tripod head, our Spike Feet add grip in ice and looser terrain, and the Ultralight Conversion Kit removes the bottom 4 sections of each leg and takes almost half the weight off your tripod making it an incredible tabletop-sized backpacking tripod. Check out our addendum video for more info on the accessories. \nA zippered soft case from the legendary Peak Design soft goods department, plus all the tools to use and maintain your new tripod: our precision machined aluminum Standard Plate, a hex wrench for plate tightening and tripod maintenance, and the phone mount mentioned above.\nL-brackets and 3rd party tripod plates. Remove the pins on the ball head for longer plates. Compatible with most Arca Swiss plates. \nHow about the entire Peak Design Ecosystem. Secure Anchor connection points let you carry the Travel Tripod with any Peak Design strap. The Travel Tripod uses the same plate that comes with our Capture Camera Clip. Carry the Travel Tripod in (or on) any Peak Design bag. It's the size and shape of a water bottle, making it easy to carry in any bag you want.\n\n\nDurable, serviceable, and guaranteed for life.\nWeatherproof and impact-resistant, we built the Travel Tripod to give you years of joy. How many years? A lifetime. Like all Peak Design products, we guarantee the Travel Tripod for life (see warranty details in the FAQ). We made every part of the Travel Tripod serviceable, cleanable, and replaceable, to give it a longer lifespan and generate less waste.\nReady to take the plunge? Click Back This Project, and pick a reward.\nThen let's add on some accessories:\n\nPeep this sick vid for details on the above add-ons, and instructions on how to add them:\n\nAnd what if you're detail-oriented?\nTripod Specs, Materials & Performance Testing\nWe've been working with a Stanford physicist during pre-production to ensure the Peak Design Travel Tripod has pro-level stability. Well, he's not just any Stanford physicist. David Berryrieser is the founder of The Center Column, a site dedicated to scientifically testing tripods. David may be the world's foremost expert on tripod performance.\nIn short, the Peak Design Travel Tripod is as stable, if not more stable, than most other travel tripods in its class. That means you get extreme compactness without sacrificing performance.\nDavid tests tripods using harmonic oscillation. For more info on what that means and how the Peak Design Travel Tripod compares to others, read Update #8. Here's what the testing looks like:\nTesting of the PD Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod. Note how much less movement there is versus the otherwise comparable 3rd party travel tripod below.\nTesting of the MeFOTO Road Trip Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.\nAgain, read Update #8 for the full story behind our performance testing.\n\nEnvironmental & Social Impact\nMaking and selling stuff creates pollution. It is Peak Design's responsibility to clean up that mess, and find ways to make less mess in the first place. It is also our responsibility to look out for the well-being of the many people who contribute to Peak Design, ensuring that we succeed at the expense of nobody.\nBelow are the key sustainability and responsibility considerations in making the Travel Tripod. You can learn about Peak Design's company-wide sustainability plan here.\nTravel Tripod is carbon neutral. That means that zero net greenhouse gases are emitted when making/delivering the Travel Tripod. We achieve this by measuring the Scope 1-3 carbon footprint of the Travel Tripod, from raw material mining to manufacturing to shipping to the end customer. We then reduce or offset that carbon footprint in its entirety. Peak Design is fully carbon neutral, all the way back to the beginning of our company.\nTravel Tripod is fully serviceable, and nearly every single part is individually replaceable. It also comes with a lifetime guarantee. This means less material has the chance to end up in a landfill.\nTravel Tripod is built in factories that pay workers fairly and provide for their safety. Peak Design works with our partner factories to maintain a code of conduct for worker pay, safety, and conditions. We invest in 3rd party audits to ensure these standards are always met. \n1% of Travel Tripod sales go to grassroots environmental nonprofits. Peak Design is a 1% for the Planet member, meaning that 1% of all our revenue goes to protecting wild places. As of April 2019, we've donated over $1 million to environmental nonprofits.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe launch our products on Kickstarter because it gives us the freedom to run our business exactly how we want. The funds we generate on Kickstarter make it possible for us to continue developing products without seeking venture capital. That means we're not beholden to growth goals, revenue targets, or product timelines imposed by other people. Instead, we focus on doing what we love: building the best things we can possibly make, fueled by support from the best customers we could possibly ask for.\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. From the beginning, our backers have steered the direction of our product roadmap, both with their feedback, and with direct participation in our design process via surveys and focus groups. This close collaboration is made possible by communication and community-building tools of the Kickstarter platform.\nThank you for letting us continue on this incredible journey.\n\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 9th Kickstarter project since 2011. Through the years we've gotten pretty darn good at setting accurate expectations and delivering on our promises. But no matter how much we've got our poop in a group (official midwestern terminology) things can still go awry. If they do, we solemnly promise to give you full transparency into the issues and solve them in a way that leaves our backers happy and proud to support our company.\n\nSupply Chain Risk: Sometimes a machine or tool breaks. Sometimes a factory loses power for a day. Sometimes we get the wrong parts or materials in. These things happen from time to time and can affect how long it takes to build our products.\n\nShipping Risk: Global shipping and warehousing logistics is mind-boggling. Hence we outsource that stuff to experts. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors.\n\nActs of God: We're based in San Francisco. That means we could have an earthquake. Or a horrific avocado toast shortage.

Simply squeeze and credit cards emerge, perfectly arrayed for immediate access.  Release your grip, and the cards drop down, locking in securely.\nThe wallet is beyond tough. We built and tested the wallet to last over 100 years.  The internal lift system is tested to well over 500,000 cycles (and going), the wallet is corrosion resistant and thoroughly impact-tested.  We construct it right here in Utah out of American aluminum, stainless steel, and high-strength polymer.  In other words, it will last you your lifetime, backed by our Industry leading \u201cA3 Guarandamntee.\u201d\nThe wallet comes optional with a high quality leather sleeve for those of us who are \u201cminimalist-plus,\u201d  allowing you to store cash or just more cards.  Without the leather jacket, the GRIP6 wallet feels strong, sleek, and space-age.  With the leather, the wallet feels more traditional, but maintains strength and quality.  We\u2019ve also included the optional FingerLoop\u2122 at no extra cost, which increases control, pocket access, and is fun to use. \nMade poorly and wear out quickly\nOften bulky, thick and annoying\nDifficult to access cards you need\nDon't protect against RFID\nThe defining feature of the GRIP6 Wallet is the patent pending internal lift mechanism. With a simple squeeze, 6 cards emerge in an easy to retrieve stair step pattern.  This geometry leaves enough room between the cards for you to locate and grab the individual card you need. The cards can be put back in any order.\nWe spent a great deal of time testing and redesigning the wallet to last hundreds of thousands of cycles, simulating a century of use and abuse.  We don't believe in planned obsolescence.  We wanted a wallet to last longer than you. That may sound far-fetched, but it's true. We built a machine to cycle test the wallet half a million times before we stopped it, but it still hadn't broken. We took the wallet apart to see what damage had occurred, but almost none had; the wear was minimal. We feel really good about our final design and we think you'll love it.  You will be able to use your GRIP6 Wallet more than a dozen times per day, everyday, and it should last 105 years.  Because we're confident in our abilities and testing, we've also guaranteed them for life.\nWhen you're not actively using the GRIP6 Wallet, the cards automatically remain locked in by a patent pending mechanism.  In addition, the light, durable 6061 T6 Aluminum body effectively blocks RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) signals used by the modern thief.  These features make sure the GRIP6 Wallet is both physically and electronically secure, and give you needed peace of mind.\nWe have a deep-seated belief that manufacturing is critical to the future of the United States' economy.  Many \"Made in the USA\" products are from materials and components from outside of the USA.  With the GRIP6 Wallet, we are able to source the high quality Aluminum, the top-grain Leather, and the glass bead-blasted injection molded plastic for the lever and internal lift mechanism all within the  USA.  The only thing we don't source within the USA are the stainless steel screws.  We're looking at bringing that home soon.\nAnd it's not just made and sourced in the USA.  We cut and build the wallets right here in Utah, at our in-house manufacturing facility.  Owning the production process of a product also allows us to: \nTightly control quality and consistency\nMake minute process and redesign changes immediately\nIncorporate customer feedback quickly\nProvide fulfilling local jobs\nProblem solve any issues that arise very quickly\nWe only use the best materials. The GRIP6 Wallet is wrought from 6061 T6 anodized aluminum, stainless steel screws, stainless steel springs, stainless steel pins and a high performance, glass bead-blasted, Bayblend\u00ae injection molded plastic. This wallet will withstand the toughest conditions and won't rust.\nThe FingerLoop\u2122 was created to enhance your interaction with your wallet. The unique loop design makes it a cinch to pull the wallet out of your pocket. It ensures a more secure hold on the wallet and, most importantly, it's really fun!  You can flip your GRIP6 Wallet in your hand like a wild west gunslinger all day long and people around you will wonder, \"What is that thing!? It's amazing! I want one!\" But in all honestly, it really is both functional and fun.  We do caution you is that it's likely to annoy people how much you take your wallet out of your pocket to sling it around!\n The optional Leather Jacket gives your GRIP6 Wallet a softer, more traditional feel and provides expandability. It can hold both cards and cash and doubles the capacity of your wallet. The prototype leather covers are laser cut, but during full production they will be cut with a die on a clicker press (i.e., the leather will be clean and consistent).  They are then sewn on our \"Boss\" leather sewing machine that is capable of punching through 3/4\" thick layers of leather or webbing. We will be converting the hand stitching machine into a fast, automated sewing machine for volume production.\nThe funds raised from this kickstarter will be used to purchase domestic plastic injection molds, all raw materials, equipment for cutting and sewing leather, and custom tooling for CNC machining the plates. We will literally be creating these unbelievable wallets with our own hands.  We've already done the hard work and know we'll be delivering you a one-of-a-kind product. We're excited to share the journey with you!\nBJ Minson was a regular, back-pocket-wallet kind of guy for many years. But one day in a fit of minimalist indignation he pulled his sloppy, misshapen, hideous wallet out of his back pocket and asked himself, \"Why in the world do I sit on this stupid thing all day?\" \nSo, he decided to put his cards in his front pocket and used a blue rubber band taken from a broccoli stem to hold them together. It was sooooo much better... for two weeks. Then the rubber brand broke. He bought more broccoli and a new rubber band, and the rubber band broke again.  This cycle happened several times. It wasn\u2019t a bad setup: BJ was getting healthier eating all the broccoli and at least he didn\u2019t have to deal with the ills of a regular wallet.  But it wasn\u2019t perfect. \nNext, he purchased a thin, simple, card-holding wallet. It was good, but it was difficult to find the right card and even more difficult to get the card out, and the wallet fell apart too quickly. He bought a different one.  Rinse and repeat, the same thing happened. \nAt the time BJ was studying mechanical engineering and he determined to design a better wallet. He got together with his friend Dan and over the course of several months developed the GRIP6 Wallet. \nAt the time, BJ knew very little about manufacturing and the wallet was going to be fairly expensive to produce. He decided to give it a try on Kickstarter in 2012 with an audacious goal of $100,000.  Even with a sale price of more than $100, the wallet did surprisingly well and got almost halfway to the goal! But, sadly, ultimately did not fund. \nBJ went on to finish school, get a day job as an engineer, and kept his prototype wallet in his pocket for the next 7 years (yes, the original wallet still works fine). During that time, he designed and produced a new belt that was innovative, simple, and amazing. He launched it on Kickstarter in 2014 and it funded! BJ founded a company called GRIP6 (check out grip6.com for more info). He started in his garage with the help of friends and since that time has made hundreds of thousands of belts. \nGRIP6 grew quickly and steadily and has become a company that prioritizes and understands the value and complexity of in-house production and manufacturing efficiency.  Even as GRIP6 grew to be a leader in belts, BJ\u2019s mind often wandered back to his beloved wallet, and he finally decided to bring his wallet to life. \nHe and his team of engineers at GRIP6 have spent thousands of hours, exhausting their experience and ingenuity to make the wallet better, stronger, and much more economical. In honor of the birthplace of the original wallet and the GRIP6 name, BJ decided to bring it back to Kickstarter to give it new birth and to give the Kickstarter community the first opportunity to join the project and share the journey of bringing the wallet to full production.  \nSo - Thank you kickstarter community for giving us a start we couldn't have found anywhere else! We'll always be grateful to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are no strangers to manufacturing and the difficulties and problems that arise.

We spent over a year sourcing 100% pesticide-free, heirloom cardamom that met our high standards of taste, quality and sustainability, and we\u2019re finally ready to share it with you!\n$25,000 allows us to purchase the entire 400 lb 2019 spring harvest, and package it in our beautifully redesigned recycled glass jars.\n Anything we make over $25k, will go towards purchasing milling equipment, sourcing Coorgi rainforest pepper, Gujarati sea salt, Rajasthani desert cumin and regional chill peppers from Karnataka and Andhra, coming end 2019!  \nThis cardamom has been a long time coming...\nI first tried to source organically farmed Indian green cardamom in the spring of 2018. I called all my contacts at the Indian Institute of Spice Research and the Indian Cardamom Research Institute (ICRI), and put the word out amongst my network of South Indian farmers and their communities. \nBy summer 2018, I collected samples from several certified organic cardamom growers, but heard a very concerning story from the spice research community. Dr. Vijayan, a trusted resource and the deputy director of research at ICRI, bluntly explained to me how big commercial cardamom growers cheat the organic certification process to sell pesticide-ridden cardamom labeled as organic to the global market. Sure enough, every single lab result for the samples I received came back positive for pesticides.\nJust when I had given up on sourcing pesticide-free cardamom, I got a call from Mr. Abraham Chacko- a farmer bang the middle of the cardamom hills- the region where commercial and corrupt cardamom agriculture is at its worst. Shockingly, his sample came back 100% pesticide free. I booked a flight to visit him the next day. \nAbraham started farming over 20 years ago on his family estate with little success. In 2017, after adopting a new low-budget biodynamic farming method, he noticed some of his cardamom plants were faring much better than the rest. He began to selectively breed the older, hardier plants bearing healthy fruit and withstanding the pests that usually devastate organic cardamom. \nThe resulting cardamom seeds are fruity, incredibly potent, with a lasting fragrance. I could already imagine the kadak, spicy cups of chai, or the aromatic, heady pastries we could make with them! \nFrom left: The Princess (50g) and The Queen (100g)\nAbraham has tried to sell his cardamom at the local auction house for years, but commodity cardamom is chosen based on size and color alone, factors that have no relation to their taste or quality. His paler, smaller pods fetch a low price, and since the auction houses are usually financed in some part by pesticide and fertilizer companies, there is no market for anything grown organically.\nThe commodity price of cardamom is 15x the price of every other spice on the Indian spice market. After saffron and vanilla, it's the third most expensive spice in the country. So naturally, it is a game of big players with big cash, and whilst we're a small player with small cash we've always had big dreams, big impact, and big community :) \n WHO WE ARE: \nDiaspora Co. was founded in August 2017 to disrupt and decolonize the spice supply chain. Our first offering, a high-curcumin, freshly-milled, heirloom turmeric called Pragati, was born out of the idea that if turmeric was going to explode and have its \"moment\" in the U.S., we wanted to make sure that it was sourced equitably, transparently and sustainably. We've since become known as the highest standard of turmeric in the U.S., used in your favorite turmeric latte brands, restaurant menus and in over 15k homes across the country. \nOur business promise is to pay our partner farms between 2x-10x the commodity price (more on that below), and source the freshest, heirloom, single-origin spices from India.

Even worse, if you don\u2019t have a good grip on your items, they can ALL fall back into the sink \u2013 taking your sanity with them.\nThe Equilibric colander reduces the amount of water needed to wash your fruits and vegetables by 60% - all while removing twice as many contaminants! You will never have to worry about items in the sink again because this design saves you time and frustration.\nIts ergonomic design keeps the vegetables upright and safe as the water bowl drains the dirty water away, cleaning your foods and keeping your clean items safe from spillage.\n\nThe colander also serves as a great serving dish for you.  You don\u2019t have to worry about using more dishes than necessary just because you need something to put them in afterwards.  Drain the excess water from your vegetables - and serve your fruits or salads in the same dish.\nTrying to defrost something at room temperature turns into a huge problem for most cooks.  Water often winds up all over the counter creating an even bigger mess, and more work for you.\nWith typical colanders, lots of dirt and other contaminates can transfer to your clean serving dishes.  But with the Equilibric colander, its washing machine motion helps remove 90% of the dirt and bacteria from your foods \u2013 giving you a healthier, more nutrient rich meal!\nAs you can see, the Equilibric colander saves you time and energy.  It\u2019s also incredibly efficient, sanitary, and environmentally conscious.  Moreover it saves extra money on your water bill.\nEquilibric has a very well considered hole slots pattern that allows to drain the excess water fast and simple. Equilibric Bowl is made from a high quality polypropylene which is an unharmful material to dine from. Equilibric Bowl design has a special spin system which uses the force of gravity to speed up all kitchen tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nStory. Team. Development. Future.\nMy name is Ann and I\u2019ve been working in design for eight years. I\u2019ve graduated twice and worked my way from the position of a common designer to art director. My husband Tim is an engineer and likes inventing. Together we\u2019ve come up with Equilibric.\nMe and Tim were born in the countryside, and despite growing up in an urban area, we always preferred home food over fast food l, which bears no benefit or proper nutrients, often being harmful. So we cook home a lot and try to ease doing so process as much as possible.\nFour years ago I had the idea to improve the typical colander design, after having bought all kinds of them in stores, inspired by design of various items and inventions, from spoons to airplanes. So I took a pencil and got to draw.\n\nThanks to Tim, my sketches and concepts came to life as working prototypes.\n\n\nThe most problematic part was talking to various China-based factories. We were sending the design and info over, but struggled with communication problems. But ultimately, we found a manufacturer and a manager that helped us on this stage after it had stretched on for a while.\nTwo years ago, Sabina joined us as a co-founder, responsible for communications and marketing. Without her, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it to Kickstarter and organize everything.\nWe\u2019re really grateful to Inpixel, the company that took care of the video material for us, delivering calmly great results despite my quite extensive list of requests.\nOur future plans is to introduce a brand new type of colander for enthusiasts and kitchen professionals. I promise, you haven\u2019t seen anything like it before, and we\u2019ll be showcasing it on Kickstarter right from the concept stage! We\u2019re also creating a USB-powered heating food container, which might possible have its own battery.\nOur global goal is to create a brand of smart kitchen gadgets and food containers (both with and without heating) for carrying your dishes.\nPlease help us bring our plans to life, and become part of Equilibric!\n\nTIMELINE\n\nApril 24, Project ends\nMay 8, Receiving funds from Kickstarter\nMay 9 - July 10, Mass production\nJuly 10-20, Quality control\nJuly 20-25, Shipping to the fulfilment and logistics centre\nJuly 26, Shipping out\nEnd of August, All backers receive their Equilibric\n\nSHIPPING INFORMATION \n\n+ SHIPPING ADDRESSES WILL BE COLLECTED VIA CROWDOX  \nhttps://crowdox.com\n\n+ LOGISTICS AND FULLFILMENT SERVICES WILL BE PROVIDED BY SFC \nhttps://www.sendfromchina.com\nSHIPPING RATES\n1 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $5\nCanada - $5\nHong Kong - $5\nSingapore - $5\nChina - $5\nKorea - $5\nJapan - $8\nEurope - $8\nUnited Kingdom -$8\nAustralia - $12\nRussian Federation - $12\nRest of the world - $12\n2 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $9\nCanada - $10\nHong Kong - $10\nSingapore - $10\nChina - $10\nKorea - $10\nJapan - $16\nEurope - $16\nUnited Kingdom -$16\nAustralia - $25\nRussian Federation - $25\nRest of the world - $25\n 6 piece (Round or Square)\nUnited States - $20\nCanada - $25\nHong Kong - $25\nSingapore - $25\nChina - $25\nKorea - $25\nJapan - $29\nEurope - $29\nUnited Kingdom -$29\nAustralia - $45\nRussian Federation - $45\nRest of the world - $45\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSomething can always go wrong especially when we are talking about worldwide shipping.

This time around, we wanted to design a more minimal pen that's sleek and pocket friendly. By incorporating the highest quality materials with subtle design elements, we were able to create a full size feel in a compact form factor. Whether you're in the board room or out in the field, the EP1 is the essential EDC pen for any occasion.\nWe designed the REFYNE EP1 around the Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 refill because we love the way it writes. Smooth and easy. Also, we knew that by choosing this style refill, it would allow users to swap out to literally dozens of other options because our pen works with any standard parker style refills (list of refills below). Who doesn\u2019t like variety, right?\nFeaturing a unique shaped bolt action channel, the bolt action mechanism was chosen for its simplicity and ease of deployment. With the flick of your finger you can open or close the pen in a fraction of a second. We decided to add a subtle design element, by using copper for the internal barrel. \nDepending on your carry preferences, the sleek deep carry pocket clip can be easily removed with the turn of a screw. The integrated top cap allows this to be done seamlessly without showing any unsightly holes or notches when the clip is taken off. Additionally, the clip is keyed to keep it secure and in position. \nEach screw has been custom machined and accepts a standard Torx T6 bit. This makes tightening down the bolt or removing the pocket clip both effortless and secure.\nDimensions: 115mm x 10mm (4.53\" x 0.39\")\nPolished Titanium body: 24g (0.88oz)\nBlack PVD Coated Stainless Steel body: 36g (1.23oz)\nRemovable Custom deep carry pocket clip\nCopper Barrel Bolt-Action\nBlack Schmidt easyFLOW 9000 M refill (included)\nCompatible with most Parker style refills\nCustom Torx T6 hardware\nList of most Parker Style Refills:\nFaber-Castell Ballpoint Pen Refill\nFaber-Castell Scribero Gel Ink Roller Refill\nFisher Space Pen Refill, PR Series- Colors (Bold, Medium, Fine)\nFisher Space Pen \u2013 Universal Ballpoint Refill\nForay (Office Depot) Ballpoint Refill for Parker (Medium)\nItoya Aquaroller Refill (0.7 and 1.0mm)\nKaweco Soul G2 Refill 1.0mm\nKaweco Sport Roller Ball Pen Refill\nMoleskine Ballpoint Refill\nMoleskine Gel Refill (0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nMoleskine Roller Gel Fluorescent Refills\nMonteverde Ceramic Gel Refill (Broad)\nMonteverde Needle Point Refill (Fine)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- Colored inks (Medium)\nMonteverde Soft Roll- (Superbroad, Medium, Ultrafine)\nOHTO Needlepoint Ballpoint Pen Refill PS-807NP\nOHTO PS-205NP Extra-Fine 0.5mm Ballpoint Pen Refill\nParafernalia Ballpoint Pen Refill NO LOGO\nParker Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nParker GEL Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nParker Quinkflow Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium, Fine)\nPelikan Giant Ballpoint Pen Refill 337 (Broad, Fine, Medium)\nPentel KFLT8 Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPlatignum Standard Ballpoint Pen Refill\nPremec Parker-Style G2 Gel Refill (0.4, 0.5 and 0.7 mm)\nRetro 51 Tornado Roller Ball Refills (REF5P) (Made by Schmidt)\nSchmidt 9000M EasyFlow Pen Refill\nSchmidt P8126 Capless Rollerball (Fine)\nSchmidt P8900 Super Bowl Refill (Fine)\nSchmidt P900 B Ballpoint Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchmidt P950M Megaline Pressurized Ballpoint Pen Refill (Medium)\nSchneider Express 735 Pen Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nSchneider Slider 755 Pen Refill (Extra-Broad, Medium)\nSTABILO EASYgel Refill\nStabilo Ballpoint Refill\nTombow BR-ZLM Ballpoint Pen Refill\nVisconti Ballpoint Pen Refill AA49 1.4 (Broad)\nVisconti Gel Refill (Broad, Medium, Fine)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs experienced and successful project creators across three brands, we're fully aware of all the different risks and challenges that could arise when bringing a product into reality.

With the use of basic tools, a simple design emerged from my hands.  A small and tactile object that has proven to be more useful in everyday life than I had expected. Along with many of the original adopters, I still use this little cutting tool on a daily basis. It really has withstood the test of time.\nClear and Cloudy\nRainbow and Midnight\nThe shape and name of the Tidashi is derived from a traditional Japanese utility knife, called Kiridashi-Kogatana; a design recognized by its long handle and short cutting edge. In Japan this tool is still relied upon for making accurate cuts or markings on wood. \nEDC\nReiteration\nOver the years, Tidashi users have provided me with feedback. A slight size increase has often been suggested, and I am glad to say that that is exactly what the Tidashi 2.0 is offering, resulting in a more confident grip when using the tool. \nEvolution\nA redesigned and more substantial silicone sheath provides just the right amount of friction for securely holding and releasing the Tidashi. It also allows for the use of larger diameter paracord and keyrings, both of which are included. It is still made from the same long lasting silicone material which has held my personal original Tidashi for all these years.\nDimensions\nTrue to its origins, the Tidashi 2.0 is cut from grade 5 titanium, known for its toughness and corrosion resistance. It is often used in diving knives, as it is lighter than steel and able to resist even the harsh environment of salt water. The fact that this particular alloy lends itself to easy sharpening is something that I have found useful, but not essential to the Tidashi design. It is not a tool for slicing tomatoes. The blade length is simply too short for that. Its forte lies in puncturing and shallow cuts, as done when opening packages. And of course its biggest strength, as with any tool, is the fact that its size allows you to have it on you when you need it. \nAlways with you\nEmergence\nIn order to increase the manufacturing accuracy and consistency of this new iteration of the Tidashi, I have decided to have its basic shape cut by CNC. This will allow me to focus more on the final finish of the Tidashi, including a unique anodizing method for bringing out the amazing colors of the natural titanium oxide layer that covers any titanium object.\nColors...\nThe decision to relinquish absolute control over the original Tidashi design by walking away from my computer, is also what guided me in developing a new coloring method for the Tidashi 2.0. I tried to put emphasis on naturally occurring patterns. By subtly controlling the flow of acid and electricity along the surface of the Tidashi, I was able to bring out some unique shapes and colors reminiscent of the cloudy skies over my home in the Sierra Nevada mountains. Although the process is repeatable, no two knives with this pattern will be exactly the same, just like the skies.  I was also able to recreate the original color combinations such as Rainbow and Midnight for a total of ten unique versions for you to choose from. I am showing all ten variations here, but please scroll all the way down for some more info about the new storage pouch.\n1.Natural\n2.Clouds\n3.Midnight\n4.Acid\n5.Rainbow Black\n6.Rainbow White\n7.Sky\n8.Black Gold\n9.White Gold\n10.Purple Rain\nPackaging\nIn the past I have often spent a lot of time and energy on the packaging of my designs. And although a custom box for your Tidashi would be nice, I was recently confronted with the sheer amount of waste I was producing by doing this. In response I have decided to package the Tidashi 2.0 in a more permanent and reusable zippered Cordura pouch. It is lined in a soft plush material to protect your Tidashi not only during shipping, but also if you should choose to store it. The design in not finalized yet, but it will most likely be just like in the picture below.\nStorage pouch included\nExperience\nAfter having fulfilled several campaigns and having shipped thousands of rewards, I would consider myself a veteran Kickstarter creator. I very much consider the Kickstarter experience a shared one between myself and the backers, which is why I am always very open about the project in regular updates. I also try to answer any and all questions asked in messages and in the comment section. My backers and I have traveled this path from inception to completion several times, and we have seen the highs and lows along the route. The previous project has been especially hard, and it has shown me which pitfalls to avoid in future endeavors, including the project we are embarking on now. I hope you will join us, and make the Tidashi 2.0 project another successful one. \nCheers,\nSander", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf there is one thing I have learned from my previous project, it is how the complexity of a design can exponentially increase the risk of something going wrong during production. It is the main reason why I chose to keep this design as simple as the original design. It is also why I chose to keep the anodizing process in house. It is a process too delicate to hand off. \n\nThe process of manufacturing the basic shape of the Tidashi 2.0 is done by an overseas manufacturer I have worked with in the past. They have been reliable and based on the samples they provided (which are in the pictures you see here) I believe they will provide an excellent product. As the project is going live we are discussing some final details about the cutting process and final finish of the shape. I plan to perform a thorough quality control on the initial small production runs, before increasing the production volume. And if for whatever reason the manufacturer cannot continue production, I can always fall back on the equipment I acquired for making the original Tidashi, and move production in house. \n\nThe mold used for creating the silicone sheath has already been made and paid for, because I wanted to show you the result in the pictures. This means that production of the sheaths should not be the bottle neck in this project.\n\nThe pouch design is based on an existing design, and the manufacturer has indicated that it is comfortable making it. If problems should arise with the manufacturing, I would not have a problem reverting to the exact design that the manufacturer already makes on a regular basis (the only difference is a slightly different size). \n\nI will be shipping the Tidashis anywhere in the world from the US, and although the declared value of the average shipment will be below the duty threshold of most countries, there is a chance that you will have to pay some import duties, especially on larger shipments. If you have ever ordered anything from abroad, you are probably already aware of this, and know that I have no control over this, other than keeping the declared value to a minimum.\n \nAlthough the cutting edge of the Tidashi is very short, I want every backer to be aware that there is always the possibility that the laws of your country do not allow you to carry it in public. As far as I am aware, it has never happened in the past. \n\nIn summary, I believe that the biggest risk would be delay in the expected delivery date. The reason for this is that definitive information about production quantities will not be available until after the campaign closes. This is a problem that is almost inherent to the Kickstarter system, and we'll work with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 26 or more", "title": "One (1) Tidashi 2.0", "descp": "This amazing deal gets you one Tidashi 2.0 in NATURAL color.

The Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini grips and holds screws in place, making fastening much easier in all aspects. You don\u2019t even need a second hand involved.\nThere are five total Magnet Driver\u2122 Minis \u2014 in two different colors signifying different sizes \u2014 that work with our 1-\u215b\u201d precision bits or standard 1-\u00be\u201d precision bits.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Full Set reward comes with 20 extra-long S2 Steel bits in eight different types, and bits are color coded to match with the appropriate Magnet Driver\u2122 Mini size.\nThis magnetic mat keeps your metal objects perfectly organized. Place small pieces and screws directly on the mat for guaranteed safety and security. Not to mention, it details the Moon and the place and date of the first man landing on the moon.\nThe Magnet Driver\u2122 Carrying Case keeps everything safe and secure for easy portability.\n                       Michael Perez, the inventor of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, has had a lifelong overarching passion for technology and has always been fond of the milestones it has reached over time. Coupled with his passion for technology, developing a precision screwdriver in honor of Apollo 11 was always a lifelong goal he strived to achieve. He spent a lot of time seeking a way to combine his passions into one product. From this, he developed the idea of the Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, which perfectly merges a toolkit with space rocket and moon accents. The rest was history. For him, everything has to be related to this commemoration, as it is crucial to humanity. For this campaign, we\u2019d like to give special thanks to our friend, Rafael M\u00e9ndez Pe\u00f1a, who not only collaborated with NASA to produce documentaries and outreach videos, but also helped us with our video. He really knows how to rock it!\n  We can\u2019t thank you enough for checking out our project and helping us make Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket a reality.\nWe know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t give a dollar or purchase a Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, if you\u2019re a supporter of Magnet Driver\u2122 Space Rocket, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always certain risks that can arise at any moment during a project like this.

We listened to your feedback from the original Braza Bro Kickstarter and incorporated the improvements into this blade. Technically this is a Wharncliffe style blade, but it reminds us of a mini pocket cleaver.\nStart your morning off right!\nWe didn\u2019t set out to make the best mini pocket/keychain knife ever, it just happened. Mike at Bastion has been designing and making EDC blades and tools for a while, and he really knows what he\u2019s doing. That\u2019s why when I was dissatisfied with all other mini knives, he was the first person I turned to when looking to develop the perfect mini folding EDC knife... the Braza Bro. \nMike on the right with the original Braza EDC knive, and Daniel on left with Braza Bro EDC mini knife launched on Kickstarter earlier this year. I swear that we are holding them the same distance from the camera, the size difference creates an optical illusion.\nBraza Bro was a hit on Kickstarter earlier this year! Read more about the Braza Bro story here.\nNow the duo have returned with an all new iteration of the Braza Bro. You may recognize the comfortable handle design, but that's where the similarities end. The blade is a completely new design, available in two different steels, stainless or titanium handle options, and other features that were highly requested by our backers.\nStylish & Versatile Wharncliffe Blade\nLooking like the mad child of a bone busting clever and a hair popping razor blade, the  Wharncliffe style blade offers good looks with mad functionality. It's almost straight edge makes it good for carving and slicing. The pointed tip is like having a pocket exacto.\nErgonomic Handle Grip\nThe handle provides an excellent grip fitting in your first 3 fingers. The shape and contour of the handle will ensure that your hand won\u2019t slip.\nThere\u2019s a choil for the index finger, and a slight recess on the spine of the handle for the thumb to sit on. The blade spine is jimped to provide a non-slip grip for your finger. When in use, the Braza Bro feels much larger than it appears.\nNot only is it extremely comfortable to hold and use, it\u2019s also a beautiful knife to behold.\nComfortable to use.\nNEW!!! Multiple Blade Metal Options\n S35VN Stainless Steel is the newest, coolest, most high tech, and toughest stainless steel alloy available. It's what everyone dreams of in an EDC pocket blade these days. It's harder than squirrel tits and keeps an edge better than a line of coke. No, but for real though, this is some tough shit. Made in the USA by Crucible, it starts off as a metal powder which allows better control over composition than the traditional mixing of molten metals. It's then sintered to bond the powders together into solid stainless steel.\n D2 Tool Steel is used in popular high-quality EDC tools. D2 is a high carbon and high chromium air hardening steel. Yes, that means it's harder than frozen t-rex shit, which then fossilized and froze again. The benefits that are offered from D2 steel are excellent wear and abrasion resistance which is provided from its large volumes of carbides in the microstructure. D2 is used in long production cold work applications requiring very high wear resistance and a high compression strength. D2 is harder than S35VN, but is susceptible to surface corrosion.\nWhich Steel Do I Want?\nIf you want a no maintenance blade that will never rust, then choose S35VN.\nIf you want the hardest and sharpest longester (yes, that's a new scrabble word, try it), then choose D2 steel. If you're afraid of a blade that may get a little bit of rust and forms a patina over time, then don't choose D2 steel. D2 is not for cry babies or those with weak hearts. It will cut you, and it will rust a little. The upside is that you'll never have to sharpen it. Ok, you will have to sharpen it if you cut rocks and fossilized shit with it, but you won't have to sharpen it as often as S35VN.\nNEW!!! Titanium Handle Option\nAn ultralight titanium handle is paired with the S35VN blade. The weight difference is surprising when you hold it in your hand compared with the stainless handle.\nNEW!!! Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nDeep carry pocket clip was a highly requested feature change from the OG Braza Bro. Whether it makes you feel more discreet, or it gives you some good vibes that its more securely clipped onto your pocket, the deep carry clip looks bad ass, and is a feature rarely seen in knives this small.\nNEW!!! Reversible Pocket Clip\nLefty's rejoice! The Braza Bro Cleaver now features a reversible pocket clip. The pocket clip can be put on the left or right handle scale, whatever you like best. There's even a tiny insert with torx screw that covers the hole on the unused side.\nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\n Cutting Edge Length: 2.12\u201d (53.9mm)  \n Closed Length: 2.75\u201d (70mm)  \n Open Length: 4.77\" (121.3mm)  \n Total Weight: 1.34oz and 1.48 oz  \n Handle Material: Titanium or Stainless Steel  \n Cutting Steel: S35VN or D2 Tool Steel - heat treated for optimal edge hardness, strength and durability, stonewashed finish before grinding  \n Spine Jimping: Spine is jimped for non-slip finger hold  \n Bearing: Ceramic Ball Bearing - buttery smooth opening with no play.\n Hardware: Torx Stainless steel  \n Frame-lock: Adds security and strength  \n Pocket Clip: Stainless Steel and removable if not needed.\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole\n Manual and Safe Operation: No spring, no assist, not automatic.  \nSpine Jimping\nJimping refers to the series of notches on the spine of the blade near the handle. These notches provide increased grip for your finger to improve safety and cutting precision. \nFlipper \nThe flipper allows for lightning quick, 1 handed deployment. A ball detent holds the blade securely closed, but a quick flick of your finger sends it flying out. Once open, the flipper acts as a finger guard.\nThe flipper is completely manual in operation. There is no spring and no assist, so the Braza Bro is not automatic. It follows the same manual opening and closing principals as a regular folding, locking knife. \nCeramic Ball Bearings\nCeramic Ball Bearings make the opening action super smooth and have zero play so the blade won\u2019t wobble when cutting. These bearings are more expensive than the commonly used phosphor bronze bushings, but they are totally worth it. You'll be blown away every time you experience how fast the Braza Bro blade flips out, and then feels as solid as a non-folding, fixed blade knife when cutting.  \nLook at those tiny ball bearings!\nLook Ma, No Play!\nCeramic Balls are suitable for applications where high loads, high speeds and extreme temperatures are factors. Long life and the need for minimal lubrication make this material appropriate for extreme applications. Ceramic is non-porous, non-magnetic, noncorrosive and lighter than steel. In ball form, ceramic balls are also harder than steel and because ceramic balls are non-porous they are virtually frictionless and capable of spinning faster than steel balls. \nUltra-Strong Frame Lock\nThe frame lock is an integral part of this the Braza Bro EDC knife. The lock is CNC machined from the frame. It\u2019s secure and easy to release using only one hand.\nOne-Handed Opening and Closing\nThe flipper and ceramic ball bearings allow for lightning fast, one-handed opening. The frame lock makes it easy to close one-handed also. The flipper serves double duty and protects your finger when closing.\nManual and Safe Operation\nThe opening and closing of the Braza Bro Cleaver are completely manual in operation. There is NO spring and NO assist, so it is NOT automatic. It is the same as a regular folding, locking pocket knife. It will only open with as much force as you can put on the flipper with your finger, so there's no danger of it swinging out unexpectedly. \nThe cutting edge length is 2.12\u201d (53.9mm), much smaller than normal blade length restrictions (the carry restrictions are usually about 2.5\" max length).\nA ball detent keeps it closed. Since there is NO spring, the cutting edge can't accidentally spring open in your pocket or on your keychain. \nIt is up to you to check that local laws allow you to own or carry this tool.\nStainless Torx\u00ae Fasteners  \nTorx\u00ae screws and fasteners are recognized by the six-point star design on the head. Created in 1967 these exceptionally secure high-quality fasteners can be found on a wide range of motorcycles, automobiles, and computer systems. Torx\u00ae products are known for their ability to prevent screw damage\u2014and enable someone to produce a high amount of torque without causing harm to the product.\nErgonomic Contoured Grip  \nSmall knives can be hard to hold onto, but this is not the case with Braza Bro. The contoured handle provides an excellent grip and fits perfectly in your first 3 fingers when holding it. The flipper acts as a finger guard, preventing your hand from sliding forward onto the cutting edge.\nReversible Deep Carry Pocket Clip\nThe pocket clip is an essential feature that is often left out of mini pocket knives. Braza Bro allows you to choose between pocket clip, keychain, or lanyard carry. The pocket clip is made of stainless steel and coated the same color as the handle. The pocket clip is very secure. If the pocket clip is not needed, it is removable by using a Torx driver to remove the screw. \nUse the deep carry on this side...\n... or that side\nKeychain and Lanyard Hole  \nThe Braza Bro is the perfect EDC tool to keep on your keychain. The keychain and lanyard hole is more than a drilled hole afterthought as seen on other mini keychain knives. It is purposefully designed into the shape of the handle.\nOpen a can of whoopass!\nWho cut the cheese? Again?\nPop a Cap!\nScrew it!\nSlice it!\nWhat's inside the box?!?\nBraza Bro Cleaver is the non-identical twin of the Braza Bro. It shares some of the same EDC genetics as the Braza Bro, but comes with a different blade style and many improvements.\nThe process of creating the Braza Bro was more than just shrinking the original Braza. We had to go back to CAD and layout the new smaller design. Everything was miniaturized, from the tiny ceramic ball bearings that make it open so smooth and keep it wiggle free, to the smaller pins, screws and pocket clip. \nWe took all the backer input from the first Braza Bro and added a new blade style to create the Braza Bro Cleaver\nYou will be able to select the blacked out option when you fill out the shipping survey through BackerKit after the Kickstarter ends.\nShare the Braza Bro Cleaver and Earn Cash!\nWe're looking for assistance to spread the word about this campaign!

No one knows the exact nature of those who built the Dome, but the founders of this advanced civilization have come to be called the Forefathers.\nClick to download ultra hi-res\nYou will discover miraculous technologies and weird artifacts in the labyrinths of the Dome, but that is not all the Forefathers left behind. Watch out for automated security systems, traps, and inexplicable anomalies.\nIn addition, the Dome itself is showing signs of consciousness. It has been reacting to the human presence since the first explorers entered its domain. Once inside, no one is able to leave. Uncovering the wonders and dangers of the Dome is a one-way road.\nExploration and exploitation of the Dome is carried out by the CRONUS Foundation, a massive organization founded by the world\u2019s most powerful governments.\nNarrative\nLearn more about the narrative of Encased - in KS-update #14\nWhat the press says\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want Encased to be just the way you see the perfect CRPG: a huge game, rich in content, sort of \u201cthe Fallout of our dreams\u201d, which all of us could be proud of. \nWe are developing the game for a while already. We have reached pre-alpha and we are confident that Encased could become a great game. But we are a small team, and there is a lot of things that we\u2019d like to add. With your help, Encased could become a way more ambitious, better fleshed out and polished project!\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money that could help us expand the game! One of our ground rules is to create games arm-in-arm with our community.\nA little bit about where the money will go\nKickstarter and taxes will take away about 10% of the funds. Part of what\u2019s left will be spent on actual implementation and shipping of all the wonderful rewards we\u2019ve come up with. All the rest we will spend on polishing, expanding, and improving the game. That includes a possibly bigger team - one more artist and several designers and scripters - which will spruce up the graphics and increase the number and quality of fights and story interactions. Also, the money will go towards voicework and localization which will make the game more fun and accessible for everyone.\nSocial Goals\nLearn more about social goals in KS-Update #11!\nFacebook likes: Like the Encased Facebook page and encourage your friends to do the same!\nFacebook shares: share the Encased announcement post on Facebook.\nTwitter followers: follow @darkcrystal_hq on Twitter and encourage your friends to too.\nTwitter retweets: retweet the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nTwitter likes: Like the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nDiscord fans: join our Discord group.\nThe Story\nAs a new recruit, the player must choose one of five Wings:\nBlack Wing - military and security forces;\nWhite Wing - scientists, medics and researchers;\nBlue Wing - engineers and technicians;\nSilver Wing - upper management;\nOrange Wing - ex-convicts who have exchanged their prison jumpsuits for the uniform of a CRONUS laborer.\nThough your selected Wing grants certain starting bonuses and opens interesting options, your choice does not lock you into a \u201cclass\u201d. You are free to develop your character, distribute skill points, and choose abilities as you wish.\nUpon completing character creation, you are summoned to Crystal Sands, a city built directly outside the Dome as a staging point for personnel and equipment.\nThe transition station mounted at the apex of the Dome, above the only aperture, is called the Spire. After basic training, you will descend from the Spire into the Dome to land at Magellan HQ. \nThere is much to uncover during your first mission underground\u2026. Relying on your stats and Wing training, you will find there are several ways to resolve each challenge. Replayability is one of our main goals for the game. After your briefing at HQ comes your first task: exploring a newly discovered Forefathers compound tagged Object O-12-Nashville.\nAfter a few adventures inside the Nashville object (which we don\u2019t want to spoil just yet), your group encounters an entirely new anomaly. You awaken something dreaming deep beneath the desert of the Dome. Your trespass has activated Maelstrom, a telepathic entity created to serve the Forefathers. \nAll connection with the world outside the Dome is lost and Maelstrom rages across the desert, infecting the minds of everyone it encounters. You and your group fall into a technology-induced stasis for five long years. And when you come to, the entire world has changed. \nEncased combat is inspired by classic, tactical turn-based systems, with a grid overlay, action points, cover system, special abilities, various ammo and damage types, many different resistances, and more!\nThe player has direct control over his character only. You will manage the behavior and tactics of their your henchmen but their specific actions will be guided by the game\u2019s combat AI system, introducing funny and interesting situations into your battles.\nThere are dozens of weapons to be found, many of which can be stripped and upgraded. \nThe world of the Dome has from its discovery been a place full of weird creatures and dangerous traps. There\u2019s no telling what lies around the next bend in the road, or inside the twilit cave, or beneath the murky waters of the swamp. But who knows? Perhaps humans are the biggest threat in this bizarre land.\nMaelstrom dominates everything. It's telepathic rage sowing chaos in the minds of everyone, trapped under the Dome. But the player, having \"freed\" the entity, enjoys a special relationship with it. The two of you have regular interactions and Maelstrom may even grant \"whishes\" to the player... but be warned: every call for assistance will eventually incur a price. \nMaelstrom's power grows stronger the closer you move to the heart of the Dome, and that's exactly where you must go to find the answers. There is a special stat influencing interactions with Maelstrom: Psyche. Resistance to Maelstrom's negative effect can be developed in several ways, and develop it you must before you may venture deeper into the Dome. There is also a special skill branch related to Psychic abilities.\nWe will talk about Maelstrom and gameplay related to it in the future updates.\nFollowing the devastating events of Maelstrom\u2019s release, CRONUS splintered into multiple other, often warring, factions. The world has changed while you were in stasis, but has the nature of Man? Trapped inside the Dome like spiders in a jar, these factions will show the worst and best of humankind. Will you join them, or strike out on your own?\nLearn more about factions in our Kickstarter Update #2\nIf the player chooses to commit crimes against the society, he will incur penalties to his reputation and earn titles ranging from 'Petty Thief' to 'Enemy of the State' or even 'Threat to Humanity'. Crime begets punishment. The player may be fined, imprisoned, and even executed. Luckily, there are several ways to deal with your arrest: bribe judges, organize a jailbreak or return alive from the Labyrinth of Death (this last one may be particularly challenging).\nEncased features a day and night cycle with accompanying lighting effects. It would be wise to study NPC routines while adventuring.\nThe Dome is huge and for the most part is an open sandbox (if you are able to resist the psychic presence of Maelstrom). The map consists of more than 170 sectors, each crafted by hand. There are abandoned bunkers, black caves, the complexes of the Forefathers, as well as wastes, swamps and other biomes.\nRandom encounters have been a standby of the old-school role playing game since the dawn of the genre. But Encased will bring them to a new level. Each encounter is a separate post-apocalyptic story, not just a bunch of critters attacking you. Want to participate in a game of Russian Roulette? Find a pathway through a deadly anomaly to find a rare relic? Defend an automated rail transport from raiders? Or end up a victim yourself. All this awaits you, in addition to more classic encounters.\nRead more about Random Encounters in our Update #5\nGuest Stars and Experts!\n  Platforms and dates\nEncased is being developed for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Early Access for the Windows version will likely begin in the first quarter of 2019, exclusively on Steam. The final version will launch during 2019 on Steam, GOG and other services. The console edition is planned for the winter of 2020.\nDigital Rewards explained\nCRONUS employee ID badge\n\nAn employee using your name set out on an expedition in the desert\u2026 and vanished. Nothing was found but their badges. The mystery must be solved before it happens again. Will you accept the quest?\n\nMap\n\nA detailed map of the known world under the Dome, showing all the cities and settlements of the Foundation, along with the entries to the \u2018objects\u2019, explored and unexplored. Restricted to higher ranks amongst certain Wings, the map also indicates some locations that the Foundation would prefer to keep secret. A gift for those with the time and inclination to explore 30,000 square kilometers of desert.\n\nLorebook\n\nA digital version of the lorebook, containing all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within. The story of its discovery, an atlas of its most interesting sites, and an insight into the CRONUS Foundation \u2014 including never-before-told stories of some of its more secret projects \u2014 this is the only book a dedicated digital Domehead will ever need.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe hum of a machine of unknown origin, deep beneath the shifting, singing sands. Undeciphered signals from the Tower, snatches of CB radio and a quiet guitar arpeggio in a sleepy roadside bar. In the hands and mind of the Mushroomer \u2014 composer for Pathologic 2 \u2014 the desert becomes music.\n\nA short story about the Dome\n\nCharlene Putney, writer on the renowned Divinity: Original Sin 2, spins a tale of the events that followed the discovery of the Dome.\n\nPortraits\n\nAn extended set of hand-drawn in-game avatars, exclusive to campaign backers.\n\nClosed alpha and beta access\n\nHelp test the alpha or beta versions of the game testing.

In random encounters, the game picks a random name from a database. Your nickname \u2014 on our approval \u2014 will be one of them.\n\nBaseball card\n  Pretty much everyone supports the Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise - at least until they lose - and the players\u2019 baseball cards are collected and traded across the Foundation. Recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent and application, under-performing gets you cut from the roster - and getting cut sees you sent into the Dome.\n\nLife Pass\n\nFree lifetime access to all projects released by Dark Crystal Games.\n\nDesign a non-generic NPC\n\nWork with the devs to build a character - come up with their name, appearance, and role in the story.\n\nPlayer portrait\n\nYour face here. We will add a character avatar drawn from your photo to the game, and also give you a digital copy of the image.\n\n\nAn episode of the story-based mini-game, dedicated to you\n\nGames are popular under the Dome too. Some of the miraculously preserved terminals house a popular text game, the hero of which bears your name. Coincidence?\n\nDevelopers stream\n\nWe\u2019ll join you on a livestream of the game, for your audience or ours.\n\nA cool in-game item, exclusive to and chosen by the backers\nA rare gun? Custom armor? An unusual combat stim? You, the backers, will decide. But remember, it won\u2019t break the game\u2019s balance. We\u2019re not that generous.\n\nPhysical Rewards explained\nBlue Wing Engineer t-shirt\nIn vivid antifreeze blue, this fine t-shirt is the favorite of CRONUS technical staff, from the lowliest technician to the chief engineer. While not standard issue, most Blue Wing employees have one. And now so will you.\nRogues baseball cap\nThe Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise is largely recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent, aggression, and a desire to avoid entering the Dome. Last year\u2019s was a winning season, and none of the players lost their places. But luck shifts like the sands, and this year may be different. And you, the fans, can be less than forgiving.\n Explorer hoodie\nThe desert is cold at night, so each CRONUS employee who must venture outside is issued with a sweatshirt. Soft and comfortable, it offers excellent protection against the cold, so at least you won\u2019t freeze to death while you die of radiation poisoning.\nCRONUS Badge\nPrinted Lorebook\nThis 70-page glossy volume contains all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within.

However, despite our experience and best efforts, there\u2019s always a chance that something will go wrong. \n\n1. Early access and release dates. All of the people on our team have already delivered commercially successful games on time and in great condition. However, no true professional will ever tell you, that he is fail-proof. There is always a chance Encased RPG will require to postpone it's set final release date. At least to get an extra coat of polish.\n\n2. We might have delays in delivering our reward promises. The reward delivery channels are extremely reliable, but, there's always a possibility that the reward delivery could be delayed due to technical issues.\n\n3. We are used to dealing with budgets large and small. Financially speaking, Encased RPG budget has been calculated precisely. We are also financing most of the game ourselves, calling community only to finance additional features.

Never leave your tripod behind again.\nA quick and simple setup will empower you to take full advantage of every photo opportunity....4 seconds and you\u2019re ready to go.\nWe got tired of carrying around heavy, bulky tripods that we never ended up using. Lumapod is specifically designed to be brought on all your adventures.\n Instantly capture and share your experiences in the moment.\nOf course a fast setup and ultra-compact design are great, but what good is a tripod if it isn\u2019t stable? We carefully selected premium materials like high-grade aluminum and kevlar ropes to ensure reliable stability.\nUse it with your Smartphone, GoPro, Mirrorless, DSLR Camera and more...\nEasily use it to snap a selfie and then quickly set it down to capture a self-portrait. Either way you can always be in the shot.\nWhen you\u2019re not in the photo, use it as a monopod to shoot lively Hyperlapses\nThere is more that separates Go85 and Go120 than just their heights (85cm & 120cm). We carefully optimized both models for specific demands.\nLumapod Go85 \nWe relentlessly designed Go85 to be as compact and lightweight as humanly possible without compromising on quality or performance. The result is a perfect travel buddy for your smartphone, GoPro and cameras that weigh up to 1kg / 2.2lbs.\nUnlike Go120, it does not have interchangeable legs. However, it is equipped with integrated terrain levelers to accommodate for those situations with uneven ground.\n Lumapod Go120\nGo120 has all the benefits of Go85 but with an overall larger height and build that will support cameras that weigh up to 2kg /4.4lbs.\nIn addition, Go120 has modular leg extensions which creates a wide-range of possibilities for adaptability. It currently comes standard with terrain leveling extensions.\nEasily turn your Go120 into a slider with the add-on dolly wheel extensions.\nOr utilize the stake extensions for soft grounds, sand and snow.\n                                             Breakdown - Choose Lumapod if you\u2019re looking for better speed, compactness, weight and the adaptability of different leg extensions. Choose a standard tripod if you need extra stability and additional terrain flexibility.\nLumapod is compact with more height, better stability and offers the benefit of having both tripod and selfie mode.\nLumapod offers the same selfie capability but with all the benefits of a stable tripod as well.\nHave you ever wondered why all tripods look the same? Is there really only one design that works? We challenged this theory and worked tirelessly to design Lumapod different.\nThere is a simple mechanical principle behind our design: replace compression parts (traditional legs) with tensioning components (Kevlar Ropes). Perhaps it\u2019s easier to understand when compared to something everyone knows:\nMuch like how the mast on a sailboat withstands wind with its tensioned ropes, we use the same theory to achieve stability. It\u2019s no rocket science but the key to our design is being able to lock and tension Lumapod in any position.\nLumapod\u2019s stability isn\u2019t just by luck. We did extensive research and testing to measure the vibrations and damping of many tripods. Our electro-mechanical test setup enabled us to optimize Lumapod and ensure it is as stable as possible.\n                                             Showing the bigger steps of lumapods development\nHey!

I'm back on Kickstarter now for my 6th international cookbook project. In 2012, I launched my first project with Kickstarter: The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures, followed by the German edition (Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden) in 2013. The series continued with English and German publications of: The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO (2014), SRI LANKA (2015), MALAYSIA (2016), and INDIA (2017).\nThis year I traveled to Ethiopia in the weeks before Easter \u2013 one of several special times of fasting, when the majority of the country eats entirely vegan! I explored the central cities, traveled overland to the north, went trekking in the highlands and stayed with families in remote villages. \nAs with all my travels and culinary research, I am extremely grateful for the privilege to learn, share & exchange, and be guided & supported by many families and professional cooks who invited me in their kitchens and shared amazing meals with me.\nSince returning to Berlin, I've been cooking Ethiopian and Eritrean food practically non-stop, recreating recipes and dishes, constantly inviting friends and guests to my cooking studio for lunch and dinner parties.\nAbebech showing me traditional village cooking in the Ethiopian Highlands.\nMaking injera with the family in Gonder, Ethiopia\nThe Lotus and the Artichoke - ETHIOPIA is my newest cookbook with original recipes, artwork, photography and stories inspired by these latest culinary adventures. It includes over 70 recipes based on the mouth-watering meals in bustling cities & towns, at road-stop eateries, and in rural highland villages.\nAs with my previous 5 cookbooks, I have written, illustrated, cooked, photographed, and designed this book myself.

Crowdfunding is an awesome adventure. I enjoy the interaction with supporters, other cooks, bloggers, travelers, Kickstarter backers, and people from all over the world that love to dream, and help others with their own dreams.\nIn 2013, a small, indie publisher in Germany contacted me about being a publishing partner. I soon started working with Ventil Verlag and The Lotus and the Artichoke joined the emerging Edition Kochen ohne Knochen series of vegan & vegetarian cookbooks. It's an incredible partnership, and I enjoy working with an alternative publisher that understands the struggles and challenges for independent authors.\nBeing with a small publisher, my production costs and expenses for writing, cooking, photographing, illustrating, and designing my own cookbooks are not really covered.\nI am passionate about my projects, and know they have a value for many people. I'm here on Kickstarter to ask for your support and involvement, to help continue and evolve The Lotus and the Artichoke project.\nKickstarter LIVE cooking show. 2016.\nTHE STORY of The Lotus and the Artichoke\nIn 2012, my first Kickstarter project The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Cookbook was successful with the help of over 360 amazing backers from around the world. It was my first cookbook in a developing series of books featuring my personal stories, photographs, artwork, and vegan recipes inspired by my travels and culinary experiences in 40 countries.\nIn December, the first edition of The Lotus and the Artichoke - Vegan Recipes from World Adventures was printed: 1000 copies in full color, featuring over 100 recipes and more than 90 full-page, mouth-watering photographs. The Lotus and the Artichoke quickly became an international sensation.\nAfter another successful Kickstarter project in 2013, The Lotus and the Artichoke \u2013 Vegane Rezepte eines Weltreisenden was translated and published in German \u2013 along with the second English edition.\nLater that year, I traveled to Mexico with my partner Julia and our young son Kolja, where we lived in a small town for 3 months, cooking (and surfing) with the locals. I documented our experiences and cooking adventures in my next book, The Lotus and the Artichoke - M\u00c9XICO which was published in English & German in 2014.\nThe following winter we spent 10 weeks exploring Sri Lanka. The Lotus and the Artichoke - SRI LANKA was published in 2015, following a sucessful third Kickstarter project with over 737 backers from more than 30 countries worldwide.\nI traveled around Malaysia, Singapore & Borneo for 5 weeks in early 2016 learning to cook traditional Malay, Chinese, and Indian dishes from the locals. The Lotus and the Artichoke - MALAYSIA was published that year, after another successful Kickstarter with support from all over the world.\nIn Autumn 2016 and Spring 2017 I went for my 7th and 8th trip to India to for six weeks of research and cooking on location in Kashmir, Ladakh, and the Northeast States. The Lotus and the Artichoke - INDIA was my most successful Kickstarter project, with support from 1,165 backers in over 40 countries.\nSince 2013 I have devoted almost all of my working hours to The Lotus and the Artichoke and other projects in the culinary field. In addition to writing my own cookbooks, I offer international vegan cooking classes, cooking demonstrations & shows, write recipes and do photography for other cookbooks and magazines. I also love to help others with translations, photography, design, and advice on their own projects \u2013 almost always dealing with art, travel, and food.\nLagos, Nigeria (World Veg Fest 2014)\nPRAISE for The Lotus and the Artichoke\n\"The Lotus and the Artichoke spiegelt Justins Erlebnisse und seine Liebe zum Reisen und Kochen so nahbar und umfassend wider, dass man so manches Mal meint, selbst dabei gewesen zu sein!\" \u2013 Nicole Just, Bestsellerautorin von La Veganista\n\u201cThe Lotus and the Artichoke shares Justin\u2019s love for cooking and world travel with such intensity and passion that you really feel like you were there!\u201d \u2013 Nicole Just, bestselling author of La Veganista\n\"Unser allerliebster verr\u00fcckter Weltreisender ist wieder da!\" \u2013 Nadine Horn & J\u00f6rg Mayer, Bestseller-Autoren von eat this!

"project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi there, adventurer! Looking for more dice in some unique designs and colors? You're in a good place!\nSome of you may already know that Q WORKSHOP is the manufacturer of some pretty unique RPG dice. We've been around for 14 years now, and we've produced so many dice sets that we've lost count already ;)\nThroughout the years we\u2019ve also created some dice designs that we loved but didn\u2019t make for various reasons: too many already scheduled releases, license ideas that just didn\u2019t work out, and so on. It hurt us deeply to have them hidden - and now we can finally give them a chance!\nWe're starting with 5 designs in one color version each. More to come!\nNo, these are not black blank dice ;) We will ask you to choose the design and color of the dice sets after the campaign ends - in our Pledge Manager. You've got time until then to decide!\nThe mat's format is B3 (353mm x 500mm, or 13.9in x 19.7in), and it's got Emil's awesome artwork on one side and a solid rubber on the other.\nAnd yes, you can also follow him on Instagram :)\nAlso, he's the guy who invented the famous April Fool's prank with the Furry dice.\nHere are some pictures of the real dice!\nThe Arcade dice feel the game! This is a real pic, not a render :)\nArcade Dice - real pic detail\nThe Bloodsucker dice all ready! Real pic, not a render\nBloodsucker dice - real pic detail\nAre you joining the fight? The Dragon Slayer dice are waiting!\nDragon Slayer - real pic detail\nHalloween dice - detail\nHalloween is comiiing! Real pic, not a render\nWizard Dice - charming already!\nWizard Dice - real pic detail\nChoose the Pledge Level - at this point, you only choose the quantity of the sets that you wish to order. They all have the same price. You'll choose the designs and colors in the Pledge Manager AFTER the campaign. You can pay the exact amount needed, or add an extra for some add-ons. You can also increase your pledge in any moment of the campaign.\nYou can get one additional die at no extra cost, if you subscribe to our newsletter here.\nIf you want to get some add-ons, you can change your pledge during the campaign - either by jumping to a different pledge level, or increasing the pledged amount.\nYour credit card will be charged after the campaign ends. Kickstarter then has up to 14 days to collect the payments, and after that it transfers the money to us so that we can start the production.\nWell, we've had some experience with it, and it is really a great place to be 100% sure that our product meets the customers' requirements. In this project, we just give you the options - and you tell us what you want. Isn't that the perfect solution?\nAlso, we just love the community feeling that arises around the campaign. There's some magic in it!\nOur dice are made of polymer: injection-molded and then painted. Each die is then polished and undergoes a thorough quality control.\nThe design is engraved in the dice, not just painted on the surface :)\nSo, you've found the most interactive section in this campaign! As the funding goal is not so high, we wanted to spice things up a bit and to offer you some opportunities to have fun.\nSo here they are - our Community Goals!\nYou'll find all the links in the buttons below!\nHow does it work?\nOnce a Community Goal is reached, the dice set with a specific design gets the matching dice bag. It's that simple.\nA maximum of 1 bag of each design will be added for free to each backer order.\nYou don't need to pay any extra cash or advise us in any way, we'll add the bags automatically to your order. If we manage to reach the goals only partially, (for example, we unlock 3 out of 5), only these sets will get their bags.\nSo, for example, if you order 3 sets (and let's assume that all bags are unlocked during the campaign), here's what happens:\n- if you choose to have 1 x Bloodsucker dice set, 1 x Wizard and 1 x Halloween Pumpkin, you'll get a matching bag for each one of those.\n- if you choose to have 3 x Bloodsucker dice sets, we'll only add 1 Bloodsucker bag to your order. You can also purchase the bag as a regular add-on, of course.\nThe unlocked bags will also appear as add-ons, so if you like them a lot, you can get more!\nYou'll find the link to the newsletter here.\nAlready subscribed to out newsletter? That's cool. We will compare the two databases after the campaign ends and if your e-mail is there, we will add the bonus D20 to your pledge.\n You can find them here :)\nAugust-September 2018 - campaign\nSecond half of September 2018 - campaign wrap-up: collecting pledges and importing the data to the Pledge Manager\nOctober 2018: filling out the info in the Pledge Manager\nNovember 2018 - January 2019: production\nFebruary 2019: fulfillment!\nFor our US backers: In the Pledge Manager you'll be able to choose between the more economical USPS shipping or more secure Fedex. Both shipping methods will have tracking available.\nThe shipping rates might go up depending on the final weight of the pledge and/or the add-ons that you add to your pledge.\nPlease bear in mind that these shipping rates are orientative only. The exact shipping rate will be charged in the Pledge manager after the campaign.\nAs with the previous campaign, we will organize the shipping for all US pledges from a US warehouse. The goal is to spare our backers the unnecessary customs fees. Once we know the exact quantity and weight of the packages, we will crunch the possibilities and decide on a one that is both reliable and fast.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've created and fulfilled two Kickstarter projects so far - the first one was fulfilled within a year, and the second one in seven months.

We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   \nIt's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. \nThis material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  \nUsing a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.\nHave a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  \nThe tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  \nAt Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  \nThe earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.\nIn 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  \nWhen we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.\n   Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.\nAdd it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  \nNeed less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  \nNever lose your pen again.   \n      They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  \n     We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.\nIn order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  \n   SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nMEDIA KIT HERE\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Single Pack", "descp": "Single Pack = 3 NanoPens.

This project was created as my own personal reminder, and to \"hang\" on to the memories that pushes us forward.   \n\" To all you fathers and fathers-to-be, and to all of you, who dedicate themselves to the coming generations.  This project is dedicated to you!\" \nHi Everyone!  In the blink of an eye, over 2 year's have gone by, and I find myself back here on Kickstarter once more. With this new project, I decided to go with something simple.  Titanium and EDCs are still my obsessions, so that's where the focus will be. I hope the design of the HANDGREY\u2122 KIN will strike a chord with you all.\nDESIGN PHILOSOPHY\nThe HANDGREY\u2122 KIN is my take on the simple key hook EDC, for your pocket, belts, belt loop, purse, messenger bag, or pretty much anything you want to hook your keys on to.\nI still rely on the bauhaus philosophy as my inspiration.  From then on, I let the lines and functions evolves.  The \"feel\" of the materials and the functions it serves, guides me toward the final outcome.  In this case, it  took on the design cues and curves, that harken back to the industrial era & machinery of the 1960s. \nWith a number of variations & iterations on the drawing board, I narrowed the final design to 2 different versions / models:  KIN {No.6}, and KIN {No.9}  \nThere are no functional differences between the 2, only aesthetics.  I like how the 2 models feel in my hands.  No.6 felt more modern, and streamlined, while No.9 felt more mechanical and succinct.  \nThis new series will retain my signature unibody design, with precision details. Each piece is individually cut via EDM WIRE-CUTTING technology, solely from Grade 5 / Ti-6Al-4V Titanium. This the most detailed and precise production method available.  It is very expensive, and usually reserved for prototypes and precision tooling only.  You can't get much better than this when it comes to cutting. \n FEATURES\nSimple hook with semi flexible spring clip\nExtra large inner clearance for hooking on thicker objects\nUnique micro-grip design to create a subtle grip.\nPremium Grade 5 / Ti6AL4V titanium \nSLOW EDM wire-cutting for the finest precision details\nCombination of Machine & Hand finishing, for best appearance\nHandgrey KIN + the ORBITKEY {canvas}\n        I will also be offering the pledges with the option of adding my Handgrey KNOX custom Titanium Key Ring.  This will be available to backers after the project ends.  \nHandgrey KNOX\nFINISHING\nI will be making the KIN in 2 finishes:\nSheen - Stone Tumbled Finish \nBright - Hand Brushed Finish\nStone tumbling comes in many different interpretation.  It sounds very simple, but quality finishes are very hard to nail down, and the machinery needed are very expensive.  It takes a lot of time to do quality work.  I strive to find the perfect balance that gives good results, with a faster production time. \nI prefer the natural color of Titanium above all else, simply because it's everlasting. It's the way nature made it. Anodization, and PVD / DLC coating are nice, but not very durable, no matter what the marketing says. I've worn through them all.   In the future, if I manage to find a better long lasting coating, or finishing process, I will offer a larger variation of final finishing for my design.  \nDedication ~ Fathers & Kings ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been around Kickstarters for nearly half a decade with numerous project. You don't last this long by not delivering. The 10,000+ backers from my previous projects will attest to this.\n\nThe only risk I can foresee realistically, is TIME. There are factors that are beyond my control, such as delivery time for raw materials or turn around from our EDM manufacturers. Things happen, machines break, shipments get lost, etc., but we have enough experience to minimize and mitigate these factors to ensure that the project is not significantly affected. I will also get started much earlier than I did on the last project just to be on the safe side.\n\nI will be working with the same EDM and machining specialist in Thailand that I have worked with the last 4 years. These GURUs know how I work, what I need from them, and that I mean what I say. So I will continue to have them do what they do best: Exceptional Quality Work!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "In the Loop", "descp": "Just want to be in the loop, and keep up with the project !", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["5 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 17 or more", "title": "Minos - Personalized / Stone Tumbled", "descp": "1 X Personalized MINOS - micro ID key tag for your EDC set up.

Transform regular mouth mason jars into a comfortable pouring pitcher without the mess!  Pour hot liquids safely!  Lift large jars easily!\nFirst invented and patented in 1858, the Mason jar is named after its inventor, John Landis Mason.  Originally used in home canning and preserving, the Mason jar has become ubiquitous due to its usefulness. The jar is used for drinking, storage, canning or crafts.  The one thing that sets the Mason jar apart is its standard mouth size.  The regular mouth Mason jar is 2.75 inches (6.985 centimeters) across the top.  The Ergo Spout will fit regular mouth Mason jars, from 12 ounces to half gallon volumes.\nThe Ergo Spout fits Mason jars whether they were recently manufactured or are of vintage age. This is only for regular mouth Mason jars. \nThe Ergo Spout with different sizes of jars.\nThe Ergo Spout has three physical parts:  \nThe lid is completely removable. It connects inside the spout, creating a hinge for flip-top functionality.\nThe main spout has a curved lip to reduce dripping and connects to a handle that is comfortable and non-slip.  \nA gasket is underneath where the jar comes into contact with the spout.  This provides a complete seal, so there is no leaking between the base of the spout and the top of the mason jar.  \nThe Ergo Spout could become your favorite kitchen tool because of its versatility.  Use it with pint jars to drizzle homemade salad dressings or breakfast syrups.  Add the Ergo Spout to a quart for easy pouring of juice or serving gravy to your crowd.  Attach one to your vintage half gallon jar to brew your sun tea or lemonade.\nThe Ergo Spout will be made of food-safe polypropylene, which is BPA and phthalates free.  The material provides the strength to lift heavy jars.  It will not warp in the high temperatures of the dishwasher and microwave.\nThe Ergo Spout solves three basic problems with Mason jars.  \nFirst, because Mason jars are glass, they become slippery when wet.  With the Ergo Spout you can avoid those slippery jars and pour without the risk of dropping it.  \nThe Ergo Spout also allows the possibility of pouring hot liquids such as syrup.  Because your hand need not come in contact with the jar, you can safely pour that hot syrup on your pancakes.  \nLast, the Ergo Spout prevents sticky drips down the side of the jar by guiding the liquid to the curved spout.  \nThe Ergo Spout makes for comfortable, safe pouring without the mess.\nWe have been showing off the Ergo Spout and its development on social media. We are so happy with the love the Ergo Spout has been getting.  Back us today to get your very own Ergo Spout for your kitchen.\nThe Ergo Spout will come in your choice of three colors: Vintage Blue, Classic White or Barn Red.\n                SHIPPING INFORMATION:\nFor those who live in the United States, shipping will be added to your pledge and charged upon successful completion of the campaign.\nInternational folks!  As of the launch date we have determined that we will be able to ship to the following other countries at the estimated shipping prices.  Shipping will not be charged as part of your pledge to Kickstarter, but instead will be charged after the campaign is complete and prior to shipping.\nCanada (estimated shipping ~$18 USD)\nU.K. (estimated shipping ~$25 USD)\nAustralia (estimated shipping ~$18 for 1 Ergo Spout, ~$25 USD for 2 or 3)\nIf you don't see your country listed, please contact us and we will review policies and costs for shipment to determine whether we will be able to add you to the list.\nIMPORTANT:  International shipping costs do not include custom fees, taxes, duties or other charges for the product to enter your country.  Please take into account any additional amounts that you may have to pay in order to receive the product and ensure that the imported product complies with your national and local laws.\nStretch Goal #1 Once we reach $30,000, we will add a fourth color option. Backers will be able to vote on this color choice. The top color by number of votes wins! Woot Woot!  \nStretch Goal #2 If we reach $50,000, we are adding two additional color options (for a total of six for the campaign)!  There will be a second round of voting with colors added from backer suggestions.\nStretch Goal #3 If we hit $70,000, we have a surprise for our backers.  We will reveal the surprise once we hit the $50,000 goal.  Don't worry, you're going to love it!\nWhen my oldest son was younger, he LOVED pancakes with syrup. It might be more accurate to say that he loved syrup with pancakes. We went though A LOT of syrup at our house.  \nMy mother-in-law had taught me how to make a simple syrup with maple flavoring. It became a family favorite because it's easy, delicious and economical. She also gave me a fancy syrup dispenser. I loved it and used it all the time. Until...  \nOne day I chipped the edge while washing it. I searched the internet for a replacement, but couldn't find one. \nThen came the light bulb moment: wouldn't it be great if there were a spout and handle for Mason jars!  I looked all over for that too, but couldn't find it.  My husband, Bryce, and I decided to make one ourselves. \nNow, after laboring over a ton of versions for the last 18 months, we finally have it ready to manufacture.  We are ready to bring you the Ergo Spout!\nWhy do you call it the Ergo Spout?  \n\nBecause of the unique ergonomic handle.  \nWhat about a wide mouth version?  \n\nDue to interest we have decided to launch the Wide Mouth Ergo Spout with it's own Kickstarter campaign.  After the design, engineering and prototyping is done we will be ready to launch.  Look for it Spring 2019! \nWhat will it be made of?  \n\nThe Ergo Spout will be polypropylene.  Polypropylene is a food safe, non-toxic, BPA-free and Phthalates-free plastic. It will also have a silicone grippy over mold on the handle.  \nIs it dishwasher and microwave safe?  \n\nYes. The plastic will not warp in the high heat of a dishwasher or a microwave.  \nIs it air tight or does it seal?  \nThe Ergo Spout includes a silicone gasket to make a complete seal between the jar and the base of the Ergo Spout. We are working to make it as spill-resistant as possible with our flip-top lid. \nIs it dripless?  \nThe spout's design reduces dripping and will help prevent drips down the side of the jar. \nAre there different colors available?  \nYes, we are offering it in Vintage Blue, Barn Red, and Classic White. We will offer another color as stretch goals.  If the campaign achieve a stretch goal of $30,000 Backers will get to vote on the extra colors.\n                                                     Do you like the Ergo Spout video?

And while most recommendations focus on how much water we need to drink, not enough is said about how often you should be sipping on your water. The frequency and even distribution of your water intake during the day is actually the key to preventing dehydration.   \nThe new EQUA Smart Water Bottle is here to take your water intake \u2013 and overall wellbeing \u2013 to the next level.\nIt glows every time you need to take a sip of water  \nOnce you\u2019re thirsty it\u2019s already too late. EQUA will make sure to send you regular reminders every time its needed in order to prevent your dehydration.\nKnows your optimal daily water intake\nYou\u2019re an individual and you need a personalised plan for your optimal water intake. EQUA\u2019s APP will do that for you and become your healthy lifestyle coach.\nTracks how much water you had\nOnce you start following your water intake you\u2019ll find that on the days when you reach your daily goal, you\u2019ll feel more energised and more friends will comment on your glowing skin.\nCommunicates with you, even without the use of your phone\nA gentle tap on the bottle will reveal how well you are doing - with a slow glow if you\u2019re on track or a quick glow if you need to catch up.\nA companion mobile app for the EQUA Smart Water Bottle will help you keep close track of your hydration. The app recommends your daily water intake according to your body characteristics and lifestyle. It tracks your water intake and offers you an insight look in your hydration habits and analytics. You can also control the frequency of glow reminders on the bottle that will remind you when you need a sip of water.\nHelp us spread the word about EQUA Smart Water Bottle among your family and friends. We will randomly choose 100(!!) of you that\u2019ll share our campaign on Facebook, Instagram or Twitter and thank you with a free personalisation of your new EQUA bottle (please see FAQ section for terms & conditions).\nCombining smart technology with a sleek, attractive design, EQUA is crafted in three color options: Snow White, Dark Grey and Pink Blush.\nUsing EQUA bottle will not only have an amazing impact on your wellbeing, but will drastically improve your environmental impact. While bottled waters are conveniently available at our every step, too often we\u2019re not aware of the scary fact that plastic has been mass produced only since 1950\u2019s but we already have a mere 9.2 billion tons of plastic waste to deal with. A switch from disposable to reusable water bottle is a simple step with a big impact!\nThere are many possibilities how to measure your water intake with the help of the bottle and the app. For us the real challenge was to build the right technology with the best user experience. Our goal was to make the hardware part small, durable, functional and packed in a beautiful design. Our choice of technology was the motion sensor (accelerometer). The accelerometer is able to recognize your movements and calculate the amount of water you drink.\nHow it works?\nPLAY\n\nThe main innovation is in its software. We have developed a clever algorithm to understand specific bottle movements. We then use machine learning technology to translate these movements into useful data.

We've been developing award-winning products that push the boundaries of ergonomic mouse design and function for over a decade. This is our third Kickstarter, and thanks to our incredible supporters, we've previously raised over a million dollars in pledges - bringing our products to life.      \nWe\u2019ve gone back to the drawing board on our ergonomic pen grip mouse (Swiftpoint GT), improved everything that people loved, and added more innovative features. We're starting production and are super excited to announce Generation 3 of our pen grip mouse, called ProPoint\u2122\nKickstarter Exclusive Bundle - unbelievable value! \nWe want to launch the product with a huge splash and reward our early supporters. So to get it into as many hands as possible to spread the word, we\u2019ve put together a bundle that is surely the craziest and best offer Kickstarter has ever seen (short of giving it away!)\nUPDATE: Due to the amazing support, we've also been able to include a USB-C to USB adapter, free of charge to ALL backers!\nDouble up, and save even more...\n                                      Do you feel discomfort from your current mouse, or know someone who does?  \nWhether it's relieving current strain or pain, or prevention before it becomes an issue, your health is important...\nUltimate Travel Mouse \nIf you\u2019re sitting on a sofa with your laptop, in a cafe, on a plane, or in a train or bus - this is where ProPoint\u2122 shines - you can use it right on your laptop palmrest.  \nWhen you need to walk to a meeting or your next class, just close your laptop and attach your Propoint\u2122 to the magnetic parking spot on the lid.\nYou can connect via Bluetooth, or with the USB receiver (which also charges the mouse). \n                                Take Command of your Presentations\nNot only is ProPoint\u2122 the most comfortable mouse in the world, but with our gyro technology it's also a \u201cpresenter\u201d - meaning it\u2019s actually two devices in one.\nStand tall with the ProPoint\u2122 in-hand, and flick the switch to transform it into the ultimate presenter device. \nNavigate your slides and lead your audience through your presentation with the virtual laser pointer, you can even draw on the screen to highlight what matters most.\n...not only a mouse, it's also a presenter device\nFinally! A mouse for your iPad\nPrecision and Gestures for Designers & Power Users \nProPoint\u2122 not only gives you the full functionality of a three-button mouse and scrollwheel but, with our unique gyroscope technology, it opens up a new world of tilt gestures for panning, zooming and rotation.\nUnlike other mice that use the scrollwheel for middle mouse clicks, ProPoint\u2122 has a dedicated 3rd mouse button that\u2019s easy to click.\nYou can assign separate functions to all three buttons when the device is tilted, so there\u2019s actually 6 button actions right at your fingertips. Assign shortcuts to the tilt gestures, like app switching, and the actions you use the most. \nIn office programs like Word and Excel, use tilt gestures to effortlessly flick up / down, or even left / right. \nIn design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, flick to the area you need to work on - without even pressing a button. \nIn 3d modeling programs, use tilt-gestures to effortlessly rotate, zoom and pan.\nPropoint\u2122 is the ultimate tool for designers and power users, in the office or on the go.\n                                   Tech Specs\nWe kept all the things people loved about Swiftpoint GT ...\nWe improved everything, and packed in even more innovative features ...\nOur Story \nWe\u2019ve been developing revolutionary products for almost 15 years and have a unique design ethic that starts with a clean slate, followed by an analysis of every minute detail of how we interact with our devices to complete daily computing tasks. \nWe put our designs and concepts through countless cycles of user testing and refinement - this gives us a deep understanding of ergonomics, efficiency, and intuitiveness, to create truly unique and innovative products.  \nWe're not only an ideas company, our team has decades of experience in manufacturing, production, sales, and logistics, and we've shipped tens of thousands of products to every country in the world.\nEverything we do is about making innovative and robust tools made to the highest build quality that we\u2019re proud to put our name on. Devices that make peoples lives easier and more enjoyable.\nLast year we launched \u2018The Z\u2019 - a gaming mouse that was voted gaming innovation of the year by CES.\nBefore that, we launched our ergonomically designed pen-grip mouse the \u2018Swiftpoint GT\u2019, which went on to become computer peripheral of the year.\nNow we\u2019re launching ProPoint\u2122 which is our next generation Swiftpoint GT device.
