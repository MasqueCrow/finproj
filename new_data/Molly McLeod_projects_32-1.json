[{"backer": "Molly McLeod", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "STRIKE! is a strategic, cooperative, and beautifully-illustrated board game for 2 - 4 players about building a city-wide rebellion to stop a mega-corporation's takeover. It was created in a collaboration between The TESA Collective, a publisher of games about changing the world, and Jobs with Justice, a leading labor rights organization.\nWe support the workers of Kickstarter who are fighting for a union! See our statement of support below.\nHappyCorp, the richest company in the world, has just unleashed its most diabolical plan yet: turning Mercury City into an entirely corporate-run metropolis. From the schools to the sidewalks, everything will be owned and run by HappyCorp, and every resident will become a HappyCorp employee. There will be no more minimum wage, no more public services, and no more unions. HappyCorp has already begun unleashing its Smile Drones to convert the city\u2019s infrastructure, crush protests, and ensure every resident watches its Commercial Breaks.\nPlayers take on the role of the Strike Council to lead a city-wide rebellion against HappyCorp\u2019s takeover, while also fighting for better livelihoods for all. Players will grow their ranks, mobilize their workers, and lead strikes around Mercury City. As the Strike Council scores victories for workers, they will gain the support of more allies, from the steelworkers to the teachers, and build new bases of support from the manufacturing district to the university.\nSo do you have what it takes to lead the worker rebellion to defeat HappyCorp? Or will you soon be a smiling employee of HappyCity? \n STRIKE! features beautiful artwork and visual designs by T.L. Simons. \nThe game will sell for $45 plus shipping after this Kickstarter campaign. But you can get it now for $35 plus discounted shipping by supporting this campaign!\n\nHere\u2019s what comes in each copy of STRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion:\nPlease note: This is a prototype. Some of the final components may look different than what is displayed here and some of the exact numbers may change.\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion is a cooperative game: all players are on the same team, fighting against HappyCorp. Players collectively win by completing enough STRIKE! cards to score 15 victory points, and thereby abolishing HappyCorp from their city.\nHappyCorp, like any nefarious corporation, can win in multiple ways: by scoring 15 victory points of its own, or by deploying all five of its MegaDrones across the city.\nAccessible and Strategic Gameplay\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion has a short rulebook. However, the combination of cooperative gameplay, eight unique characters, as well as a tough opponent in HappyCorp, makes this a highly strategic game!\nExperienced game players should be able to understand the gameplay behind STRIKE! relatively quickly, while novice gamers should be able to pick it up within a few turns. The unique characters and different difficulty settings will let you play over and over again!\nEight Unique Characters\nAt the start of each game, players choose one of eight characters to play. Each character has unique powers and stats, giving them different ways to strategize.\n For example, Valentina can disassemble Smile Drones three times on her turn, meaning she\u2019s great at challenging HappyCorp. Skyler, on the other hand, can grow ranks three times per turn, meaning she can quickly organize large strikes.\nTurns\nEvery turn, players will spend four action cubes in order to complete STRIKE! Cards and halt HappyCorp\u2019s takeover of their city. \nFour action cubes being used on a character board.\nPlacing actions on your player board allows you to add new strikers to the board, move your strikers around the city, disassemble HappyCorp's drones, and complete requirements on STRIKE! cards to score points.\nThe blue and orange players grow their ranks, and then team up in a location to kick drones out of that space and complete a STRIKE!\nPlayers can also recruit workers from other industries across the city, from the teachers to the steelworkers, to grow their strikes and take powerful actions.\nHappyCorp: Commercial Breaks, Drones, and MegaDrones - Oh my!\nAt the end of each turn, HappyCorp will force you to draw a Commercial Break card. These will do bad things for the Strike Council: such as remove Strikers from the board, cause players to lose energy, and deploy HappyCorp\u2019s drones throughout the city. \n But worst of all is HappyCorp\u2019s dreaded MegaDrones. Whenever three regular drones are in a location together, they fuse into one humongous MegaDrone! The creation of a MegaDrone causes HappyCorp to score one point for each MegaDrone in a shared color, and it blocks the players from completing strikes in that location.\nA MegaDrone is created!\nSolidarity Forever: Cooperation & Teamwork in STRIKE!\nEvery facet of gameplay in STRIKE! is based around teamwork and cooperation. These are some of the key cooperative game features:\nEveryone is one the same team and must strategize together: win together, or lose together.\nEvery character\u2019s special powers can benefit other players. Play as Hamza the student, and focus on boosting your teammate's energy. Or play as Candace the Firefighter to help strategically dispatch other players' strikers around the board.\nCombine your Strikers in locations to score more points.\nAnd more! \n Want to preview the rulebook? You can do so here! Want to see a gameplay preview? Check out the video below!\nMany workers at Kickstarter are currently working to organize a union and have faced opposition from Kickstarter management. This Kickstarter campaign completely supports the efforts of the workers, as we rely on the labor that runs this platform!\nThe Kickstarter union has asked creators to continue launching campaigns on Kickstarter and for people to continue supporting campaigns on Kickstarter. They have stated that their unionization effort is to support the workers, creators, and backers who make Kickstarter possible. As in all cases, we follow the lead of those people building the movement and we thank them for their courageous stand. So let's make this not just a Kickstarter campaign, but a labor campaign too: Here's how you can stand with the workers of Kickstarter, in their own words. Also, you can share this campaign with the message that you support the workers of Kickstarter.\nFinally, we'd love if you also want you left a comment on this campaign page about how you support the Kickstarter union!\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion is completely and unabashedly a pro-labor rights game. This is a game about building the power of working people and taking on a mega-corporation. In addition to supporting the workers of Kickstarter, we also teamed up with one of the country\u2019s leading labor-rights organizations to make it: Jobs with Justice.\nThe idea for STRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion was born out of conversations between Jobs with Justice (JWJ). TESA and JWJ worked on every step of the game together, from the conceptual concepts, to the world building, the game design, and playtesting. This is a game about, by, and for the labor movement.\nTESA playtesting an early prototype of STRIKE! over video chat with Jobs with Justice.\nThere are a number of different ways to support STRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion, and you will get exciting rewards in return. The first four reward levels are primarily tailored to individuals, and the last three are primarily tailored for organizational support! Check them out on the right side of this campaign page on desktop or click the Rewards tab on mobile.\nStarting at the first reward level ($35 + discounted shipping), you can get STRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion: \nAnd in addition, at the higher levels, you can also get these awesome rewards for a discounted price:\nOne or both of these awesome shirts. (Union-made.) You'll tell us which one(s) you want after the campaign is over. They are both unisex: \n\nAnd TESA's other games, such as Space Cats Fight Fascism:\nAs well as Rise Up: The Game of People & Power:\nAnd our other games!\nIn addition, if you're part of an organization, at the higher levels you can get shout-outs in the rulebook and game box!\nNow that we've reached our initial funding goal of $22,000, we are announcing exciting stretch goals. These are additional funding goals that will allow us to add even more features to the game if we reach them. Below are our first two stretch goals:\n We have reached this goal and it is unlocked: We are adding four additional \"Allies\" with unique powers to the Ally Deck! Our backers will vote on who the additional allies are at the end of this campaign. Read more about this stretch goal in this update. \nSince we have reached $35,000, we will create a free custom character generator! This means you will be able to upload a picture, fill out a form, and print and download a custom character. You, your friends, family, and co-workers can all play STRIKE! as yourselves!  Read more about this stretch goal in this update.  \nBecause we've reached $40,000, then we will be adding more pieces of unique art to the Commercial Break deck - bringing the nefarious but hilarious HappyCorp further to life! Read more about this stretch goal in this update.   \n If we reach $45,000, then we increase the size of the board by 1.5'' x 1.5'' - we're calling this our \"HappyCorp Size Board.\" This will increase the playing area for each of the city's 12 locations and make the unique city art for each district pop even more! Read more about this stretch goal in this update. \nHere are some nice things people are saying about STRIKE!\nAs soon as STRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion was done, I was ready to play again. The theme and mechanics blended together smoothly and with intention. My favorite part of the game is how empowered I felt helping the labor movement take down HappyCorp. To be fair, that theme aligns with my core values, but I think the game does a great job helping you personify yourself as the underdog going up against behemoth, which anyone can get behind. The cards' flavor text had a nice balance of humor and real-world commentary on the problems that giant corporations create. Can't wait for the release!\n-Matt Milkowski, public school teacher\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion finds the perfect balance of strategic, cooperative gameplay and rich narrative. Gorgeous artwork and thoughtful, humorous flavor introduces levity to a typically daunting topic; creating new entry points for creativity, conversation, and fun.\n-Vanessa Fernandez, labor organizer\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion is fast-paced, it's tons of fun, and it raises awareness about the value of worker solidarity and collective action. What's not to love??\n-Eli Kurtz, game designer \nAnd here are nice things people are saying about our other games:\n\"Rise Up is a blast for the gameplay alone. The cooperative element added a layer of novelty for even this hardened gamer nerd...\"\n-Jessica Stites, Executive Editor, In These Times magazine\n\u201c3.5 out of 4 stars!\u201d\n- Chapo Trap House Podcast on Space Cats Fight Fascism \nOur games have also been featured in Mashable, YES! Magazine, iO9, Fast Company, The Guardian, Waging Nonviolence, and more.\nIn addition to getting the game for $10 off the normal price by backing this game through this campaign, we\u2019re offering $5 off shipping: Shipping on all packages for the United States is $9. Shipping for all packages to Canada are $15. Shipping to the United Kingdom and the European Union is $19. Shipping to the rest of the world for all packages is $29.\nSome countries outside of the United States charge customs fees for packages received from the United States. Please be aware that that this campaign does not cover that cost. \nWe brought together a fantastic team to design the world, gameplay, and aesthetic style of this game:\nSTRIKE! The Game of Worker Rebellion is the fifth game published by the TESA Collective. Our game design team has a strong track record of developing and fulfilling well-received games that are fun and thoughtful. Following in the footsteps of our previous releases, including Rise Up: The Game of People & Power as well as Space Cats Fight Fascism, we will continue our tradition of merging cause and play with this game about labor rights and worker empowerment.\nJobs With Justice is leading the fight for the rights of working people and for an economy that benefits everyone. They are the only nonprofit of their kind leading strategic campaigns and shaping the public discourse on every front to build power for working people. Jobs With Justice is committed to working nationally and locally, on the ground and online.

By responding to four prompts with any combination of 85 words you'll get unstuck and discover new ideas for your next step \u2014 all in under 20 minutes. \nHave you felt it? Life seems especially tricky these days.\nThe average person today will experience over thirty major transitions over the course of their lifetime. Oof...that's a lot.     \nReal footage of someone after high school, after college, and throughout their career.\nYou face big (and small) challenges everyday.\nTo make matters harder, you live in a world that feels increasingly messy \u2014 from global issues, to business challenges, to personal growth & development.    \nSo what's *worth* doing?\nHow do we face the question that looms over all of these challenges? How do we decide what's worth doing? \nWE'RE MAKING A DECK OF CARDS TO HELP!\nWhat's Worth Doing uses a simple hexagon shape to help you create a mind map around three main questions:\nWhat challenges do you want to address?\nWhat kind of people do you enjoy working with?\nWhat do you like to make?   \nYou'll be challenged to sort through 75 cards quickly and then draw connections across your mind map to see what types of interesting and meaningful projects you might do next. The cards help you navigate transitions and dive deeper into your work by designing small projects that allow you to learn, grow, and change your world for the better.\nAt the end, your final step will be to sort through the ten BOOSTER cards \u2014 resources you might need next to actually make your idea come to life.\nHOW TO PLAY?\nYou can play it solo, with friends, colleagues, students, neighbors \u2014 really anyone who's interested in...you know...life.\nWHO IS IT FOR + WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?\nWe've tested the deck with over 200 people, which has led to deep discussions, personal epiphanies, and meaningful discoveries \u2014 all in less time than an episode of Blackish. Here are a few of the people that found the deck especially useful and what they've said about What's Worth Doing:\n + Educators \n\"I'm going to revamp our capstone course around this deck! Students can research the people/professions and the challenges \u2014 then design projects to complete by the end of the semester.\" \n + Team Leaders\n\"A helpful way to draw new connections across teams and discuss helpful solutions to the problems we actually care about.\"\n + Coaches & Counselors\n\"Playful, collaborative, easy to use/explain, and fun to pull out and use with my clients. We had new breakthroughs within the first 20 minutes!\"\n + Academic Advisors \n\"A helpful discussion-starter for students  to think about and test what's possible after college.\"\n+ Parents\n\"Now I know how our family is going to plan our summer projects!\"\n+ College Students\n\"I was drawing new connections that I'd never thought of! I have a much better idea for what I need to do and who I need to connect with before I graduate.\"\n+ Career Professionals\n\"I've been feeling stuck. Needing to try something new, but just on the side. These were just what I need to discover projects I could begin right away!\"\nActual photo of someone who used What's Worth Doing.\nHOW DID THIS COME TO BE?\nOh hey there. My name is Victor and I'm the founder of Experience Institute, a Lecturer at Stanford, and co-owner of Brand Deck. \nIn 2012, I was at my own crossroads. I needed more education, or so I thought. But the options were too expensive and more school just wasn't a fit for me. So I decided to design my own masters through 12 projects in 12 months, all over the world. I called it the Leap Year Project.\nThat year changed my life. So I started an organization focused on helping students and career professionals from all backgrounds navigate their own life transitions .\nTransitions between school and the workplace. Between one job and the next (the average American today will have no fewer than 12 jobs over the course of their life). Between one career and the next. Between one important project to the next important project. During these conversations, we\u2019d ask:\nWhat kinds of challenges do you want to work on? What issues in the world excite or frustrate you?\nHow do you like to work? What activities do you enjoy? What do you like to make? \nWhat kinds of people do you want to be around and work alongside?\nWe all need a starting point, something that help us begin to see through the fog of endless possibilities and expectations. This is especially true in times of transition. So after having many of these conversations, we started developing this simple visual:  \nWe found that this simple visual is incredibly helpful in framing the most important considerations. It led people to identify unique opportunities that exist in the overlap of all three circles\u2014AKA, their starting point.\n Inspiration for Design & Gameplay \nWhen working on how to create the initial design and gameplay, we leaned heavily on a product designed by Scott Thomas called Brand Deck. The simple nature of the sorting exercise for a grand life question was compelling. Our original designs were very similar: poker cards and minimal designs.\nBut we wondered how to incorporate the venn diagram above. Could the cards connect? Or overlap? Should there be a game board? \nWe kept hitting snags. So we paused design, went on a trip, and then came back with the idea to change the SHAPE of the cards. And the hexagon gameplay was born. Though the cards don't overlap, the ability to \"connect\" your responses helps to embed the idea that your interests, abilities, and community can be mixed into any number of possible projects and next steps. Seeing them together is where the new discoveries emerge. \nLogistics, Team, and Timeline\nThe team behind What's Worth Doing has spent the past seven years designing books, tool kits, and cards that have been shipped around the world. We already have the majority of the designs for What's Worth Doing, a fantastic printer, and a fulfillment operation that can handle any number of orders. \nThe timeline will look like this:\n October 17th | Close Campaign\n End of October | Send final files to printer\n Mid-November | Receive proofs\n Early-January | Receive Cards\n February | Ship cards to YOU!\n\nWhy Kickstarter? \nWe love Kickstarter. This community has helped us produce projects that are now in the hands of thousands of students, educators, and career professionals. We think this is the fastest and best way for us to get these cards into your hands and make improvements as a community. With you, we think we can make it even better. \nSo with all of the hexagonal goodness this page can muster, please back this Kickstarter and let's make this happen!\nThank you!\n- The Experience Institute team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrinting hexagon cards and a hexagon box will slow down production because it's not the standard card shape.

What will happen to his family? Will his grieving father be okay? And was it really a monster? In Lake Merritt? Is that even possible?\nOllie\u2019s wanderings lead him to investigate the lake and its mythical monster, and he quickly learns that the creature has been feeding on the city\u2019s homeless.\nDesperate to discover the truth about his mother\u2019s disappearance and save others in Oakland from a similar fate, Ollie sets out to find the monster. He\u2019s joined by his crew of friends:\n Hiero: The Persian Mad scientist trying to build the mother of all laser cannons.\n App:  The Mexican vlogger using her coding ability to lift her family out of homelessness. \n HAM: The Metallica loving, chariot building, Pinoy whose family harbors a secret about the Lake Merritt monster.\nOllie and his crew\nThe four friends embark on an urban adventure through Oakland to hunt down the monster using scientific expertise, their own cultural knowledge and their deep friendship. They are on a mission to solve what happened to Ollie's mom, and to save the City they love. \nTOWN BIDNESS: WHY MAKE THIS MOVIE?\nBenjamin Mulholland created the film to capture the essence of a changing Oakland from a city of color to a bastion of wealth. He has worked at the intersection of people and politics for over twenty years, working mostly in public television. In 2018, he was appointed a residency with the SFFilm where he researched monsters and legends from various cultures and married them to the myths of his hometown.\nTrue to his own personal experiences, the film is a right of passage story for urban youth centered around the leap from boyhood to manhood. The story is as much a tale about the Town as it about Ben\u2019s own personal story.\nSimilar to Ollie, the film\u2019s protagonist, Ben\u2019s mother disappeared when he was a pre-teen. This coupled with a disjointed relationship with his own father in his youth inspired the story.\nThe film explores the beauty and the problems of Oakland. It is a tale of two cities, but also a tale of the resilience of Oakland's citizens and a right of passage film for Oakland's youth. It\u2019s not just kids in the suburbs that get to enjoy the adventures of Stranger Things or be a Goonie. It\u2019s time for the kids of Oakland to have their moment, too.\nThe Short of it\nTHE SHORT OF IT IS...\nSeveral film production companies and studios are interested in a feature-length version of the film, but the hurdle we need for a proof of concept short film that will show our characters, our vision and our ability to pull it all together.\nThe short film will be a prequel to the feature film. It will show Ollie beginning his search for the monster in an adventure filled with dreams, legends, and mysterious creatures. The short will naturally serve as the primary vehicle for getting the feature film financed and made. \nSo we've come to you, the kickstarter community, to help us make that happen.\nPLAY\n\nConcept Art - The Manananggal\nConcept Art - Abiyoyo\nConcept Art - Enso Sideshow\n\nThe Lake Merritt Monster Movie Enamel Pin!

And even though the human species has long since been forgotten, the darkest parts of their history have not.\nA rising wave of fascism is sweeping across the galaxy, threatening to throw the Interspecies Galactic Alliance under autocratic rule. To help grow its power, the regime known as The Rat Pack has convinced the powers that be that all cats must be tightly controlled... or forced into feline exile. But everyone knows, cats don\u2019t like to be collared, and they don\u2019t like to be caged.\nAnd so the feline rebellion begins, led by Ophelia (the freedom fighter), Rocket (the medic), Sky (the pouncer), and Pepper (the smuggler). Together, they can stop these fascist forces from seizing power - while building a new galaxy where all species are free together.\nSpace Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game where you play as a band of rebel cats trying to stop fascists from taking over the galaxy. Think Star Wars meets Cats the Musical! It is for 2 - 4 players and takes roughly 45 - 60 minutes to play.\n\"Space Cats Fight Fascism is a card game with a great name and an even better mission.\" - io9\nIn Space Cats Fight Fascism, you\u2019ll hop from planet to planet, scratching away at fascist forces and freeing animals pinned under the fascists\u2019 claws.\nLiberate the Planets \nThe resistance kneads your help! Space Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game \u2014 all players win and lose together. Your goal is to liberate four planets before the fascists take control of the Interspecies Galactic Alliance. You'll have to strategize to liberate one planet of each type: Whiskers, Tails, Paws, and Ears. \nYou\u2019ll use cards from your hand to build up the animal resistance on the twelve different home worlds. Once the Resistance has at least four liberation tokens on a planet, you will place a Liberated flag there! \nWhen four planets have become liberated, the fascists have been defeated by the Resistance, and the animals of the galaxy rejoice!\nThe Rat Pack Strikes Back\nBut watch out, because the fascists are always right on your tail! With cards like Anti-Cat Propaganda and The Fascists Use Laser Pointers to Distract Us!, they\u2019ll try to wrestle back control of liberated planets while occupying even more planets to cement their power. The Fascists can win the game in one of three ways: by placing three Occupied flags on the board, by getting every single fascist onto the board, or by gaining too much power on the Fascism Scale.\nMaking Tough Choices on Your Turn \nEveryone knows Space Cats won\u2019t just sit on their haunches while vermin try to take over. Each player gets three actions on their turn, which can consist of a combination of leaping from one planet to another, removing a fascist token from the board, restocking cards from the Resistance Deck, and playing Resistance cards from their hand. Resistance cards give you extra powerful effects, such as adding liberation tokens to your current planet, teleporting across the galaxy, healing scratches from yourself and your fellow cats, learning new cat paw-ers, and more.\nUse tactics that come naturally to cats.\nAnd while there are so many ways to free the galaxy, there\u2019s so little time. So stop shedding all over your crash couch and blast off in your rocket ship instead, because you\u2019ll have to make difficult choices on your turn. If you don\u2019t remove scratches from your cat, you'll risk gaining too many of them, which will hinder your rebellion. Should you teleport to the planet that\u2019s on the verge of becoming occupied by fascists, or do you want stay where you are and liberate your home world? Then again, if you don\u2019t restock soon, you\u2019ll run out of the Resistance Cards you need to fight for the resistance!\nHow Fascism Grows Stronger\nIn space, no one can hear you meow: At the end of your turn, you will have to roll multiple dice, which will either add more Fascists or remove liberation tokens from the galaxy.\nHowever, the Space Cats can pin the Fascists down. For each Fascist Token you\u2019ve removed from the board on your turn, you\u2019ll get to roll one less die.\nIn this way, deciding when to reduce the number of Fascists on the board and when to add more Liberation tokens is a delicate balance. Without adding Liberation tokens to the planets, the Fascists will take over by reaching the end of the Fascism Scale. However, if you simply focus on adding Liberation tokens and don\u2019t take on the Fascists directly, their power will grow at a rate you won\u2019t be able to stop.\nBuild Your Cat Paw-ers \nEach cat starts with one base ability, such as: Pouncer, Medic, Smuggler, and Freedom Fighter. But players can also add new powers to their cats throughout the game, like \u201cSharp Claws,\u201d \u201cCough Up Hairballs,\u201d \u201cStolen Fascist Plans,\u201d and \u201cRescued Animals.\u201d These will create combinations of effects that allow you to fight fascism in new ways. The decisions you make about the powers you adopt will make each game different than the last! So even if you have nine lives to play, every game will be unique. \nBuild fun and powerful combos!\nA New Setup to the Galaxy Each Time You Play! \nEach game of Space Cats Fight Fascism has a random setup! When you lay out the game, you\u2019ll shuffle the cards in the Planets Deck, which make up the board. Then you\u2019ll randomly put out the cards, influencing how you strategize to win. Will you work to Liberate only one corner of the galaxy, or will you spread out like you\u2019re taking a nap in a sunbeam to fight fascism across every world? \n  Fascist Strongholds\nFour planets are Fascist Strongholds. When Fascists gain power there, players will have to draw a Galactic News Card, which have additional negative effects!\nThe fascists will grow their power through their militias, laws, and propaganda.\nA sample \"Galactic News\" card!\nWork Together, Win Together!\nSpace Cats Fight Fascism is a cooperative game, which means players will have to strategize together by using their resources and unique powers. Every cat-stronaut will have an important role to play, and it\u2019ll take a team effort to stop the fascists from taking over!\nBe legendary lions and pounce into action right away! Or, take a little time to rest up for the rebellion.\n\nThis is what comes with your copy of Space Cats Fight Fascism! Including the rulebook and a card that reminds players what they can do on their turn, you'll get: \nYou can preview the instruction booklet here! Please note, this is a pre-design copy of the rulebook. We will use funds from this Kickstarter to make the rulebook beautiful and professionally designed, as well as edited for consistency, clarity, and typos. \nWe\u2019re excited about all the rewards we can offer you for supporting Space Cats Fight Fascism on Kickstarter! These include getting a copy of the game, playing the game with a custom character card of your cat, and even getting your cat illustrated onto a card in the base game! Check out the reward tiers below.\n At this level, you\u2019ll receive one copy of Space Cats Fight Fascism!\nEverything you need to save the galaxy comes in this box!\nAt this level, you\u2019ll get one copy of the game and the Secret Meowssions Expansion Pack! You\u2019ll also get two additional cat characters to play in the game!\nSecret Meowssions is an expansion that adds new elements to the base game of Space Cats Fight Fascism, for those who want to extend their gameplay and strategize in new ways. In this expansion, cats will have additional missions that they have to complete, without the fascists finding out what you are up to! These meowssions will include freeing captured animals of the resistance, seizing a fascist space station, distributing food to hungry animals, and more. If the cats are able to complete these meowssions, they\u2019ll get major rewards, such as gaining the support of local animals, new tools to fight the fascists, extra actions on your turn, and more. But if the fascists uncover your plans, there will be serious consequences...\nThis level will also come with two bonus Space Cat characters with unique paw-ers: Buzzy and Amelia. Buzzy\u2019s ability is Lunar Scout, which allows him to travel to moons and gain extra resources for the resistance. Amelia\u2019s ability is Laser Eyes, which allows her to smoother the fascist Rat Pack.\nThese two bonus characters will be able to be played both with the base game and with the Secret Meowssions Expansion.\nAt this level, you\u2019ll get everything above, plus, you will be able to play the game as your own cat!\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will submit a photo, which we will then turn into a custom character sheet and a playable token that you will receive. You will also be able to choose your cat\u2019s ability from a set of existing options (such as pouncer, smuggler, freedom fighter, and more), ! Finally, you will be able to either select from an existing set of short descriptions for your custom character, or you can write a new one! You may also choose either an existing background story from the game for your cat, or you can write your own.\n(If you want to have another pet instead of a cat as a custom character, you can choose to do so. You\u2019ll just have to be okay with them doing cat-like things!)\nYou\u2019ll get all the above, but you will also get a second custom character! Play the game as both of your cats, or share the fun with a friend or family member! \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will submit a photo for each cat, which we will then turn into custom character sheets and playable tokens that you will receive. You will also be able to choose your cats' abilities from a set of existing options (such as pouncer, smuggler, freedom fighter, and more). You may also choose either an existing background story from the game for your cats, or you can write your own.\nYou\u2019ll get all the above, but you will also get four custom cat characters! Play the game with up to four of your own cats or other pets! Don't have four cats? Share the fun with your friends and family! \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign ends, you will submit a photo for each cat, which we will then turn into custom character sheets and playable tokens that you will receive. You will also be able to choose your cats' abilities from a set of existing options (such as pouncer, smuggler, freedom fighter, and more). You may also choose either an existing background story from the game for your cats, or you can write your own.\nIn addition to all of the above, you can also have one of your cats or other pets illustrated into one of the cards in the game! And while this game is mostly about cats, other animals are on their side and fighting fascism too. You can have a dog, bird, horse, guinea pig, or any other pet illustrated into a card in the game! They might be recruiting animals to the resistance, stealing a spaceship from the fascists, taking part in an uprising, or doing another heroic deed! \nSo this:\nBecomes this!\nThe art in Space Cats Fight Fascism is beautiful and adorable. We\u2019d love to feature your pet in the game!\nWe are offering discounted shipping rates for this Kickstarter! Shipping on all packages for the United States is $7. Shipping for all packages to Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European Union is $15. Shipping to the rest of the world for all packages is $19.\nA prototype copy of Space Cats Fight Fascism!\nRewards that are going to the US and the EU will be shipped from within those regions, which means they will be VAT- and customs-friendly. Rewards to Canada will be shipped from the US.\nSome international shipments outside of these regions may be subject to customs charges, depending on the country to which you are shipping. We cannot label the game as a gift on customs forms.\nSpace Cats Fight Fascism will be the fourth game published by the TESA Collective. Our design team for this game has worked on 8 other games \u2014 including Good Dog, Bad Zombie as well as Rise Up \u2014 so it\u2019s a perfect blending of our interests! Our design team has a strong track record of developing and fulfilling well-received games that are fun, funny, and thoughtful. The TESA Collective is based around North America: in Chicago, Vermont, Western Massachusetts, and Montreal.\nEvan Rowland is working with TESA as the art director for Space Cats Fight Fascism. Evan draws pictures and makes games. His work has appeared in Questlandia, Noirlandia, and Good Dog, Bad Zombie. He hopes that his life in some small way discomfits the fascists of the world. We are also working with Fox Desfleurs for the art. Fox is a freelance illustrator and graduate of Seneca College's Independent Illustration program. He is a lover of retro-RPGs, fractals, and all things cute. He lives with his husband in Toronto.\nBrian Van Slyke, a member of TESA, is also the co-designer of Good Dog, Bad Zombie, and a member of another company, Make Big Things, which published Good Dog, Bad Zombie! If you followed the Kickstarter for that game, you might notice some similar rewards between the two campaigns. Make Big Things and TESA are good friends, and they both learn a lot about publishing games from each other, but they are separate companies. :)\nTESA has been the leader in producing games that are ethically manufactured. Several years ago, we began working with Community Printers \u2014 a worker-owned business in California that uses sustainable materials. Community Printers is an industrial scale printing press, and we collaborated with them to develop methods for manufacturing board games. Since then, other publishers have followed our lead in using Community Printers to manufacture their games! \nBelow, you can watch the video created by Molly McLeod about how we produced our previous game, Rise Up, with Community Printers. \nPLAY\n\nWe are proud of our success in developing new, ethical means for creating games that are good for both people and the planet.\nNow that we've reached our initial goal of $20,000, we are able to introduce stretch goals! These will allow us to add more features to the game.\nOur first stretch goal has been unlocked! We're adding a new playable character to the game - Alias: SC. He's the resistance's main hacker, and he has a powerful ability that brings new tools to the resistance.\nThis stretch goal is unlocked! We are adding three additional \"New Power\" cards to the game! These new powers allow you to upgrade your cat's base abilities, and they allow you to create fun combinations of effects. They also make each game round unique!\nNew stretch goal!\nIf we are able to reach $44,000, we will add 10 new cards to both the Galactic News Deck and the Resistance Deck. That's 20 additional cards in the game, total! This would allow us to include even more creative storylines in the game, changing up the flavor and story with each round of the game. We're very excited about this!\nWant to see Space Cats Fight Fascism in action? Check out these brief clips from playtests we did as we developed the game.

No matter when you choose to pledge, you don\u2019t get charged until the campaign\u2019s end date. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign! \nEven if we\u2019ve reached our initial goal, you can still pledge!

But you realize something is missing\u2026 it\u2019s those scratches behind your ears\u2026 those enthusiastic belly rubs\u2026 the sound of a hooman calling you a \u201cgood dog\u201d...\nSo it\u2019s time to brave the apocalypse and search the city for hooman survivors, bring them back to Central Bark, and build a place you can call your forever home!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a cooperative board game, where everyone plays together as a heroic dog pack. Together, you\u2019ll explore a post-apocalyptic city while sniffing out scents, barking at the undead, and herding hoomans to safety.\nSomewhere out there, our hoomans are waiting!\nYour goal in Good Dog, Bad Zombie is to find the scaredy hoomans that are hiding around the crumbling metropolis. To do so, you\u2019ll have to investigate scent tokens in different city locations, such as Squirreltown, the Boneyard, and Worst Place.\nEach scent could reveal a hooman in hiding, or a lurking danger - like a zombie mailman, a barn full of bats, or too much kibble for one pup to handle!\nWhen you do find a hooman, your job isn\u2019t done yet. You\u2019ll need to use your energy cards\u2014and the support of the other dogs in your pack\u2014to lead the hooman to safety. Use cards like \u201cRUFF RUFF BARK GRR-RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d and \u201cHooman in danger! HOOMAN IN DANGER!!\u201d to guide the hooman away from hungry zombies!\nChase the zombies!\nAs you play, new zombies will spawn throughout the city and constantly move toward Central Bark! To keep all your hoomans safe, you\u2019ll need to fend off the zombies. Chase them far enough, and they\u2019ll tumble over the cliffs or be swept away in the river.\nZombies can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly rescued hoomans!\nRescue all the hoomans!\nFind and rescue 6 hoomans, and Central Bark will become your new forever home. Everyone wins!\nSix hoomans safe in central bark.\nBut every time a hooman is lost to the horde or a zombie slips into Central Bark, your pack becomes more feral.\nWe must strive to remember the kindness of hoomans!\nIf the feral track reaches 10, your pack reverts to the ways of their wolf ancestors and forgets what it means to feel the love of a hooman. Everyone loses!\nBe a dog!\nWe wanted to infuse our game with as much dogginess as possible. Be prepared to say things such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to lick myself!\u201d and \u201cI howl at you!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll help your fellow dogs by licking and howling, boosting their energy to help them outwit the zombies! Herd and bark at each other to escape dangerous situations and reach defenseless hoomans faster.\nIn Good Dog, Bad Zombie, there\u2019s no room for the lone wolf. Each dog will support the pack with their own unique skills!\nLupin\u2019s \u201cSnuggle\u201d ability unleashes an energizing flurry of licking!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is for 1 - 5 players, and takes 45 - 60 minutes to play. Choose your preferred difficulty setting when the game begins - take it easy with the \"Walk in the Park,\" or fend off a massive zombie onslaught with the \"Hounds of the Barkalypse\" setup. Whatever you decide, you can expect an adventure full of close calls, laughing players, and doggie heroics!\nWatch these short, behind the scenes video clips of playtests from Good Dog, Bad Zombie over the years!\nPLAY\n\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a game for people who love dogs and prefer not to be eaten alive by zombies.\nWhat's in the box?\nThe base game comes with:\nThe rulebook (you can check out the playtest draft here!)\nThe city board\nHooman town\nFeral track with marker\n8 Dog player sheets\n8 Illustrated Dog tokens\n18 Illustrated Zombie tokens\n12 Hooman cards\n3 Illustrated Hooman tokens\n64 Energy cards\n54 Scent cards\n3 Scent tokens\nCommunity Printers and Ethical Manufacturing\nMake Big Things is committed to producing our games ethically, as much as possible. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve teamed up with Community Printers to manufacture Good Dog, Bad Zombie. Community Printers is a worker-owned cooperative, like Make Big Things, meaning that everyone who works there democratically owns and runs the business. Community Printers also specializes in environmentally sustainable printing and manufacturing.

We also strove to develop a game that was truly cooperative: where everyone had to work together and no single player could dominate the game.

Here is a quick explanation of the platform:\nGenerally speaking, Kickstarter lets us raise money from lots of people so we can make and deliver our product.\nIt\u2019s all or nothing: If we don\u2019t meet our goal by the end date of this campaign, April 12 at 9 PM Eastern Standard Time, we won\u2019t receive any funds (and you won\u2019t be charged anything for pledging).\nIf we\u2019re successful, you won\u2019t be charged until the campaign closes on April 12th - so pledging early is a big help! We know some people may want to wait to pledge until closer to the end of the campaign for financial reasons. Your payment method will not be charged until the campaign is completed on April 12th, no matter when you choose to pledge. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign!\nCan I still pledge if you\u2019ve already reached your goal? Absolutely! If we are fortunate enough to reach our initial goal, we\u2019ll release additional \u201cstretch goals\u201d that will allow us to add more content and features to the game while producing more copies!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth Kickstarter campaign for Make Big Things!

Right now, the game is virtually complete. We\u2019re in the final stages: working to finish the art and incorporate it throughout the game, and then working with an editor to finalize the rulebook and make sure it\u2019s as accessible as possible.\n\nIf we meet our funding goal, you\u2019ll be receiving a beautiful, complete game that we hope you\u2019ll love just as much as we do.

We began working together on this book because we wanted to make something that would spark conversations about the way we all design our paths, grow our creativity, and find our place.\nOver the past two years, we've shared Skype calls and in-person work sessions. We've been writing (and re-writing) the book, prototyping illustrations, and testing the concept with kids and adults of all backgrounds.\nThe story and illustrations reflect our spirit of playful making. It embodies our beliefs that everyone has a place, that the world is a classroom, and life's challenges are opportunities for discovery and innovation.\nTo bring the story to life, our friend and Spanish artist, Edu Vea (NosE) chose to use real wooden pieces to illustrate each page. After designing and testing the idea, we worked alongside Matthew Hoffman to produce the shapes in his workshop. Then we went to Daniel Kelleghan's studio to photograph each scene. Finally, our talented friends at Grip laid out the entire book, finding the perfect place for every word and every shape.\nThe handcrafted wooden shapes show minor imperfections and oddities, a reminder that big ideas can be expressed with simple materials, and that everybody of every shape has something unique to contribute.\nWe couldn't be more proud to see the book finally ready to find its own place in your home, office, or classroom!\nThe story explores an exciting world made from simple circles, triangles, squares, and rectangles. Young audiences will have fun hunting for familiar shapes in the book's playful illustrations. We wanted to show how basic elements combine to create buildings and landscapes, characters and obstacles. We hope readers find the style both inviting and inspiring. \n  Our main character defies categories and labels, inviting readers to wonder: What is that shape anyway? What do we call it? Does it have a gender? A pronoun? The book uses shapelessness to explore the challenges and opportunities that come with being different. We wanted to create a playful celebration of individuality. \nBook Design by HelloGrip.com\n  We've kept this very simple to keep the book affordable and sharable and give everyone the opportunity to be part of bringing this project to production. You can order 1, 2, 3, 5, or 10 copies of the hardback version of The Shapeless Shape at a rate that will only be available to Kickstarter backers. Also, domestic shipping is on us for single copies. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nEver since the beginning, The Shapeless Shape has been about community. The story began with two friends focused on education and innovation, and it slowly expanded to a team of writers and makers interested in spreading a positive message. Kickstarter allows us to organically expand that community \u2014 inviting kids, parents, educators, creators, designers, and writers of all sorts to be the very first to see this story and spread the message. This is our way of staying true to how we began \u2014 a community of friends who believe everyone has a place. \nTimeline\nWriting: 2015-2017\nEditing: March - June \nMaking: June - August \nDesign & Layout: August - September\nKickstarter: September 19 - October 19\nProduction & Printing: October - November\nShipping to YOU: December 1 \nIllustration: Edu Vea (NosE)\nShape Maker: Matthew Hoffman\nPhotography: Daniel Kelleghan\nBook Layout & Website: Grip\nFile Prep: Manuel Torres\nAdvisor: Sandra Feder\nEditor: Michael Lawrence\nOrganizer: Christina Segeler\nCommunications: Debbe Stern\nCampaign Design: William Ferguson\nKickstarter Video: Ben Derico / Sidekick Video\nSpecial thanks to the families who tested the story with their awesome kids: Dustin Henderlong, Dannon Loveland, Aaron Wilson-Ahlstrom, Beth Swanson, Amie Curioso Silo, Nina Church, Katie Crain, & Andrew Unger.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've kept the project very simple to minimize delays.

I'm Lucy Bellwood, a professional Adventure Cartoonist living in Portland, Oregon. I'm running this campaign to fund a printed collection of my 100 Demon Dialogues Project and a companion plush toy to keep you all company as you bicker with (and perhaps get to love) your own inner jerks.\nWhat's all this about? Here's the scoop:\nBack in 2015 I started exploring a series of illustrated dialogues between myself and a small, obnoxious character who had a lot of big ideas about everything I was supposedly doing wrong in my life and my career. \nSharing these illustrations induced a particular kind of catharsis: it turned out most everyone I knew was struggling with feelings of imposter syndrome and anxiety. Externalizing these conversations and giving them a humorous twist often enabled me to overcome my self-doubt and get on with the exciting business of Making Good Art\u2014and it seemed to help other people do the same.\nThis year, for The 100 Day Project, I decided to delve deep into these Demon Dialogues. For the past three months, I've been drawing a demon every day, exploring all the ins and outs of the creative process, growing up, and trying to live a balanced life as an adult in the 21st century. (You can read all the entries online for free right here.)\nThe project has garnered a massive and humbling response. I've heard from so many people who saw themselves in these illustrations and were able to laugh at the absurdity of the demon's demands or nod in recognition when something hit too close to home. Lots of people were asking for books or prints, so I decided to launch this campaign to bring a physical edition of the project to life.\nThe primary goal of this campaign is to produce a print edition of the complete 100 Demon Dialogues series. I'll be making softcover and hardcover editions available, both with all the fancy bells and whistles I can think of. \nSoftcover editions will measure 6\"x 6\" and feature French Flaps, color covers, spot foil, and patterned inner covers.\nHardcover editions will measure 6\" x 6\" and feature ribbon bookmarks, colored spine stitching, spot foil, and patterned endpapers.\nBoth editions contain all 100 entries from this year's 100 Demon Dialogues project, printed in black and white, plus a brief essay on what I learned while completing the project. If things go really well, I'll be including a gallery of additional demon entries from previous iterations of this project, but let's get the basics down first.\nOf course, the logical companion for the print edition is a cuddly demon of your very own! \nI've partnered with Soft Stuff Creations to produce a plush toy demon for all your bickering needs. Here's a look at the prototype:\nThis little fella measures about 15\" from tip to tail and has beans in his backside so he can easily sit up on any surface you care to place him on. The body and eyes are both ultra-soft, short fur, and the eyes and mouth have embroidered edges. His floppy limbs windmill in a very pleasing manner when you throw him down a flight of stairs, too. \n\"Ugh, I can't believe you like this band.\"\nSoft Stuff Creations has a stellar record of producing plush toys for folks like KC Green and Kate Beaton, and I'm really excited to be working with them for this reward.\nWhile I'm deliberately keeping this campaign simple so I can better focus on producing high-quality books and toys, I am offering a limited-edition run of signed and numbered, reversible letterpress prints, produced in partnership with my pal Emily Riley of Rx Letterpress, a local Portland printer.\nThese prints will be 6\"x9\", featuring black and blue ink with a custom watercolor wash\u2014which means no two will be alike! You can hang them whichever way appeals to you the most, or switch \u2019em up depending on the day.\n(Concept art only, final design forthcoming.)\nIf you're looking for prints of specific Demon Dialogues, never fear: the fine folks at Buyolympia have got you covered. You can buy prints of every single demon from the series right here.\n  Of course, producing all these exciting things takes money, which is where Kickstarter comes in! The operating budget for this campaign looks like so:\nFor all you number nerds, here's the breakdown. [Note: these numbers are current quote estimates and may change, but we've been careful to overestimate where possible so there won't be any nasty surprises.]\n~$9,540 to Soft Stuff Creations for plushie design and production.\n~$3,050 to the print team for book production and shipping.\n~$1,000 for print brokerage and negotiation.\n~$8,000 to Blackbox, who will be bringing their stellar customer service and logistical experience to the table to get your packages shipped intact and on schedule.\n~$600 to Allyson Haller, my fabulous book designer.\n~$320 to Rx Letterpress for limited-edition demon prints.\n5% for Kickstarter fees (about $1,214, with current figures).\n2-5% for credit card processing fees (variable, but again: about $1,200).\nThis takes us just about up to $25,000, which you'll notice is the goal for this campaign. I try to be transparent about my finances as often as possible, so here's the deal: this campaign is to fund the production of these items, which is why I\u2019m setting the base funding goal at 25k. \nHowever, reaching the magic number of $32,500 will ensure that I\u2019ll be able to afford the taxes on this income (The More You Know: Kickstarter money counts as income for creators!). The final rate may be less than 30% because many of these expenses are deductible, but it's always best to play it safe where this stuff is concerned. \nThere are no official stretch goals for this campaign because I wanted to jump straight into making the best possible thing right off the bat, so consider this our one above-the-mark mission. Deal? Deal.\nSupport Team\nI'm thrilled to be working with the following companies to ensure the backend of this campaign runs as smoothly as possible:\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third Kickstarter campaign, and I'm really looking forward to implementing everything I learned during my first two successful experiences.\n\nAll the illustrations in the 100 Demon Dialogues series are complete! I've been working hard to get as much of the book design done ahead of time as possible, so all that remains is gather that artwork and getting the final files put together with my fabulous book designer, Ally.\n\nFor both books and plushies: production and transit time are hefty where overseas projects are concerned. I'll be keeping backers abreast of the production process so they can see what goes into designing and producing these objects, but we can't get around how long it takes them to arrive from abroad. \n\nOur March 2018 arrival estimate is VERY generous to allow maximum time for potential delays. I'd rather your rewards be a pleasant, early surprise than an overdue burden! I will, of course, keep everyone fully apprised in the updates of when to expect their goods. Blackbox and BackerKit, our survey and fulfillment companies, both have fantastic customer service and backend interfaces to help guarantee that your books and plushies arrive in a timely and undamaged fashion. I have the utmost faith in them. \n\nAside from shipping delays, though, we're looking at a solid, stress-free experience bringing some exciting things into the world.

While style guides like the Associated Press Stylebook are used in newsrooms and public relations offices alike, they don\u2019t cover identity well \u2014 if they mention topics like gender or race at all, they just touch on the surface. Identity is a crucial topic for anyone writing today to get right, especially in fields like technology, where we need to talk about our users and audience in a way they find inclusive and understanding.\nWe\u2019re running this Kickstarter to fund the resource we need in our own work. The Responsible Communication Style Guide will cover how to write about five key topics:\nRace\nGender\nSexuality\nReligion\nHealth and Well-Being\nWe'll also cover how this approach fits into the work The Recompiler does, and how we can write about technology in the most welcoming and accessible way.\nWho are we and why are we qualified to create this style guide?\nAudrey Eschright is the founder and publisher of The Recompiler, a feminist hacker magazine launched last year. She\u2019s been looking at the underlying structures that inform our technology and improve our communities for far longer than that, with a decade-long career as a software developer and community organizer.\nThursday Bram has been writing online professionally for over a decade. She writes about business and technology primarily, but has written about everything, including reviews of kitchen sinks. Her first step with many of her clients is creating a style guide from scratch.\nWe\u2019re equipped to edit and publish this style guide, but we aren\u2019t the right subject matter experts to write many of the sections this guide will contain. It needs to be written by people with the lived experience to provide context. We\u2019re finalizing the section editors we\u2019ll be working with and will announce their names during the Kickstarter, so stay tuned for those updates!\nWho is this style guide for?\nWe\u2019d love to create a style guide that covers every relevant topic for every industry, but we\u2019re going to do something a bit more specialized for the first iteration. The Responsible Communication Style Guide will focus on covering our five topics within the context of technology. We both work in technology and know the gaps in resources firsthand. We\u2019re also starting with technology because we both see the discussions taking place in tech communities as having an outsized impact on other communications. After all, can we build inclusive and accessible tools if we don\u2019t even have the words to discuss inclusion or accessibility?\nThe Responsible Communication Style Guide isn\u2019t just for writers. Podcasters, vloggers, speakers, and media creators of all kinds have to think carefully about word choice to make sure an audience gets exactly the intended message. We see a clear business case for the many journalists and marketers working around tech in different media: if only because there\u2019s a clear business case for not alienating or offending sections of your customers.\nWhat do we need?\nWe\u2019re asking for $20,000. With that money, we\u2019ll cover the cost of paying contributors, printing copies of the style guide, and sending rewards out. Even if everyone were to choose the e-book option for the style guide, paying contributors, editors, and designers, plus other necessary expenses to create a project of this scale, will require about 60% of our budget. The rest goes toward the physical costs of delivering the project rewards you\u2019ll select.\nStretch goal!\nWe know it's a long shot, but we have 9 more hours left. If we get to $25,000 before the end of the campaign, we'll add on creating videos of our on-site training. Right now the training is only available to backers at the $1,800 level, but if we hit the stretch goal we can make videos available to anyone backing at the $35 level. Let's see how far we can push this!\nWe need you to back this project to make it successful. Even a small pledge will make a world of difference for us, though we\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll consider backing at least the $15 level so that you\u2019ll be able to start using the style guide in your work as soon as possible.\nWe also want you to share this Kickstarter project with anyone you know who has to write or create other media. Help us reach the people who really need this guide.\nThank you for supporting our Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe work required to finish the Responsible Communication Style Guide breaks down into three categories: writing, printing, and shipping.\n\nWe're finalizing our section editors now and they'll be able to start work right after this Kickstarter ends. One of the biggest risks in this project is that an editor will not be able to complete a section. However, we have a list of alternative section editors and writers who we can work with in the event of a problem.\n\nBecause the Recompiler publishes a quarterly print edition, we already have an existing relationship with printers and a fulfillment system.

But what goes into the secret sauce of friendship? Kristen, Cory and James here on the KNOW YOUR HUMANS! team think it's all about being able to express yourself authentically through conversation and play.\nThat\u2019s why we simmered that secret sauce directly into KNOW YOUR HUMANS!, a new party card game for 3 - 10 players, ages 16+.\nIn just a few rounds, strangers become friends, and friends become even closer. Originally inspired by Truth-or-Dare, our game prompts players to interact in three awesome ways:\nQuestion Cards that range from silly hypothetical to thoughtfully personal.\nAction Cards with ridiculous cooperative challenges.\nAnd Battle Cards that will have your friends facing off in competitive mini-games.\nIt's your new secret weapon against boring conversation and forgettable hangouts.\n80% of the cards involve 2 or more players, so you\u2019ll rarely play alone, and no one has to sit on the sidelines for long. You might learn about someone\u2019s supervillain alter ego, invent a secret handshake, or have an epic finger fencing battle!\nKNOW YOUR HUMANS! is perfect for:\nLearning new things about humans you\u2019ve known forever \nBreaking the ice with new humans \nBringing different circles of friends together\n\u2026when you\u2019re hanging out at home, festivals, family gatherings, bachelor/ette parties, on vacation, or any of the other weird places you humans gather.\nBut this ultimate weapon against boring hangouts won\u2019t exist without YOU! So if you\u2019re the kind of person who wants to know how your roommate would survive the zombie apocalypse, and participate in a massively multiplayer thumb war all in the same game, please help us make this dream a reality.\nWith love & pajama parties for all,\nKristen, Cory, & James\nHow To Play\nTo play the game, everyone begins with three random cards in their hand, and one player starts the game off as the \u201cParty Wizard.\u201d Everyone submits one card from their hand that they think the Party Wizard will want to play.\nThe Party Wizard chooses one of the submissions, and plays the prompt on the card, which might be a question, action, or battle. Whoever submitted the chosen card gets 1 point, unless it was a Battle Card. In that case, whoever wins the battle gets 2 points.\nThe Party Wizard then gets to return the cards she or he didn\u2019t choose back into the deck anywhere they like. All players draw a new card from the deck, and the role of Party Wizard shifts to the left. The game ends when one lucky human reaches 3 points.\nOur Story\nOnce upon a time, James, Cory, and I used to socialize by simply sitting on our butts and drinking, like normal humans\u2026 And then we experienced raves, art festivals, and travel adventures with friends. During those experiences, we discovered that the most memorable parts weren\u2019t the DJs or the beautiful destinations. While we do love a good laser light show, the best moments were when we got to bond with our favorite people on a deeper level.\nWe began to understand that it\u2019s possible to design experiences that maximize both fun and meaningful connection. This combination had a powerful impact on our own lives, and we wanted to find ways to share what we had learned with more people.\nOur first idea was to host live events for this purpose. Our big test was a New Year\u2019s party complete with a storytelling \u201ctattoo\u201d parlor, an indoor playground, and even a giant neon squid puppet partying with us on a black light dance floor. We really felt the magic of bringing people closer, but our impact was limited to people who could attend. We wanted that magic to reach many more friend groups beyond our city. So, we took everything we had learned about bonding through play, and baked it into a card game that anyone could experience anywhere.\nEvery day more adults are gathering to connect face-to-face over card and board games. As life long gamers ourselves, we are incredibly inspired to be a part of this global movement. And since we\u2019re driven by connection, we wanted to make a game where no matter who wins, everyone walks away with new memories, inside jokes and appreciation for the humans you played with.\nThrough our experience creating live events, we had learned that there are some key elements in the secret sauce of connection. So, we built KNOW YOUR HUMANS! around two of the most important ones - personal storytelling and play. Now that we\u2019ve got this game, even a night sitting around on our butts drinking can turn into a night we remember forever. We\u2019ve spent the past nine months testing and revising the game, and now we need your help to take it prime time!\nWe Need Your Help!\nObviously, we need your hard earned cash to help us produce the game, but we\u2019re also incredibly excited to see how all you superhero (and supervillain) geniuses out there in the Kickstarter community can help make KNOW YOUR HUMANS! even better. We will have opportunities for you to playtest our current prototype, and weigh in on things such as: \nOptimal number of points for a win \nUpper limit on group size \nBest 2 player remix \nBest non-competitive remix\nAnd of course we\u2019re open to your new card suggestions as well. Let\u2019s make something new and awesome together, ya\u2019ll!\nStretch Goals\nOur current prototype cards come snuggled inside of a ridiculously cute cat or dog travel pouch. The pouch always gets a laugh, and puts people in the mood to play. It\u2019s like a wingman that primes people for fun wherever you take it. Producing custom pouches at scale would be expensive, but if we sell 1,500 copies, everyone will get an awesome carrying case instead of a boring ol\u2019 cardboard box! (Please note: Cards in the photo below are of an older version of the game. All backers will receive the new and improved deck which is bridge-sized and a new animal pouch design that is TBD!)\nFAQ\nHow many players does the game support? The standard rules support 3-10 players, but the game can be remixed to play with different group sizes. We will be asking our community to experiment with different group sizes during our public playtesting phase.\nWhat's the age range for the standard game? We think 16+ is a good suggestion, but there\u2019s no hard language or sexually explicit material in the game.  Our age suggestion is more reflective of the mature nature of our Question Cards - for example, it might be tough for a 10 year old to answer \u201cWhat\u2019s an identity you\u2019ve left behind?\u201d  \nWhat's the age range for the NSFW Booster pack?  The suggested age for the NSFW booster cards is 21+ because they will include drinking games, stronger language and some sexual questions.\nHow long does it take to learn and play? Learning only takes a few minutes, so it\u2019s easy to bust out at a party. Play times vary depending on how many players are involved, but generally range from 15-40 minutes. It can also be played non-competitively for as short or as long as you like. Use it as a 10 minute ice breaker, or stay up playing until dawn - see if we care, we\u2019re not your Dad!\nWhat's included with the game? A 53 card deck of Question, Action, and Battle Cards, an instruction card, and a box made of space age material (cardboard). If we hit our stretch goal, we\u2019ll replace the box with a custom carrying pouch!\nWhere are you printing the cards? Panda Games will be our partner for manufacturing.\nCan I change/update/delete/add to/massage my address/order? Yes. At the end of the campaign, we'll send out a survey asking for a final mailing address plus a detailed description of exactly what you ordered so we can be sure to send you the right swag.\nWhat size are the cards? Our cards are \u201cbridge\u201d size (2.25\"x3.5\"), which are slightly smaller than standard poker cards (2.5\"x3.5\"). The smaller cards travel nicely, and we want you to be able to KNOW YOUR HUMANS! anywhere you wander on Spaceship Earth!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve tested the game with friends (and strangers who then became friends) for nine months before launching this Kickstarter.

What is nice is a planner that feels like it was made by someone you know or can at least relate to. If you're going to really use a planner and fill it with your plans, notes and thoughts, shouldn't it at least feel human?\nUnsolicited Advice is a weekly planner with dated pages to help you keep your life organized in 2016. Part calendar, part journal, it's intended to help you keep your shit together but also kick your ass a little bit. It nags you with small reminders like \"go to bed what are you even doing right now???\" then makes you laugh with unexpected surprises and of course my shitty drawings. It's stupid and useful, full of surprises, with plenty of space for you to make it your own.\nI've filled this thing with weird activity pages that might remind you of being a kid, or you know, some time when you weren't glued to your phone. They're child-ish, but not childish. This is not for children. It references the internet but doesn't beat you to death with tired emoji jokes.

I've been making the Unsolicited Advice weekly planners on my own for five years now. It's become a very special project that helps me enter into each new year.\nOver time, my personal work has grown into a bunch of connected projects that deal with being human (with an internet connection) in a weird and funny way. In 2014, my first book 1 Page at a Time: A Daily Creative Companion was released by Penguin Random House worldwide. It was a direct result of my first Kickstarter campaign and thanks to the support of people like you. It has been a dream come true to keep on doing projects like this one, and it feels the best when I am sitting in my apartment packing an envelope to send directly to you.\nIn the last year, I've also been lucky enough to collaborate with people like The Strand Bookstore, Brooklyn Public Library, Tumblr, Urban Outfitters, and Tattly.

It also helps clarify which costs are which in this process.\n\nWhen a project ends, Kickstarter allows me to send a survey. I'll ask for your address and other relevant details.

So pack your stuff and travel with us into the future! \nThe Concept\nThe Future Chronicles is a publication, made for the digital age. Every issue deals with a topic of social change. Every article covers a milestone in history and takes place in the respective time.\nTo build up the basic knowledge on our subject, we always start our journey in the past. Then, article by article, we travel into the future.\nTo bring everything together we created a design language that connects all the different places in time: A unique visual style, carefully selected typography and the creative spirit of a different artist for every article.\nThe First Issue\nThe first issue tells the history of 21st century\u2019s most disruptive technology: the internet. Traveling through twenty articles from 1962 to 2096, you\u2019ll experience the incredible transformation from a technophobe to a virtual society.\nMachines become more intelligent than humanity, privacy ends in a free flow of information and centres of power dissolve in the emergence of decentralized structures.\nTechnology is shrinking, until it vanishes in the human body. Mankind overcomes natural selection by evolving into machines, until our whole world finally gets replaced by virtual reality.\nLet's make it happen!\nWe want the Future Chronicles to be an independent publication. It\u2019s sole purpose should be to inform, inspire and please you, our readers.

We're redesigning a New Orleans public elementary schoolyard into a \"water literacy campus.\" Rain gardens, large cypress trees, and a giant play mound will not only solve the school's flooding issues, but create a joyful and fun environment that teaches students about their place in the Mississippi River Delta. Construction starts this summer. We need your help to get this built!\nCourtyard/ Playground today\nCampus courtyard redesign vision, showing play mound and rain gardens\nThe Campus Today\nAt the heart of New Orleans and in the shadow of downtown and the Superdome, KIPP Central City Primary (KCCP) sits just above sea level. Of the 527 students, 98% receive free- or reduced-price lunch, and 98% are minority. The campus takes up an entire city block and is organized around a central courtyard. Today, this hard patch of dirt, concrete, and asphalt floods each time it rains. There are few trees that provide shade and even fewer amenities for active play and learning. Yet all outdoor activities at this school take place in this environment.\nStudents playing on the field\nPonding in the courtyard after a storm\nNew Design & Curriculum Connections \nThis campus redesign builds directly on the innovative Ripple Effect \u201cwater literacy\u201d curriculum that science and ELA teachers at KCCP are implementing this year. Using their own courtyard as a microcosm for citywide flooding issues, students are learning about flooding, erosion, soils, and local ecology as they propose design solutions to reshape and re-imagine their courtyard. \nRipple Effect science curriculum in a KIPP Central City Primary classroom\nAt the same time, Ripple Effect designers are actually redesigning the courtyard to curb flooding and use water in playful and enriching ways. Rain gardens planted with native irises and cypresses will teach students about local ecology; a grove of trees will offer quiet spaces for reading and shade; a giant play mound will give students a new vantage point and illustrate the interplay between the flow of water and topography.\nCourtyard Redesign\nThe courtyard will feature rain gardens, a grove of trees, and a play mound\nYour Contribution\nYour tax-deductible donation will ensure that we can break ground this year and make a difference for every child that passes through the school\u2019s front doors this July. Your impact will last for decades, and be seen in the contributions of the scientists, architects, engineers, policy makers, and ecologists that start who careers here in this courtyard. \nCompanies like Waggonner & Ball Architects, Spackman Mossop Michaels, and OPA Signs & Graphics are already contributing their services. Both the Meraux Foundation and the Kabacoff Family Foundation are contributing funding as well. But we will only be able to reach our $150,000 goal with your contribution. \n Here\u2019s what various donation levels would mean for this project:\nA $100 donation will help us demolish asphalt.\nA $250 donation will buy us one cypress tree. \nA $500 donation will allow us to buy 40 Louisiana irises for the rain garden. \nA $1000 donation will allow us to bring in fresh soils, mulch, and other surfaces to replace asphalt and concrete. \nA $2,500 donation will allow us to build 100 square feet of the rain garden. We are planning a 2,000 sq. ft. rain garden that holds over 20,000 gallons of water. \nDonations that help us surpass the $65,000 mark will allow us to build a play mound, and provide outdoor furniture, and educational signage that will further enrich the courtyard as an environment for learning and play. \nComments from KCCP teachers on proposed courtyard\nComments from KCCP teachers on proposed courtyard\nProject Background\nWe live in the Mississippi River Delta, a dynamic environment with distinct patterns of water flow, soil formation, and erosion. The region and the city are characterized by flowing water, unstable ground, and also abundant natural resources. Learning about water resources, water management, and ecology are especially critical in an era of climate change, sea level rise, uncertain weather, and diverse environmental stresses. Nowhere is that more important than in New Orleans. After Hurricane Katrina, levee failures inundated the city with brackish water from the Gulf of Mexico. This school, KIPP Central City Primary, was flooded with over 4 feet of water.\nMississippi River Delta\nKIPP Central City Primary days after Hurricane Katrina, 2005\nSpurred by the tragedies of 2005, planners, designers, and engineers working on the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan and related projects have started to shift the regional paradigm from fighting water with pipes and pumps to a more sustainable and resilient approach in which we reshape the urban environment to reduce flooding by safely storing stormwater in green spaces, balancing groundwater levels, and enhancing local ecosystems. None of this work, though, will be possible without an informed and water literate citizenry with a deep understanding of natural resources, ecology, and infrastructure, and with the ability to work collaboratively towards stronger, safer, and healthier communities.\nIn 2012, one teacher and three designers in New Orleans created a water workshop for 30 fourth graders at KIPP Central City Primary, as part of a three-week study of the city\u2019s geography and topography, subsidence, flooding, infrastructure, and international \u201cwater cities.\u201d Students then proposed design-based solutions to the flooding they regularly experienced in their own schoolyard.\nToday, that same teacher and a designer from the original team have formed Ripple Effect, which consists of teachers, designers, and water experts, all working on \"water literacy\" curriculum for grades K-4 at this same school. Next year, we are expanding to schools across Greater New Orleans, and building upon partnerships with the New Orleans Sewerage & Water Board and Waggonner & Ball Architects to improve the quality and the reach of both our curriculum development and our site remediation programs.\nAs we expand to additional schools in the coming years, the curriculum we develop will always be paired with an actual built project on that campus. Doing so will allow us to connecting learning in the classroom to what the kids experience and can learn from the school environment themselves. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis Kickstarter campaign comes at a critical time in the life of this project. In January 2015, we began design and fundraising. With seed funding from KIPP New Orleans, and through private donors and foundation grants, we have been able to raise $70,000 to help cover fees for professional designers working at reduced rates, as well as some construction costs. Kickstarter funds will allow us to continue the project through July, completing construction before school is back in session in August. \n\nThis construction schedule is ambitious, but thanks to our experienced and talented design team \u2013 including our Project Manager, who hails from Auburn University's Rural Studio, and whose background is in design/ build projects \u2013 we feel confident that we can build all major elements this summer, in time for the start of school. \n\nIn addition to our Project Manager, the team consists of an Art Director from Ralph Appelbaum Associates, an Urban Designer from Waggonner & Ball Architects, and a Landscape Designer from Spackman Mossop & Michaels. Combined, they have over 20 years of experience in designing and building client-focused, innovative, and sustainable projects.\n\nAdditionally, all team members are part of the larger organization of Ripple Effect, which began one year ago, funded by the Sewerage & Water Board of New Orleans. With that program, we have brought together 9 designers, 7 teachers, and 7 water experts, to create curriculum for over 300 students at this same school, KIPP Central City Primary. Ripple Effect will expand to additional school communities throughout New Orleans in the 2015-2016 school year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Water Literacy Courtyard is COMPLETE!", "update_content": "Friends,\nWe are writing with exciting news.

People who need food stamps don\u2019t have the luxury of time. An hour spent waiting at a food stamp office means an hour less of wages, or another hour of childcare to pay for.\nThough there is an online application for food stamps in New York City, it\u2019s built for people using desktop computers. We believe that applications for benefits should reach people wherever they are, and in 2014, many Americans are on smartphones. Indeed, a recent Pew internet study showed that 45% of low-income Americans who own phones are using their phones as their primary method of accessing the internet.\nWhat we've shipped already:\nEasyfoodstamps.com is a website that condenses the current paper application to a few key questions.

Because many government application forms are similar, we can eventually build the \u201ccommon app\u201d for government benefits.\nWho are we?\nWe began this project at Significance Labs, a nonprofit in Brooklyn focused on harnessing technology to improve the lives of low-income Americans. We believe the world needs more tools to combat poverty -- not more photo-sharing apps. So, we spent this summer talking to New Yorkers who are working hard to get back on their feet. We heard, time and time again, about the ordeals they faced applying for government benefits, and about the workarounds and energy that went into trying to navigate a tangled system.\nOther ways to help\nFunding through Kickstarter is a key piece of the puzzle, but we're also looking for partners, allies, investors, foundations, and anyone else who wants to get more involved in our project.

Also, we know that many folks don't know they're eligible for food stamps, and bridging that information gap is a tough problem that we aren't actively addressing now.

Stay tuned from more to come from The Clothes Letters Wear. Updates on the production will still be posted here, but if you weren't a backer, you will want to check out http://www.theclothesletterswear.com. It will serve as a nexus for TCLW in the years to come.\nHi there! You may not know me. That\u2019s OK. I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019ve seen my work, though. I\u2019m a typeface designer. I've had my work used in and for five major motion pictures, countless books, including a number of best sellers and more than a few video games. Basically, I design letters for a living. That\u2019s right--fonts. Your computer is chock-full of them, and although you may not realize it, those fonts are all made day and night by hard-working elves locked away in a deep, dark, cavernous dungeon. Well, not so much that last part. But thousands upon thousands of these letters are all sketched, shaped, and polished off by designers like me. Some letters are made to be pretty; some are just functional; but they all surround us every day. There\u2019s no escaping them. Let\u2019s come back to that, though. \nMaking fonts is a big project. No question there. But I\u2019ve learned that even creating all these forms doesn\u2019t compare in excitement and level of impact to my next project. \nThis little guy is my son, Will. He\u2019s had a big part in helping me shape this great new story. When Will was born, we found that he loved to devour books--and not just with his mouth. This, of course, made me as a type designer very happy. The little guy loved books so much that it easily became one of our staple activities together. Big books. Little books. Board books. Soft books. Lot of colors across all the pages. Some books were great and entertaining to read; others, just nice to fill the time. So what\u2019s the problem? Through all the books we\u2019ve read together--and there have been quite a few--I\u2019ve discovered that there aren\u2019t enough cool books for kids, and sadly, none are dedicated to the type forms that make up all these other books we read. For someone just starting out on a learning expedition, this thick, typographic forest of letters masked in different forms might be quite bewildering. Remember, these crazy shapes are everywhere!\nHow could I convey to him that this form of A should read the same way as this one? In short, I realized he needed to be indoctrinated--I mean, introduced into the wonderfully wild world of fonts. \nThat\u2019s where this new book, The Clothes Letters Wear, comes in. In it, I use the concept that fonts are the clothes that letters put on. It\u2019s a basic enough concept for even young children to grasp and appreciate, and it allows them to start to playing with their own creative ideas based on such a simple foundation. I designed this book, too, not only as a simple teaching tool for you to use with your children, but also to delight and entertain you. Yep, that\u2019s right; you the parent have a right to be entertained, too. And while a fantastic resource for any parent, I believe graphic designers in particular will find a great love for it. With it, they can easily show children how forms look different across typeface classifications as well as how each letter presents a world of possibilities. \nIt's a board book, measuring about 6 inches square, with beveled corners. It's plenty durable and able to take all kinds of abuse including, but not limited to, chewing, Roomba ingestion, and repeated readings at 5 A.M.\nIn the end, the book should give your kids (and yes, you) an appreciation for the craft and design of the actual letters themselves and provide you a book you can enjoy reading over and over together. \nI\u2019ve made the captivating illustrations bright and colorful, and the use of different letter forms makes for a fascinating read to delight ages young and young at heart. As an added bonus, this children\u2019s book has a custom designed font. I\u2019m always looking for an excuse to design a new font, and this book created the perfect alibi. Drum roll, please.\nI now give you . . . Cabrito (\u201clittle goat\u201d en Espanol). You can also get a free copy of the Regular Italic from MyFonts.com. Go ahead, I'll wait. \nThis new serif typeface incorporates the latest research on typographic legibility for children, features to make it--well, extra legible. A little background: studies show that Bookman Old Style is one of the most readable typefaces. This font became my initial framework for the typeface. Then, I found more legibility research saying that (brace yourselves) Comic Sans is also very legible for beginning readers, much due to the large x-height and softer, easily recognizable forms. In addition, forms that are closer to handwriting also seem to be more legible. Once I threw all that into my cauldron and stewed it a bit, the result was a pleasantly rounded typeface that includes not-so-strictly geometric, handwriting-inspired forms for the b, d, p, and q. Es guapo! \nThe typeface is fully featured and professional. I\u2019m selling the full version over on MyFonts.com. However, you can get it in a bundle with the book cheaper (though not quite as fast) here along with the book by pledging. The Pro version has over 48 different fonts including condensed and extended variants.\nApart from the book and the font, 11x17\u201d letterpressed posters of various characters from the book will be available, too, not to mention pledging through the Kickstarter is a great way to get deals on a number of other cool fonts.\nAt the base level, I\u2019m hoping for the support I need to make this book a reality, but really, I\u2019m preparing to aim for the stars on this one. I\u2019ve got some great stretch goals down the line as well. That last part may sound crazy, but I\u2019ll add in that this isn\u2019t my first rodeo. Some of you might know me from another Kickstarter, Chatype, which received international attention. The first one was a great success, and I\u2019m now able to put what I learned from the first one into organizing this new project.\nBut organization can get me only so far. I can\u2019t do this without you. The design\u2019s just about ready to go, and we\u2019re just about to start production. I now need your help to get The Clothes Letters Wear produced and into your child\u2019s hands (and like Will, in your child\u2019s mouth, too). This book is designed for you and your child to treasure for many years. We\u2019d like you to join us in making all this possible. \nFrom Will and I, a big thanks. We hope to hear from you soon.

A lot of Kickstarters fail or are delayed because they have \"too many moving parts.\" Being mindful of this, I\u2019ve tried to make the incentives as simple to produce as possible. One of the challenges will be the delivery time for the books. Currently, the partners that I\u2019ve lined up for production estimate six to eight weeks. I trust their estimates are accurate but am also mindful that there could be delays along the way: shipping, hurricanes, the occasional rogue goat who gets in the way and various kinds of typographic mishaps such as rouge rags, orphans, and widows.

We just need 23,000 more backers.\nSo, starting right now, we're adding an official $1 donor level. Get your friends to climb aboard, and help us make history! Also, starting today, Kickstarter backers are going to begin receiving exclusive for-your-eyes only content. You can get in on that with a simple $1 pledge! (And of course, if you've already donated, you're already on the exclusive update gravy wagon.) Plus, there'll be a backers-only treat tomorrow. I promise.\nYou guys are the best. Keep it up. Our love is epic. - Rob\nMarch 13\nWell, there's no other way to say it: wow. We asked for help, and you came through in the biggest way. It's hard to believe how fast we shattered some of Kickstarter's biggest records, but that's what you guys do. Us? We're just excited and grateful, and thrilled that so many of you want to go back to Neptune with us. But you know what? Now that we know what's possible, there's more work to do. $2,000,000 is just the beginning! We've got 30 days, and the more we raise, the bigger and better this movie will be. So, let's not pop the cork on this champagne yet. We still need you! Please keep it up, and we'll keep working to deserve your support.\n- Rob\n11 hours, you guys? Seriously? It only took you 11 HOURS to cross 2 million dollars? You speedy little marshmallows :) Words can't even express how excited we are. You came through, and I'll keep my promise too. We're going to make the best Veronica Mars movie anyone ever made, and the movie YOU deserve. Because YOU made this happen. But there's still time, and the more we raise, the better we can make it. All of the money you pledge this month goes right back into making this movie the one you've been waiting for, and the movie we've been waiting to make. So call your friends. Rally the troops. Lets break another record.\nLoVe always, \nkristen bell\nDay 1: Messages from Rob & Kristen\nAlmost since Veronica Mars went off the air, there's been talk of making a movie. In that span, I've taken different tactics in dealing with the question of whether it might happen. To be clear, I've always wanted to make a Veronica Mars movie. I love writing these characters and working with these actors. Kristen Bell has always wanted to make the movie.\nThere was a moment, a few years ago, when we thought we had a real shot at making it happen. I developed a pitch that revolved around graduation day at Hearst college -- Wallace and Mac were graduating at least, Veronica had been sidetracked by freeing Keith from prison. Plus, there was a murder in Neptune that was affecting the beach city's spring break business in much the same way a great white shark affected the beach community of Amity. I probably stoked fan fervor in my optimistic comments about the prospects. Warner Bros. wasn\u2019t convinced there was enough interest to warrant a major studio-sized movie about Veronica and the project never got off the ground.\nAfter that, I tried to tamp down expectations. I didn't want to be guilty \u2014 at least not twice \u2014 of building up hope when the odds seemed so long. Still, without fail, in every interview I do or every place I speak, I get the \"will there be a Veronica Mars movie?\" question. Even after a couple of years of downplaying the chances, I'd still run across blog postings headlined, \"will Rob Thomas shut up about the Veronica Mars movie, already!\" I was trying to. I promise. \nI first found out about Kickstarter a couple of years ago from an Austin musician friend of mine \u2014 Robert Harrison, lead singer of Cotton Mather, the band that gave us \"Lily Dreams On,\" our closing song of season 1. He financed a rerelease of the band's fantastic Kontiki album. Later, I was marveling about Kickstarter with another buddy of mine who said off-handedly, \"You should use Kickstarter to raise the money to make the Veronica Mars movie.\" I chuckled. That seemed like a silly idea in the moment. We'd need millions. But for the next few weeks, the notion was never far from my mind. I started doing the proverbial back-of-a-cocktail-napkin math. The average pledge on Kickstarter is $71. Hell, if we could get 30,000 people to give the average donation, we could finance the movie, particularly if the cast and I were willing to work cheap. The most common donation amount on Kickstarter is $25. Surely, 80,000 of our three million viewers would find that price-point viable! \nOf course, Warner Bros. still owns Veronica Mars and we would need their blessing and cooperation to pull this off. Kristen and I met with the Warner Bros. brass, and they agreed to allow us to take this shot. They were extremely cool about it, as a matter of fact. Their reaction was, if you can show there\u2019s enough fan interest to warrant a movie, we\u2019re on board. So this is it. This is our shot. I believe it's the only one we've got. It's nerve-wracking. I suppose we could fail in spectacular fashion, but there's also the chance that we completely revolutionize how projects like ours can get made. No Kickstarter project ever has set a goal this high. It's up to you, the fans, now. If the project is successful, our plan is to go into production this summer and the movie will be released in early 2014. \nLife has taken Veronica away from Neptune. In the years since spoiling Keith's chances to be reelected sheriff, Veronica hasn't taken a case. But something big is about to bring her back home and back to her calling. My goal is to include as many of your favorite characters as possible. It is, after all, time for Veronica\u2019s 10-year high school reunion. Keep in mind that the more money we raise, the cooler movie we can make. A two million dollar fundraising total probably means cross words are exchanged at the class reunion. Three million? We can afford a full-on brawl. Ten million? Who knows... For some reason the Neptune High class reunion takes place on a nuclear submarine! A Hobbit shows up! There\u2019s a Bollywood end-credit dance number! I\u2019ve always wanted to direct Bill Murray. We\u2019ll figure out something cool. Hey, if that total goes high enough, I\u2019ll bet the good folks at Warner Bros. will agree a sequel is a good idea.\nThanks to everyone who hasn't lost faith.\nRob\nDay 1: A Message from Kristen\ndearest marshmallows... \nI am currently the happiest blonde in a hamster ball the world has ever seen. We have been waiting so long to make this movie dream a movie reality, and it\u2019s because of YOUR commitment, YOUR persistence, that we finally have a chance. We just have one more step to go. \nYou have banded together like the sassy little honey badgers you are and made this possibility happen. i promise if we hit our goal, we will make the sleuthiest, snarkiest, it\u2019s-all-fun-and-games-\u2018til-one-of-you-gets-my-foot-up-your-ass movie we possibly can. \nI promise to give it my all. i promise to work my hardest to give everyone a little bit more Veronica, and i will be oh so honored to do so.  \nI only ask for one thing in return. \nIf I ever die, do me a favor. Go on Oprah and tell the world that I loved kittens. \nLoVe to you ALL, \nkristen bell \nMore Countries!

We're so happy to have you aboard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Veronica Mars movie project faces the usual risks of film and TV production \u2014 what if Kristen Bell joins a cult bent on the destruction of visual media? What if gangland enforcers break Rob\u2019s typing fingers? Never fear: we are offsetting those risks with production insurance, contingency plans, and a production team with decades of experience. \n \nOne of our biggest challenges is coordinating schedules. We only have a few weeks to shoot and most of our cast members have additional obligations. We\u2019re going to do our best to coordinate everyone\u2019s availability, and we think we\u2019ve figured out timing that works for most of the cast. We\u2019re going to do our best to include as many of your favorite characters as possible (we know that\u2019s important!) but it\u2019s possible that some actors won\u2019t be available during our shooting window.\n\nDistribution is always a challenge with low-budget films, but Warner Bros. is going to help us distribute the movie, and try to get it out there as widely as possible. \n\nWith respect to rewards fulfillment, we will be working with a professional fulfillment partner to get all your DVDs, digital downloads, and other goodies delivered safely and on schedule. \n\nI\u2019ll be sending regular updates about our progress to all backers, so you\u2019ll be the first to know about what\u2019s going on.\n\nImportant Information About Rewards\n\n\u00b7 Kickstarter campaign and rewards fulfillment limited to U.S. and Canada. \n\u00b7 Travel, lodging and transportation to events and set visits not included in any reward bundle\n\u00b7 Must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to attend events (premiere, set visit) \n\u00b7 Some rewards may require additional paperwork (to protect us and you)\n\u00b7 Distribution schedule not finalized, but Kickstarter backers at $35 and above will receive a digital version of the film within a few days of the theatrical premiere.

It'll be printed non-digitally with bright, beautiful colours, wrapped around by seven carefully-created hot-drink-relevant games - and a secret eighth game on the inside.\n(Pictures are mockups and may differ slightly from final print versions)\nTHE COASTERS\nThe coasters feature six different games: \"Coinflip Coasters\", \"That Wasn't Milk!\", \"The Winning Coaster\", \"Acrononymous\", \"Starting Sentences\", and \"Coastdown\".\nThe backs are crammed with mysterious symbols and sigils for use in the games - but you'll have to get the coasters to find out what they're for...\n(Pictures are mock-ups and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nTHE T-SHIRT\nThere's going to be a choice of t-shirt designs; one more graphical, and one crammed full of games. As you can see, this one's crammed with games:\nThere'll be five great games to play while you're out and about, printed on cotton t-shirts (choice of unisex and women's) with a big, bright, non-digital print. The t-shirts will ONLY EVER be available via this Kickstarter.\nCheck back next week for a look at the final t-shirt!\n(Picture is a mock-up and may differ slightly from the final print version)\nMore About Tiny Games\nWe're bringing together every kind of game you can think of: chase games, people-watching games, word games, creative games, shopping games, strategic games, storytelling games and a bunch more words we can't even think of right now. To get a better picture of what kind of games to expect, please watch the video above, plus you can download the complete rules for those games in this PDF.\nYou'll only need to read a few sentences of explanation for any given game; we're trying to create the maximum amount of fun for the minimum amount of rules-reading. You'll also get any digital tools you need to play whatever that game is - dice, spinners, timers and so on - and a record for posterity of the best bits of each game.\nInitially there'll be five locations for games: the home (further sub-divided into living room, kitchen, bathroom or bedroom), the pub, on the road (by bus or train or car), on a walk (whether in the city, the country, or a park), and in one other location to be chosen by a vote of our backers. \nThis is just the start - if successful, we're planning to add a load more games, locations, occasions, as well as special releases for holidays and events, all within the same fun, approachable framework. And to make sure it is fun and friendly, we're thrilled to be collaborating with IGF-nominated art director Luke Whittaker of State of Play Games on the visual design. \nWe're Hide&Seek, an award-winning game design studio based in London and New York. A lot of the games we\u2019ve made haven\u2019t been videogames: they've been games you play in the real world. If you're interested, have a look at the game we ran for 12,000 players in Edinburgh on New Year's Day; or the festival we put on at the Southbank Centre.\nTiny Games in London\nWe've already polished the format of Tiny Games through a lot of practice. Last year, we made 99 Tiny Games for all 33 boroughs of London, in the form of vinyl posters that went up in parks and on busy shopping streets. The project was an amazing success, described as \"brilliantly innovative\" by The Guardian Gamesblog and featured in Wired and the Wall Street Journal. You can read more about the history of Tiny Games here.\nWe've made and distributed our own games before, most notably with the Board Game Remix Kit, which uses four boardgames we've all got and remixes them to create 25 exciting new games, tweaks and mash-ups. BoingBoing called it \"the most insanely clever Christmas gift idea of the year\".\nWe want to encourage real-world play everywhere, not just where we are. That's why we're making this app. \nAccessibility and Settings\nThe app will have persistent settings that help it to choose the right game for you - if you can't run, say, or if you're colourblind, or you're mostly playing with kids and you don't want any games that might tend to the risque, then you can tell the app and it'll take that into account when it works out what game you should play.\nTo make the Tiny Games experience as good as it can possibly be, we need your help.\nWe need the wonderful people of Kickstarter to help us shape the app itself!  We'll be opening up the development process to all our backers - sharing game rules, builds, and design progress blogs - and we'll be depending on feedback from you to help make everything amazing. We hope you'll get involved in playtesting games, letting us know when our explanations aren't clear, guiding the choice of locations that you want to play Tiny Games in. It'll be super fun.\nAnd then, obviously, well, we need money. To make this app as beautiful as it can be, stuffing it with games, pumping it full of tools to help those games run smoothly.\nWe'll use the money for a few different things: \nVisuals. We're a small studio without an in-house designer, and we want Tiny Games to be beautiful. We've got UX experts and amazing artist Luke Whittaker on board, but we need to be able to pay them.\nMore development time. We've made a prototype of the game, and begun refining how it works in practice, but we need to do more work to make sure it's exactly as smooth and seamless and effective as possible.\nMore games. We've designed a lot of Tiny Games already, somewhere in the low to mid hundreds, and we're adding to that number every day, but in order to have a genuine range of games for you - wherever you are, however many people are with you, whatever mood you're in and whatever props you have to hand - we're going to need more than \"a lot\" - we're going to need absolutely loads, and that takes time. We need to playtest, polish and refine, and that takes time too. \n\nWe want the app to be as good as possible and in your hands as soon as possible. We're asking for the smallest amount of money we can honestly do that for.\nWe don't want to get too ahead of ourselves, but we need to lay out some important info about this Kickstarter and about platforms in particular. The \u00a325k target enables us to ship this app on iOS only.

Job Hunters focuses on one \"rag-tag\" group of hunters during their down time spent in a government-sanctioned safe house. Season One was funded entirely on Kickstarter and received over 300,000 video views and gained a subscriber base of over 14,000. \nHaven't seen Season One? It only takes an hour. Catch up here. \nWe want to make Season Two even bigger and better and need your help to make that happen. Read on to find out more about us, our plans, and our sweet incentives!\nSTRETCH GOAL: \nWe've reached our goal but we're not finished! \n$55,000: We'll film an Arena Live Show in character\nIt'll be like our live show today, but outside, in the arena, and in character. It'll give you a chance to see what it's really like in the arena, and will give you a chance to chat with MAEWIN!\nWho are you guys, anyway?\nJob Hunters is created by a group of writers, actors, and filmmakers in Seattle, WA. The core consists of:\nKristina Horner (Producer/Avery): italktosnakes. Tweet her.\nForest Gibson (Producer/Devon): Cinesaurus. Tweet him.\nTara Theoharis (Producer/Tiffany): The Geeky Hostess. Tweet her.\nLiz Leo (Producer/Art Director): OneUpMakeup. Tweet her.\nWhy do you want my money?\nWe created our first season with about $14,000 and a crew entirely made of volunteers. We want to bring a more rigorous schedule to Season Two and we need the funds to deliver you bigger, better stories from the characters you love.\nTake a look at our cost breakdown: \nWe know $50,000 may seem like a lot to some of you, but compared to a traditional television or film production, it\u2019s still very bare-bones. This is still a labor of love made on borrowed time, so we need your help to get us the rest of the way.\nOne of the things that excites us most about Season Two is the chance to get our fans involved in a bigger way. You\u2019ll notice many of our incentives have a level of engagement that allow you to feel like you\u2019re a character in the show - or for a large enough donation, actually become one!\nWe are also interested in working with companies for a corporate donation. If you are interested in a larger corporate donation or sponsorship and would like to chat details with us, please send us a message.\nWhat\u2019s the production status?\nWith Kickstarter funding, we plan on beginning filming in June. Without funding, we will not be able to create Season Two.\nHow do I find out more about you?\nYou can see Season One of Job Hunters at our YouTube channel!  \nFollow Job Hunters on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr to stay in touch with our production, or bookmark our website.\nWe are so excited to bring the characters of Job Hunters back on screen to continue telling their story, and we appreciate your help in making it happen.

Almost immediately we realized we wanted to do the show again, and we knew we'd have to do it BIGGER with more artists, more posters, and most importantly -- more places. The National Poster Retrospecticus Tour was born...\nIn April of 2013 we'll be taking this tour on the road to seven different cities, returning home to an extended show in Boston. We'll be driving the posters around, setting up the show for a one night event in each city, taking it down and moving on to the next one! \nBurlington, VT - April 3\nRochester, NY - April 6\nDetroit, MI - April 10\nMinneapolis, MN - April 13\nSt. Louis, MO - April 16\nRichmond, VA - April 20\nBoston, MA - May 3\nThe show this year will feature over 300 posters from more 75 different artists, nearly doubling the size of last years show -- and will include work from such Amazing Artists as Daniel Danger, Aaron Draplin, Dan McCarthy, Aesthetic Apparatus and TONS more.\nBUT WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!\nThis is the first year of the tour and we have a lot of costs to cover to get the tour going, as we are hoping to make it an annual event and go to even more cities the next year (Hawaii? Alaska?? Deep South??? West Coast????). There are transportation costs, including the vehicle, gas, tolls, and building the travel cases to carry close to 10,000 posters (including the back stock), insurance on the posters, shipping, promotion, and cataloging the tour -- plus a lot more and it's adding up. We will need around $20,000 to make it happen, and have set our KickStarter goal as 15,000 to get us started. The more help we get from you -- the more successful the tour will be! After the tour wraps up our goal is only to recover our expenses and make no profit.\nThe tour happening is the ultimate reward for us, the galleries we get to go to, and the people who get to enjoy the show -- but there also a lot of great rewards you can get for contributing. From NPR merchandise like t-shirts, postcards, stickers, and buttons to a limited edition series of posters made for each stop on the tour to ultimately, owning all 300 posters from the show -- we have you covered.

We feel we are well equipped and excited for the challenge, between the three of us we have a combined experience in planning and hanging gallery shows, promoting events for both art and music, and touring the country with bands. The National Poster Retrospecticus is the ultimate culmination of our experience. We have already secured the galleries in all the cities we are visiting, as well as many of the artists who will be participating. The galleries seemed like the biggest hurdle for us, getting people to sign on to an event that hasn't really happened yet, and with no precedent. Now that the tour definitely has places to go and posters to bring to them, it's about coordinating the details and funding the proper amount so we can make sure it happens.

Our next move: Pushing others to jump out of their comfort zones, too, and writing and designing the hell out of the results. For the next month, we will crash on one issue of a magazine. No salaries, no health care, no ergonomic office chairs. No foundation grants, no advisory boards, no independently wealthy vanity investors\u2014for now, at least. That means no filler, no product placement, no luxury gift guides. It means we won\u2019t be afraid to publish things that are complicated or sexy or weird... the kinds of things that might just get you fired. (We\u2019ve been there.)

Lathrop, Zak Stone, and Nona Willis Aronowitz. We spent most of our waking hours together at GOOD magazine until six of us were fired and two more quit in June 2012.

Today\u2019s dilemmas deserve fresh eyes liberated from the tired status quo of superficial journalism, boring narratives, and old ideas about what works. We\u2019ll take a look around the corner to bring you stories about the people, the movements, and the trends that are tearing the world down and building it anew.\n\nTomorrow will be available on the web, but first it\u2019ll be published as a treasure-it-forever print issue. We\u2019ll give you 100 oversize pages of reporting and essays, plus full-color photos, illustrations, and infographics. This is print, after all\u2014we might as well go big or go home.\n\nTomorrow\u2019s first edition will be printed and shipped to your door in fall 2012. A launch party in Los Angeles will follow. Arrange your hangover burrito plans now.\n\nWhere will the money go?\nThe $15,000 will fund production, web design and hosting, tech needs, postage, and one amazing launch party. We'll print enough magazines so everyone who orders an issue gets one. But if you exceed our expectations, we\u2019ll exceed yours. If we raise more than $15,000, we'll be able to compensate contributors and ourselves\u2014at least a little. If we raise even more than that, the publication will get even better.\n\nWhat is Tomorrow\u2019s future?\nWe\u2019re committed to making at least one issue\u2014but we\u2019re open to more.

They are designers who dream big and burn the midnight oil to forge their own paths. \nIn December 2011, we started the blog, 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship where we share our process and research for the book. Each day, we post an inspiring story, article, or interview on design entrepreneurship. We have worked hard to curate interesting content and the outpouring of kind words that we've received has reinforced our excitement for the project.\nThe blog presents short, inspirational excerpts from our discussions. The printed book expands on these conversations and presents long-format features, interviews, pivotal essays, original writing, and interludes from the Kern and Burn authors. \nWe encourage our peers to challenge the traditional role of graphic designers by presenting the perspectives and experiences of those who have used design to do more. We celebrate designers who solve big problems, aim to delight their audiences, make meaningful work that benefits others, and most importantly, live their lives to the fullest. We believe good design is all about good people. Our book is about good people who happen to be designers.\nWe have talked to design leaders and innovators at startups like Twitter, Airbnb, and Kickstarter, founders such as Khoi Vinh and Cameron Koczon, designers that craft products like Peter Buchanan-Smith and Studio Neat, those who champion side projects like SwissMiss and Christian Helms, and those who believe in the importance of writing and self-publishing, like The Manual. See our website for a complete list of contributors. We will continue to add new contributors as we progress through the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship.\nWe're honored to share their stories with our readers. The launch of our Kickstarter project marks the beginning of a wonderful collaboration with an even larger community. As always, thanks for joining us on the journey.\nThe Book\nWe are making a book that captures the energy and excitement of design entrepreneurs. A book that inspires the design community to Kern and Burn\u2014to perfect our craft and to work obsessively hard. It is a book that focuses on designers' lives, decisions, and aspirations rather than their techniques and color palettes. A book that challenges our peers to believe in themselves, and think about their lives as a design problem.\nAs we make our way through the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship we edit our discussions, curate our interviews, compile essays, reflect on what we've learned, and work to craft a book that is as beautiful as our content is rich. The format and narrative of the book will evolve through the process.\nThe book's title is also in the works, we'll announce it when the time is right! We've adopted the startup mentality and are putting this project out there before it's perfect, packaged, and ready to ship, (heck, before it even has a title), but we like that. That means we get the chance to involve the design community in our design process, the book's production, and we get to share the reward of creating something meaningful, together.\nRewards\nIf we reach our goal, with your contribution, we will use the funding to hire an editor, refine our design, and begin production.\nOur reward levels include some fun additions to the printed book, including a digital copy, a small-format process book with highlights from the 100 Days of Design Entrepreneurship, a letterpress pica ruler bookmark (for the Kern in all of us), and a series of hand-pulled screen printed posters.\nSupporters will receive exclusive updates as we develop the book. We encourage your feedback throughout the process, and are excited to see it all take shape.\nKern and Burn Team\nKern and Burn is a collaboration between Jessica Karle Heltzel and Tim Hoover. They are both finishing their MFA degrees in graphic design at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).\nThanks to Public School and Christian Helms for starring in the video, and Eric R.

You all gave this movie a green light - thank you! Please continue to share until the last second at 11:59:00PM EST. We'd love to go over the goal to help pay for some of the Kickstarter fees and put the full amount raised towards the film.\nPlease share our press release with any blogs or newspapers you think might be interested in covering our last two days: http://bit.ly/xaj5pO\nIntroduction\nHello! Whether you\u2019re a fan of Improv Everywhere or learning about us for the first time today, thank you for visiting this page. We\u2019re close to being finished with our feature-length documentary film which chronicles the global impact of Improv Everywhere. The director of the film, Matt Adams, has been producing the project on his own up until now, but it has grown so much in scope that we need to reach out to our Internet fan base to help us make this film a reality.\nDirector's Statement\nWhen I started working with Improv Everywhere, I was also working a full-time office job. The job enabled me to purchase some professional audio/video equipment and pursue filmmaking in my free time.\nAfter saving up for close to a year and doing my best to make Improv Everywhere videos look as good as I possibly could, I left my day job and decided to give all my attention to the group.\n\nIn the 3 years since I left my job, the videos that I've produced with Improv Everywhere founder Charlie Todd and edited from my Brooklyn apartment have been seen by over 100 million people. \nAs I continued to work with Improv Everywhere, I realized that there was a whole other story about the group that hadn\u2019t been told. I began interviewing people that had been involved with Improv Everywhere from the start about their personal experiences. The stories were so fascinating that I immediately knew that I had to make a feature-length documentary film that told the behind-the-scenes story of the group. \n\nWhat am I supporting? \nEditingWhile many post production services have been donated to the film, we still need to rent facilities and hire additional editors.\nAnimationsTo help illustrate certain points throughout the film, we will create custom animations, graphics, and images.\nSound MasteringWe really want this film to sound great. We will professionally master the entire soundtrack for theatrical, online and DVD viewing.\nComposerWe\u2019d love to hire a composer to create an awesome original score for the film.\nClosed CaptioningImprov Everywhere wouldn\u2019t be what it is without our international audience and we want to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to see this film with captions in their native language. By helping fund closed captioning, our film will be accessible to the hearing impaired and foreign language speakers.\nTravelTo complete our interviews, we need to purchase tickets for travel and lodging. Additionally, once the film is complete, the team needs to travel with the film to various film festivals with hopes to get it seen by as many people as possible.\nEquipment and Expendables\nAlthough we are using mostly all of our own equipment, we still need to purchase media to store all of the footage and need to maintain all the equipment that we do have to continue the ongoing post-production process.\n\nWebsite & Digital DownloadThroughout the post production and film release, we will need to maintain our website and pay for bandwith charges.\nFootage Rights Improv Everywhere made a television pilot in 2007, and the rights belong to the network.  There is raw footage in the network\u2019s possession that we haven\u2019t even seen. Our goal is to get access and rights to all the footage from this pivotal moment in Improv Everywhere\u2019s history to tell the most engaging story possible.\nFAQ\nDo you have to reach your goal? Yes. We need to reach or exceed our goal in order to keep any of the pledges for the film. If we don\u2019t reach our goal, no one will be charged for their pledge and it will be as if the whole thing never happened. It\u2019s all or nothing!\nWhat happens if you exceed the goal amount? So happy you asked! If we exceed our goal by enough, we will use that money to stage and document one brand new prank from the planning process, all the way to the final cut. We want to take the audience through something where we have no clue how it will turn out! We can\u2019t tell you what the idea is, but we will document all aspects of it and interview everyone involved.\nWhat\u2019s the release date? As of now, we\u2019re looking at festival release in March of 2013\nWill the DVD be playable on my player/computer? Yes, we will be making the DVDs region free.\nCan I give my reward as a gift? Yes, you can purchase a pledge and gift it to someone else. They will be notified about the gift and who it was from. We can even ship them their reward if you leave us a note.\nMORE\nBelow are some examples of our rewards: \nBelow are a few images of our talented friends who appear on the film:\n___________________________________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Extra Features & Rewards Delivered!", "update_content": "We\u2019re thrilled to announce all Kickstarter rewards have been shipped!

So no, not just a solar lamp, there\u2019s lot\u2019s more to this than meets the eye: patented chip  technology, accessories, social aspects, but you need to know a little bit of background first.\n\nIf you didn\u00b4t check out the INTROMOVIE pls check out this 2 minute info and you know what you need to know.\nstate-of-the-art\nWe want to change the lives of 1.5 billion people! Ambitious? yes! Neccessary? yes! If you don't reach for the stars, you'll never reach the sky.\nSo what did we do? We designed the coolest looking solar LED lamp and we called it \u2018WAKAWAKA\u2019 which means \u2018Shine Bright\u2019 in Swahili. We were inspired by Shakira\u2019s song and we\u2019re grateful that she\u2019s not objecting to use this world famous phrase from her World Cup song \u00b4This Time for Africa\u00b4.\nWhy is it cool looking? Because we want WAKAWAKA to become a success in the US and Europe as well. We hope YOU like it for example. And if YOU like WAKAWAKA, than so will someone in Kenya, Tanzania, India or Haiti. (we know)\nPeople who live at the \u00b4Bottom of the Pyramid\u00b4 cannot afford anything, right? WRONG\u2026 Moreover, since they live off less than $ 2.00 a day, they are the most critical consumers you can imagine. They would like to have what we have, but for a rock-bottom price because they cannot afford more. The market for solar lamps in Africa is growing at a staggering rate of 450% per year currently, proving there is acceptance and willingness, but there is a lot of junk on the market which doesn't work properly. We want to take a 'solar lamp' to the next level. So, that\u00b4s why we developed this cool looking, top quality and super efficient solar LED light!\nIt was designed by Studio Kalkwijk in such a way that it can fit on a bottle. Not only allows this for a more compact and mobile design, but it also helps to recycle bottles and ... it opens up opportunities for new distribution channels as a promotional tool.\nEventually we will be able to manufacture WAKAWAKA at such a low price (in some countries assembled locally), that we can actually offer it to people in rural areas for less than $ 10.00 which is the equivalent of 2-3 months worth of toxic, dangerous lighting fuels.\nSo\u2026 is WAKAWAKA also for you???\nYES! It's designed for rather severe working conditions.  You can image rural Africa can be rather extreme. WAKAWAKA makes for a convenient camping torch, outdoor must-have, or bedside reading light. It\u2019s equipped with a high performance replaceable battery which will last for several years if used on a daily basis. Should it run on empty when you don\u00b4t use it for a couple of months, all you need to do is charge it in the sun for a couple of hours and you\u00b4re good to go.\nMOBILE PHONE BATTERY CHARGER\nAnd\u2026 the best is \u2026 that you will be able to charge your mobile phone battery with it! No matter where you are, as long as you have a WAKAWAKA nearby you will always have a charger with you. You need to take out the battery from your cell phone (sorry iPhone users, it\u00b4s a bit tough for the iPhone, no offence, but people living off less than $2 a day cannot afford iPhones in most cases, hence the design) and you plug it into the battery holder. Now you\u00b4re charging 3.7V directly instead of 5V which is normally the case. You\u00b4re charging far more efficient (and faster) now. (it will fit 80+% of the most commonly used cell phone battery brands) . By the end of 2012 we plan on introducing a slightly more expensive model which can actually charge phones directly (this one WILL include iPhones, Blackberries and so on).\nWHY DO WE NEED YOUR HELP?\nWe have come a long way with our own pocket money so far. We\u00b4ve spent almost a whole year on research preparations, design and engineering. We invested in the initial prototypes (which we got at a bargain price) but fact is that we\u00b4re nearly out of cash. Yes, we\u00b4ve talked to Venture Capitalists, but they ask for such a large stake in the project that we would loose our grip on it. Kickstarter is a fantastic community for us which will help us realize the ideals and dreams we have which are needed in the world, but are not always the ideal investment object for large corporations. We believe that the power of 'YOU' will bring these ideas to a mature level where they can start making a difference. By pledging at least $ 35.00 you are pre-ordering your WAKAWAKA and with $ 50.00 we can start developing the battery charger as well, which we will send you as soon as it's ready. Pledge for an Exclusive or Limited Edition WAKAWAKA and you will receive a personalized, certified WAKAWAKA. A collectors item, 'one of a kind'! And we will be forever grateful!  \nYou are helping us creating a major impact on the lives of millions and you get the benefits from it as well. classic win-win!\nEXTRA REWARD ADDED $ 125.00 : donate a WakaWaka to a school in Kenya\nWe added an extra reward on special request. We got quite a few inquiries from people who wanted us to donate WakaWaka's as well. For this purpose we have located a school in Kenya, the Mwamtsefu school to be precise. With your help we will first help the teachers with a light so they can check homework in the evening. By now so many people have pledged for this reward that we can now also support students who will bring WakaWaka home, which has a direct impact on their living environment and school results! We sincerely hope we can provide lights for the entire school! with your help, we can!\nThis is where the school is located. South East Kenya, close to the Tanzanian border.\nThese are the teachers together with Willie from The Netherlands. Her Wenzi Foundation (www.wenzi.nl) supports the school with housing, materials, furniture and so on. Together with us she helps ensure your WakaWaka\u00b4s will end up in the right hands!\nBelow: a few of the 700 kids at the Mwamtsefu school. We already have enough WakaWaka\u00b4s to give all of the students in this picture a study light!\nSchool provides free meals.   \nSince there are not enough class rooms yet, most kids follow class outside under the trees.\nThanks to all your donation pledges we will be able to provide a very substantial number of these students with a WakaWaka solar Light. They will be able to study in the evening, teachers will be able to work after dark and this will have a major impact on the community! We will keep you informed when the lights arrive!\nWHERE DOES YOUR MONEY GO?  \nWe are preparing for production of the first couple of hundred WakaWaka's. These need to be tested. End of January we have a field test scheduled in South Africa as well as in Kenya with Unilever! Yes, we're very proud to have accomplished this already at this stage! However, funding through Kickstarter is a precondition that we can actually make the moulds and finish our engineering on time so we can actually make the units we need for testing. A successful test will lead to a first substantial order!\nYour WAKAWAKA will be among the first ones coming from the first production run after we\u00b4ve improved the design as a result of those field tests.\nWho\u00b4s on the team?\n\nWe\u00b4re a bunch of enthusiasts, but all with serious backgrounds and an idealistic drive. Let\u00b4s introduce ourselves (from right to left on the picture):\n\nMAURITS GROEN\nHis last name means \u00b4green\u00b4 and it so suits him. As a result of his 35 years experience in environmental policy and consultancy people call him a \u00b4green Guru\u00b4, because his whole life is devoted to raising awareness on sustainability \u2013 and doing something about it. He rides a foldable bike to his meetings and takes the train with it no matter where he needs to go unless there is really no other way. He lectures frequently on topics such as climate change, sustainable food supply and energy efficiency and he\u00b4s being consulted by people from all walks of life. A networking WAKAWAKA inspirator we would like to call him.\n\nKIM VAN DER LEEUW\nKim\u00b4s earliest memories are of colourful, fragrant, lively visions of India where he spent part of his youth. Ultimately it was this that led to his a masters in environment & resource management. He has become an expert on reducing carbon emissions. In 2010 he coordinated the program to offset the national carbon emissions of the World Cup soccer in South Africa. Kim is a social entrepreneur with great spirit and experience on the ground in Africa with a wide variety of projects. WAKAWAKA is the project he has been waiting for all his life. \n\n\nCAMILLE VAN GESTEL\nA driving force. His passion for WAKAWAKA and the purpose behind it, releases an energy which affects the whole team the most positive way. He\u2019s had over a decade experience with product development, production coordination, project management and sales. His business education and broad working experience all seem to come together in WAKAWAKA.\n\nTogether we have what it takes to co-create the success for WAKAWAKA it so needs in order to reach out to those 1.5 billion people who don\u2019t have a light, who breath toxic air every day, get burned and waste money they don\u2019t have on it. It\u2019s this picture we keep in mind when we get up in the morning.\nONE MORE NOTE\nShould we raise more than our fundraising goal, than we can proceed with development of the 2nd product, which will have a direct 5V out option which you can use to charge practically any kind of phone. As our kickstarting funder we will give you the first chance to get your hands on these as well! And of course will know it first when new accessories come out!\nAlso we can start hiring people in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia to start up their own WAKAWAKA business and \u2018spread the light\u2019 into \u2018Dark Africa\u2019. We need to set up distribution networks and we want to pay people a decent salary for helping us.\n\nThanks so much for reading our story! We hope you will help us, help them. Get your first WAKAWAKA before it hits the market! We will be back with more info here soon!\n\nWarm wishes,\nMaurits, Kim, Paul & Camille\n__________________________________________________________\nFOR OUR FANS :\nThis is our WAKAWAKA partner mr.

I'm an independent illustrator and designer living in CT, and for the past four years, I've been drawing something, anything, every Monday through Friday. December 21st marks my 1000th daily drawing. 1000th is a weird word, so that will be the last time I use it here.\nSince around Daily Drawing 217 I started thinking about putting together a book featuring all of my Dailies. At the time, I told myself I needed so many more drawings. At around Daily Drawing 493 I decided 1000 would be the right number. As I approached Daily Drawing 900 I started sweating profusely and wondering what I'd gotten myself into. ALAS, THE DAY IS UPON US! (I say 'us' to make you all feel involved, but really the day is upon me.)\nI'm not ashamed to say I want your help self-publishing this book because I want full control over the final product. The Daily Drawing project has changed my life in several significant ways and I need to honor that by putting out the product I want to put out. (Don't worry editors, I'm totally willing to let you have the reins on future projects.) Drawing every night gave me the confidence to move away from graphic design and towards illustration professionally, and to take the scary leap to freelancing full-time. All the projects I started getting as a result of my dailies didn't hurt either! Though these drawings cover a broad spectrum of topics and content they also serve as a memoir for the past 4 years of my life. I'm hoping to raise $5,500, which will be enough to print and bind the book. I've been staying up all hours to get the files organized (1000 is a lot!) and the pages laid out, and it's starting to take shape. If all continues as planned, 1000 Days of Drawing by Chris Piascik will be on bookshelves and coffee tables sometime in March.\nOver the years I have done a lot with these drawings. I've created a handful of zines\u2014one featured all of Major Taylor's guidelines for Good Habits and Clean Living. \nAnother was a collection of drawings documenting every bicycle I have ever owned\u2014and it's been a lot. \nI've done 4 different zines focused on hand-lettering. I've also screenprinted a bunch.\nMy good friend Stebs of Paper Fortress fame even made a video of me doing a drawing for Halloween a couple years back. Check it out!:\nThat video has had over 50k views! It was featured on Boing Boing and Draw!\nHow about some interesting statistics? \nThere are 8 sections in the book:\n1. Quotes \u2013 138 drawings\n2. Characters \u2013 140 drawings\n3. Improvised \u2013 124 drawings\n4. Bikes \u2013 48 drawings\n5. Music \u2013 111 drawings\n6. Politics \u2013 121 drawings\n7. Complaining \u2013 123 drawings\n8. Random \u2013 195 drawings\nMaybe a little more bragging... my drawings have been featured in/on Print Magazine, Boing Boing, Fast Company, The Daily What, Moveon.org, DefGrip, Prolly Is Not Probably, My Love For You, LetterCult, Lettering Beyond Computer Graphics, The New Twenties, Drawn and more!\nSo a book, right?

People just like you--maybe even you yourself--sent us soaring to nearly 300% of our funding goal and helped put Clever Mojo Games on the map! Now we're back with an all-new board game called Sunrise City.  Take a look at the video above to get an idea of what Sunrise City is all about.\nGo ahead...I'll wait.\nSo, Sunrise City is a role selection, tile-laying, city-building board game. It's simple enough for kids of a reasonable age, friendly enough for family game night, and meaty enough for experienced gamers. It can be played by two, three, or four players and, depending on your experience, is playable in 60 to 90 minutes.\nAs you saw, a game of Sunrise City is played in three rounds and each round has four phases: Role Selection, Zoning, Bidding, and Construction. You can download the Prototype Rule Book PDF for all of the details, but lets take a quick look at each phase, below.\nAt the beginning of the game, before any of the rounds or phases start, each player is dealt four role cards.  From those four they select one card and pass the remainders left. They select a second card from the three cards they receive from the player on their right and again pass the remainders left. Finally, they select a third card from the two handed to them from the player on their right and return the unchosen cards to the game box. This is a simple draft and allows each player to choose their roles from nine possible cards. In the three rounds that make up a game of Sunrise City, the players will each choose one of their roles to use for the entire round and then discard it when the round is over. \nAt the top of each role card is a number. The player with the lowest role number each round will go first in each of that round's phases. At the bottom of each card is a description of that role's special ability. It could be a unique scoring opportunity, a means of harassing the other players, or a chance to bend the game rules in some special fashion. In general, the lower numbered cards have weaker role abilities, but give the player an increased chance of going first.\nAfter players have been dealt four zone tiles and four building tiles and chosen their role for the round, the zoning phase begins. Starting with the player with the lowest role card number, players take turns adding zone tiles to the city. Each tile represents a residential, commercial, industrial, parks & rec, or mixed use zone. \nAny zone type can be placed next to any other zone type, but the goal is to form zone combinations that match the building tiles in your hand so you can score points in the construction phase. Placing zone tiles adjacent to same-type zones already on the table will create a \"district\" and earn the player extra points.\nMixed in with the zone tiles are community tiles: Cathedral, Emporium, Fire Station, Zoo, and Police Station. These are the infra-structure of the city and they earn players extra points when they place certain building tiles in the areas surrounding the community tiles.\nAfter the players have added all of their zone tiles to the city, the bidding phase begins. Players are bidding to control the undeveloped zones so that they can construct buildings on them in the next phase. \nThe bidding system is simple, transparent, and cutthroat! Each player has a stack of six bid tokens and they take turns stacking them on undeveloped zones. To outbid another player you just stack your token on top of theirs. A player can \"close\" a bid by stacking one of their bid tokens on top of a bid stack where they already have the top bid. When the bidding is complete the markers on top of each stack are the winners and the markers underneath are returned to their players.\nEach building tile is made up of two building types that match the zone types mentioned earlier. When both buildings on the tile are the same type, the tile shows one larger building but it still counts as a separate building for placement and scoring. Each building tile also has three score numbers on it. The center number is scored by the player who adds the building tile to the city. The side numbers are scored by the players who controls the zone tiles on which the building is placed.\nIn the construction phase, there are two ways to add a building tile to the city. Placing a building tile directly on the zone tiles is \"ground floor construction\". The player must have one of their bid markers on at least one of the zone tiles on which the building tile is placed and the zone types much match the building types on both halves of the building tile. Placing a building tile on top of an existing building tile is \"upper floor construction\". In this situation, both halves of the new building tile must match the building types of the tile on which it is being placed. The player scores only the center number on the building tile and the side numbers are ignored. Bonus points are earned for adding odd numbered floors (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc...)\nThe community tiles that were added to the city during the zoning phase also affect scoring, giving a player an extra point if a matching type building tile is placed in an area surrounding the community tile.\nSo, there are lots of scoring opportunities, but what does that actually mean? Each player tracks their score on a ten-point score track, working their marker up the track for each point they earn. If a player's marker overshoots the top of the track, their marker wraps around and starts climbing again and the player earns one benchmark token. However, if the player's score marker lands on the star at the top of the score track by exact count, they earn two benchmark tokens. The player with the most benchmarks at the end of the third round is the winner.\nSunrise City is not a simple race for the most points, it a contest to grow the city in a manner that allows you to score the right number of points at the right time so that you can maximize your collection of benchmarks.\nThe Springboard Seal of Quality is your assurance that a new game project is worth your time and attention. All titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by the game professionals at Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, Game Salute works with the publisher to ensure solid designs, thorough play testing, excellent presentation, and high quality components.\nThis Kickstarter funding project for individual gamers like you, is the first step in the overall Springboard campaign for Sunrise City. If we are successfully funded here on Kickstarter, the Springboard campaign will continue on to Phase II, a limited-time opportunity for retailers all around the world to get Sunrise City and the promotional exclusives.\nWe recognize and appreciate the important role that our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers are playing in the launch of Sunrise City and the success of Clever Mojo Games. Therefore, we make the following promises to you:\nThe promo cards and tiles noted as EXCLUSIVE will remain exclusive. We promise not to sell them individually or as a set, and not to include them as a part of any game expansion or re-printing. Once the Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers have received their exclusive items they will NEVER be re-printed.\nSunrise City will be shipped to Kickstarter Backers at least two weeks before the items are available for purchase at ANY convention or store. Actual delivery dates will vary depending on your local postal service.\nStores who participate in Game Salute Preview Nights for Sunrise City will receive a preview copy for their Game Library in advance of the scheduled release date. \nI know this page is already three miles long, but I've got a lot to say. Below you will find some information about the variety of rewards available at the different pledge levels. From exclusive cards and tiles, to apparel, trinkets, art, and even your own image on a Role Card, I think we have something for everyone.\nWe have a set of nine EXCLUSIVE items for our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers. The primary character and building art is finished but the frame and borders are still being polished.\nFour Role Cards:\nDetective allows you to combine your zone tiles and the zone tiles of another player, choose the four you want to keep, and give the remaining four back to that other player.\nCity Planner allows you to rotate any zone tiles you control, thus changing the road layouts and possible zone combinations before you place building tiles on them.\nForeign Investor earns you floor points for even numbered floors. You already earn points for odd numbered floors, so now you'll be able to earn a bonus for every upper floor you add to the city.\nRe-Elected Socialite is a great last-round role as she allows you to choose a role card from any role that any players used in a previous round.\nFive Community Tiles:\nPower Plant subtracts a point for any Residential Building added in a surrounding area.\nUniversity subtracts a point for any Commercial Building added in a surrounding area.\nTheatre subtracts a point for any Parks & Rec Building added in a surrounding area.\nLibrary subtracts a point for any Industrial Building added in a surrounding area.\nStadium subtracts a point for any Mixed Use Building added in a surrounding area.\nWhat better way to show your support for Sunrise City than to wear a handsome, high-quality ball cap with an embroidered Sunrise City logo there for all to see and admire? The CITY PATRON levels are all about the cap, but the GROUND BREAKER and CIVIC LEADER pledge levels can add a cap to their other rewards for a small increase in the pledge amounts. The CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels include the caps. \nWhen you're sitting around the gaming table and telling everyone how you were the key to Sunrise City's success, you can dazzle your gaming buddies by pointing out the Sunrise City Key To The City lapel pin that you're wearing. The Key To The City Pin is included in the GROUND BREAKER, CIVIC LEADER, CITY SOCIALITE, and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels. This brass and enamel pin will become a treasured keepsake and make you the envy of all who game with you.\nIf you have a game room then you're definitely going to want some game art to hang on the walls, and we've got you covered.  We're making arrangements with Panda Games Manufacturing to set aside uncut printer sheets of role cards and building tiles for those Backers who pledge at the CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER levels. I don't have the exact dimensions of the sheets yet, but I expect they'll be at least 20\"x30\".  Your friends will certainly appreciate your taste in art.\nThere are vanity license plates, and vanity book publishers, but those are nothing in comparison to a board game component! As part of the CITY FOUNDER pledge level, we will draw your likeness in the game's snazzy style, and put you on the Role Card of your choice. Four of those cards are already taken by the members of our design team, but that leaves 16 cards for you to choose from. Role Card choices will be awarded in a first-pledge first-drawn basis, so bid early for the best choices.\nSo, if you're reading this, you've slogged through three miles of text and we've had our chance to show you what Sunrise City is all about. Now, it's all up to you! Sunrise City will only go to press if gamers like yourself step up and say \"Yes, I want to play this game and here's my money!\" \nCan we count on your pledge?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Sunrise City: Nights!", "update_content": "Just wanted to pop over to the original Sunrise City backers to let you know that the first full expansion for Sunrise City is now live on Kickstarter.\nSunrise City: Nights!\nClick on over and take a look and please do spread the word."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Sunrise City: Nightlife", "update_content": "A great big hello to all of you original Sunrise City backers.

Our students deal with a host of urban and economic challenges while receiving an education that makes them competitive in the 21st century job market. There are high rates of poverty and crime in the community, and there is little investment by public or private enterprise to create job opportunities.\nOne of the biggest things my students are missing is inspiration: inspiration to pursue in-demand careers in technology & engineering, inspiration to persevere through academic struggles, inspiration to pursue a life beyond their insulated (and often troubled) community. \nThe Class\nThis year, I\u2019ll be teaching a class called Introduction to Engineering Design (http://www.pltw.org/our-programs/engineering-curriculum#High_School_Engineering_), which is part of the high school engineering program Project Lead the Way (http://www.pltw.org). The focus of this course is three-fold: develop technical communication skills, learn about the design process, and develop skill at 3D modeling. The important advantage students will get from this class is proficiency with the professional 3D modeling software Autodesk Inventor (http://usa.autodesk.com/autodesk-inventor/). This is a great opportunity for my students because they\u2019ll be able to assemble a portfolio of work to show prospective employers in industry their aptitude with CAD software.\nWhile the course\u2019s curriculum does an excellent job introducing the ideas of engineering and design analysis to students, it doesn\u2019t focus on \u201cwowing\u201d the students with the awesome possibilities of engineering. For my students, this class needs to be about inspiring the future pursuit of engineering just as much as it\u2019s about learning the design process and basics of 3D modeling.\nThe MakerBot\nThe previous instructor for this course at my high school found it challenging to inspire students to pursue engineering when they could never interact with their designs as a final, physical product. The perfect addition to this course would be a way to actually produce the 3D models the students design in Autodesk Inventor, and a company has recently achieved a relatively inexpensive way to do this - The MakerBot (http://www.makerbot.com/).\nRecently released for sale, the MakerBot is an alternative for 3D printing compared to the industrial models seen elsewhere. 3D printing allows the user to create a plastic version of anything designed using CAD software. With a MakerBot in the classroom, students can take the design from their imagination, create the 3D model in Inventor, and print it out in plastic by the end of the day.\nThis is the just the sort of inspiring addition the Intro to Engineering Design class needs: the MakerBot is capable of being the \u201cwow\u201d factor that can help plant the idea of becoming an engineer in a student\u2019s mind.\nPlease consider contributing to this project to help inspire these students to pursue careers in engineering and technology. The funding for this project will purchase a MakerBot for the class, enough plastic for the first year, and pay for any shipping costs related to the rewards earned by backers.

To date, there has not been anything like this- and with so much energy in the arts, Prospect.2 and the ever-growing number of galleries, it stands to reason our city can support such a program.\nCatalogue will democratically list galleries and institutions and include venues within the entire city, not solely in sanctioned arts districts. Each new edition will also include an accompanying essay relating to the New Orleans arts community.\nOur design and concept was inspired by international arts listing guides, and will give visitors and tourists a comprehensive, accessible, and easy-to-use free visual arts guide that lists and celebrates all galleries and institutions in our city. And it even folds up an fits into one's pocket.\n\nThe initial run for the September/October Catalogue will be 3,000 full color guides distributed in art spaces, businesses, and other points of interest citywide. Catalogue will be edited and re-distributed every 2 months. \n\nWe are not charging a fee to be included in Catalogue because we believe the information we list is public knowledge and should be accessible for all who are interested and all who wish to share their exhibitions. We are also volunteering our design, cartography, administrative, and distribution efforts to get Catalogue out into the world.

If you missed it, you can still get more info about Urbanized and support the film at our official site.\nCheers! -Gary\n\u2014\nIn 2005 I began work on my first documentary, Helvetica, which looked at the worlds of typography and graphic design through the eyes of one loved/hated/ubiquitous little font. I wasn't a designer, or even a filmmaker, just a design geek who really wanted to see a movie about fonts! After Helvetica was released in 2007, I had the idea for a second film, Objectified, which focused on industrial design and product design, and our relationship with the manufactured objects that surround us. But I realized there was more to explore, and had the initial ideas for a third film that would also examine how design affects our lives. So I began thinking of the films as a \"design trilogy\".\nThe third documentary in this trilogy is about the design of cities. Urbanized looks at the issues and strategies behind urban design, featuring some of the world's foremost architects, planners, policymakers, builders, and thinkers. I've teamed up once again with cinematographer Luke Geissbuhler, and we've been traveling around the world interviewing people and filming specific urban design projects that represent the issues facing cities today. The world's population is in the midst of a massive migration to urban areas, and the design solutions our cities implement in the next 20 years will be critical.\nWe've already spent over a year and some substantial production costs making Urbanized, with over 100 people involved in the film thus far. We're knee-deep in the editing process now with Helvetica editor Shelby Siegel, but we still have several more filming trips to make this spring, and then we tackle post-production tasks like sound editing, color correction, and other tech work before completing the film this summer.\nUrbanized is a totally independent project: we don't get government funding or grants. And while we've been honored to have PBS and the BBC broadcast our films, they don't produce them or help us make them, they license broadcast rights to the films after we finish them. So Urbanized is being funded mainly by revenue from my previous two films. Please join us in helping to finish Urbanized, and you'll get some nice goodies as a reward. I'm especially excited about The Design Trilogy limited-edition box set, which will include the debut of Helvetica Neue. It's the director's cut of Helvetica (this time Arial shoots first).\nThanks to everyone who has supported these films, on behalf of all of the people who've worked on them. We really appreciate it.\nCheers! -Gary\nPS: The soundtrack of the video above is our old friends El Ten Eleven, it's the song \"Anxiety is Cheap\" from their new album.\nPPS: As a special bonus for our Kickstarter backers, we'll be releasing exclusive video clips and soundtrack MP3s over the next few months as we're finishing Urbanized. These clips and songs will only be available to our backers. You're helping us finish this film, so you deserve an exclusive first look at the footage as we're shooting and editing it!\n\u2013\nThe Design Trilogy limited-edition box set, designed by Build, only 1,000 copies.
