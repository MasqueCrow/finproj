Also, some big last day news!!! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a seasoned business owner, I understand how things do not always go as planned. 2020 was definitely an example of that! There are some factors which are out of one's control, and human error must always be factored in. When this happens, problem solving and a commitment to make things right is paramount. I always endeavor to give the customer more than they expect with no gotchas. My experience has prepared me for this and my commitment to honoring my word is my main priority. Our backers will attest to the quality of response and service we provide. \n\nManufacturing and supply chain difficulties are the biggest risk to this project. We have taken several steps to minimize this risk:\n\nFirst, I have been involved significantly in every step of this project from inception; prototyping, working with qualified engineers, costing and quality control of manufacturing. I went so far as to personally finance, at significant expense, an initial low volume run of tables to make sure these tables did what I said they would, and to ensure that we could manufacture these with the quality I expect. The result was a product I am very proud of. This knowledge and being so active in the \"day to day processes\" allows me to personally oversee this project.\n\nSecondly, our Game Toppers are made in the USA. I am working with a manufacture that is based in my home town. They have many large accounts like Target, Best Buy and others, in a 90,000 square ft. facility, that has equipped them to handle the quality and the capacity this project demands. It also provides us many key advantages as far as quality control, problem solving, supply chain and mitigating problems that can happen versus manufacturing overseas.\n\nThirdly, shipping is always a challenge. We have purchased a 5000 Sq ft facility in our home town to manage inventory and the pick and pull process of our topper orders which we have been running on our own since Feb of 2019. Our Game Toppers are somewhat heavy packages. Considerable time and effort has gone into making sure our fulfillment partner in the EU can handle the shipping in a timely manner. We also have been testing our packaging to ensure our Toppers arrive in pristine condition. Because of this I have made significant upgrades in our packaging to ensure a quality delivery. our second delivered campaign has seen lower shipping failure and improved response time due to our implementations.\n\nWe are charging for shipping. I am making sound business decisions so I have enough funds to pay to get them to you. Our Toppers are over sized for the shipping category. The world is currently upside down in this segment or economy, and it's a worldwide problem. We see it easing in the future, but have prepared for the worst to ensure we can stand by our commitments. Our improvements in package engineering have proven well worth it! While we realize it costs a bit more to ship, this was an intentional design decision to provide the best quality, comfort and functionality that gamers desire. We could have made a smaller Topper with 2 inch rails and not offered the versatility that our design offers, but I refused to compromise on this. The small amount of extra shipping, I feel is worth it in the long run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nComponents are extremely well designed and durable goods\nReusability and recyclability\nbuilt to stand test of time.

It is a card game that comes with 108 poker-sized cards and involves card drafting, hand management, resource management, and some secret scoring. The theme is the discovery of new land during the middle ages.\nIt can be played with 1-6 players (solo mode, or 2 to 6 competing players), in 30 to 60 minutes.\nA $29 pledge earns you a copy of the game, including shipping within the U.S. There are a couple of fun \"put your face in the game\" pledge tiers available as well.\nDelivery is expected by November.\nNow EU-Friendly!! I have found a Germany-based fulfillment partner to ship games through for our EU-based backers!\nThe game consists entirely of cards -- 6 Sponsors, plus 102 multi-use People cards, totaling 27 unique characters.\nThe object of the game is to score the most points while completing a voyage to the Land of Danger. To get there, players will step through the 3 Acts of the story: \nFor more details on how the game works, check out the Google Docs of the full rules:\nMulti-Player Rules: [Google Doc]\nSolo-Play Rules: [Google Doc]\nFor even more details, and to give the game a try, download the full grayscale print-and-play (13MB ZIP file): [download]  \nHow-to-Play (multi-player) Video ...\nPLAY\n\nSolo-Game Play-Through Video by Liz Davidson of Beyond Solitaire ... \nLost from our history books, Portuguese sailor Raimundo Peres da Costa discovered a new land in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at the cusp of the 14th century. Merely planning and gaining support for such a risk-filled journey proved a difficult path. Yet, with the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo secured the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.\nPerhaps Raimundo\u2019s story was lost for a reason. What if the first person to successfully lead a voyage to the fabled Land of Danger was \u2026 you? Let\u2019s go back to the start -- Lisbon, Portugal in the year 1290 -- and see how things play out.\nDays of Discovery is the first game in the \"Tales of Danger\" series. These games will tell the stories of the legendary Land of Danger -- a cluster of islands that used to be located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThis first game covers the opening of the story, and the games that follow will continue down the 180-year timeline, having players explore how the first settlements were established, see how magic was revealed, and experience the conflicts that sprung up along the way.\nThe games will cover a range of different objectives and play styles, but will have a number of things in common:\nThey will be competitive multi-player games\nThey will each have a solo mode, designed with a small footprint\nThey will each follow a 3-Act story arc through the game\nThey will each come in the same sized box, with a similar book-like design, to look good when stacked together on a shelf\nThe game is packaged in a thick-walled, fully-wrapped, telescoping setup box that is designed to look like a leather-bound book.  It measures 5-1/2 x 3-1/2 x 2 inches, and is constructed from 70pt chipboard and covered in full-color printed heavy stock.\nThe box contains:\n6 Jumbo-sized Player Reference cards\n108 Poker-sized cards: 6 Sponsors, 102 People\n2 Rule Books: Multiplayer, Solo-Play\n3 extra zipping plastic baggies (for organizing cards)\nThe cards are made from 12pt 305gsm black-core card stock, and will have a semi-glossy UV-protective coating.\nThe box is big enough to hold all of the cards when they are sleeved.\nThere will be no stretch goals to unlock for this project. \nA number of preview copies of the game were sent out to various reviewers and other folks in the indie board gaming space. As their reviews are posted, I'll list them here ...\nFrom Jason Glover, Grey Gnome Games, on BGG: \"Each act uses different mechanics and feels quite different from the next, while binding well to the theme. All of this is done with one set of multipurpose cards. This is an incredible design feat.\"\nFrom AJ Porfirio, Van Ryder Games, designer of Hostage Negotiator, on Twitter: \"The solo play is great! I am a backer and supporter.\"\nFrom Glenn Flaherty, Board Games & Bourbon, on Twitter and YouTube: \"Days of Discovery is on KS and has a nice story arc: Gain a benefactor, assemble a crew, then survive your journey. It plays like Splendor, Friday, with a hit of The Grizzled. I like it.\"\nFrom the TIGR review by Fairway: \"Days of Discovery is a fantastic little mashup of three different card games ... If you like card games and are looking for one that plays quickly, is easily learned and can play six, this game should definitely be on your list.\"\nFrom the Gameosity Review:\"There's something unique about Days of Discovery - the way the three phases of the game interlock means that every decision you make has multiple consequences, and learning the ins and outs of that interplay is the heart of the game. I really enjoy the layered strategy at work here, and it's definitely the most ambitious of Matt Worden's projects so far.\"\nFrom the Father Geek Review: \"Matt Worden has created a wonderful game that uses simple mechanics, but feels and plays very differently through each of the three acts. Even better, each act is both a separate game and a prelude to the finale.\"\nFrom the Everything Board Games Review: \"The unique multi-use cards will keep us coming back to Days of Discovery. These cards combined with the three-act structure allow a lot of game to be packed in a little box.\"\nFrom Tom Gurganus, Go Forth and Game: \"The story being developed, both within this game and for this series, really has me hooked. And this first game in the series is a perfect way to get it started! I like the three act paradigm. It is different and each act builds into the next. That's pretty cool!\"\nFrom LizDavidson, Beyond Solitaire: \"Days of Discovery is a small game, but an ambitious one. The game is definitely engaging, and I have played and enjoyed it.\"\nThere are only 4 backer pledge levels, and all have some of the shipping costs included:\nPledge $9 or more to receive a link to a full-color, 300 dpi print-and-play PDF (electronic delivery = no shipping costs here)\nPledge $29 to receive a copy of the game.

I have been designing board games as a hobby for nearly 20 years, and had my biggest success with the 2011 Games Magazine Game of the Year -- Jump Gate ... which was also published in Europe as Space Mission.\nI have been working on Days of Discovery for about 3-1/2 years, playtesting it at many Protospiel events and with independent playtesters along the way. It started out as a solo-only game, but continued to develop into the 1-6 player game it is today. To get more background on this design, read the blogs about it on my website.\nPodcast Interviews: I've recently been interviewed on a couple of podcasts ...\nThe Game Crafter Official Podcast\nGo Forth and Game\nAs with most of my games, I will be using The Game Crafter to produce Days of Discovery.\nWith their Small Stout Box and excellent playing card and rule booklet production, I am able to make the game exactly what I want it to be.  Add in their U.S. location and Bulk-Order-Fulfillment service, and the logistics of fulfillment become a lot easier.\nBecause of this, I consider a November 2018 delivery to be a conservative estimate.\nEU-Friendly Shipping: I have found a Germany-based fulfillment partner to ship games through for our Europe-based backers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any creative project that needs to be manufactured and shipped to backers, a number of things can go wrong.\n\nHowever, I have done the following things to mitigate the risks ...\n\nThe game design and artwork (except for the 2 \"add my face\" items) are complete. The rule books have been written and gone through an initial editing pass. I am not using stretch goals to add anything new to the game during the project. I will be using an established manufacturer who will both print my games and send them directly to backers.\n\nIt is possible that unexpected delays may still occur in the final preparation of the print images -- especially related to the two \"add my face\" items -- or in the manufacturing and fulfillment of the orders. If anything like this occurs, I will do my best to communicate quickly and completely with all of the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Frugal Adventurer - Full Color PnP", "descp": "With a pledge of $9, receive a link for the full-color high-resolution Print-and-Play PDF of all cards and rules.\nINCLUDES:\nLink to download the full-color high-resolution Print-and-Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Daring Adventurer - 1 copy of the Game", "descp": "With a pledge of $29, receive 1 physical copy of the game, and a link to download the print-and-play PDF.\nShipping is included for U.S. backers. $5 for Canada. $10 for all other locations.\nTo add extra copies of the game, add an extra $25/copy to your pledge.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "When Cutie Met Patootie is a tabletop game from a rich storyline brought to you via a fun, narrative Kickstarter campaign. A narrative campaign just means that throughout this campaign, we will learn the story of the game characters through time-released animations. In fact, the first video is right above! If you are only here for the game, that's fine too! There are plenty of fun things for you to check out below. Thank you for your support and welcome to the When Cutie Met Patootie Kickstarter campaign!\nChapter 2\nPLAY\n\nIn Chapter 1, we learn of how the Visitors arrived on Earth and what their mission is, outlined by the gameplay.\nIn Chapter 2, we are introduced to the Citizens of Kodiak Harbor and how Cutie gets mixed up in all of this.\nIn Chapter 3, we discover just how Rewind managed to make it to Earth in the first place.\nIn Chapter 4, we find out if our heroes succeed or succumb to Rewind's flood!\nWhen Cutie Met Patootie is a turn-based resource and hand management game. In the box, you'll find 162 cards, 150 acrylic gems, and 10 Visitor Pawns.\nYour goal in the game is to collect and spend gems to move the Visitor Pawns to the top of the map while making sure the Visitors end the game carrying the specific gems which earn you points.\nSetup\nA lifetime of map variation replayability!\nGameplay\nOn your turn, you have two options: You can advance one of the Visitor Pawns or distribute gems onto Visitor Cards by playing Path Cards from your hand.\nAmelia advances for free, Beryl makes a \"quick\" advance, and Gillies makes a \"slow\" advance.\nAdvance: Using the gems from their respective Visitor Card which match their route requirement, or any two gems in place of a required color, a Visitor Pawn may advance along the path. Sometimes a Pawn may move for free if the Visitor is depicted on the Path Card in the space ahead. Only two pawns are allowed on each space.\nA Gillies card was played, and Gillies collected quickly the gems from the card. However, another card was played afterward to collect slowly.\nCollect Gems: To collect gems, simply play a path card from your hand to disperse the gems shown on that card to the Visitor Card(s) of your choosing. When collecting gems, players can do so slowly or quickly. Quickly means that all gems from a played Path Card depicting the Visitor are given to that same Visitor. Slowly means gems are dispersed however the player wishes otherwise. Collecting gems slowly comes at a risk!\nLooks like Gillies and Amelia made it to the next level safely, but there are too many Rewind Cards! Beryl has been swallowed by the flood!\nFlood Timer: Rewind is a nasty character who is currently flooding the map! Here's how that works. Every time a player collects gems slowly, a Rewind Card is added to the timer. When the Rewind Card count matches the lowest unflooded row of Path Cards, that row will flood and all Visitors on or below that level will be captured!\nWhen the Visitors cleared the row, the flood came from the Rewind deck. Now one Rewind Card will flood the next level!\nAutomatic Floods: If ever all Visitors clear a row, that row is flooded by pulling directly from the Rewind Deck instead of the timer counter of cards. In this way, the pressure is always on to beat the flood!\nGame End: When the last row has been flooded (Row 4 in 1-2 Player game, Row 3 in 3-4 player game), the game ends. Gems are collected from the surviving Visitor Cards and starting Gems from each surviving Visitor are added to the point groupings. Players reveal their Citizen Cards and score points based on the count of gems!\nUse these free tools below to start playing today!\n             Test the game for free on Tabletopia\nAs a backer of this campaign, you are signing up for a guarantee that the components will be of the best quality from the start.

I would not be where I am today were it not for their guidance.\nIn the year I have worked for LongPack Games, my work family has taken a vested interest in my professional development, teaching me all there is to know about manufacturing and logistics.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest!

We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed.

This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events.

Each player directs the forces of the conservative Provisional Government or the socialist activists of the Petrograd Soviet in a struggle for power and influence that will shape Russia\u2019s future and either launch or suppress the impending civil war.\nIn Dual Powers: Revolution 1917, each game round is divided into 5 phases --  the Draw Phase, the Objective Phase, the Action Phase, the Scoring Phase, and the Cleanup Phase. \nDRAW PHASE - Each player draws 5 command cards. \nOBJECTIVE PHASE - Each player selects a secret objective, placing it face down on the game board. \nACTION PHASE - Taking turns, each player plays 4 command cards to recruit units, move units, refresh units, or take a leader's special ability. With each card played, the date on the calendar advances, and players will sometimes earn a bonus action. \nSCORING PHASE - Up to 3 regions of the board are scored based on which player has the greatest strength, including the region of unrest, and each of the players' secret objectives. Tokens in the scored regions are exhausted. \nCLEANUP PHASE - The region of unrest and the placement of the blockade token changes. All played cards and the players' secret objectives are discarded. \nIf either player moves the marker on the support track to the \"victory\" space on their side of the board, they immediately win. Otherwise, at the end of the round in which the month marker is on the October space or later, the game ends and the player with the most support is the winner!\nWant to take a closer look to how the game works?

A lot of interesting decisions in the game.\" -- Jeremy Salinas, Man vs. Meeple\n\"Dual Powers is easy to learn, and difficult to master. Players will continually explore layers of deep strategy every time it hits the table!\" -- Derek Funkhouser, Boardgame Spotlight\n\"Super Dynamic.... creates for really fun head-to-head play.... It plays pretty quickly and works well. \" -- Eduardo Baraf, Pencil First Games\n \"It\u2019s a card-driven game. It\u2019s an engine I like very much, a mechanic I like very much when it comes to historical games....This is a fun game that I find quite enjoyable.\u201d - Marco \"Wargamer\" Arnaudo, Game Reviewer\n\"This is the highest rating I've ever given a Kickstarter preview, and the game totally deserves it!... Honestly, I don't have any criticisms of the game. It's easy to learn, fast to play, balanced, exciting, fun, and even a bit educational. There's nothing here not to like.\" - George Jaros, Game Reviewer at GJJ Games\n\u201cI played Dual Powers as a prototype more than a year ago during development, and I wished I could buy it on the spot! The game has a high degree of strategic depth and subterfuge that cleverly emulates the time period and events it represents.\u201d - Scott Bogen, Game Reviewer for the Boardgame Show\n\"Dual Powers has all the elements of a classic card game and the feeling of a tight 2 player war game. Lots of double thinking your opponent and hoping your long term strategy pays off. Can't wait to see this in print!\" - Jeph Stahl, co-designer of Academy Games' Birth of America series\n\"I'm a Kickstarter curmudgeon. Despite hanging out and running campaigns on Kickstarter for years, I have yet to back a single game. That's changing when Dual Powers goes live. I love everything about it: the viscerally beautiful art, the original mechanics (OH THE CALENDAR MECHANIC), the fact that it's tuned like a fine Stradivarius for one and two players, and most of all, the way a few simple rules magically conspire to thrust me into the middle of the Russian Revolution. I'm beyond smitten.\" -- Nick Bentley, designer/developer/marketer at North Star Games (Evolution, Happy Salmon)\n\"Dual Powers is a smart, engaging mix of modern and traditional gameplay. Cleverly invoking what\u2019s fun \u2014 and familiar \u2014 about cribbage, it goes on to deliver a completely new experience set against a flavorful historical backdrop. The first time I played Dual Powers, when the game ended, I demanded that we immediately play again. If you enjoy games like Twilight Struggle, you owe it to yourself to try Dual Powers.\" - Jeff Tidball, designer/writer (Horus Heresy, Pieces of Eight, Dragon Age RPG)\n\"I actually like how the game feels, plays and looks. I do get that feeling of being immersed in the political upheaval but in a light, slightly removed, almost passive way...

Over the years we have expanded to 5 full length podcasts per month covering board games, role playing games and miniatures gaming. We've also produced audio dramas, video blogs and more. This fundraiser will ensure that the Cabal continues to produce all of this content and more over the next year! \nThese are the items that you will receive in the reward bundles.\nPart of the fun of creating things and also creating stuff!

All of the other goodies listed below are individually listed within the backer levels.\nWHAT ABOUT SHIPPING?\nShipping is the most difficult part of running any Kickstarter. We are running this project to facilitate making as much content as we can and too many campaigns have been sunk by botched shipping. Each pledge including physical rewards will have a shipping and handling cost added to it. \nUS Shipping: $5 ($3 for just the promos) \nCanadian Shipping: $12 ($10 for just the promos)\nEverywhere Else: $15 ($13 for just the promos)\nShipping for Grand Adventures Print version adds $2 for Canadian and international pledges.\nShipping For Add Ons\nShipping will be added per add-on based on the item and it's destination via a pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nWe very much appreciate your understanding as we are attempting to minimize our risk and make sure you get all your goodies! \nNOTE ABOUT BACKER LIMITS: So you may notice that there are actually limits on a the backer levels. The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 1500. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos. If by some strange and amazing circumstance we completely run out of the 1500ish promos during this campaign, will will continue with backer levels sans-promos.

After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We figured out which things work best and what people like the most. What's fun, and what's too fiddly.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Test your survival skills in the dark fantasy world of Unbroken. You are the only one left alive after your group was ambushed by monsters - now you must avenge your friends and reclaim your freedom. Quick to learn, easy to set up and playable in a brief 20-30 minutes, the game will challenge you to make the right decisions or fall victim to the many dangers of the monster-infested caverns.\nPlan wisely and take calculated risks - you do not have much and must use every resource at your disposal to prevail. Each journey in the dark is unique as you play as one of four different characters and face a variety of monsters and encounters. Your character gets better with experience and so will you - Unbroken is a game that encourages and rewards repeated plays to refine your strategies. \n                                                           Hanging on by a thread. You snuck past a giant spider along the way but now want to arm yourself, hearing monsters ahead. You need some wood for a sturdy club.\nYou could gather your strength at a shrine or distract the feasting goblinoids to steal their food. No wood that you wanted, but you\u2019ll use the shrine \u2013 hunger isn\u2019t the biggest threat to your survival now.\nStill a bit of time left - you push on, looking for another encounter.\nFinally, some wood! You could fashion a weapon from these branches. But you are weak \u2013 gathering the wood, then crafting the club would tire you out. Instead you decide to rest up and to face the upcoming monster with your bare hands.\nYou are short on time \u2013 another encounter could yield resources, but if time gets to 0 the monster would ambush you. You decide not to risk it and face the monster.\nYou face your foe. The unfortunate wretch trapped in these caverns has long gone mad with despair.\nYour gamble not making a weapon paid off! The Survivor\u2019s Special effect would disarm you, wasting all resources you would have spent on the weapon.\nYou didn\u2019t have to go into the fight blindly \u2013 you could Scout the monster and knew what to expect. It would cost resources but would provide certainty.\nIn Combat you will spend effort to wound your enemy. Good thing you feel strong after stopping at that shrine!\n\nYou would be in trouble encountering an armoured monster - dealing with that using just your fists would lead to a quick defeat.\nYour victory is rewarded! Which weapon upgrade tree will you choose? Which skills will aid your struggles? There are two more truly dangerous monsters to defeat before you are free of this accursed place!\nUnbroken has been designed to be played regardless of how strapped for time or company you might be. All you need to get it to the table is a small space, 20-30 minutes of free time and just one player - YOU. \nSome games have add-on solo modes. Some allow you to play versus a virtual opponent. Unbroken doesn\u2019t settle for the fact that you\u2019re playing solo - it celebrates it. The survival story you\u2019re telling is that of individual triumph in the face of adversity, and it has been crafted to be enjoyed in exactly this way.\nUnbroken is won by careful planning and calculated risk. There are several strategies you can go for including a focus on skills, trickery or different weapon upgrade trees. Your approach will determine your success much more than the limited luck element. Every game you will learn how to best prepare for the challenges of the dungeon. Every next game you will be a little better at surviving. \nDo you spend your resources to find out more about the coming dangers or do you hedge your bets and go in blind? Do you risk looking for food to not starve even if you might be ambushed by a monster? There are many difficult decisions in Unbroken and these will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering if you made the right one. \nUnbroken is built on a flexible system that is centered around a variety of characters to play and monsters to combat. We already have great designs in mind for expansions that we will start working on in full after the campaign. We can\u2019t wait to have the community\u2019s input on the new content! \nWe are so certain that you will like Unbroken that we are happy to offer an unconditional full refund (including shipping) within 30 days of you receiving the game.

I reported the damages to the manufacturer and after they denied the issues and blamed it on the shippers they finally checked the shipment that the still had not sent (still no answer why it was still there). They found 30% of these were damaged as well. I finally got the shipment off to VFI for the 3rd shipment and they are packing the shipments up. I email VFI every day asking for updates. They report that they are packing but have not shipped yet. In addition to all of this, the manufacturer has sent fewer products to each location than were ordered. They are refusing to produce replacement cases for the damaged all-weather cases so I have been forced to find another manufacturer to produce replacement waterproof cases in a pinch. The original manufacturer is also refusing to refund me for the damaged products. I am still trying to resolve these issues with them. Needless to say, I will not be working with that manufacturer in the future.

During the game, players will use their action pool to move around the evocative maps, investigate mysteries, interact with their environment, and unleash powerful attacks and abilities unique to each character. Once selected, however, these abilities will be unavailable until that character\u2019s action pool has emptied \u2014 a process that becomes more challenging as that character gains fear.\nStory maps for Chapters 1 & 2 - Click to enlarge\n  Players live the adventure of Legends of Sleepy Hollow over eight chapters filled with mystery, suspense, and a deeply rich story. Each chapter is kept separate from the others so players will discover the secrets of Sleepy Hollow as they play. There are seven distinct maps in the game and each chapter unfolds and plays different than the last, so playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow feels much like playing eight different board games!\nNow that we've achieved our base funding goal we will be able to publish Legends of Sleepy Hollow at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff, like a stand-alone scenario and more Chapter game mats!\nThe mats will introduce the Heroic and Legendary difficulty levels so that players who have completed the game can try again with beastlier baddies and special conditions! The mats will be produced at the same factory as the base game, and on the same stock as the base game Standard mats. We've now unlocked enough of them so we will produce a whole mini-expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free!\nBackers at the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive the core game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, complete with 39 custom sculpted miniatures, nearly 200 cards, dozens of wooden tokens, premium player boards and maps, and more!

Inside this book you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the Heroes, Foes, miniatures and more. Also, American Gothic will include the original short story by Washington Irving with special illustrations!\n      Three days after the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, four Tarry Town residents with strange ties to the supernatural venture into an ever-darkening Sleepy Hollow to uncover its mysteries.\nAs our story begins, the townsfolk of Sleepy Hollow have grown increasingly frightened by tales of dark creatures and ghouls haunting the hillsides. Some of the newer residents scoffed, calling it myth and superstition, but older settlers felt that something was out there lurking. Elijah Kappel could feel it, and he knew the elders were wise; he'd spent the past decade studying the old ways and customs, and could now interpret the hushed whispers of Old World folklore.\nElijah feared that Ichabod's disappearance was only the beginning of something sinister. He knew that even if it was old Brom Bones cavorting around the forest on horseback, his head tucked into his vest, that Elijah might need more than his faith and a trusty walking staff to confront such headstrong opposition. What he needed was someone more imposing than the town bully - perhaps someone who walked softly and carried a big shovel...\n  The Legends of Sleepy Hollow is an adventure game for 1 to 4 players featuring cooperative tactical missions and some \"legacy\" elements.\nChapter 1 set-up - Click to enlarge\n  Watch our rules video for an overview of gameplay:\nOr download our \"print and play\" version of Chapter 1, and try it out for yourself!

While players who have experienced the full story will know the surprise twists throughout the game, each Chapter is designed to be a variable experience each time you play. \nFor instance, during set-up in Chapter 1 the Discovery tokens are randomized so players may find the journals in different places each game. Each Chapter's game mat also has variable conditions such as unpredictable creature spawns, or random event actions.\nFinally, we have created advanced \"Heroic\" (hard) and \"Legendary\" (very hard) versions of each map! We will be offering PDFs of those maps after the game is produced, and sending professionally printed hard copies to each backer for free if we unlock those stretch goals!\nLegends of Sleepy Hollow comes with 7 different Chapter game maps, custom screen-printed dice, thick, layered player boards, tons of cards, 39 gorgeous miniatures, and more! Here\u2019s a complete run-down:\n16 thick, interlocking punchboard map tiles \n4 sculpted plastic Hero miniatures \n10 sculpted plastic Gobkins \n10 sculpted plastic Schrikroots \n15 sculpted plastic other miniatures (shhhh, it\u2019s a secret!)\n Over 140 Euro mini-sized cards with linen finish (for the Legends story deck, character Skills, Skill upgrades, Foe cards, more)\n Over 50 bridge-sized cards with linen finish (character equipment and proficiency upgrade cards) \n4 thick, layered player mats with wells for Action/Fear tokens and equipment/proficiency upgrade cards \n20 wooden Action tokens \n25 custom wooden Fear tokens \n6 custom screen-printed dice \n1 regular six-sided die \n40 thick punchboard Damage rings (attach to bottom of the miniature bases to track damage) \n12-page full color glossy rulebook \n24-page Storybook with thick card stock pages (contains Chapter details, story elements, and game mats) \n1 amazing box - check it out!\nAs a story-driven game, theme and atmosphere are key elements in the experience of playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow. We want you to feel as though you're a part of the world from the moment you pull the box off the shelf. We created this box to replicate an 1800s Dutch-style dresser chest, but with the unique whimsy and beauty that Abigail's art brings to the game. It's as if this relic was lifted directly from the in-game world to your game table. The box lid lifts open to reveal the game contents inside - just as if you were in the game unlocking Ichabod's chest to see what mysteries it holds. The box lid hinges with support from ribbons connecting the inside of the lid to the base. Double-walled interior elements make the box extra sturdy and create a smooth, tight seal when the lid is dropped down. We even included artistic details such as hinges and a front lock!\nSamples of Legend deck, Foes, and starting Hero Skills - Click to enlarge\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow will have more awesome features inside the box - and we can't even show you all of them... that'd spoil the story and half the fun!\nFirst up, the game will include 39 highly-detailed miniatures designed by Francesco Orr\u00fa and based on character artist Abigail Larsen's concepts. You can check out the four main Hero sculpts below, and get a closer look at the Gobkins and Schrikroots that will be battling our heroes - at least in Chapter 1!\nHero mini samples - click to enlarge\n            Each Hero and Foe miniature has a punchboard ring that attaches to the bottom of the figure and is secured by a plastic base. Tracking health is as simple as turning the ring to the appropriate amount. Some Foes may have special damage track rings that activate abilities - but you'll have to wait and find that out on your own!\nAnother great feature is the Hero player boards. These are made of layered punchboard with recessed wells for Action/Fear tokens, equipment and weapon proficiency upgrades, and a raised surface with room to tuck Skill and Item cards underneath!\n   All backers of Legends of Sleepy Hollow will get some awesome extras!\nFirst off, backers at both pledge levels will also receive the fully-produced solo card game Lost in the Woods, designed by Robert Johnson! The game will retail for $9.95 after the campaign, but it will be sent for free to all backers!\nLost in the Woods is set on the eve of Ichabod Crane's fateful ride home at the end of the original story of Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!\nIf you'd like to try Lost in the Woods yourself, you can download the print-and-play files right here!\nHere's an overview of how Lost in the Woods plays!\nNext, every backer will receive a set of personal Totem cards that will not be available in the retail version of Legends of Sleepy Hollow. \nPromotional personal Totem cards - Click to enlarge\n  If the players wish, each character may start the game with their personal Totem card in Inventory. The card may be played from Inventory at any time to resuscitate the character if they have been incapacitated, returning them to full Health and with 2 Fear on the next turn. These cards are useful for lowering the difficulty of the game for more casual groups, or for when things get really heated around Chapter 4!\nKevin and Melissa Delp of Tantrum House took a look at Legends of Sleepy Hollow, and they loved it!\nBeasts of War plays the first chapter of Legends of Sleepy Hollow in Legendary mode! Beware, there are SPOILERS!\nJonathan and Will from Roll For Crit produced an excellent preview video and gave Legends of Sleepy Hollow their official seal of approval!\nBell of Lost Souls did a live runthrough of Chapter 1 on Twitch, and they had a great time!\nBoard Game Gumbo interviewed game developer & lead storyteller Chris Kirkman about the game, the story, stretch goals, and more!\nLinks to Media & quotes about Legends of Sleepy Hollow:\n\"Like classic cooperative and dungeon crawl games, you\u2019ll find yourself trying to use your actions efficiently and working with your teammates to optimize your turns. With its goth horror storytelling and the tension created by the game\u2019s turns, your group will soon be overwhelmed by creatures who move with zombie-like relentlessness. You may not complete your quest on your first attempt, but like any good game, you\u2019ll be quick to try again.\" - Ruel Gaviola, Geek & Sundry \n\"The Legend is real! Story-based gameplay and replayability combine into one mythical gaming experience in the Legends of Sleepy Hollow. Your gaming table will thank you for this one... it definitely earned a spot on my game shelf!\" - Becca Kaufeld, Game Trade Magazine\nHaving played Chapter 1: \u201cAsymmetrical powers? A story to uncover? Secret envelopes to open? And a dude dropping baddies with a shovel!?! What's there not to be excited about???\" - Rob and Christina Rouse, Blue Peg Pink Peg podcast\n\"If you like classic horror, if you like intrigue, and if you have been looking for a well-done campaign game that doesn\u2019t pull any punches and keeps you engaged throughout the entire story, then you want to go look at their Kickstarter page and back it.\" - Marti Wormuth, Open Seat Gaming\n\"When I played solo, however, the game felt like a turn-based tactical video game, such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, where I was the tactician, in control of the actions of all of the heroes. Despite controlling multiple characters, playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow solo gave me a similar feeling that I had playing Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and I feel it will likely appeal to those that play AH:CG solo for its story-driven, exploratory horror experience.\" - Eric Buscemi, The Cardboard Hoard\n\"I won't spoil the events that take place after completing the team's objective, but if it's anything close to the events of the other seven missions, I expect Legends of Sleepy Hollow will provide ample opportunities for twists and exciting storytelling. Another thing driving story and replayability is once a mission is accomplished, players can choose an additional skill or upgrade their equipment to progress their character and make them more valuable for future missions. I love this inclusion, and I think it will add a lot to keep players engaged, ready to test their new skills on new foes.\" - Chris Hecox, Geeks Under Grace \n\"By the end of our play through, I was genuinely impressed with how well Sleepy Hollow seems to add new content and challenges, and will continue to do so into later chapters.\" - Wyatt Krause, Sprites + Dice\n\"I like how the players have to make their choices with limits, forcing each player to carefully consider possible outcomes. I also like that you can see doom approaching. This helped me and the rest of the players make better choices, while not ever feeling like the game was going easy on us.\" - Father Geek Approved!\n  More to come!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping.
