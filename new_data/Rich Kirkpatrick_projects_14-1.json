[{"backer": "Rich Kirkpatrick", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "** Help us reach stretch goals: If we hit $6,000, we'll launch a website to keep the conversation going.**\nPolitics can be pretty divisive and depressing. What happened to hope? Too often, politics feels like a battleground where we lob accusations back and forth. And that's not likely to change after November's presidential election, no matter who wins or loses.\nPolitics have long been divisive and people will always disagree. But I have hope that we can do better.\nSo I'm launching this project to lift up stories of hope and joy among our elected officials. It starts with a book of political profiles, titled Better Politics, Please, that will tell encouraging stories of common ground. \nYeah, that\u2019s a tall order these days. \nBut if we want to make civic engagement civil, it starts with we the people. I hope you'll join me in creating better politics, please.\nAuthor Kevin D. Hendricks and Better Politics, Please! example book cover (illustrated by Carolyn Swiszcz).\nThe Book\nWe'll gather stories of 25 inspiring people to share in the book Better Politics, Please: 25 Stories of Politicians Who Value Hope Over Hate.\nYou can read some example profiles in our updates.\nThe book will feature leaders such as:\n Former U.S. Representative Carlos Curbelo: \u201cIf this country doesn't start healing, it is not going to matter who wins elections. We're all going to lose eventually.\u201d Read more >> \n U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth: \u201cAs bad as it\u2019s going to be in Washington, it\u2019s never going to be as bad as getting blown up.\u201d Read more >> \n Brooklyn Park, Minn., Mayor Jeff Lunde: \u201cThe national dialogue, the rhetoric on both sides drives me absolutely crazy. That\u2019s not how we do things in Brooklyn Park. We actually talk and listen.\u201d Read more >> \n Virginia Congressional Candidate Qasim Rashid: \u201cI think the bigger risk is for me to stay silent and not try to neutralize this hatred. Because if I do that, as my children get older, they'll have to suffer through it.\u201d Read more >> \n U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler: \"If you spend all your time sowing discord, that's what you're going to reap.\" Read more >> \n Colorado Governor Jared Polis: \u201cWhen we realize that our fates are connected and that we are better together, we can solve any problem we encounter.\u201d Read more >> \n Former Kentucky Lieutenant Governor Jenean Hampton: \u201cI wasn't running to be first anything. I just wanted to help make Kentucky better.\u201d Read more >> \n North Dakota State Representative Ruth Buffalo: \"I was never raised to see party lines. We\u2019re all related, we\u2019re all on the same team, we\u2019re all human beings.\" Read more >> \n U.S. Representative Adam Kinzinger: \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to the point where I don\u2019t care about the politics...  What can we solve today?\u201d Read more >> \n Nevada State Senator Pat Spearman: \"The women who are here this time, doesn't matter which party, when we're passionate about something we just push for it.\" Read more >> \nMinnesota State Senator Matt Little: \u201cWe will never heal our democracy hiding behind a keyboard.\u201d Read more >>\nThese stories will come from both sides of the aisle and will offer a glimpse into that person and one small way they're bringing hope to politics. Some stories you might love, and some you might not. Some you\u2019ll agree with, and some you won\u2019t. But that's OK. Common ground isn't always comfortable. The goal of this project is to find something to celebrate in each person, no matter their party.\nMore than words, the book will also be illustrated by artist Carolyn Swiszcz. She's known for the zine Zebra Cat Zebra, which features her fun and quirky style. All the illustrations in the video above are her work. Carolyn will contribute illustrations for the cover and (initially) six interior illustrations that will help bring these profiles to life.  \nAmerican flag and artist Carolyn Swiszcz (illustrated by Carolyn Swiszcz).\nRewards\nFor most of the rewards, you get the previous rewards as well. So all the backers get a postcard! If you back at the $18 level or higher, you'll get a print copy of the book. In addition to the book, you get:\nThe knowledge that you brought this project to life\u2014go you!\nYou'll get the book before the general public.\nWe'll print your name in the book, a permanent acknowledgment of your support and a big thank you. \nYour copy will be autographed by author Kevin D. Hendricks and artist Carolyn Swiszcz.\nAfter this project is done the book will be available for sale to the general public, but the only way to get the above rewards is to back the project now.\nSome of the higher tiers give you an opportunity to influence what goes in the book, from submitting quotes to picking who we profile (within reason\u2014we reserve the right to veto ideas that don't fit the vibe of the book). You can also get an illustrated version of yourself by the talented Carolyn Swiszcz! (These higher reward tiers don't come with all the previous rewards, so pay attention to what's included.)\nA Bigger Idea\nThis book of 25 profiles is the initial goal for this project. That seems possible and realistic in the midst of COVID-19 and unprecedented economic turmoil (gulp).\nBut I have a much larger vision. \nMore than a single book, I'm envisioning a whole conversation. An ongoing project that collects and tells these stories through a website. But for that to happen, we need a lot of people to catch this same vision and support the project.\nSo we'll start with a book. Then we\u2019ve got stretch goals to make the book bigger, add more illustrations, start a website, and more. But it can only happen with your help. \nIt's Dot Com! (illustrated by Carolyn Swiszcz)\nStretch Goals\nThe initial goal to launch the book is $3,000. We hit that and the project is a go. But there's more we can do. As we hit these milestones, we'll do more:\n REACHED: $4,000 - Nice: We'll take things up a notch with professional cover design.\nREACHED: $5,000 - More content! We'll expand the book to include 35 stories and 9 illustrations total.\n $6,000  - It's a website: We'll launch a dedicated website to continue telling these stories.\n $7,000 - Pro: We'll hire a designer to create a logo for the website.\n $8,000 - More more: We'll double the size of the book\u2014we'll do 50 stories and 12 illustrations total.\n $10,000 - Steady content is what fuels a conversation, so if we hit this stretch goal we'll commit to doing at least one post per week on the website for the first six months after the site launches.\nWhy Now?\nI\u2019m launching this campaign in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak. That seems foolish, and maybe it is. There\u2019s an unusual level of fear and uncertainty, but there\u2019s also an unusual level of people coming together and doing the right thing. Those are the stories I want to champion. \nWe need this conversation now more than ever. Troubled times are exactly when we need better politics. \nWearing your mask? (illustration by Carolyn Swiszcz)\nWhy Me?\nFrankly, I wish it wasn\u2019t me. For the past few months I\u2019ve been telling people, 'I have this crazy idea\u2014talk me out of it.' A few have told me it won\u2019t work, but no one has said it\u2019s a bad idea. Many have told me to go for it. So here goes.\nI ran the church communication blog, Church Marketing Sucks, for 15 years. I saw firsthand the power of content to start a conversation and create a movement. I think the same needs to be done for politics.\nProfessionally, I\u2019m in a bit of a transition. Church Marketing Sucks was a mainstay for most of my career, and now it's done. Not only am I feeling the loss of income, but there\u2019s the loss of purpose. I\u2019ve spent the past six months or so wondering what\u2019s next. This might be it\u2014or at least I\u2019m willing to take my shot.\nWhere the Money Goes\nThousands of dollars in a Kickstarter project sounds like a lot, but there are a lot of expenses to cover:\n Fees: Kickstarter keeps about 10% (they keep 5% and about another 5% goes to credit card processing fees).\n Taxes: The government will keep another chunk (death and taxes, right?).\n Content: Creating the content will be a major expense. We need to pay illustrator Carolyn Swiszcz, and there's my time writing, editing, and proofing the copy. Then there's producing the print and digital versions of the book, with layout, design, and all the production work.\n Rewards: Delivering the rewards is another big expense. There's printing postcards and mini-prints, shipping, envelopes, and more. \n Stretch goals: As we hit stretch goals, some of the income will go toward bringing on professionals to take things up a notch with quality design. Stretch goals will also pay for more illustration and writing time as we make the book bigger. If we launch a site, there's hosting, domain, building a site, etc.\nIf We\u2019re Successful\nIf this works, we can start a conversation about better politics. Hitting the initial goal will create a book that tells stories of hope and joy in our politics\u2014just in time for the 2020 election. \nIf we hit some of those stretch goals, we can make the book better and even launch a website to keep this idea rolling. Because we need better politics not just in 2020, but well beyond.\nI hope you\u2019ll join me by backing this Kickstarter campaign. Let's start a conversation and celebrate better politics, please.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is an experiment to see if people will support this idea. It's a big risk, but I think we're up to the challenge.\n\nI'm a full-time freelance writer, so creating content is what I do. I've already started writing profiles, and have more than 10 ready to go. I actually love writing these, so I'm eager to have the monetary support to keep doing it.\n\nThese projects always have unforeseen elements, but I've tried to be realistic in planning. There are minor risks of an act of God, my work situation changing, or other calamity. Though given that we're launching this in the midst of the COVID-19 shutdown, it seems like we've already faced big changes. If anything, this is a project that will help me weather this situation.\n\nI've self published a dozen books for myself and others, so I don't anticipate any challenges there.

It was the published form of a lecture that walked through the Psalms of Ascents as a journey with Jesus from Palm Sunday to the cross.  The book struck me with two things - one that the psalms could have a liturgical anchor in the church calendar, and two that Jesus probably sang these songs as part his regular worshipping life during passover (and especially the last week of his life). \nEventually this idea turned into a Calvin Worship Renewal Grant for my congregation in Raleigh where it blossomed into a year long meditation on the the ascent psalms.\nThe Present:\nFinally after all of these years Cardiphonia, with the help of Bellwether Arts, is extending this project into something we hope will bless the worldwide church!  \nThe project is multi-faceted with music, visual, devotional, and liturgical components. Musicians have contributed over 30 new worship songs inspired by this group of psalms.  Visual artists have contributed an image for each psalm, and an eclectic group of pastors, scholars and writers have provided some guidance to worshipping through the ascent psalms. There will also be digital access to a full songbook and services inspired by each psalm. \nThis project could never have happened without the tremendous gifts of the church coming together.  My deep gratitude to all of the artists listed below who contributed. \nThe Future:\nThe whole project will be available digitally for Holy Week 2018.  Then in the following month or so we will get all of the cool physical rewards out to supporters (double disc, art/devo book, handkerchief, t-shirts, etc). \nWe also hope to eventually take this project to Israel to support a youth summer arts camp sponsored by a local church, and we are in conversations with the missions agency Serge to direct some portion of the proceeds to support refugee care.\n---\nLIST OF PARTICIPATING ARTISTS!!!\nMUSICIANS: Green Carpet Players (Matt Grimsley and Amy Porter) , Pillar Church Music (Andy Bast, Jonathan Gabhart, and Noah McLaren) , Red Mountain Music (Brian T.

Above is my favorite picture of our band leading worship. The reason it\u2019s my favorite, is you\u2019ll notice the band is not in focus. Whenever we have the opportunity to lead our goal is to always make Christ the focal point of the worship and for our band to disappear and just become worshippers with everyone else.\nI've been really fortunate to play with some guys who are not only great musicians, but really good friends. Guys like Josh Merold, Brian Kammer, Duane McDonald, Norm Wozniak, Paul Bogan and others too. Over the past several years we have had the privilege to lead worship at a number of retreats and conferences. Like myself a few of the guys are full time Pastors at churches. I love their heart for God, music and people. When we lead at places, we like to say \u201cthat often the best worship happens not on the stage, but off the stage when we get the chance to talk with people, pray for them and with them, and encourage them as they encourage us in return. Truth be known, we\u2019re a lot more comfortable spending time with people, than under stage lights, wearing skinny jeans and trying to rock cool hair. Let\u2019s be honest, NOBODY wants to see us in skinny jeans, and we haven\u2019t had cool hair since the 80\u2019s!\nOne of the things we run into when we lead at places is people asking us. \u201cDo you guys have a CD recording or digital files?\u201d The answer unfortunately has been \u201cNo, we don\u2019t\u201d. That is until now! Here\u2019s where we need your help. We\u2019re going to finally get into the studio and to record songs as well as take it to them to production, so we can have Cd\u2019s and digital files for people to take with them. This will also help us get an opportunity to lead worship at more places. We've  had several people interested in having us out, but they always ask if we have recordings they can listen to before booking us.\nWhat\u2019s behind the name - ONE:SIX WORSHIP PROJECT? The reference is from Philippians 1:6 and the idea that God is not finished with any of us yet, we\u2019re still a bit of a work in progress, a project if you will. Anything you contribute will go to the cost of the studio time, final mixes, as well as the cost of producing the Cd\u2019s and getting the music digital ready. \n I\u2019m excited that we will be recording at \u201cEar Witness Studios\u201d in Southern CA with Sam Knaak. He\u2019s a friend of one of the guys in the band and in my brief interactions with him thus far, I get the feeling he\u2019s an all around solid guy and we are looking forward to working with him! All the guys are passionate about music and I think we bring a little \"Heart & Grit\" to the style we play. You'll hear a lot of electric guitars and Hammond organ, with some rock and blues sensibility. We don't mind throwing a little bit of grease in the wheels, worship music doesn't always have to be pretty. We hope you will consider the opportunity to partner with us.

In his live performance, there is a segment where Matt has a full on \"conversation\" with his computer, Looptimus Prime. It's a 'tongue-in-cheek\" concept, but entertaining... at least we think so :)\nOctober 2012\nLoop Community decides to build a FREE mobile App, and calls it \"Prime\"... knowing full well that a \"Looptimus\" product is coming.\nDecember 2012\nLoop Community investigates the idea of manufacturing their own pedal. Discussions begin.\nJanuary 2013\nThe Loop Community team decides that it's time to develop the best MIDI foot controller for live performance. We honestly got tired of selling a pedal (Soft Step) that is too hard to program. We also grew weary of receiving support request after support request on how to use the SoftStep. Frustrated users are not what we're after.... So Matt sketches up the first idea for \"Looptimus\" and meetings begin with various developers.\nInitial Design Sketches\nCAD drawings for the enclosure\nJanuary 2013\nThe pedal design is decided upon and the first silkscreen design is created and sent to the manufacturer for printing.\nFebruary 2013\nThe first prototype (steel enclosure) arrives and begins thorough testing in live performances throughout Chicago.\nFirst Prototype (w/ a Steel Enclosure)\nRoad testing on stage!\nApril 2013\nMeetings begin with large manufacturers, suppliers and assembly lines to discuss large-scale manufacturing of such pedal. Developers begin working on the custom circuit board design, which requires hours of testing.\nPrototype Testing\nMay 2013\nFurther development takes place to tweak the pedal. An expression pedal jack is added to the pedal after user requests.\nJune 2013\nThe first 3 road-test prototypes arrive and are shipped to selected musicians across America for further testing.\nFirst 3 Prototypes ready for user testing!\nJuly 2013\nLooptimus is seen \"hiding-out\" at the Loop Community booth for several national worship conferences around the country. Testing and tweaking continues with our professional team of developers and programmers.\nhiding under the table!\nOn Matt McCoy's Pedal Board @ NWLC\nAugust 2013\nAfter discussing the many different enclosure options, we decide to go with a black powder coated, Aluminum enclosure for maximum durability and lightness in weight. All sides are rounded, with no sharp edges or screws showing. Designs, Manufacturer and Part Suppliers are finalized and READY TO GO! It looks beautiful.\n(Artist Rendering) Actual Product will be in a Black, Powder Coated, Aluminum Enclosure.\nMADE IN THE USA!!!\n\nHow Can I Use the Pedal?\nThe pedal has 20 banks + an all-access bank, available at any time. So that is actually a total of 21 banks.\nOne Bank Per Song\nUse each bank for a song in your setlist. Then use each patch in the bank for a different section of your song. Each bank has A - F patches, so you can assign A to Verse, B to PreChorus, C to Chorus, etc. \nUse One Bank for your Setlist\nAssign button A to song 1, button B to song 2, button C to song 3, and so forth\nUse for Live Looper in Ableton\nAssign buttons to the Live Looper settings in Ableton Live and loop your instrument live!\nGet Creative!\nAnything you can assign to a MIDI interface can be used with the Looptimus MIDI Controller\nGet one of the few LIMITED EDITION colors, on KickStarter only!\nManufacturing Plan and Timeline\nJanuary 2013\nMatt meets with a professional pedal developer to discuss the idea of \"Looptimus\". The pedal developer agrees to help us build our initial concept prototype.\nMarch 2013\nMatt begins to meet with numerous manufacturers around the United States to discuss the potential of mass manufacturing a pedal. Matt also talks with a manufacturer in China, but decides to keep all manufacturing in the USA for quality control and short delivery times.\nApril 2013\nLoop Community partners with a large, accomplished and proven manufacturer in Chicago. Development begins on the pedal - bill of materials, CAD drawings, enclosure designs, PC board designs, etc. Coders begin developing the logic for the pedal that will be printed to our own custom chip and circuit board.\nJune 2013\nPart suppliers are finalized and quotes are agreed upon. \nAugust 2013\nThe manufacturer and supplier of the Aluminum enclosure is secured. Screen-printing manufacturer is secured.\nSeptember 4 2013\nKICKSTARTER BEGINS\nOctober 2013\nKICKSTARTER ENDS\nInitial PO is placed and Aluminum Enclosures arrive in manufacturing facility 4 weeks later.\nCircuit Boards, switches and other parts are ordered and shipped to assembly line.

By pledging, you can still help me write it. Every additional dollar will go directly towards making music and content for you and for the church. And at the $20 level, you can still get 3 exclusive piano/vocal songs that will never be released again.\n2 Albums For the Price of 1 Amazing Kickstarter Campaign\nIn addition to the studio album I'll be making with this funding, I would LOVE to make an additional album to give away to the world for FREE. Our new goal is $70,000. If we can reach that by April 15th, then this fall I'll get my friends together to record a Live Worship Album with new and old songs of my own plus a few covers and hymns. \nIf you've already given, you can help us get to this goal by telling someone about this Kickstarter Campaign in person. Please, hit up your friends, your family, your barista, or heck, make a new donation in the name of your World of Warcraft avatar. You can also adjust your pledge and increase the amount by a few or a bunch of dollars. And lastly, of course, you can use Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr to get the word out.\nThanks everyone! And thumbs up for Rock and Roll!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cBeauty is the seal of truth.\u201d - Benedict XVI\nFriends, I am hoping to record a new project of songs for the Church. I am newly independent after a stint at a record label, and it's so important to me to stay connected with the people (you) who have supported me and rooted for me through the years. And so I want to make a record of songs we can sing together--and I want to make it with you! If you believe in this idea, I invite you to support me financially, with prayer, and with sharing. There are a lot of great rewards you can check out--even if you can only give a dollar, there is a reward coming your way! Every dollar really does count. Now, more than ever, I can't do this without you.\nI've spent several years artistically waffling between writing corporate worship music and Christian pop music. Recently I have come to realize that my gifting lies in leading worship more than it does in playing church concerts: and what's interesting is, as I look back even over any commercial success I've had, the most well-loved songs I've released are the ones that offer the opportunity for others to pray them along with me (Restless, You Revive Me, even Winter Snow.)\nSo with that in view, I am laboring both in prayer and in my art to make music that serves the Church in its various needs and purposes. Some of those needs may include personal devotion (like praying in your car), or Sunday worship, or corporate prayer (like a Friday night worship gathering). I grew up underneath the great banner of the Christian hymnal tradition, and so I have been writing some songs that draw from that heritage\u2014but I am also influenced greatly by the charismatic renewal in the Church, and so some of the record may reflect that as well. Mostly I want to write something fragrant, and give it as an offering to God and to you. I want you to sing it with me. With your help, I can make this project happen.\nThis record will feature the piano and my vocals very heavily, with some added atmosphere. I want it to be simple and yet lush, in order to create a space where you and I both can pray without distraction. Liturgy is part of my background, and I am hopeful that some of these songs will be helpful in that setting.\nI have long believed that true Beauty can change a world where truth and goodness are no longer important to most people. Beauty is still idolized in our society, and so it still has influence, however warped its role may have become. But the remarkable thing about true Beauty is that, when it is real and when it is pure, it carries in itself Truth and Goodness. The three are inseparable. And the best thing I can do as an artist who wants to serve the Church is to love all three, and to pursue them with prayer and humility, hoping to offer them to the Church and the world using the gifts I've been given. I believe God will bless that work. I am not worthy of it, but I undertake it willingly.\nMore beautiful than any gift of music one person can give is the coming together of believers to sing the praises of God. I hope this project will afford me the opportunity to experience that with you. Please consider supporting me: I have lots of fun rewards\u2014I think you'll love them! And I hope you'll love the record. I am really excited to make music with you. :) Thanks for everything.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter making music for my whole life, I am fully prepared to make this record. There is a lot that goes into creating a music project. But I've put a crack squad together and they are oh so ready for it.\n\nThe biggest risk you face backing this project is not getting your rewards as early as you'd like. Many of the rewards require a lot of time and love from me, so please be patient while I put them together! Everything we're doing here is with lots of love, so, while I will be responsible with my time, it may take a little longer than I'd like.\n\nOther than that, there's always the crazy outside possibility as an artist that my ability to perform is compromised by vocal injury, etc. If that happens, things will be delayed but we'll find a way to provide you with music to pray along with.\n\nIf you choose the packages that require travel from me or you, the inherent risk is the same as there ever is with travel.

The tent is officially BACK UP! We've reached our goal and are beginning to book studio time and flights for Spence and Steve to Nashville. HOWEVER...please continue to spread the word because every extra dollar will help make this an even better sounding, better looking, better smelling project. For those of you donating at the $75 level and higher, here's a sneak peak at the t-shirt Dave has designed. In a couple of weeks, we'll be asking for your sizes (no need to send those in yet).\nWhere to begin? Let's start two years ago in Franklin, Tenn. We were rehearsing for a 10 year reunion show at a worship conference. Very soon after playing through a few songs, we starting talking about how fun it would be to record again but couldn't figure out how to pay for it. The answer to our quandary came with Kickstarter. We LOVE Kickstarter because the fans get to participate in the process and we don't owe a thing to a record label. Instead, we owe YOU, our fans and supporters...to whom we've always owed a great deal of gratitude. (awww...single tear)\nThere's literally NO PRESSURE on us. We have no obligations to labels, publishers, managers, booking agents...no one. Our only obligation is to YOU. With that in mind, our goal is to simply enjoy ourselves and make you proud.\nSo you're asking \"Sheesh, $28,000 is a LOT of money.\" Yes it is. And we don't have it. But, if a lot of you give a little bit, we'll be ready to rock. \nThe money we raise will be spent wisely, but it has to go a L-O-N-G way. Beyond things like recording studio rentals, producer and engineer fees, other musicians, mixing and mastering, we're also going to need funding to create artwork, do a photo shoot, duplicate the CD, fly Spence and Steve to Nashville, etc. We can assure you, this is a shoestring budget and we promise no caviar lunch jet rides. \nWe've tried to come up with what we think are some fun awards for our backers, but mainly we wanted to make sure that you get your money's worth in downloads, t-shirts, Skype calls...even private concerts.\nNOTE: In any particular level, you can donate more dollars. For instance, if you want the awards at the $50 level, but really want to give $1,000...you can do that.  We see no problem with that whatsoever. Honestly. \nBUT...there's good news and not-so-good news. The good news is that if we raise OVER our goal, we get to keep the extra funds. That means higher quality everything, plus the ability to hire a publicist, maybe hire a radio promoter, print up some new merchandise, revamp our old touring gear, etc. Now, the not-so-good part: If we don't raise the TOTAL amount of our goal, we get ZERO. Nada, zilch, nothing. No CD, no reunion shows, no caviar lunches on private jets. That's a sad thing, right? Right. \nAlso, no money will be collected (your card will not be charged) until the campaign ends at 2 p.m. CST, Friday April 20 and ONLY if we meet our goal of $28,000.\nSo, what can YOU do? \"LIKE\" this on Facebook. Click to Tweet the heck out of this campaign! Post a link on your Facebook page. Post a link on your friends' walls, make an announcement at church, pass out flyers at political rallies.

Here's the scoop about a new project I've got in the works...\nRecently there's been an awakening in my creative life that I'm excited about. New songs have been stirring in me, and I'm ready to record a new album called Everything You Love Comes Alive. \nThis past year I've been writing and speaking about discovering our gifts, developing and nurturing them with passion and discipline, then sowing them like seeds into the fields where we live and work. I believe this \"work of art\" isn't so much a list of accomplishments or failures as it is doing what we love and are passionate about, and finding beauty and purpose in our lives as a result. Some of the songs on this record echo that theme--I can't wait for you to hear them!  \nProducing the album will be Nate Sabin, who produced my last CD, Meteor Shower. He's a brilliant songwriter, producer and friend who helps inspire my best work. Our plan is to record in Nashville and Minneapolis in late Spring of this year. I want to bring all of the resources, talents and heart I possibly can to this project. \nAs an independent artist, I don't have a record label that finances my albums, which means I am responsible for all of the costs. Although we've set the goal here at  $12,000, we've estimated the new album will cost about $20,000 to make. Even in a healthy, thriving economy, this amount is a lot to set aside and I'm very much in need of some help to fund this record. In addition to renting studio space, and paying the musicians and engineers a fair wage for their time and talents, there are also design and manufacturing costs. We were modest in our goal amount because it's all or nothing: if we don't get all of it pledged in the 30 days, we're back at zero.\nI would be humbled and overjoyed to have you share in this creative endeavor with me. Your support will make this vision a reality, and you'll play a part in not only creating a beautiful work of art, but also in encouraging and touching the lives of those who hear it. How cool is that?\nI'm offering thank you gifts for your pledge, but mostly I want you to know from the deepest place in my heart that I am grateful for your friendship and support.  \nPlease contact staci@stacifrenes.com if you have ANY questions about this campaign or project! \nWarmly,\nStaci \nP.S.

Emilie was seven. By age 13 Emilie was singing and playing with her musician dad in front of hundreds of people as a member of the church rock band. Emilie's parents knew music was more than just a passing fancy when she turned 14-years-old. After saving babysitting money for a year, she walked into Guitar Center to buy her very own electric guitar--a Gibson SG with a worn cherry finish. She not only has a passion and dream for music, but an emerging gift more than ready to be taken to the next level.\nEmilie was mentored in songwriting by Grammy nominated artist Sarah Kelly who helped Emilie write some of her very first songs. Her keen ear for writing melodies and the powerful and natural vocal are a compelling blend. It took her first experience with an extremely gifted songwriter to expose this gift. Now, this project will allow Emilie to grow even more.\nThis is where Ramy Antoun founder and president of CAG (Creative Arts Group) enters the story. As a producer he recently recorded artists such as Sara Overall and the 1211 Band and is also credited on albums as a session drummer by artists including Black Eyed Peas, Pat Benatar, Paul Oakenfold, Buckethead, Katie Rose, Alannah Myles, Michael Brooke, and Glen Phillips. Ramy has coached and mentored dozens of very gifted artists so this recording will be a huge win for young Emilie. \nDreams are possible, but they never come free. Help Emilie live her dream!

But let's keep going!!! It's not too late to become a backer!\n-------------------------------------------------\nJoin the cause of helping a confused culture find its way back to God. Pre-order your copies of FOUR LETTER WORDS here, and help shine a light for generations groping in darkness.\nFOUR LETTER WORDS is my second book. I'm asking for your help to bring it to life through Kickstarter. Just pre-purchasing your book helps back this cause. By clicking the \"back this cause\" button, you'll make it possible to spread its message around the world.\nThe message is simple: life works best when we do it God's way as revealed in the Bible. What if the brokenness, the struggles, the confused morality, the sexual desperation around and within us can be healed? What if a hard look at Jesus provides authentic answers to life's toughest questions? It's not about religion, it's about Jesus.\nWhat if some of life's biggest questions didn't have to stay questions forever?\nYour backing will... \n--Purchase your own high quality paperback books and help publish them for others.\n--Make e-books available on Kindle, Nook, and other formats. \n--Create charts and graphics (downloadable) to make the message clear, and to help with groups and classes. \n--Provide practical resources for groups and individual study via the Four Letter Words website. \n--Spread the word about this life-altering, faith-strengthening project.\nAdditional sales now that we've reached the goal will go toward creating additional resources. Thank you!\nCOMING FALL 2011! \nCover price will be $13.99. Become a backer now for pre-release discounts.\nCHRISTMAS GIFTS - GRADUATIONS GIFTS - STUDENTS AND FRIENDS\nYou won't be charged unless we reach the goal amount, so you purchase your pre-release copies with confidence. Once we hit the goal, the book is guaranteed to be printed. It is already written, I'm just polishing it up right now. The first part of the goal helps publish the book. As we exceed the goal, I'll be able to create great websites and add even more resources to help our friends see that God makes sense. \nGREAT NEWS! The foreword will be written by Dr. Sarah Sumner, DEAN OF A.W. TOZER THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY.\nHow you can help...\n1. Buy as many copies as you can; become a backer at the highest possible level.\n2. Spread the word. Please link to this page on Facebook, Twitter, and your blog weekly until we meet the goal. Tell your friends. The links and icons above will make this easy. You have no idea what a big help this would be! Especially if you invite your friends to repost your posts!\n3. Pray that God will use this project to speak his own four letter word of LOVE over a culture that has lost its way.\nFrom the Christian perspective, the world's crying need is a return to God. But our friends won't do that until their objections are answered. FOUR LETTER WORDS speaks to the touchy ideas that our ultra-tolerant age can't tolerate about Jesus. With love and patience, this book dismantles the disbelief that keeps our friends from God.\nNo system of faith or truth has ever offered as beautiful, logical and satisfying a worldview as biblical Christianity. It's time to say so, with compassion, humility, and courage.\nTable of Contents\n1. FOUR LETTER WORDS --Why do Christians believe stuff that gets them into trouble? Why can they seem so intolerant? Why does our ultra-tolerant culture find the Christian worldview so intolerable?\n2. TRUE --Who says your truth has to be my truth too? Can\u2019t we both be right? What is truth and where can I find it?\n3. KNOW --How do we know what we know? Is faith a weak link in the Christian\u2019s chain of knowing? Doesn\u2019t science contradict the Bible?\n4. OUCH, part 1 --Why is there pain and suffering in the world? Why does my life hurt? When will God stop the pain? What is he waiting for? \n5. OUCH, part 2 --Is suffering real or just an illusion? Does Jesus care? Is he strong enough to heal my wounds?\n6. EVIL --Do good and evil really exist? How do I tell the difference? Should Christians be judgmental? Who's to say what's right and wrong?\n7. WORD --What makes the Bible so special? Isn\u2019t it just one among many valid options? Isn't all truth God's truth?  \n8. DAMN --Is hell real? Will God send people there? Why? How can hell be consistent with God\u2019s love? Doesn't love win in the end? (You can download this chapter for free by clicking here.)\n9. WAIT --Sexuality is a normal part of life, so, if we love each other, why wait? Wasn\u2019t the Bible written for a different time and place? Why should we enforce its ancient values today?\n10. HOPE --Strength for today, hope for tomorrow. No philosophy or religion has ever given the world as much hope as biblical Christianity. A beautiful story of interlocking truths, revealing the heart of a Father who loves you. Why not try Jesus?\nHere are some early reader comments...\n\u201cI don't know if you were hoping for a rave review or not but... you've got it. :) This was great. Seriously. I was tempted to pass it on to my pastor because I think it is something he really needs to read. These issues are exactly the reason my church is so small... our neighborhood is all young, postmodern-ish people, VERY reluctant to go to a church with \"evangelical\" over the door. I read it all through a couple times, Wayne read it through and we agreed that it's a really important and well-written book. Your voice is great. You don't sound like you're trying to be too conversational, but you are making whole semesters worth of information very accessible. Anyway. Huge high-five directed your way.\u201d\n* * * * * \n\u201cWell, I love it. You hit the nail on the head with the conversational aspect. It is easy to read, witty, funny, and clever without skimping on meat.\n* * * * *\n\u201cYou accurately and passionately take very deep, very profound theological and philosophical concepts and give them a familiarity that would allow me to be on a first name basis with them.\n* * * * *\n\u201cMost importantly, as a 20 something majoring in philosophy and in love with Biblical theology, I would recommend this book at length to anyone and everyone I know. Like I said before, it is weighty enough to captivate people versed in philosophical nomenclature without disappointment, and yet practical enough for your average blue-collar guy or gal to grasp and utilize. Our culture is indeed under attack, and we need to provide the tools of battle needed to wage war. This is one of those tools, and I thank God that He has given you the ability to do something like this. Keep 'em coming!!!!\u201d\nCOMING FALL 2011! \nClick here to view my first book, released about a year and a half ago... Check out the 100% five-star reviews.
