We have included an approximate USD conversion for all the reward tiers and add-ons. The project goal of $12,000 AUD is approximately $9,000 USD.\nMedieval Playing Cards is the original deck created by Egor Klyuchnyk from Anomaly world studio in collaboration with Elephant Playing cards.\nInspired by fearless knights, severe lords and gorgeous queens, Medieval is a fully custom hand-drawn deck with one way courts in the original old style of playing card decks. From the card stock to the construction of the tuckbox, Medieval is designed to transport you back in time with a contemporary twist!\nSilver and Gold edition decks with Foil (to be unlocked!)\n   These new decks have been created to show all beauty of the Medieval Age and inspired by the great artist - Diego Vel\u00e1squez. Through this deck we want you to feel this epoch, and experience its elegance and grandeur. We present two types of decks: First, the Silver Unlimited Edition, and second the Gold Limited Edition for those who want to stand out.\nUnlimited SILVER Edition\n   Limited GOLD Edition\n Features of the decks:\nPrinted by Legends Playing Cards Company.\nThicker Robusto card stock for a genuine medieval feel.\nRed wax-style seal.\nIntricate custom numbered seal on the Limited Gold deck (if unlocked)\nAuthentic out-of-the box tuck flap packaging.\nBeautiful and Intricate 2-way back design for both decks.\nUnique coat of arms for each suit- subtle background design. \nCard Backs (click for higher resolution)\n  Note about the out-of-the-box tuck flap\nSeveral people have commented how impractical this will be for continual use - this is not the case! Once the seal is broken and the deck opened, the flap will fold back inside the tuckbox just like a normal deck. It is the same size and will function exactly the same as a normal deck after opening. We have chosen to use this construction method to emulate old-style decks, but with the ability to convert back if you want to. It is unique and looks awesome, but once you open it it will work just like another (but better) deck of cards!\n    Medieval playing cards were created with one way faces harking back to the old style playing cards to represent nobility in all their glory.

These sugar skulls are very colorful and whimsical, not scary at all. I absolutely love the Sugar Skull style used for the Day of the Dead.\nIn terms of meaning, the skull symbolizes death but in a positive manner. In Mexico it is believed that death is not the final stage in one\u2019s life but rather a step forward into a higher level of conscience.\nCALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - Black - Printed by the USPCC \n   Limited run of 2500 decks\n  One thing that makes sugar skulls stand out from other skull-related creations is how jolly it looks. Most depictions of the skull are either creepy or morbid, but sugar skulls are happy and cheerful ones. The reason for this is because they want to capture the joy and spirit of their deceased loved ones.\nThe symbolism of a sugar skull is rooted in the decoration around the eyes. Flowers are meant to symbolize life, while cobwebs symbolize death. The skulls are designed to be bright and cheerful, being a celebration of the life that once was.\n                      T-Shirt Design\n  T-Shirts are 100% Fine Cotton\nSizes: S, M, L, XL, 2XL (Mens and Womens sizes)\n$23 per T-Shirt ($26 for International) \nUncut Sheets\nThe front side of the CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR uncut sheet (frame not included).\nDimensions: 22 X 26.5\" \nThey show every card in the deck, front and back\nPackaging: Rolled up and shipped in a cardboard tube\nColors available: Black or Blue\n$35 per Uncut Sheet ($55 for International)\n  CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - Blue - Printed by the USPCC - Limited run of 2500 decks  \n                      WALL ART\nPosters:\nPoster Size: 12 x 18 \nONLY 50 of each Available\nSigned and Numbered\n$30 per Poster ($45 for International) \nAvailable in Black / Blue\nPaper Stock: Standard heavyweight: 80 lb. stock with matte finish\n    Canvas Prints:\nLimited Edition\nONLY 5 OF EACH SIZE ARE AVAILABLE \nSigned and Numbered\nChoose from 6 sizes to suit any interior space \nArchival-quality inks won't fade over time\nComes ready to hang with hinged hardware\nBlack / Blue\n       CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - PURPLE - LIMITED EDITION \n500 decks ONLY!

Designer playing cards with attitude.\nRemember us?\nThe Buzz:\nIn April 2015, over 500 people from all over the world contributed to the Kickstarting of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. We released our debut deck - a completely custom, foil-covered deck of playing cards that oozed attitude. The design that you helped create was a hit, and is now loved by people around the world, all thanks to you! \nWe're extremely proud of the original deck and its general reception. It won a place on Kardify's Top 12 Decks of 2015! We were interviewed by ABC Local Radio Australia and the Local Newspaper. The original deck recently won third place in United Cardists' \"2015: Deck of the Year Contest\" for three categories - Best Ace of Spaces, Best Jokers and Best Tuck Box. The deck also landed a spot within the Top 100 Hot New Releases in Toys and Games on Amazon, as well as being featured on Art of Play, Cardvolution, and Gambler's Warehouse - three of the biggest playing card retailers on the planet. \nWe\u2019ve been absent for a while, but now we\u2019re back! The Joker and the Thief return with a striking and luxurious colour way \u2013 White and Gold.\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition \nSharp. Streamline. Sublime\nTuck box photography by our friend Fabien Defaucheux. Check out his work on Instagram - @Fabiendefaucheux\n In collaboration with our artist Pedro Oyarbide, we originally sought to create a deck that was distinctly unique amongst other decks of playing cards on the market. We focussed on 100% custom illustration, striking details, eye-catching packaging and deep connotation evident through symbolic design. \nTo add to the mythology that the Joker and the Thief Playing Cards evoke, we decided to create a white and gold edition. This creates a third dimension of meaning, contrasting the darkness of the original deck with the light colour scheme of the second edition. This builds upon the conflict between life and mortality that is apparent on the back design. The Joker and the Thief emerge from the shadows more beautiful than ever.\nThe Back Design\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition rocks a metallic gold, inverted colour scheme.\nA thought provoking dynamic of mysticism and myth.\nThe first step in creating the original cards was to create a unique back design. One that not only had an intricately beautiful design but one that both appealed aesthetically and sentimentally. It had to be thought provoking. From the first sketches to the end product, it slowly developed its own flair, and this continues throughout the deck! \nThe back design is one way; it is perhaps one of, if not, the most unobtrusive and functional major one-way design on a deck of cards.\nThis allows for a unique story and symbolism to be evoked; metaphors of life and mortality, thievery, lies, deceit, power, mysticism, struggle, and love. We see the opposition of the King and Joker, the way they oppose each other, each being attacked by a viper, a symbol that despite their contrast, both share the same fate. The chained hands, both of flesh and bone, represent mortality. They hold cards; life holds the ace of spades, the death card, and the skeletal holds a card with a skull on it, representing the inevitability of death. The chains and manacles link the Joker and the Thief, and the daggers represent the danger of their opposition.\nThe Joker and the Thief: White Gold Edition features an inverted back design sporting bright gold metallic ink for gorgeous shimmer in sunlight. \nThe Ace of Spades \nIconic. Draped in Gold.\nA bold statement. The ace of spades is the source of the original deck's identity.\nJoker and the Thief's debut Ace of Spades returns\nThe Court Cards\n12 Completely Custom Court Cards\nThe court cards are all completely custom, illustrated from scratch. The themes that you see on the back design can be seen here. You may even start to see a story forming as you shuffle through them. We have created something different. We have done away with borders to free the courts - to make use of the space and to make each of them distinct and prominent characters.\n\"12 court cards, dressed with charisma and distinct in character - royalty ready for battle.\" - Art of Play\nThe Joker and The Thief \nThe Two Troublemakers Return. \nThe Joker and The Thief\nThe Tuck Box \nPeppered with Lavish Touches.\nBy far the most praised aspect of the original deck of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards was the tuck box, which was adorned with a heavy amount of silver foil hot stamped on both the exterior and interior of the box. Now we have dressed the second edition in a beautiful white and gold colour scheme. \nWith gold foil stamping, embossing, a perforated blood red tax stamp seal now featuring gold foil, and a new uncoated matte finish for the white stock - this version is bound to stand out amongst your collection. Impress your friends with a deck that many are calling a conversation starter!\nThis tuck case will look amazing on your poker nights, pulling them out to perform to a spectator, residing on a shelf amonst your prized collection, or featured in an opening shot of one of your Cardistry Videos. \nBeautiful and extravagant tuck boxes are going to be a consistent feature of the Joker and the Thief brand moving into the future.\nInterior Hot Foil Stamping\nDesigned with Handling in Mind\nLightened and Improved. Taking full advantage of design and composition.\nAs a more refined version of the original deck, the White Gold edition had to be lightened, and stripped back. By inverting the back design, it not only created an elegant aesthetic, but it also significantly cuts the amount of ink saturation within the card stock. This takes full advantage of the composition of Classic Finish. By stripping back a significant amount of Joker and the Thief\u2019s ink, this deck should possess a far snappier; far more responsive and papery feel in comparison to the original deck. \nThe Bells and Whistles \nAll the features you want, know and love!\nThinner Borders\n100% Custom Pips, Fonts, Court Cards and Art Work\nUpdated Colour Scheme\nGold and Silver Metallic Inks (Faces and Backs)\nInterior Tuck Case Gold Foil Stamping \nExterior Tuck Case Embossing + Hot Stamped Gold Foil Coverage\nDramatic Ink Saturation Reduction \nCLASSIC Stock and Finish for Improved Handling\nMatte Finish Tuck Case Paper\nTraditionally Cut for Smooth Edges\nPerforated Blood Red Tax Stamp Style Seal now with Gold Foil\nManufacturing\nThe Expert Playing Card Company will manufacture the second edition of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards. This ensures that you receive the highest quality product possible, and a deck of playing cards that is both incredibly durable and handles amazingly. \nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition will sport the highly acclaimed CLASSIC Stock and Finish. To take full advantage of this type of stock and finish, this edition will feature a reduction of ink saturation due to its inverted back design. This, along with being traditionally cut, ensures snappier, smoother, crisper and more responsive cards for maximised performance.\nThis praised finish has both the snappiness and durability of EPCC's previous decks combined with the more papery feel and slick finish of a traditional USPCC deck. It is the best of both worlds.\nLEFT: Standard USPCC Cutting. RIGHT: Precision Cutting (Our Manufacturer) EPCC\nFulfilment Service\nTo ensure that your decks arrive safely and quickly, Art of Play will be returning to fulfil the Joker and the Thief: Gold Edition deck.

My name is James Milaras, and I am the co-founder and owner of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. \nSecondly, we're very thankful here at Joker and the Thief for you guys, our backers! Last year, you made something very special happen. My best friend and business partner, Reuben, and I wanted to create a special deck of playing cards. Creating a deck of cards was our dream ever since we first got into cards. Our backers made that a reality! You will always be apart of team Joker and the Thief.\nReuben Nutt, while still collaborating with us has since moved town to pursue other interests. His continued efforts in creating beautiful video and photographic content for Joker and the Thief has been outstanding. Of course a shout out to our beast of an illustrative team member, Pedro Oyarbide, for his amazing work on this project as well as an upcoming monster of a project.\nWith that said there is even more cool stuff from us this year! Joker and the Thief: Dystopia is coming (*winks*). If you don't know who we are, here's a little something that will bring you up to speed with us!\nJoker and the Thief was founded by two Australian Cardists, videographers and photographers that have huge love for all things playing cards.\nBack in 2012, we started up a YouTube channel called Joker and the Thief Card Deck Reviews. Through this we collaborated with Art of Play. We got together on our weekends, and in our spare time to go out and location scout to shoot. We then edited in house, usually side by side, listening to music and fuelled by snacks. We had minimal equipment and a very small budget (if there really was one) Oh the joys of indie film making!\nWe sought to change the way deck reviews were made and in doing so, many adventures were had along the way. Since we didn't have a car at the time, our bikes and our legs were the main source of transport in our city, if we were to shoot on location. With little time, little transport, a budget of... not much, and our favourite Youtubers, Film Makers, and Cardists as our inspiration, we slowly but surely developed our skills. We had some truly memorable moments along the way. We always knew that we were going to create a deck of cards... one day. And here we are - Round 2! \nWe've done this once guys! We can do it again.

We are confident that this Kickstarter campaign will be an even smoother process than our last project. \n\nAs with any project, there are risks and challenges involved. We ensure that our methods are simple. Outsourcing will once again allow for a very smooth and successful campaign.\n\nShipping:\n\n- We are enlisting Art of Play to handle the shipping of your decks. So as soon as the Expert Playing Card Company has finished manufacturing the cards, the stock will then be sent to Art of Play's warehouse in San Diego, California. The shipping of the stock to Art of Play may take up to three weeks. There is a possibility that this process may be slightly delayed, but in case that this happens, you will be updated.\n\n- Your orders will promptly be packed and sent out to wherever you are in the world. If you have ever received a package from Art of Play, you will know that their packages are secure and every deck arrives in immaculate condition. You will also receive a tracking number for your rewards!\n\n- We expect the cards to be shipping out to you in [Insert Date]. If earlier you'll be updated. We'd rather over-promise than under-deliver.\n\nProduction:\n\n- As it stands, the files have been at EPCC prior to the launch of this campaign. So, as soon as we hit our goal, we will give Expert the all clear to start production.\n\n- When the campaign is successful and has concluded half the job will be done. It may take 3-4 weeks for manufacturing time. There is always a possibility that a delay or a problem can occur in terms of manufacturing. Expert Playing Card Company has an excellent work ethic and will work hard to ensure that no issues come up, and if they do, will be sorted quickly.\n\n- It is important to note that we also receive physical and digital proofs from Expert that must be approved. Since we are based in Australia allow for up to 2 weeks for us to receive these proofs and confirm them. We need to make sure that you are guaranteed quality. \n\nUpdates:\n\n- As soon as we hear something, you will too. Our updates section will be our platform to announce anything new to you.\n\nOther Rewards:\n\n- For those who pledge for posters, they will be produced, signed, packaged and shipped in house. We will make sure that your posters are sent out as early as possible.\n\nThanks very much for visiting our campaign page and backing!

We have published 10 titles so far, with 4 of them - Progress: Evolution of Technology, Exodus: Edge of Extinction, Mistfall and Simurgh - financed through Kickstarter.\n\nOur delivery track record is so far impeccable, each project was finalized and delivered before or by the deadline, in spite of tight self-imposed schedules. Simurgh, funded in December 2015 is due to be delivered in May 2015, right on schedule. However, we are aware that each project has its own specific challenges and we plan to reduce the risk through careful planning and contingency measures.\n\nWith four successful projects we are making use of our experiences to improve our processes and further decrease any risks. As In the Name of Odin is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, we already know the ropes, and with the time used to prepare not only the game, but also the campaign itself, we are ready to face any possible challenges.\n\nOur goal with In the Name of Odin is to produce the game within 90 days from the campaign end, and to deliver before the end of August 2016. We already have a detailed production and shipping plan in place.\n\nThe new challenge with In the Name of Odin is the presence of plastic miniatures. This is a new technology with which we have some degree of experience (Exodus had plastic miniatures) but we have enrolled the help of experts in this field.\n\nThe fulfillment will be handled by the same companies that helped us deliver Progress, Exodus and Mistfall. We're already familiar with their systems and vice-versa, thus we expect little to no delays on this front.\n\nAlthough In the Name of Odin is fully developed and the artwork is 75% ready, we are also prepared for unexpected delays. In the worst case scenario, finalizing the art could add delays of max. 10 days, production of some extra 25 days and shipping & customs may add 10-15 days.\n\nWe are experienced at dealing with large production runs, and we are preparing backup plans for each step of our project, starting from production, through shipping, to final delivery.\n\nWith all of the above points in mind, we estimate that there is a 80% chance of a delivery at or before the deadline and only a 20% chance of a 30 days delay.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nBecause we are dealing with a large number of games produced, packed and shipped, there is always a chance for human error or damaged parts. If such a thing happens, please check out our customer support page on www.nskn.net and we will send you replacements with all due haste.

Please, follow us as we show you our project.\nThe deck, named Teliad Heren, represents nature, life, harmony, not \u201cpeace\u201d since Humans, Orcs, Elves and Dwarves do battle and confront themselves. The back has elements from the four races and fuses them together in a new, innovative way. Gold foiling will embellish the tuck case (even without the stretch goal)\nThe back from Teliad Heren is a summary of all the graphic elements from the four races\nThe indices have a peculiar style, inspired by the runic alphabet\nThe Elves (clubs)\nThe Humans (hearts)\nThe jokers - inspired to the classic Dal Negro joker\nA big summary with the faces of Teliad Heren\nAlfrin stands for \u201cimmortal\u201d and depicts the fantasy world of Teliad in an timeless, eternal life. That\u2019s why Teliad Alfrin is decorated with gold and silver ink. All the colors of the characters will be printed in two layers: an underlying metallic ink and a CMYK print on top.\nAlfrin will be limited to 1000 decks, and never printed again.\nAlfrin tuck case with green foil and DRAGONSCALE paper\nAlfrin hearts and diamonds\nAlfrin clubs and spades\nAlfrin jokers\nThe king of hearts in all his regal glory\nThe bold Queen of spades\nDwarves in heaven? Why not! They are hard workers, they deserve some peace\nThe brave Jack of spades\nThe dragon back of Teliad Alfrin. Green and silver ink\nWith Teliad d\u00f9r (obscurity), Darkness enters the world of Teliad. Dark colors, silver ink and new, twisted, details for all the court cards are the key features of this deck.\nTeliad d\u00f9r is a stretch goal: when unlocked, pledges will change as stated in their description.\nThe tuck case in its (evil) glory\nThe king of hearts, after being corrupted by Darkness\nThe fine details of the back\nHow number cards and pips will look in Teliad d\u00f9r\nPassione relies on LPCC for printing its own premium decks. LPCC is a reliable partner, already involved in the Love is a Smoke project.\nTeliad will be printed with Elite finish.\nLPCC's attention to details is \"legendary\"\nA statement from LPCC: \"At Legends PCC, our primary focus is producing the world\u2019s finest playing cards for people who appreciate quality. Constantly staying on top of worldwide printing advances, we seek to apply these to playing card manufacturing and packaging design. With this project, we are looking forward to trying out a new and never before used paper stock for packaging, a premiere Italian paper supplier with a wide selection of brand new paper varieties. Quality and consistency is paramount when dealing with paper, and when you print with Legends, we can closely match the feel and durability of any of our in-house decks.\"\nLPCC masters the art of printing playing cards\n\nThis time Passione Playing Cards together with LPCC will bring out custom tuck cases for the first time from a renowned Italian company, a leader in paper manufacturing: Fedrigoni.\n...you won't find a finest paper than Fedrigoni's\n\nFedrigoni is not a new player in the market. It actually created the market itself, the Fedrigoni Group was born in 1717 AD. Now Fabriano is part of the Fedrigoni Group, it is worthwhile to remember that Fabriano invented modern paper, working on it since 1264 AD. It\u2019s one of the most ancient \u201cmade in Italy\u201d products you can think of.\nWe are still in the process of selecting the right paper for each tuck case.\nAfter the main goal we already prepared some stretch goals. When Teliad d\u00f9r is unlocked, tiers with more than one deck will have it included.\nDuring the campaign you will be able to customize your pledge by adding decks, uncut sheets or other objects unlocked during the campaign. You can't add Teliad Alfrin decks (the limited ones), but you can add uncuts.\nHeren uncut (front)\nHeren uncut (back)\nAlfrin uncut (only back for now ;-) )\nThe leather pouch\nThey speak about us:\nMaxPlayingCards 1: TELIAD Playing Cards.

Luxury for the modern cardician.\nThe Design\nA merger of form and function\nWe wanted to create a worker's deck. A pack of 52 cards that merges form with function. Using a classical approach to design, the goal was to develop a look that is familiar, but fresh. The elegant repeating pattern evokes the decks that have survived the test of time. Black Mint Playing Cards are luxury for the modern cardician.\nHandling\nBlack Mint will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock.\nAfter we established the look, we focused on the feel. The true mark of a card is how it handles. The Black Mint deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock available. It will be coated with the legendary Air Cushion Finish to provide for the smoothest spread, fans, and shuffles. \nCustom Faces\nClassic court cards with a modern touch of MINT.\nEverything about the Black Mint Deck is custom. The faces include custom fonts, pips, court cards, and Ace of Spades,  but we were careful to maintain the classic playing card look that we have all grown to recognize and love.\nBy Magicians, for Magicians\nThe back design features an intuitive marking system for magicians to take clever advantage of.\nOur goal is to create harmony between the card and the cardician. Black Mint playing cards are a tool; and like great magic, they hide their best kept secret in plain sight. An innovative marking system opens up and endless world of possibilities. We have also included several gaff cards to help you perform special effects that you couldn't with an average deck.\nExtra Cards Include a double backer and a double facer.\n'Edge 52' Online Instructional Course\nEach deck comes with an instructional course teaching you powerful effects with your deck.\nStudents of 52Kards know that we are also invested in the education of magic. Each Black Mint deck will come bundled with a free in depth instructional course that will teach you how to effectively use the built in marking system and included gaff cards. The course will also cover the use of a variety of other gimmicks in card magic.\nThe course will include chapters on the use of marked cards, duplicate cards, double backers, double facers, short cards, tapered cards, crimped cards, and more.\nIf you have been learning magic and sleight of hand technique from 52Kards.com or the 52Kards Youtube channel, then you will LOVE this course.\nRaspberry Mint\nMany backers have been asking if we will eventually produce a Mint deck that has a colored back design. This has been our intention all along as The Mint Collection is meant to be a complete line of playing cards with the Black Mint being the launch edition. The next edition we have planned is the Raspberry Mint deck (think the Black Mint deck, except in a beautiful shade of red), and we were originally going to release it next year sometime... However, due to the massive success of this project we are getting the Raspberry Mints printed at the same time as the Black Mints!\nA mockup of the Raspberry Mint Deck. The exact shade of red may be subject to change.\nIf this stretch goal is reached, then backers will be given the opportunity to choose how many Black Mint decks and how many Raspberry Mint decks they want to get with their pledged money. \nRaspberry Mints will also be available as a $10 add on. They will NOT be limited, and will continue to be sold at 52Kards.com after they are printed. \n The cards and tuck boxes will include all of the same features as the Black Mint deck (markings system, custom seal, embossed/foiled box, gaff cards, etc). \n Once the campaign is over we will be sending out a survey to all of the backers and you will be given the opportunity to add any additional decks to your reward package.\n Limited Edition\nWe have a BIG update to the Black Mint Playing Cards Kickstarter project! In order to celebrate the massive support the project has already received we are introducing a new LIMITED EDITION Black Mint Deck! It's a beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card(see the picture below to behold it's full glory!). The borderless back is perfectly suitable for the Black Mint design and the touch of gold adds a rich aesthetic to the pattern.\nA beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card.\nLimited Edition Black Mint.\nLimited Edition & standard Black Mints Limited Edition & standard Black.\nHere's a few important points:\nThe Limited Edition Black Mint will be available exclusively through this Kickstarter project and will never be for sale again after the campaign is over. The regular Black Mint cards will be available at 52Kards.com once they are printed; although Kickstarter backers will be getting them sooner and at a discounted price. \n The Limited Edition decks cost $15 each. To reserve your decks, simply add $15 to your pledge per deck. We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to find out exactly what you want your pledged money to go towards.  Each person is allowed to purchase a maximum of 6x decks per person. We will strictly be enforcing this rule to keep these decks truly limited in nature. \n The intuitive Mint Marking System will still be included in the Limited Edition decks. \nWe are keeping the tuck box design a surprise for now, but trust us when we say it's going to be especially handsome. \nLimited Edition Black Mints are only available to backers of this project. After March 2nd you will no longer be able to become a backer. \n If you don't know how to manage your pledge and add more money to your contribution you can see this video for more information:\nAdd Ons\nBlack Mint Deck - $10 per deck\nRaspberry Mint Deck - $10 per deck\nLimited Edition Black Mint Deck - $15 per deck\nMint Stripper Deck - $15 per deck\nBlack Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each\nRaspberry Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each\nLimited Edition Uncut Sheet - $50 each\nStretch Goals\nFree USA Shipping when you get 6 decks or more\n Would you like to add extra rewards to your pledge level? Click this video to see how.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is getting enough funding to get the decks printed. The United States Playing Card Company requires a minimum order of 2,500 decks in order for them to print your design. As you can imagine, this amounts to a large amount of money, which is why we are asking for your support in this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nEverything else is ready to go. Once we have the funds we will be ready to print. Your rewards will be sent to you as soon as production is complete, which we expect to be in June of 2016 (hopefully sooner).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "MINT 2 is Coming...", "update_content": "Hey Backers!!!

Back of this deck will be printed with exclusive real gold based pigment inks. First ever new debosing technology will be used to produce Velvet tuck box with extreme detailing of debossing pattern. Deck will include white cover \"jacket\" with gold foil stamped logo. Custom shape and design for numbered seals which could contain owner's name. \nOnly very limited amount of decks will be printed (400 decks only) and only 370 decks will be available on Kickstarter. \nWe use FREE WORLDWIDE registered airmail delivery to every backer.\nName of the deck was inspired by Branle, 12th-century French chain dance adopted (c. 1450\u2013c. 1650) by European aristocrats, especially in France and in England, where the word branle was anglicized as \u201cbrawl.\u201d Aristocrats frequently performed pantomimic branles in which they scolded each other like washerwomen or courted (as in the branle de Poitou, the possible ancestor of the minuet). Certain branles, especially in France, were designated for specific age groups, such as the lively branle de Bourgogne for the youngest dancers.\nBranle Playing Cards deck portrays history and culture of XVI-XVII centuries. Each of the suits can be associated with a particular European country. For example, the peaks - Britain, hearts - France, clubs - Spain and diamonds - Eastern Europe (Rzeczpospolita, Transylvania, Hungary). Suits are not linked to these countries directly, but the association is undoubtedly present.

We are now back with another exciting deck of playing cards inspired by femininity, but more importantly, using the latest in printing and manufacturing technology.\nImpressions Foil Femme by MPC\nMPC Ace of Spades with foil back\nThe Femme Deck\nFollowing on the huge success of our previous projects where we used high gloss, touch and feel printing technology to playing cards, which has had such widespread appeal and have definitely grown way above our expectations, we have been working altogether again on creating another card deck concept.\nWhile there are many playing card designs out there, there seemed to be not that many decks in the industry using softer tones such as pastel colors which is a surprise. The Femme deck is a concept deck inspired by beauty, femininity, love and romance. We finalized on pink and mint colors which were chosen carefully from research of reports of popular colors which could represent this concept.  The outcome of using the combination of these colors with raised high gloss embossing with metallic printing technology are absolutely beautiful and we're proud to share it with everyone. We introduce to you, the all new Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards.\nThe Impressions Foil Femme decks are pretty much amazing and definitely playing cards that you'll not have seen before with this kind of beauty. With an added \u201ctouch and feel\u201d dimension to a well-established product, which we introduced to the gaming industry, feeling the touch of the cards is an exciting experience in itself.\nClose-up of card back\nWho's it for?\nThese playing cards are for everyone. Despite its femininity themed colors, they will appeal to all as there's no denying the colors coupled with this technology is a great match.\nMint deck\nPink deck\nThe astoundingly shiny foil back playing cards with raised UV printing is the first of its kind in the playing cards industry. What's more, they can very much be played with like a normal CMYK printed deck and with superb performance. We have had countless number of testing of prototypes. Keeping these cards true as a deck of cards, we are using professional playing cards grade air pocketed paper card stock (linen) with a black core center layer.\nDeveloping this deck is possible only through our skilled workforce and dedication to do what others have not done before. The knowledge that our mother company QP Group has acquired in its 33 years history and its ongoing investments in the latest technology, manufacturing methods and people have allowed us to create this exceptionally special Impressions Foil range.\nTechnology\nThe technology used behind our Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards is a mix of traditional manufacturing methods plus state of the art secondary process industrial machinery. In short, we apply embossed gloss UV using pinpoint accuracy on state of the art machinery onto a layer of thin foil on the complex card back design which produces the outstandingly attractive and shiny metallic card back look.\nThe high gloss is very different to traditional spot UV as this revolutionary technology can produce a raise of up 250 microns in polymer height (which is Braille). We can also control the density of polymer applied, which is a ground breaking technology in printed materials.\nOur signature high gloss UV is widely acclaimed due to its glossiness and characteristics to enable players to touch and feel the cards. Reaching 99GU gloss, which is the highest possible on printed material, giving the foil layer an extra shine, further strengthening the metallic shine experience.\nComparison with normal printed cards\nThe Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards are produced on 310gsm linen professional grade paper card stock. This is one of the top card stock that MPC offers, with black core center layer and equipped with an air pocketed surface creating a fantastically smooth handling experience.\nHandling\nWe believe that playing cards is definitely an art, but at the same time, we don\u2019t want to just create an art piece. We at MPC make sure that all cards that we produce are absolutely playable and would offer an exceptional handling experience for those of us who need it such as magicians and cardistry enthusiasts. You can see how they perform in the project video.\nOne handed fan\nDesign\nOn releasing playing cards under our MPC brand, we also developed our own unique playing card design to go with it. Our signature back consists of a symmetrical illustration of a fully grown tree.\nMPC tree back\nWe need trees to make paper and as a responsible paper product manufacturer and print company, QP devotes endless resources to help create a better environment by enforcing recycling efforts and expanding usage of recycled materials on mass productions. We have chosen a tree design to remind ourselves of our roots and values. The card face of these Impressions Foil cards adopts a standard design for practicality. All artwork were fully redrawn to create this design unique to MPC.\nThe Femme decks comes in colors pink and mint tree back, making it the perfect addition to your collection and more importantly, can become your everyday deck of cards for entertainment and performance.\nStretch goal\n$15K - Once we reach this funding goal, we will upgrade our regular seals on each tuck box to the special gold signed MPC seal.\nWe're working on more surprises.\nMetallic Tuck box\nThe tuck box contains a layer of thin foil and the revolutionary high gloss UV technology to apply different levels of polymer (very glossy raised ink) to certain parts of the artwork to form a touch and feel effect.\nFoiled tuck boxes\nUncut sheets\nWe have the Pink and Mint foil back uncut sheets available through our ULTIMATE COLLECTORS pledge or you can buy them individually for $30 each as an add-on.\nGifts\nAs always we\u2019re hoping to be able to include a gift for all our backers.

We plan on releasing several decks (or series) a year and each of these decks will have a different theme. We have always loved that look of the Minimalist art style and in what you can convey with just simple lines, blacks & whites and solid bold coloring. It is a style that is very unique and really stands out.\nOur face cards are the 10's, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers. These have what we refer to as \"Figure Art\".\nOur pip cards are the 2-9 and have what we refer to as \"Element Art\".\nWe spent a lot of time and went through several versions when developing the card back. This ultimately was the one we decided to use. It is a completely mirrored back and works on several visual levels.\nTop - Standard Deck / Bottom - Miniverse Deck\nOne of our all time favorite tuck boxes is the Heretic set by Stockholm 17. It is a thing of beauty in its nearly all black design. Right from the start, we knew we wanted to keep that minimalist look throughout everything and it made sense to make our tuck box very stark. Bits of color, mostly blacks and greys, and with just enough information on it so you knew what deck you had in your hands.\nStandard Tuck Box\nPrices include S&H costs.

It is basically the equivalent to a red poker deck... while the standard deck would be considered a black poker deck.\nNew Features - Back of the cards are now red (of course). All the King cards have different & new figures not seen in the standard deck. The background behind the main art for the front of the cards is reversed. Alternative versions of the Joker cards. Alternative red colored tuck box.\nMiniverse Deck\nUNCUT SHEET ($40 US / World - Email for Quote)\nThis is a 310 GSM Linen Finish Uncut Sheet.

Comes in either a Hardcover bound edition or a digital PDF edition.\n(*BONUS - Hardcover also includes the Digital PDF Book version as well)\n\nSo what has changed from the previous campaign?\n1. MPC will now handle all the card production. This way it makes things a bit more manageable for us.\n2. Much lower funding goal of only $2100.00 instead of the original $8000.00. This one should easily be obtainable.\n3. Deck prices are a little bit cheaper... for the most part. We've tried to pass those savings onto our backers. Every little bit helps nowadays.\n4. We've put up all new and really interesting Add-On's for you to get. Some we have never seen offered before in a campaign, Please check those out above.\n5. We had to remove some of the previous characters. BUT, there are new ones in their place that are just awesome. Check them all out.\n6. All the artwork has been improved and enhanced. The background have a more 3D look and feel to it and all the figures have a slight shadow behind them that makes them seem like they are jumping off the card. Really cool looking stuff.\n7. Our backers had suggested easier to read cards. Well... you asked for it and you got it. First, we made the numbers/pips and suits much larger. Next, we removed the right handed side numbers/pips in favor of a more streamlined look, as well as, going back to the industry standard of Red/Black coloring on all the cards.\nI noticed that Mighty Heroic Minis states it is Series 1.1. What does this mean?\nIt just simply means that this is Series 1 Deck 1. \nSo... series 1 will always be your Mighty Heroic Minis. In the future, if we do a second deck of all new characters, it would be Mighty Heroic Minis \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1 Deck 2. That way you always know what specific deck you have in your hands.\nI see there is a tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Heroic Minis LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nHow are the funds going to be used?\nTwo Geeks Gaming is a small design company specializing in Card Games, Tabletop Games and Custom Artwork. We have invested thousands of dollars into getting the company started and designing this one deck. We also have three more decks planned for release in the upcoming 2016 year. \nSo the bottom line is this... if there are any profits made from this campaign, it will go right back into development for our next deck and future projects.\n Twogeeksgaming01@gmail.com\nRead about us here\nRead about us here\n                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed.

I started the design over 1 year ago, and I have continuously improved on since I wanted to make an elegant and intriguing version.\nBEFORE-AFTER, SPOT THE DIFFERENCES :)\nIn this case the face of the Queen Of Spades has been modified\nAbout the production: The deck will be printed by Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC) with classic finish. The goal for this deck is a little high because the deck is full of features and the production costs are very high (twice a normal deck). I need to produce at least 2000 units to keep the production costs affordable.\nAbout me: Requiem Team is just me, one-man-band. My name is Lorenzo, I live and work in Stockholm, Sweden. Designing and illustrating playing cards is my passion and this is my 4th Kickstarter campaign; the previous three have been funded and fulfilled, just take a look at Requiem, Heretic and No17. I hope you like No.17 Le Chat Rouge and that you want to support it by backing and sharing. Thank you for being here! :)\nIn every campaign I run, I give gifts to the backers ;) but there are a few rules about those.\nFirst of all, the gifts are not add-ons. Only the copper coin and the uncut tuck-box sheet, and the normal decks can be added on top of your pledge.\nThe gifts are automatically assigned during the shipping process. If the guys at the fulfillment center pack one deck, they will put the gift for one deck. If they pack 2 decks, they will put the gifts for 2 decks, etc etc.\ngifts overview\nHere is how it works:\nIf you have one deck, you get one sticker. \nIf you have 2 or 3 decks, you get one sticker and one button pin. \nIf you have 4 decks, you get one sticker, one button, and one magnet with bottle opener. \nIf you have 6 decks, you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, and one half-brick box for your 6 decks. \nIf you have 12 decks (or brick), you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, 2 half-brick boxes for your decks, and one copper coin. \nIf you are in the 17er reward, you get all.\nAll the court cards (J,Q,K) are illustrated and the 4 aces are big and ornate. The pips (2 to 10) are improved, and the jokers are \"jester-cats\". All the cards have an elegant black border. It is easy to play with, readability is very good, and the cards are made with casino quality paper and finishing.\n The back is full-bleed  with red foiled accents.\nphotoshop rendering\nNote: all the graphics are ready and final. Small tweaks and improvements might be made during or after the campaign.\nFor this deck I decided to make a tuck-box without ink, it will be foiled in black and red, embossed, on black paper. More will be unveiled during the campaign, such as the back side and other details.\nback of the tuck, with cutout in the middle, showing the backs of the cards (stretch goal)\nRed Label Limited Edition Deck\nThis deck is NOT AN ADD-ON. You can get it ONLY IF you are in the limited reward (now sold out), or in the reward called \"The 17er\".\nI will produce approx. 110-120 units, it depends by the count at the end of the campaign. It is an exquisite piece for collectors and playing cards lovers.\nHere the specs:\ncards: same as the normal deck \ntuck-box: same die-cut, but completely black. no foil and no embossing \nLaser-cut \u201csleeve\u201d on red metallic paper, that looks like a label. Actually I\u00b4d call it \u201cjacket\u201d, since it is open on the back (see update #3)\ngolden foil under the front\nsignature \nnumbered \nshipped from the US with tracking number \nawesome Carat case included (transparent acrylic case, lid with magnets) \nshipping included. \none per backer \nassembled in Stockholm\nRed Label Prototype in its Carat Case\nStretch goals and Add-ons will be unlocked and unveiled during the campaign. I will send updates to keep you posted about these question marks.\nIt is important that you take a quick look at the updates, and see what's new, and how the deck will improve.\nADD-ON: Copper Coin for 101 SEK\nThis is a 1.5 inch antique copper coin, with epoxy on both sides with reed edge. \nThe price for the coin is 101 SEK (approx. $11.8)\nIf you want one, just add 101 SEK  to your pledge. If you want 2 coins you add 202 SEK, if three coins 303 SEK, etc etc. The coin does not affect your shipping cost.\nphotoshop rendering\nADD-ON: Uncut Tuck-box Sheet for 203 SEK\nThis is a flat tuck-box without cuts and score lines. There will be the 2 foils and the embossing.\nThe price for this one is 203 SEK (approx. $24.5 USD, \u20ac21.5, \u00a316 GBP) shipping included anywhere in the world. It will look more or less like the picture, here the details:\ndimensions: I estimate 13x29.7cm / 5.1x11.8in, but they might be slightly different. \nshipping cost included shipped from Stockholm \nwith signature \nnumbered \nphotoshop rendering\nWhat is an ADD-ON ?\nThere are items called \"add-on\". It simply means that you can add them to your pledge. The add-on is not a reward tier. All you have to do some simple math, push the blue button called \"Manage\", and modify the total amount. Scroll up and find the button next to the cover image.\nHere a couple of examples to make things clear.\nExample for US backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 130 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 130+203 = 333 SEK\nExample for international backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 170 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 170+203 = 373 SEK\nJust mail me if you need help :)\nCustom Box for 6 decks, included!\nThis box is FOR FREE for backers with 6 decks or multiples of 6. This is a self-assembling sturdy box, with magnets, and it will wrapped in protective plastic (with 6 decks inside of course). On the top lid: custom red-foiled graphics as shown in the pictures (photoshop rendering on the real box).\nSince I am based in Stockholm, the campaign is in Swedish Crowns (Kr SEK). The conversion rate to USD  (Euro and British Pounds) in this list is updated every day of the final days. There are fluctuations all the time, about \u00b11.5%. but you can keep track of them here \ncurrency conversion rate updated on November 7th\nYou can follow me and stay up to date on several social media platforms.

NYC NY1001).\n\nThe estimated delivery date is just that, an estimate. it depends on the factory and their workload. I will send the final files at the conclusion of the campaign, but I cannot speed up the production. There is a possibility of earlier delivery, but it all depends on how quickly EPCC completes the production, once I approve all the printing proofs.\n\nPrinting a deck of playing cards is a standard procedure, but errors may occur, you never know, the devil is in the details. But this is my fourth project and I do not foresee any issues. I'll keep my eyes open and follow every single step of the project to make it real, as I did for Requiem Playing Cards, Heretic Playing Cards, and No.17.\n\nBe aware that the colors on the screen will not perfectly match with the colors on printed paper.

Taking this deck as a starting point, I tried to create my own vision of the Underworld. Although a joyful and positive person myself, I had always been attracted to dark themed artwork. I find fascinating how artists throughout the centuries have imagined the world of the dead and how they dealt with the greatest fear of mankind.

The Original Edition may be reprinted but the tuck case of any future reprints will be basic and less elaborate in production compared to the KS Original Edition\n>>>>>>>> THE REWARDS WILL BE SENT FROM THE USA <<<<<<<<\n\nUPDATE!\nAll KS backers will get their decks hand numbered and signed (upon request) on the tuck case! The decks sold during KS will be the only ones numbered and signed. The rest of the decks will just have the total number produced written on the tuck case.\nRendering of the tuck cases\n The picture above can hardly give an idea of the finished product as it cannot capture the shine of the gold stock combined with the foil or the surprising contrast between the matte and somewhat textured black stock and the shiny foil.\n From a black background emerges a bizarre world of  spooky creatures that dwell in the darkness...\nAnimated edition QoS\nQueen of Diamonds\nJack of Diamonds\nAce of Diamonds - Original Edition\nKing of Hearts- Original Edition\nAce of Heatrs - Original Edition\nAnimated (Limited) edition deck will have the courts and figures framed in a marble-like intricate border.

I've been designing custom Playing Cards since early 2012. During that time I've always work on my Playing Card designs late at night, hence the moniker of Midnight Cards! After going with a quirky and unorthodox theme for my last project, I wanted to ground my next Deck in the essentials of a high-quality Playing Cards design. I'm proud to present the Grinders Deck!\nThe design of the Grinders Deck is meant to embody the workhorse mentality of a professional Grinder, but also contains elements of grandeur and opulence. (CLICK ON ANY PROJECT IMAGE FOR A HIGHER RES VERSION)\nTUCK BOX:\nThe Grinders' Tuck Box will utilize a Black matte stock. NO inks will be printed on the Tuck. The extremely intricate design elements will be stamped in Copper AND Silver Foil. SHINY!!\nThe Grinders Tuck Box, Cards and Custom Brick Box (see below!) will all be printed by Legends Playing Card Co. This will be my third personal design that will be printed by Legends. They do an amazing job!! The Cards will utilize Legends' awesome Classic Finish. Classic Finish is a softer and slicker paper. It's more comparable to a vintage Bicycle Deck.\n         THE JOKERS:\nThe Jokers for the Grinders Deck focus on a well kept Poker player ready to make his move! I drew the character in a similar hard-edge outlines with rough painted interiors, similar to the Court Cards. The Red Joker has a Queen of Hearts reveal. Which is good for any aspiring Magicians!\nBACK CARD:\nThe Back Card shares a lot of the intricate details from the Tuck Box. Some elements in the Back Card design contain subtle references to the games of Poker and Roulette. Roulette is another game that has it's share of professional Grinders. Plus, Roulette is one of my favorites while visiting a Casino! (CLOSEUP DETAILS BELOW)\nFACE CARDS:\nThe Face Cards are designed with the intention for maximum playability. The Courts Set is from a more classical design than most modern Courts. I have modified them and added plenty of elegant details and handpainted elements to make them unique on their own!\nCUSTOM BRICK BOX:\nEvery TWELVE (12) Deck order will come packed inside a custom Grinders Brick Box. It will have a custom Diecut, including a top panel that folds into a display Header with the circular Logo shape Diecut above the other elements (seen below in the Render with the grey background). The Brick Box printing specs will be exactly the same as the Tuck Box - the same thick Black matte stock, Copper Foil AND Silver Foil! The Grinders Brick Box is NOT available by itself or as a separate Add-On item (it's only available with 12 Deck orders).\n2\" DEALER COIN:\nThe Grinders Coin will be produced by Coins For Anything. The 2-Sided Coin will measure 2\" in diameter, and will have an Antique Copper Finish. Black Enamel will highlight the details on each side, and White Enamel will bring out the Grinders Logotype on the Coin Front. I have designed numerous Coins that CFA has produced. Above is a photo of the prototype Coin!! \nTo add any extra items to your base Pledge Reward, just click on the Blue \"Manage Your Pledge\" Button and change the dollar amount to account for the added item(s).

All U.S. Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Texas, by Gamblers Warehouse. All International Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Hong Kong, by Legends Playing Card Co.\n\nARE THEY LIMITED? - Of course! I have never reprinted any of my personal Decks, and never will. I will only print the quantity of Decks and Brick Boxes needed for Pledge Rewards and off-Kickstarter orders, plus a few hundred extras for a future Midnight Cards online storefront.\n\nWHY ONLY ONE DECK? - My last project, Bowl-A-Rama Playing Cards, turned into a pretty complex assortment of merchandise between two separate Kickstarter campaigns (three separate Decks, Wooden Nickel Sets, handmade Bowling Pins and three Uncut Sheets). So, I chose to keep this project VERY streamlined - one Deck, one Brick Box and one Coin. IF the Grinders project is a big hit, there MAY be a second Deck.\n\nNO STRETCH GOALS? - After running many Kickstarter projects, I've noticed that listing Stretch Goals publicly on the project page sometimes leads to Backer peer pressure to Unlock items that didn't make it. More than once I've added a Stretch Goal or two to a campaign (usually a premium printing extra), even if the funding level didn't reach the Stretch Goal amount listed. It has definitely affected the bottom line in those projects! So, for this campaign I will have a Stretch Goals list of my own, but I will not share them online. They comprise of the usual - Interior Printing, Embossing, second Deck...... If / When the project gets close to a Stretch Goal, I will post a Kickstarter Update to announce that specific Stretch Goal's details.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Randy Butterfield (Midnight Cards)\n14 created \u00b7 232 backed\nI'm a Graphic Artist located in Indianapolis, IN with my wife, Susan and kids Violet and Aaron.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Under 48 HOURS remaining for OCULUS Deck", "update_content": "Hey Everyone,\nJust a quick heads-up to let you all know that the OCULUS project is down to it's last 48 hours.
