The nefarious meerkats have agreed to help them in exchange for food. You must pilfer the unwanted food from the other animals without arousing the suspicion of the zookeeper. If they become too suspicious your escape attempt is doomed for failure. \nPilfering Pandas is a modern reinvention of a classic set collection card game that requires carefully timed & targeted actions. The key to winning is knowing when to sneak and pilfer more unwanted food from the Hideout (a spread of cards visible to all players) and when to stay put. Getting this wrong can be costly or even disastrous.\nPilfering Pandas has 3 game modes:\n Competitive: Players each attempt to make their escape, individually trying not to attract too much attention while hindering the escape attempts of their fellow pandas.\n Cooperative: All players work together to escape, always trying to stay one step ahead of the Zookeeper.\n Solo: Working on your own, your job is to get the help you need from the Meerkats and make your escape before the Zookeeper notices.\nAlthough the gameplay in Pilfering Pandas is easy to understand the strategy is harder to master. This means Pilfering Pandas is suited to both adults who like quick games but with lots of decision making as well as families (cooperative recommended for under 12s).\nWren Games is the wife and husband team Janice & Stu. As parents of 2 young children,we understand how hectic life can get, so we wanted to create a game that is accessible for busy people. Pilfering Pandas is our third game which aims to provide:\n Short playtimes. \n Depth of decisions. \n Intuitive gameplay. \nWe have multiple options for you to try before you buy including our very own solo implementation in the form of a digital app that's free to play throughout this Kickstarter. Get an overview of the rules here and then keep scrolling down to find out more about our app.\nWe also have these 4 gorgeous hard enamel pin badges (approx 1.5 in) up for grabs featuring the fabulous game art. We couldn't resist! \nIf you prefer watching to reading, here's a good video summary of Pilfering Pandas so you can learn all about this addictive little game. \n\nPilfering Pandas is a reinvention of a classic card game Janice played with her nan growing up (she knows it as Benny - tell us in the comments if you've heard of it!). \nAt its core, Pilfering Pandas is a set collection game, but it's not your typical set collection game. We've added lots of twists added to bring about a brisk game with depth to decisions. \nTo achieve this depth, we've made a ton of changes, not least creating cooperative and solo modes. Pilfering Pandas plays similarly in all 3 game modes but with some key  differences making each game mode a different experience. \nA typical turn on the surface looks deceptively simple, making Pilfering Pandas quick and easy to teach to others. However the strategy is harder to master. A turn will look something like this: \nPick up 1 or more cards.\nPlay sets to the table and/or pass.\nAdvance marker(s).\nDiscard a card.\nSets of 3 or more cards can be played in any of the following ways:\nSo at this point you might be thinking, isn't this just Rummy? And the answer is no, it's a lot more than Rummy. Here are a few of the key differences:\nSets are played to the table (Meerkats) and not kept in hand.\nThere's no hand limit or action limit.\nYou can pick-up more than 1 card from the discard pile (Hideout).\nTo play a new set, you must match the suit or number of the last card in the previous set played.\nYou can chain sets, doubling points if you reuse a card in an already played set.\nEach player has a special power or challenge based on their pandas character.\nA wild card in a set can be taken back (or stolen) or discarded to slow down the zookeeper.\nIn cooperative and solo games, the zookeeper is constantly chasing you.\n The Hideout \nPerhaps the most interesting mechanism in Pilfering Pandas is the Hideout. The Hideout is where you 'discard' a card at the end of your turn, but unlike traditional discard piles, the Hideout is not a pile, it's a spread of cards visible to all players. For a fee, you can pick up as many cards as you want from it,  making huge plays of sets in a single turn possible (there's only a hand limit in solo games). \nThe Hideout acts like a communal hand in cooperative games (like an extension of your hand in solo games) where you all work together to build sets ready for one lucky person to pick up. However, the strategy is reversed  in competitive gameplay. Not only are you looking for cards in there that you might want, but you are also actively trying to prevent any sets being created that one of the other players could grab before you do. This means you should think carefully before discarding that card your opponent might be looking for! \nCompetitive Gameplay \nIn competitive gameplay, players attempt to make their own escape, trying not to attract too much attention from the zookeeper and making sure no other pandas escape. There can be only one panda on the loose.\nCooperative Gameplay\nIn cooperative gameplay, all players work together to escape, always trying to stay one step ahead of the zookeeper who automatically advances 1 space every turn. What you do on your turn directly affects how much closer you are to escaping, as well as how much closer the zookeeper gets to catching you.\nSolo Gameplay\nIn solo gameplay, you are working on your own to ensure the escape of the pandas from the zoo. Your job is to get the help you need from the Meerkats and make your escape before the Zookeeper notices.  \nTry Pilfering Pandas for yourself in any of the following ways:\nDownload the DRAFT Rules [Note: Coop/Solo rules still being updated from rules editor]\nTry the PnP \nDownload our free app: Android | iOS \nPlay on Tabletop Simulator \nPlay on Tabletopia \nJoin an online demo: keep an eye on our Facebook Group and in the updates to learn how to join.\nDigital App\nThe digital app is free to download and play through-out the Kickstarter.

We are planning to have a fulfilment centre both in Germany (close to where we manufacture) and in the UK. \nBoth UK and EU VAT will be taken care of and will not be charged additionally. Countries outside of UK / EU have the tax used to subsidise shipping costs. We are also customs friendly in the following locations.\nGiven the ever changing shipping costs due to Brexit and Covid these  estimates only are based on current shipping prices and final shipping partner. Our exact shipping partners will depend on the final number of backers and shipping costs at the time of dispatch. \nThe estimated shipping prices are:\nPlease note we cannot ship to the following locations: Afghanistan, Brazil, Cuba, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Kazakhstan, Burma (Myanmar), North Korea, Russia, Syria, Ukraine and Yemen.\nWhy are the ranges so large for shipping costs?\nShipping is the trickiest thing to estimate during a Kickstarter, especially now. We've done our very best to give you the most transparent view based on the quotes we have but we can't predict the future. This is why the ranges in some cases are quite large. The differences between suppliers are large and we cannot guarantee that the cheapest supplier will hold that price until we fulfil. \nWe will use the most cost effective shipping method when the time comes, but with COVID surcharges,  we just don't know what the cost will be in 6-9 months time. Therefore the above are rough estimates of shipping costs, but we're confident we won't go above the upper limits and when we come to contracting a fulfilment centre, we will be targeting the lower end of the range.\n\nConnect With Us\nNewsletter\nFacebook Group\nTwitter\nInstagram\nFacebook Page", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the first time we are splitting fulfilment between the UK and EU to ensure both UK and EU friendly delivery. This means that we are likely to be working with a partner that we haven't worked with before which always brings risks. However, we will only work with a partner that we know has positive recommendations and who we trust.\n\nCOVID and BREXIT also bring risks as both are affecting the world and in particular logistics in a continuing and unpredictable way. We have estimated shipping to the best of our ability, and have included best and worst case estimates to ensure you know the full picture. We'll keep you informed through of what's happening and any decision we make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nWhere possible we use 'local' suppliers. We are manufacturing the playmats in the UK and the game in Germany. We have also chosen a fulfilment centre in Germany to minimise the travel the games need to do.

Since lockdown we have been looking at ways to bring the experience to your home at an affordable price, solving clues to get through a door without being locked in a room, truly...thinking outside the box.\n\n\"I bought this calendar for an early teen and they loved it. The puzzles were excellent. We are definitely buying again for next year!! \"     - Customer review\n\nEach A3 sized calendar has a unique design that will engage your mind with an array of Christmas related puzzles.  Some will be quick to solve, some have to be unscrambled and some may need to be decoded with the help of the back of the advent calendar. \n\n\n\nWHO ARE WE?\nWe are Escape Room designers who have been creating Escape Room experiences in Peterborough UK.

It means that more puzzles can be made, it opens up the area inside the advent window to be an extra playable area. The detached door can now be used elsewhere on the calendar, cut up or folded to find the solution.\n\n\"The mix of puzzles was great.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Our intrepid author Paige Turner is back!  In Paperback Adventures, you get to play as the protagonist in one of Paige's wild brainstorming sessions. Conquer a menagerie of pulp novel characters in this solo deckbuilding word game.\nJust like in the original game Paperback\u2014and its follow up, Hardback\u2014you will build your own deck of cards throughout the game, and those cards will have letters to help you spell words every turn. But in Paperback Adventures, instead of testing your wordsmithing wit against other players, you will use your words to defeat a series of AI enemies in \"roguelike\" fashion.\nPaperback Adventures is a solo-focused game. It was designed from the ground up as a strategic, highly-replayable solo word game. There are also additional gameplay variants for cooperative play between two players.\nHere are the stretch goals we've unlocked!\nCommunity Stretch Goals\nPart of what makes Kickstarter great is the opportunity to hear what matters most to backers. Here are some of the additions and changes we\u2019ve made thanks to our backers\u2019 feedback.\nAs the game developed and grew, we wanted every character to have their own cards and unique styles of play, but with the Fowers Games history of small box games we also wanted to keep an affordable price point for the game. So we decided on a modular system that lets you play the game whether you buy one character or several.\nHere's what the Paperback Adventures core box contains:\nRulebook\nEnemy Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\n12 Enemy Cards\n12 Reward Cards\n7 Penalty Cards\n7 Enemy Vowel and \"?\" Cards\n26 Item Cards\n26 McGuffin Cards\n7 Penalty Card Sleeves\nAs long as you have at least one character box, the core box contains everything else you need to play the game. The core box also has space to store the bonus content from each of your character boxes (note: not all content from those boxes), allowing you to set up a new game more quickly.\nSo what comes in a character box? Each protagonist in Paperback Adventures plays distinctly, with different core items, starting items, and a unique 10-card starting deck. Additionally, every protagonist has their own growth deck of 50 cards that offers different paths and playstyles every game session.\nBut a character box doesn't only provide new content when you choose that character. Inside each character box you'll also find a few new enemies and a few new bonus items and McGuffins that go into your core box and add additional content no matter which character you pick for a given game.\nEach character box has bonus enemies, items, and double-sided McGuffins (like this one!)\nThe more character boxes you add, the more variety and wacky combinations you get. \nHere's what comes in each character box:\nCharacter Tray with Tokens (designed by Game Trayz\u2122)\nCharacter Card\n6 Enemy Cards\n6 Reward Cards\n60 Letter Cards\n6 Core Item Cards\n4 Bonus Item Cards\n4 Bonus McGuffin Cards\n60 Letter Card Sleeves\nThe protagonists are not only unique from a gameplay standpoint, they also come from wildly different genres and have their own graphical style and artistic design. Here are the playable characters in Paperback Adventures:\nOur final character is a Pirate\u2014he is currently awaiting a proper name to be voted on by the backers!\nWord-heavy playstyle\nBarrage cards get bonuses for longer words\nCan drain the enemy's life!\nCan copy the effect of an item\u2014effectively using it twice\nCrew cards come back from the fatigue pile\nTry out the Tabletop Simulator demo on Steam!\nIn a single game of Paperback Adventures, your protagonist will face off against nine randomized enemies of escalating difficulty.  To make matters worse, your health total persists from enemy to enemy. Luckily for you, each enemy also offers randomized rewards to help you power up quickly to meet the challenge. \nYou'll need to beat each enemy one by one by spelling words with the cards in your hand. Each card has symbols that either damage the enemy, block the enemy's incoming damage to you, or provide you with mana so you can use your items. You'll also be able to activate the unique ability of one of your cards.\nThe game is divided in a trilogy structure, where you'll battle two normal enemies and a boss for each \"book\" in the trilogy. You can stop a game session after completing one book (~45 min) or even after any enemy through a \"save game\" feature that will keep your current deck, items, and rewards separate in the game's box. To beat the game, you'll need to defeat all nine enemies in the trilogy.\nOne goal from the outset of this game's design was to find ways to streamline the typical deckbuilding roguelike experience found in digital games for tabletop play. Two essential systems deliver the gameplay variation and combos needed for the genre while keeping player upkeep at a minimum: the splay system and the hex and boon counter system.\nYour word is ready\u2014which way will you splay?\n When you spell words each turn in Paperback Adventures, you'll need to also choose which way to splay your word, so that only one edge of each card is showing except for the top card. The only card ability visible will be on the top card, and that's the ability you activate. Here's an example of how it works:\nWhen you splay left, you count all the icons on the left edge of each card. The top card is the last letter of the word.\nWhen you splay right you count all the icons on the right edge of each card. The top card is the first letter of the word.\nThe splay system forces you to make tough choices\u2014do you want more blocks or more hits this turn? Or maybe which card is your top card matters most. To make that decision even tougher (and to keep every battle moving), the top card also gets fatigued for the rest of the battle. You'll get it back for the next enemy, though!\nHex and boon counters allow protagonists and enemies to support a wide range of playstyles without adding too many rules and overhead for players to track. Hex counters affect the character they are on negatively, while boon counters affect the character they are on positively. So these counters are always contextual--one enemy's hex counters might cause accelerating damage, while another enemy's hex counters limit your card draw.\nHere is a link to the current working rulebook for Paperback Adventures\nWe know that some players will want a tougher challenge, especially after completing a few runs. So we\u2019ll be including a system called Plot Twists.\nEvery Plot Twist comes with two distinct challenges, one on top and one on bottom, for the entirety of your run. Here is one condition card unlocked earlier in the campaign:\nEach challenge has a difficulty number assigned to it, with \u201c1\u201d being the lowest difficulty. Before starting a run, you can choose an overall challenge level for your run and then mix and match challenges from the various Plot Twists until the collective difficulty numbers add up to your desired challenge level. This way, you can experience brand new challenge combinations while also making the game better fit your experience and skill level.\nYou can splay the Plot Twists underneath your player tray, showing only the new rules from your chosen challenges so that you can quickly reference them. Those rules will stay the same throughout your run.\nWhile Paperback Adventures was designed from the start as a solo experience, we also knew that people would enjoy playing it with others. We\u2019ve been playtesting and working behind the scenes to bring some two player variants to the table that not only open up a seat for an additional player but also open up new ways to approach the game.\nTwo-Headed Giant\nThis cooperative mode really leans into the idea of co-op play. The two players must work in tandem using the same character, deck, and token tracker. But here\u2019s the kicker: you split your starting items and McGuffins between the two of you. Additionally, you alternate taking turns, which means your items and McGuffins are only available half the time. Anytime you gain an item or McGuffin, you both gain one!\nA lot of the fun in this variant comes from working together to find the best words and setting each other up for big turns. Don\u2019t just take our word for it though; check out this gameplay video where we show off the mode over a couple different enemy fights.\nDouble Trouble\nIn the Double Trouble mode, each player has their own character to play! They team up against a pair of enemies, but they must coordinate their attacks and share certain resources\u2014like the wild card!  (To make this possible, one enemy uses the tray from the unused character.)\n Paperback Playthrough with Aaron of GameEnthus and designer Skye Larsen\nPlaythrough from a Live Stream with Ruel Gaviola on Tabletop Tonight\nBook 2 Gameplay from a Live Stream with Richmond of BramBeard Gaming\nJason Perez with One Stop Co-op Shop\nYou won't get too far in a roguelike without sweet loot. Reward cards for each enemy will give you two options to choose from. You have to choose which set of loot is more important to keep progressing.\nItems provide powerful effects that can be used once per turn, but you'll need mana to activate most of them.  \nExamples of a McGuffin and item with completed art\nMcGuffins are always double-sided, and you'll get to choose which McGuffin will help you more. These powerups provide modest effects, but don't require mana for use. Find the right ones for some spectacular combos!\nEvery character letter card is also upgradeable. When a reward says you upgrade a card, flip the card over and put it back in its sleeve. Some card upgrades add extra icons to the card, while others improve or even alter the card ability.\n\n Shipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager after the campaign.  We ship customs friendly.\n Tim Fowers, co-designer, has piloted many successful games including Burgle Bros, Fugitive, and Paperback \n Skye Larsen, co-designer, has finally justified his Creative Writing degree (sort of)\n Jeff Krause, development, worked with Tim on Sabotage and Burgle Bros 2 \n Ryan Goldsberry, illustrator, helps bring all of Tim's games to life\n Noah Adelman, product design, has designed components and storage solutions for many successful games through his company Game Trayz\u2122\n We'd also like to thank Andrew Colin Beck for our logo design, Nate Stebbing for the animation work in our Kickstarter video, and Fernando Cunha for our gameplay animations on this page.\nWe will use a pledge manager to help our backers get their copy of Paperback Adventures as quickly as possible.

Wasted Wilds has unlocked all 22 stretch goals, including 4 new apocalypses (Plantpocalypse, Smart Apes, Underground, Fascist Soldiers), component upgrades, a huge supplemental mission book, legacy campaign content and an additional survivor in the Beekeeper. \nMaximum Apocalypse: Wasted Wilds is the much anticipated continuation of the hit cooperative roguelike game series. It features the same compelling survival gameplay but adds two distinct campaigns with a lot of new twists around exposure to the elements and interactions with other survivors. \nWasted Wilds can be played as a stand-alone 1-4 player campaign, or combined with the contents of any other Maximum Apocalypse game or expansion to support up to 6 players.  Survivors from Maximum Apocalypse, Kaiju Rising, Gothic Horrors and Jurassic Perils are all fully playable in this game. Plus any of the new survivors from Wasted Wilds can be played in the other Maximum Apocalypse games as well!\nIf you're unfamiliar with Maximum Apocalypse, it is a cooperative roguelike game filled with adventure, exploration, survival and strategic choices. It was built from the ground up to be very modular and infinitely replayable.  Maximum Apocalypse has inspired a Role Playing Game and spawned numerous expansions featuring everything from Bugs, C'thulhu and Kaiju. There is a vast wasteland out there to explore and Wasted Wilds has been designed as the perfect starting point! The Frozen Wilds campaign walks players through a mission by mission tutorial that will ease new players into the experience.\nThis graphic does not include additional Stretch Goal Content (see below)\nWe always like to offer more to our Kickstarter backers. We're going to try something new for this campaign and will be giving everyone the opportunity to vote and influence the path we take on this crowdfunding adventure together.  Over the course of the campaign, the community will not only direct which stretch goals come next, but also unlock and design some of that content together. Be sure to check the campaign daily!\nWasted Wilds features a brand new set of survivors with all new skills and mechanics, along with new apocalypses, enemies and two distinct campaigns.  Here is a quick rundown of what's new in Wasted Wilds:\n The Driver is an impulsive ex-stuntwoman who relies on her adrenaline to get her through tough situations.  She comes with her own custom car that can mow down enemies and can even move the Van tile for easier escapes.\n The Chef is a support class who uses his knowledge of the kitchen to aid his fellow survivors.  He focuses on staving off hunger and is deadly with his many knives.\n The Contractor is a strong warrior with a big appetite.  His innate ability allows him to build barricades which prevent future monster spawns.\n The Thief is a stealthy rogue who evades danger and strikes from the shadows.  She grows in strength as she makes her way through her 50 card survivor deck, setting up crucial assassinations.\n\nThe Frozen Wilds & Scorched Wasteland\nWasted Wilds focuses on the environmental impact of apocalyptic events such as Nuclear Winter and Global Warming.  There are two distinct campaigns: The Frozen Wilds and Scorched Wasteland, that task players with surviving many different types of apocalypses, monsters and events as you progress through each campaign.  Our Mission Book and Learn to Play guide makes learning the game and its new mechanics easy for new and old players alike.  Each mission explains setup, shows example map layouts, lists each objective and how to escape with your life:\nOur Learn to Play Guide simplifies the rule set and eases players into the experience. As you progress through the Frozen Wilds campaign, you will slowly be introduced to new game mechanics and threats such as exposure to elements, parlaying with other tribes of human survivors, monster tokens moving during the day and night effects.\n\nTime is Against You!\nWasted Wilds organizes its new mechanics into a Clock board.  Time is always ticking along in Wasted Wilds. Every turn advances the clock, but rolling a '7' increases the passage of time and might trigger Exposure or another effect!\nExposure: Survivors will be facing extreme conditions and will need to stay inside to avoid exposure to the elements.  Survivors that are exposed (located on outdoor tiles) will draw negative status effects from the Exposure deck. It might start off as frostnip, but can grow into pneumonia or worse.  The Exposure deck allows us to introduce apocalyptic dangers outside of the traditional monster deck.\nDon't get stuck outdoors when Exposure strikes\nDay/Night: Day and Night effects were introduced in the Gothic Horrors expansion. During the day, monster tokens move around the map.   When Night falls, events trigger that will help or hinder your progress.\nParlay with NPCs to get them on your side\nTribes: The biggest enemy that you will face in Wasted Wilds is humanity itself.  Groups of survivors have created their own tribes.  These enemies are more complex than your standard apocalyptic monsters, you can parlay with them and trade items to turn their opposition into an alliance.\n\nStreamlined Setup\nEverything in Wasted Wilds aims to get players into the game quicker. All of the hard-to-organize map tiles have been streamlined into a \"scorched\" and \"frozen\" set that you can easily keep separate and store between missions using our storage system. There's no need to search through all the map tiles to get the right set for a mission any longer.\nThis is also true for the Scavenge Decks.  The Red, Green and Blue scavenge decks are the same for every mission in Wasted Wilds.  We've made sure that every scavenge card features a colored icon indicating which deck it belongs to so that you can easily sort them. Each Scavenge deck can then be stored in the correct storage tray between play sessions for faster setup.\nThe Time Traveler Expansion, designed by Todd Walsh (Set a Watch) and inspired by his love of Sci-Fi, features a quirky survivor who is great at avoiding combat. Whenever the Traveler is used, you also introduce their Time Pod tile, which you can use to teleport around the map.  Of course when you rip through space time there are bound to be consequences. You will have to watch out for time anomalies as well...\nStep inside the mind of Gustav Rangmar, the artist behind Maximum Apocalypse, for the creation of its memorable characters, imaginative creatures and post-apocalyptic world. The Art of the Apocalypse is an amazing collection for fans of the series. It gives you a glimpse into the creative process, Gustav's favorite pieces, and all of the work that goes into crafting a game world like this one throughout its 120+ pages.  \nThe Redhead first appeared as a promotional Gunslinger in the very first Maximum Apocalypse campaign. Now, she's finally getting a proper expansion focused on the lore of the indie comic of the same name. The Few and Cursed Expansion features the Redhead's \"Curse Chaser\" deck from the Few and Cursed board game along with new monster decks and tiles that focus on a new 'Cursed' status effect. Special Thanks to Felipe Cagno and Fabiano Neves on trusting us with their IP and making this idea happen!\nThe Allies of the Rapture expansion compiles all of the extra Kickstarter Exclusive content from our previous campaigns. This includes the solo focused Allies expansion, the Rapture apocalypse, murder clowns and gremlin monsters. If you missed out on the KS version of Gothic Horrors, this expansion is for you! This content is already included in the Legendary Edition.\nLast but not least we will have new Wasted Wilds play mats available for bundling in the pledge manager:\nWe will be offering other Maximum Apocalypse products like the Legendary edition, Gothic Horrors Kickstarter edition, RPG books etc. in the pledge manager, but their quantity will be limited based on existing stock in each region. You can also visit shop.rockmanorgames.com and get in stock games shipped ASAP and have them before the end of this campaign!\nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will help support this Kickstarter and be invited to order Kickstarter exclusive content for their stores. All retailers will be able to order at 50% OFF MSRP.  No Minimum Orders. Orders of 6+ will get free shipping (in most countries).

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your rewards (customs, duties, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions.

You have humans. The humans have problems. Use your magical powers to solve their problems and save the day!\n\u2b50 A roleplaying game designed for all ages to enjoy, that excels as an introduction to the hobby.\n\u2b50 The elegantly simple rules system puts the emphasis on storytelling and supports a setting and characters that players are familiar with and love from the start.\nEvery Magical Kitty has a human. Every human has a Problem. In Magical Kitties Save the Day, you need to use your magical powers to solve problems and save the day. But kitties live in Hometowns that are filled with witches, aliens, hyper-intelligent raccoons, and other foes. They make human problems worse, so the kitties need to go on adventures to stop them before that can happen.\nThe Deluxe Edition of Magical Kitties Save the Day SOLD OUT just a few months after its original Kickstarter. Now we\u2019re bringing it back as a special release not available via distribution. It\u2019s packed full of high-quality component upgrades like wooden tokens and custom dice, and a bunch of bonus content including the Magical Power, Talent, and Flaw cards, and two extra Hometowns with maps.\nBut don\u2019t worry if you\u2019re missing a few Magical Kitties books for the Standard Edition you already bought. We\u2019ve made them all available as add-ons for this campaign so you can easily complete your collection!\nIf you\u2019ve been looking for a way to introduce your friends and family to roleplaying games, Magical Kitties is the perfect game to do it!\nWhen you open the box, sitting right on top is Magical Kitties & The Big Adventure, a solo-play graphic novel adventure. This action-packed comic book is also a full scenario! Within moments, you\u2019ll be able to create your magical kitty and go on an amazing adventure that will also teach you how to play the game.\nAfter that, older players can be the game master for kids as young as six years old (and everyone else who loves kitties). And it's an excellent game for kids to start running on their own. Even if you\u2019ve never played a roleplaying game, Magical Kitties includes the tools and guidance for both first-time roleplayers and first-time GMs.\nWhether you\u2019ve played board games with roleplaying elements, watched actual play videos, or just think roleplaying games sound like a lot of fun and you want to give them a try, Magical Kitties can be your first step into a larger world of fun.\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, one player \u2014 known as the game master (GM) \u2014 has a very special role. They describe the world in which the magical kitties live to the other players and, when the kitties take action, they use the rules of the game to figure out what happens next.\nPlaying Magical Kitties is easy. You have 3 Attributes \u2013 Cute, Cunning, and Fierce. You also have a Talent, a Flaw, and a Magical Power. When your kitty is trying to do something difficult, you\u2019ll build a pool of six-sided dice with:\n\u2b50 A number of dice equal to the attribute you\u2019re using (Cute, Cunning, or Fierce)\n\u2b50 An extra die if you\u2019re using your Talent\n\u2b50 Two extra dice if you\u2019re using your Power\nThe game master sets a difficulty (a number from 3 to 6) and then you roll your dice pool. Each die that rolls equal to or higher than the difficulty is a success. The number of successes you rolled determines the outcome:\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, it\u2019s not just a question of whether or not you succeed: It\u2019s about how you succeed. The complications and bonuses generated by most outcomes drive the action forward in unexpected and exciting ways. You and your friends will discover the story together!\n\nOTHER FUN GAMEPLAY ELEMENTS:\n\u2b50 Character generation takes just 5 minutes.\n\u2b50 The dice are always in the players' hands, not the GM's.\n\u2b50 Players get Kitty Treats that let them change the story. You earn Kitty Treats by roleplaying your Flaw.\n\u2b50 No one ever dies in Magical Kitties. If you take too many Owies, you get knocked out or otherwise \u201cincapacitated\u201d for the scene.\n\u2b50 You get XP every time you fail a roll. And for saving the day, of course!\n\nPOWER UP! SOURCEBOOK AT A GLANCE:\n\u2b50 36 all-new powers for your magical kitties!\n\u2b50 Epic foes, epic powers, and epic stunts for taking your game to the next level!\n\u2b50 Guidelines for designing your own powers, bonus features, and more.\nOriginal Magical Kitties creator Matthew J.

We work to minimize such charges, but every country and courier has its own regulations, rates, practices, and policies.\nWe ship your rewards ourselves. Rewards will ship from the Atlas Games warehouse in Duluth, Minnesota, USA. Based on our experience, this is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global fulfillment warehouses. In part due to our direct control of this facility, our shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\nRetailers get their usual terms. Retail tier backers pay shipping later, if at all, using Atlas Games\u2019 standard direct-to-retail sales terms for shipping.

We will send games to our partner warehouses in these regions in order to keep the shipping costs as low as possible for you. This also means that we will cover the cost of import duties and custom fees to these regions ourselves, so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nVAT\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount according to the VAT rates of each respective country.  VAT will be charged in the pledge manager.\nIt is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, UK, Canada, China and Australia so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions will probably incur import duties.\nMighty Boards aims to create immersive board game experiences with gorgeous game design, intense challenges and evocative stories. We believe that a game depends on its rules, stories and the visuals and pieces that express them. While our games span a variety of thematic and mechanical genres, they have one thing in common, which we like to think of as something of a mission statement: the tight coupling of rich,  evocative theme and meaty, engaging mechanics.\nOur talented team, based in Malta, places great importance on these innovative mechanics that stimulate the imagination. Every product goes through rigorous development and a solid testing process to make sure we deliver only top-quality products. At Mighty Boards, we go all in to bring you a great gaming experience.\n\nTerms and Conditions\nWhen you pledge for our games you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions:\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVITY:  Kickstarter Exclusive items like the Overkill Promo Pack will not enter regular distribution. However, they will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Mighty Boards on our website.\nREFUND POLICY Mighty Boards follows the standard Kickstarter terms for refund. This means that we will provide a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Mighty Boards and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Mighty Boards.\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge.\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. We will replace any missing or damaged items. In the case of minor cosmetic damage to external boxes replacement will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We use CrowdOx as a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several emails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to send you your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT We will keep testing and developing the game until it\u2019s as close to perfect as possible. Due to this and potential improvements suggested by the factory the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Mighty Boards will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. Mighty Boards will also inform backers of the major changes and reasons for such changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVengeance: Roll and Fight has already been developed and tested extensively both by our internal developers, as well as externally through playtesters, early reviewers and dedicated friends, family and fans. Both episodes of the base game are close to completion and ready to head to manufacturing. Stretch goals remain to be tested and developed, according to the goals met. However, we are certain that we will be able to meet the design, development and production deadlines we have communicated on the project timeline displayed above.\n\nWe have already identified potential manufacturers, all of whom have been trusted partners on previous projects.

We won't lie; our missions are no walk in the park.\nRead on to see if you've got what it takes.\n Receive a package to your door! Our packages are delivered direct to you, filled with incredible puzzles and a deep, immersive world.\n Team up or play alone! You can play by yourself, with your partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues. Each of the packages should last between 90 and 120 minutes.\n Interact with the world! Contact the characters by email or Whatsapp, hack into their online banking, or research website content to help solve the puzzles.\n Become immersed in the story! Put yourself into the shoes of the detective to solve The Cursed Exhibition.\n Continue your journey! Each package follows on from the previous one, presenting you with new challenges and exciting plot twists.\nPhysical Items\nAt the heart of each episode is the package that will be delivered through your door. Inside you will find a range of different items, which you will need to solve the case. \nInteractive Technology\nTo create a truly modern detective experience, all members of the Society will need to examine digital sources as well as the physical ones in the package.\nOur bespoke communication systems allow players to converse with characters via email and SMS/Whatsapp.\nOur detailed and immersive websites create complex online worlds for detectives to explore as they search for answers.\nExhaustive Clue System\nEven the best detectives can require a little help. That's why we've created an innovative and exhaustive clue system to enable detectives to get a little assistance should they require it.\nOur master detective Lucid Montgomery takes a look over every case that comes through our door and is kind enough to write down a few prompts for each part of each episode in case a detective is in need of assistance.\nWelcoming Community\nWe have already collected together an incredible bunch of detectives on our dedicated Facebook and Reddit groups.\nThese amazing detectives discuss and share their findings, assisting each other when they get stuck and pointing out hidden tidbits that some might have missed (while flagging spoilers, of course).\nWe know some detectives like to work alone, but for those that don't, you will find the community a welcoming place for you to discuss the cases.\nWe won \"Best Mystery Game\" in the 2020 Bullseye Awards\nWe need your help Detectives!\nWe have to find out more about what is happening at the museum.\nIt's a matter of life and death.\n------------------------------\nWe're delighted to bring all of our backers three exclusive puzzles over the course of the Kickstarter campaign.\nThese mini-puzzles will reveal more about the mission ahead and reveal a horrifying secret about the museum and the dangers that lie in wait.\nTo take part, make sure you've pledged and are keeping an eye on our Kickstarter updates. \nAll three parts are now live.\nWe hope you enjoy.\nWe are very excited to be able to offer you the chance to add-on our existing adventures to your pledge, and get them at a discounted price.\nThe Disappearance of Claire Makova - when the daughter of a high-profile diplomat goes missing, you are hired to track her down before its too late.\nThe Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee - a young man falls into an inexplicable coma, can you unravel the mysterious secrets behind his illness?\nThe add-ons will be shipped in July 2021, alongside Episode One of The Cursed Exhibition.\nSo what made us decide to launch The Cursed Exhibition on Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is a hugely helpful way for us to plan for the costs of producing our games and the complex logistics involved in putting them together.\nBy pre-selling on Kickstarter, we know how ambitious we can be with our plans for The Cursed Exhibition. The huge support we received for The Disappearance of Claire Makova and The Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee meant we could do so much more than we originally planned.\nEvery copy that's purchased on Kickstarter contributes to extra design features, video work, voiceovers, interactive elements, digital content and physical box contents. Simply put, the more you support us the more we'll be able to do.\nWe're a small company, but we have big ideas and your support makes them a reality.\nWe are pleased to say that we ship worldwide! You can view the shipping costs in the table below:\nWe do not charge the full shipping fee to our customers. We absorb some of the cost ourselves.\nTaxes and Duties\nUK\nAll of our games are manufactured and shipped from the UK and so we are able to guarantee tax-free delivery.\nEuropean Union\nFollowing Brexit, we are continuing to work hard to find a reliable, monthly, duty-free method of delivery to our EU customers. We are hopeful that we will have this fully in place by the time we start shipping The Cursed Exhibition. \nHowever, if we are unable to do this then we will again give all backers the option to receive all six games in one package, delivered duty-free, which will be shipped after the final episode of the season has been released. \nUSA, Canada & The Rest of the World\nWe take all precautions to ensure that customers outside of the UK and EU pay no customs or import fees - including attaching CN22 forms - although we cannot guarantee your parcel will not be held at customs or have additional fees applied. \nIf you have had board games sent to you in the past from the UK without issues, then there is a good chance the same will happen with The Detective Society's games.\nThe Cursed Exhibition is made up of six episodes and if you buy the whole season you will receive one per month. We'll ship each of the episodes to all players simultaneously. This will help avoid any spoilers, whilst also giving all players the chance, if they wish, to experience each episode at the same time as every other player, making it an exciting 'live' event.\nDo you need to have played previous The Detective Society games to play The Cursed Exhibition?\nAbsolutely not! This is a brand new, six-episode standalone adventure that requires no previous knowledge of our old cases.\nHow do the pledge levels work?\nIf you pledge for \u201cFirst Package\u201d then you will receive your package shipped at the same time as everybody else, at the end of July 2021. You can then choose to buy the rest of the season, either via a subscription or by buying the packages individually when they are released.\nIf you pledge for \u201cAll Six Packages\u201d then you are purchasing the whole adventure; you will receive one episode every month. The story will run alongside your life for the entire six months!\nAny add-ons you purchase will be shipped at the same time as the first episode of The Cursed Exhibition.\nWho can play the game?\nThe game can be played solo, with a partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues and is recommended for players aged over 14 years, due to the peril the characters find themselves faced with.\nWhen will we deliver?\nEpisode One will be produced and shipped in late July 2021, with the subsequent five episodes being shipped monthly from then on.\nIt's always been important to us that we deliver what we promise on schedule, and we have achieved that with our two previous Kickstarters.\nAll our processes and supply chains have been established from the production of The Disappearance of Claire Makova and The Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee and that will continue seamlessly as we move into the production of The Cursed Exhibition.\nWhat if I already have a subscription to the Society?\nFirstly; thank you for supporting us! If you already have a subscription with The Detective Society, you do not need to pledge on Kickstarter to receive The Cursed Exhibition. It will automatically be delivered to you as part of your monthly schedule.\nThe Cursed Exhibition is being designed by the same people that brought you the previous Detective Society games - Joe Mills and Tristan Rogers - while Dan Wiseman is in charge of the business operations.\nBefore creating The Detective Society, Joe was instrumental in the success of some of the best escape games that London has to offer. His journey began with Time Run, ('fifth best escape room company in the world' in 2018); before moving onto Sherlock: The Game Is Now - the official BBC TV series tie-in. He also created and launched one of Design My Night's top picks for a night out in London: the immersive puzzle-based cocktail experience, The Case of the Poisoned Chalice. Joe takes the lead when it comes to creating all the puzzles.\nTristan is a game designer, actor and award-winning writer. He's worked in some of London's top theatres and has written on numerous programmes for BBC Radio. He\u2019s worked with Joe designing puzzles at various escape games, most recently penning the plot for The Case of The Poisoned Chalice. Tristan is in charge of overseeing the narrative of the cases.\nDan is our managing director and brings his vast business and marketing experience to the team. For over 10 years he has been building and operating successful businesses, including a digital marketing agency. He is connected to the The Detective Society through a mutual love of all things gaming-related, evidenced by his constant stream of RPG game ideas. Dan made his first RPG when he was just 13 years old. Dan ensures that we deliver on our promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are of course various risks and challenges involved - problems with design, procurement and shipping can all occur. However, our extensive work creating our previous two seasons means we have lots of experience to draw on. We have established good relationships with our key suppliers, and we are now very well versed in the processes required to release one episode a month. Our budgets are thorough, and we have built in significant contingency to deal with those issues we cannot foresee.\n\nOf course there is one major factor which is outside of our control. Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, and its existence has underpinned the lifespan of our young company. As we have existed with it for so long, we are confident we can deal with what the current situation throws at us. We are in regular contact with our suppliers, all of whom continue to operate as normal. Initially it impacted on the delivery timescales of our suppliers, but - at present - those have returned to their normal estimated delivery times. However, things can change quickly and disruption to our supply and distribution networks (both here in the UK and worldwide) may impact our ability to deliver according to our planned schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are committed to using components that can be recycled or reused, both in terms of the content of the package and the packaging materials.\nSustainable materials\nThe paper and cardboard we use comes from FSC certified forests.

Terrible things happen in Nowhereville, perpetrated both by monstrous people and literal monsters. But the townsfolk constantly forget about these things. For some reason, you remember. And you fight back. \nThe game draws inspiration from the early works of Stephen King, the X-Files, and Twin Peaks. \nIn Nowhereville, you'll endeavor to stop terrible things, defeat monsters, save lives, and foil plots. And maybe, just maybe, someday you'll get to leave. \nComplete, all-in-one rulebook for players and GMs\nCharacter creation in 5 minutes\nPlay six different archetypes with templates available for adding supernatural capabilities to your character\nGM advice and guidelines for this type of game\nA complete town with map, overview, organizations, NPCs, monsters, personal secrets, and other details\nIntensity dial to adjust how your game plays\nCharacters have four Traits (Body, Mind, Charm, and Heart), each rated 1-4. When determining whether you succeed on a task that has consequences for failure, you'll roll a number of six-sided dice equal to the rating of the Trait being used versus a target number between 4 and 6. Every time you make a Trait check, besides determining success or failure, you'll earn a point in one of three tracks (Skill, Spirit, or Sway).\nYou spend Skill to advance your character. Spirit is spent to gain in-game advantages. Sway describes the influence the town has on you, and eventually punishes you for daring to fight back. \nYour character also has access to a variety of talents, powers, and templates that you can use to customize them. \nIn addition to the game book,  you'll receive the following support materials. \n Character Playbook and Template PDFs - Form-fillable PDF character playbook for every character type in the game as well as every template available in the game\nThis Kickstarter is lean and mean. \nThe game is fully designed, playtested, and edited, and currently in layout. Artwork is finished. Your pledge will go toward reimbursing the expenses previously incurred and covering remaining expenses. \nThere are no stretch goals. There are no special backer level to create something to be added to the book later. Nothing to slow us down in getting the game to you. \nThe Kickstarter will fulfill as quickly as we can wrap up the layout and get proof copies approved. \nPDFs will be fulfilled with DriveThruRPG.com. You'll receive a download link when the game is ready. \nYou'll receive a link that will allow you purchase a copy of the physical book at-cost. You'll pay shipping then. \nThe at-cost price is just what it takes to print the book, so it's super-cheap!\nThe cost may change a bit based on final page count. The following costs are approximate. \n$3.50 USD for a softcover\n$8.00 USD for a hardcover\nShipping varies based on your location, but shipping to a US location runs around $5 USD. Go HERE to see estimates for shipping to countries outside the US. Assume a page count of around 120. \nDriveThruRPG's shipping services don't include VAT or tax for Canada, Australia, or the European Union.\nPDF download links for add-ons will be sent out a few weeks after the campaign ends, as soon as we've collected backer surveys from everyone. \n Game Design, Illustrations, and Layout: Craig Campbell (he/him) is an architect, horror fan, indie RPG designer, and the owner of NerdBurger Games.

We were like that, too \u2013 so we came up with a solution!\nThis Kickstarter funds a custom-printed shelf file designed for holding adventure modules, hardcover RPG books, and boxed sets. All four exterior panels feature new hand-painted art by Doug Kovacs!\nThe shelf file has a 3\u201d wide spine. This is thick enough to fit two big hardbacks, about 25 \u201cskinny modules,\u201d or one to two RPG boxed sets. It also fits board games that are in letter-sized dimensions. It comes with preprinted spine labels you can use to identify the contents.\nWe're offering backers of this Kickstarter a special pre-distribution price. When offered through distribution at a later date, we anticipate these costing $5 more.\nWith enough support, our stretch goals will give away extra shelf files to backers for free!\nWe're also offering a great price on a big collection of randomly selected adventure modules for your new shelf file!\nAnd backers will get to vote on the final name of the product!\nThe Sturdy Shelf File\nMade of durable corrugated cardboard, the shelf file is die-cut to shape. It ships flat, and easily folds into position. Each box is individually polybagged for safety in shipping.\nThe shelf file of holding, ready for your adventure modules!\nAmazing Art\nDoug Kovacs has hand-painted brand new art specially designed just for this project. He sketched out the image on a physical sample and painted it to fit. It will look so good, you\u2019ll want to leave this shelf file out in the open!\nSpine Labels\nEach shelf file comes with a page of labels. You can use these to easily identify what\u2019s in the box. \nStretch Goals through Economies of Scale\nWe're already level 1! That means bonus shelf files!Read this update for details! Now, help us get to 6th level!\nThe printing for this project is a classic example of economies of scale. We need to produce a die-cut mold and cover a number of up-front costs. The more we print, the faster we hurdle those fixed costs, and the lower the unit cost becomes. Stretch goals are therefore based on backers getting more copies for the same price they already pledged. \nThe basic pledge levels cover 1, 2, or 3 shelf files, and those pledge levels don\u2019t receive stretch goals. If you pledge for 4, 6, 8, or 10 shelf files, those pledge levels will begin to receive extra copies if we hit certain milestones. The end result looks kind of like a class progression table. If you've played D&D you know what we mean! It works like this:\nFor example: if the project hits 4,000 shelf files sold, everyone who pledged for 4 shelf files will actually get 5; everyone who pledged for 6 will actually get 7; and so on.\nAbove 6,000 copies, the incremental unit costs don\u2019t reduce appreciably. There are no more extra levels above there. (Unless we hit some crazy amount - never say never!)\nNote that the bonus shelf files don\u2019t \u201ccount double\u201d \u2013 only the core pledged copies count toward the stretch goal math.\n Fill It With Adventures! \nBuy your shelf file pre-filled with adventure modules at a great price! \nFor $75, you can add on a stack of 20 randomly selected adventures from our extensive line. You will save at least $125 price against cover price. There will be no duplication among the adventures, which will come from our Dungeon Crawl Classics, Mutant Crawl Classics, Fifth Edition Fantasy, Dungeon Crawl Classics Lankhmar, and other product lines.\nDepending on the mix of adventures in your random pull, you may save even more than $125. Most of our adventure modules are priced at $10, but some limited-edition variants have an MSRP of $15 or more. Those options will be included in the random pull, so depending on the mix of titles you receive, you may get an even better deal for the $75 add-on price.\nEach shelf file holds about 25 adventure modules! Stuff it full with a random pull!\nWhat To Name This Thing?\nWe asked our fans what to name this thing, and we had so many great suggestions! So many, in fact, that we could not decide.\nEvery day we will change the name of this project to a prospective name. Over the course of the project you will see two dozen possible names!\nOnce the project ends, all backers will be given a chance to vote.\nMay the best name win!\nShipping Costs\nBased on the advance prototype, we can estimate shipping costs as follows. Please note that these are estimates. Final costs will be determined at time of shipping based on weight of the physical goods. These shipping costs are for the shelf file only and do not include the pack of randomly selected adventures. That pack will add approximately $10-$15 in additional shipping cost in the USA and substantially more for international orders. International shipping costs below include prepaid VAT and shipping via a very efficient FedEx program with prefilled customs forms and quick turnaround. US shipping is estimated via priority mail.\n1 shelf file: $10-12 USA; $18-$20 international\n2-3 shelf files: $12-13 USA; $25-$30 international\n4-6 shelf files: $14-16 USA; $35-$45 international\n8-10 shelf files: $17-18 USA; $50-$80 international\nTidy up your bookshelf with the Shelf File of Holding!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run more than twenty Kickstarters, all fulfilled successfully or on track to do so.

Court of Blades takes place in the vibrant, fantasy renaissance city-state of Ilrien, in a world populated by scheming nobles, court magicians, and dashing duelists. \nAs a noble retainer, you will engage in the polite civil warfare of the great families. You will host lavish balls, and manipulate the courts, uncover the plots of your rivals, protect the city from arcane dangers, manage your own intrigues and personal scandals, leverage your reputations, connections, and so much more.\nInspired by infamous warring families like history's Medicis and Pazzis, Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets, or Game of Thrones' Starks and Lannisters, in Court of Blades you will take on the role of a talented retainer to a newly risen House of the Esultare in the great city of Ilrien. The Esultare, composed of the six Houses Major, are considered to be the most powerful families in the Principalities. Amongst them they have their own pecking order, and every citizen of Ilrien is aware of every house\u2019s position within that order.\nYou\u2019ve already risen so high, but to secure your place and ensure that the house you serve ascends to the highest seat of power in the Principalities, you will have to learn about your rival houses, advance your house\u2019s agenda, and risk your lives in a world of duplicity and magic.\nWe play to find out if our noble retainers can play the Great Game and win it all, or if they'll fall prey to the machinations of their rivals or their own human failings.\n\nEach game session of Court of Blades centers around one errand that your coterie has chosen to prioritize accomplishing on behalf of the house you serve. You will have time to complete three of these errands in each Social Season, tied to the calendar year in Ilrien. How much of your agenda you manage to successfully complete will determine your ability to advance the house at the end of each Social Season. Beware, the higher you climb, the more rivals you will find waiting for you.\n5/17/21 Update: We had an amazing interview with Craig over at Third Floor Wars where we talked about developing Court of Blades, what a \"Court of Thrones\" expansion would look like, just how chonky this game really is and so much more!

It is a fiction-first, d6 dice pool game that is easy to play and focuses on the action, while giving you all of the tools you need to tell incredible stories with mechanical support. Responsibility for shaping the story is shared equally amongst the group, and there is very little GM prep-work to be done before each game. \nIt uses a core resolution mechanic that asks the players whether their current action is being done from a controlled, risky, or desperate position. Each situation will result in a number of different outcomes beyond mere success or failure. In Court of Blades, even a \"bad roll\" will change the landscape, affect the scene, and drive the story in interesting and satisfying directions. \nHere are some of the new toys we\u2019ve added to help you tell these stories of intrigue and peril:\n A FitD Game built for campaign-length play. While you can absolutely run a one-shot, or a single Social Season; as lovers of long-running games, Court of Blades was built to run for 30+ sessions. Plenty of time to develop deep bonds with rivals and friends, change an entire city, and maybe even find true love as you claw your way to the top.\n New and easy-to-use GM\u2019s tools that allow you to create a fully dynamic city that is filled with constantly evolving plots. With just a few dice rolls in-between each Social Season of the game, there will always be new secrets for the PCs to uncover.\n The \u201cUncover a Plot\u201d mechanic to discover what your rival houses are secretly up to. And, of course, mechanics to foil their efforts and pave the way for your house\u2019s ascension.\nWay more \u201cspecial permission\u201d abilities and items than you can shake a narrative stick at.\n New mechanics for Scandals, Bonds, Romance and Paramours, Intrigues, Influence, Warring Houses and more. \nYou can also hear us talking about some of the mechanical changes we made to the system while it was in development with the Hacked in the Dark podcast crew: Right Here!\nIn addition, we've put together a preview of the book's early release formatting that you can grab: Right Here!\n\nThe Playbooks you'll find inside.\nPlayers will each choose one of our six core Playbooks to build their retainer, ranging from the political mastermind, to the powerful magician. Or change the game with one of our two \u201cadvanced\u201d Playbooks, the Kiss and the Curse. One bound by fae blood, and the other by dark and forgotten magic.\nMultiple players can choose the same playbook, but the team gets a better range of unique abilities when everyone chooses a different playbook as their core concept. You can always reach into other playbooks to mix and match special abilities later!\nThe Bravo is a dashing sworn-sword, quick of wit and unmatched in combat. The Bravo gains xp when they address a challenge with violence or panache.\nThe Hawk is a dangerous bounty hunter, menacing and unflappable in the face of danger. The Hawk gains xp when they address a challenge with pursuit or observation.\nThe Eye is a master agent and infiltrator, cannier than a skulk of foxes and just as hard to catch. The Eye gains xp when they address a challenge with stealth or perception.\nThe Couth is a street-wise wildcard, lucky or dangerous enough to rise from the gutter. The Couth gains xp when they address a challenge with evasion or mayhem.\nThe Knack is a magical expert, gifted with arcane power and knowledge of the hidden world. The Knack gains xp when they address challenges with arcane knowledge or power.\nThe Key is a political mastermind, able to craft arguments and devices with ease. The Key gains xp when they address challenges with expertise or calculation.\nThe Kiss is a fae-touched charmer and magical manipulator. The Kiss gains xp when they address challenges with fae power or control.\nThe Curse is a haunted revenant bearing ancient knowledge, weaponry, and a grudge. The Curse gains xp when they address challenges with callous disregard or unearthly endurance.\nThe Bravo's Playbook\nThe Houses who await your service.\nPlayers decide, as a group, which of the six great houses they want their PCs to serve. Each house has its own set of strengths to explore, and its own unique flavor to inspire the sort of stories your group wants to tell. While any house can be played in whichever way the group wishes, you will find that each house lends itself naturally to a different style of play, right out of the box.\nHouse Corvetto, the \"Majestic Tyrants\" lend themselves to games of mystery, manipulation, seduction and the arcane. Serving the Corvetto, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Coercion or Majesty.\nHouse Battalia, the \"Old House of Martial Valor\" lend themselves to games of thrilling feats of arms, protection of the city and courts, and upholding the law. In service to Battalia, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Honor or Tradition.\nHouse Bastien, the \"Rising Tide\" lend themselves to games of charity, revolution, and looking out for the little guy against all odds. When you pledge yourselves to Bastien, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Audacity or Unorthodoxy.\nHouse Lovell, the \"Arcane Gossipmongers of Wealth and Taste\" lend themselves to games of social intrigue, scandal, deadly rumors and arcane secrets. Under the auspices of the Lovell, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Secrets or Discernment.\nHouse Al-Mari, the \"Tower Built of Spit and Spite\" lend themselves to games of brutal cunning, ruthlessness, and carving out your place while being beset by enemies on all sides. Pledging your sword to the Al-Mari, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Dominance or Aggression.\nHouse Elanda, the \"Fist Around the Heart of Trade\" lend themselves to games of controlling the markets, attracting singular talent, and manipulating the city for money and power. Serving as Elanda's thumb on the scale, your coterie marks xp when they overcome obstacles with Guile or Extortion.\nHouse Lovell's Coterie Sheet\n\n$7.5k -  Court of Blades is nearly complete.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "You abandoned your old life to work in tandem with the magician: the first person to show you that true magic exists in your world. When something goes horribly wrong and the magician gets himself into a bind he can\u2019t escape, you must step forward to claim the gifts that have been yours all along, before it's too late to help him \u2014 or anyone else.\n\nThe Shape Of Shadows is a connected path game about show magic and true magic, the tension of asserting yourself as an equal to someone taking you under their wing; and the price you are willing to pay to fly on your own.\nThe Shape of Shadows can be adapted for players who prefer to write with brevity, using a bullet journal style of notation.\nThe Shape of Shadows is about a magician's assistant who, for their own reasons, dedicates their career to pursuing stage and close up magic through the mentorship of the magician. Through the eyes of the character they create, players will learn how the magician's assistant started the path they're on, how they chose to work with the magician, and why the risks and danger of learning true magic were not enough to deter them from their studies. Through intricately constructed journaling prompts, image- and word-based puzzles, and utilizing a mundane day planner to create strange alchemical rituals, players will explore the magic of the world they move through, in and out of this connected path game. The core game is played solo, but alongside everyone else who opens the door to the adventure and mystery at the heart of The Shape of Shadows. No two players' stories will be the same, but every player will walk their connected paths together through their play experiences.\n\nA sampling of letters from former assistants for the players to discover in-game.\nConnected path and keepsake games are two terms coined by Shing Yin Khor and myself during our collaboration on our previous game, Field Guide To Memory. In a connected path game, players experience unique, solitaire games while simultaneously sharing in a community of others engaging in the same creative spirit alongside them. \n\nThe joy of playing a connected path the joy of show and tell: our intuitive desire to show each other what is precious to us, why we treasure it, and why we'd like to feel compelled to share it with the communities that are precious to us in turn. \nPlaytester feedback on The Shape of Shadows was almost unanimous in its enthusiasm.\nBoth the narrative and core game experience in The Shape of Shadows center on a day planner. As the magician's assistant, much of your time in character will be spent interacting with the magician's planner, scouring it for keys to the doors he\u2019s always kept closed to you, in order to learn what you need to restore him. \nAn example of how some players answered game prompts in their planner by using color-coded index cards.\nAs the player, you will choose one month in a weekly planner to keep track of your character's increasingly strange appointments, while the rest of the planner undergoes a metamorphosis in your hands. Every day of play offers something new. Some days are contemplative, focusing on memory and observation in the form of journaling; others are adventurous and may lead you outside to find a token you need for a ritual circle; and still others involve trying your hand at more tangible crafts. \n\nWhether you're learning the nuances of different forms of sigil magic and how to work them into the trick locks you use during your close up magic shows; reviewing the finer points of talisman crafting to shield you from hecklers at the comedy club; charming your playing cards so they never tumble from your hands during a waterfall shuffle; or developing alchemical formulas for transmutation (that you can actually make in real life at home during the game!), it all goes in your planner to turn it page by page into a true magician's spellbook.\nAs far as you can tell, the magician devoted the entirety of his life to seeing how far he could push his skills in the practical application of true magic, and honing the craft of his show magic. Alchemy, cardistry, divination, illusionism, close-up, conjuring \u2014 nothing is off the table for him. \nVarious letters from former magician's assistants over the years.\nOver the course of his life the magician accumulated a veritable dragon's hoard of research materials, ritual components, flotsam and jetsam both figurative and literal (an avid beachcomber, the magician uses his findings often), and piles and piles of correspondence (some of it quite personal).\nAlmost every day during the game, you will receive 1-2(or more!) photographs and documentation of these objects as part of your gameplay prompts.\nTwo reward levels (the ILLUSIONIST and the CONJURER) include physical packages of these curiosities, mailed to you as part of the game's closing narrative.\n\n\nLOCK, $15 (UNLIMITED) \nAt the $15 KEY level, you will get added to the player list for The Shape of Shadow's live run in late summer. For the duration of the game's run you'll receive an email with story and activity prompts Monday through Thursday. The game lasts for four consecutive weeks.\n\nKEY, $25 (UNLIMITED)\nAt the $25 LOCK level, you'll get everything associated with the live game, and a high resolution PDF of the full game text, sent to you after the live run wraps up. After her superlative layout work on Field Guide To Memory, Ruby Lavin will return to design The Shape of Shadows' PDF as well.\n\nSLEIGHT, $40 (UNLIMITED)\nAt this level backers will get entry into the live game and the full game PDF for two recipients. \n\nILLUSIONIST, $60 (UNLIMITED)\nPLAY\n\nAll digital versions of the game, including the emailed live game experience in late summer, the full PDF, and large envelope of strange and beautiful paper ephemera, as described in the \"Artifacts, Art, and Ephemera\" section. Includes ephemera from the game narrative that your character or others may encounter during play, a sheet of custom-illustrated sigil stickers, and a sheet of holographic stamps showing a white rabbit popping in and out of a magician's hat. I am mountaineering up an exciting new learning curve and making this reward level unlimited.\n\nCONJURER, $350 (LIMITED TO 60 BOXES)\nAn example of what a recipient of the Conjurer's box might receive.\nIn addition to everything at the ILLUSIONIST reward level, you will receive a literal one-of-a-kind collection of beautiful flotsam and jetsam just like the talismans and treasured detritus in the magician's office. Each box is numbered, since no two boxes are exactly the same, and all of them will have at least 1-2 pieces of my original art, in different mediums.\n\nWhen I conceptualized this reward level, the thought that came to mind was \"if a cabinet of curiosities could be ordered through delivery.\" The high level of care, craftsmanship, and artistic expression I want to put into each of these boxes is the kind of experiential feast I adore creating and sharing with people; and, in order to keep it sustainable, there is a strict limit of 60 of these boxes. \n\nEach collection box will be made, packed, lovingly fussed over, and shipped out a few at a time in order to avoid bottlenecking my home studio and office. If you back at this level, please note that another backer may receive their box long before you, depending on how many people end up supporting this level.\n\nCreative Contributors\nAmal El-Mohtar is an award-winning writer of fiction, poetry, and criticism.

This game builds further on the scaffold of everything I\u2019ve learned from those experiences.\n\nThe game is fully structured and written, albeit in an unedited late-stage draft. The Kickstarter funds will cover the cost of copy editing by Ryan Boyd, and layout design by Ruby Lavin (whose previous layout credits include Field Guide To Memory and Wanderhome), as well as giving me the time I need to attend to the creative and administrative tasks associated with the multifaceted nature of connected path games like this one. Short of Mailchimp\u2019s server going down or a street magician accidentally turning me into a rabbit, I anticipate fulfillment of the text and live game to stay on schedule.\n\nI do not currently have a fulfillment partner for the Illusionist reward level (the flat art and ephemera), but I'm in touch with two or three companies and will contract the most suitable once I know what quantity of printed goods I'll need to ship. While the USPS is generally reliable for domestic US mail, with any physical reward there is always the risk of packages getting delayed or lost in thin air. \n\nAdditionally, the future of international mail sent out of the US is currently hard to read in the cards. I fully intend to work with my future fulfillment partner to send out every single package that is backed and accounted for, but be aware that it could take a very long time for your rewards to reach you. (Due to various plant pressings and organic materials in the Conjurer's boxes, I cannot ship that reward level internationally and it will be limited to US backers.)\n\nMy aim is to fulfill this Kickstarter from late July to August, well before the stated delivery dates.

The book will feature the beautiful art work of  Joel Bisaillon,  brought to you by New Comet Games, the same people who brought you the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Devil's Swamp.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is a rules and setting supplement to the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game and focuses on the period between 1650 and 1730 CE. Your keeper can set up your investigators as crew on a pirate or privateer ship, freelancers in one of the Caribbean ports who love the gold doubloon more than a foreign governments rule, or even provide your investigators with their own ship. Working together the investigators must face evil Mythos, real and imagined. Curses left by ancient civilizations and hidden nightmares around the world.\nThe golden age of piracy is a time of spreading empires. England, France, Spain, Italy as well as several other smaller countries are planting their flags and colonies on any piece of land they can find. Empires rise and fall, Spanish ships are hauling new found gold from the new world back to Spain and ships are lost to pirates and storms regularly. Governments authorize privateers to sail under their flag but can raise the black when needed.\n There are new skills, new professions, famous NPCs and new weapons that the investigators must learn to use if they want to survive against not only the dangers of the Mythos, but also against disease, dehydration, sea monsters, warships, and other pirates.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is not just a setting book anticipated to be approximately 360 pages, but also contains a full campaign, The Map of the Astronomer. This campaign will take your investigators to ports unknown, fantastical lands out of this world and come face to face with some of the most dangerous Elder Gods and dark creatures ever faced. Can anything prepare the investigators for the finale and the most terrifying deity of all time.\nMany of the adventures could be run as standalone, but it is designed as a full campaign.

Written by Stoker-nominated and Audible best-selling author Arvind Ethan David, GRAY is told both as a beautiful graphic novel, with art by Eugenia Koumaki, Diana Greenhalgh and Joana Lafuente,  and as an all-star,  full-cast audiodrama. \nThis Kickstarter is to:\n#1 produce a fully dramatized, scripted audiodrama, with amazing music, sound design and an all-star cast\n#2 fund Volume 2 of the graphic novel including printing and full artwork \nThe Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde\u2019s only novel and one of the classics of gothic literature,  is the tale of the most beautiful man of his age, who sells his soul and his conscience in exchange for eternal youth, beauty, and power \u2014 and who spends his life murdering, raping and corrupting.  All the time in his attic, his picture degrades and rots.\nGRAY flips the original's moral framework and gender archetypes: our DORIAN GRAY is a social media princess who drifts through the coolest cliques of NYC, living the most debauched of lives, breaking hearts and turning heads wherever she goes.  But Dorian has secrets.  For one thing, she\u2019s a violent criminal.  For another, she\u2019s an immortal creature of magic, hell set on a mission of revenge against some of America's most powerful men. \nWe're in the final STRETCH!\nSee all the options under \"Rewards\"!\n$100 Tier\n$150 Tier\nJagged Little STAN!\nYour own picture of Dorian... in full color! Get this 4 postcard set!\nDorian Gray - Frozen in Enamel // Dorian Gray Enamel Pin\nAdd-On Item for Physical Reward Tiers\nGray Volume 1 - Please note the final version will be hardback & not include the red \"Advanced Readers Copy\" text at the top.\nGray Volume 1 - Please note the final version will be a hardback\nGRAY remains true to Wilde\u2019s spirit of pushing every boundary, creative, sexual, and of exposing the pervasive hypocrisy of society, but we apply his lens to our era - the time of #MeToo and #DefundThePolice.  Our characters cover the spectrum of sexual and gender identity,  and like their Wildean originals, they debate, in sparkling witticisms, the most serious issues of our time. These include: Sexual Assault and the #MeToo movement; gender identity and sexual orientation and the prejudice LGTBQ+ people suffer and Systemic Racism.\nGRAY has partnered with RAINN, the nation\u2019s largest anti-sexual violence organization to provide resources to readers, listeners and our cast and company around the charged issues that the story explores. Please see the bottom of our page for more info on RAINN. \nWhilst an innocent student in the 1980s, a young woman named Dorian Gray was subjected to a ritualized assault at the hands of a cabal of ambitious men.  It was in that moment that she became something both more and less than human.  \nNow, 40 years later, but not a day older, she\u2019s ready for her revenge. To destroy the men who wronged her, but more importantly, to end once and for all the culture of sexual predators and casual abuse.  Gray believes the system can never serve women, so she's going to destroy it. \nThen Dorian meets Detective HANK WUTAN, the Black NYPD detective assigned to stop these crimes.  Hank has his own demons and his own issues with the system he's pledged to serve, but he's an incremental, cautious reformer by nature.  A rule follower. Police. \nDespite all that, and despite the fact that Dorian is his suspect number one, they fall for each other,  hard.\n\nGRAY takes Wilde\u2019s classic novel and reinvents it as a tale of cathartic revenge for the #MeToo era, a story about dangerous women and corrupt men, about sexual power and predators, about guilt and consequences and about the different ways of changing the world: those who would burn it down to start again, and those who would work from within to reform it.\n\u2026 and about how a murderous, privileged, debauched she-demon and a law-abiding Black detective can be soul mates.\nThe audio drama tells Dorian's story as a true-crime investigative podcast hosted, 20 years after the events of the book,  by the mysterious Speranza- a new character, determined for reasons of her own to figure out the truth of what happened to Dorian Gray, and to tease out the implications of her terrible crimes.  Set to release in Fall 2021.  \nThe Audiobook isn't a book on tape, it isn't an ordinary podcast, rather a fully reinvented adaptation designed solely for audio.  With an amazing cast and some of the top sound designers from the world of film and television,  we are playing with the form in the same way that Orson Welles did with War of the Worlds --  creating a fiction so convincing it's better than the truth.\nMeet our wonderful cast, which includes some of our favorite people from Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency and Jagged Little Pill :\nThe Audiobook Team\nDorian Gray's story is told in full-colour...  We're halfway there, but we need your help to tell her full story! \nThe graphic novel has been written as two volumes for release \nVolume 1 contains Chapters 1 - 5, will be released for sale on July 2021\nVolume 2 contains chapters 6 - 9 + an (epic) epilogue has been written - and with your help, it could be released October 2021!  \nGRAY - A Graphic Novel Volume 1 with cover by Aron Wiesenfeld\nGray Volume 2 - A Kickstarter Exclusive, with cover by Eugenia Koumaki!\nPlease see our shipping chart below.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Blue Planet is a compelling RPG journey into humanity\u2019s precarious future on a distant waterworld where political unrest and a hungry alien ecology threaten the nascent colony effort. A planet where GEO marshals struggle to maintain peace, Incorporate mercenaries wage amphibious proxy wars, and native insurgents fight for their adopted world. A frontier where human desperation and corporate greed ravage an uncanny ecology, threatening to plunge humanity into a war of survival with an ancient, alien legacy. \nThough the original Blue Planet predates many of these titles, the setting is evoked by the movies Avatar, Blade Runner and Outland, the television series The Expanse, Firefly and Earth II and the books Legacy of Heorot, Songs of Distant Earth and the Mars Trilogy. A reviewer once gave a glib but accurate elevator pitch for Blue Planet as \"Space marshal Cowboy and his cybernetic dolphin sidekick fight eco-crimes in alien Hawaii.\" \nDiptych Book Covers\nThe Full Premise \nBlue Planet's uniqueness and enduring appeal are in its deep, realistic, hard science fiction setting, and to really describe it requires more than a few sentences. For those new to the waterworld, we recommend exploring the more detailed premise here.\nThis campaign will fund the production of a new third edition of the critically acclaimed Blue Planet roleplaying game. We\u2019ve brought Blue Planet to Kickstarter because we're excited to make the definitive edition of the game, but we need your help to do that.\nWe want to design a uniquely beautiful, full-color, two-volume, 600-page masterpiece, overflowing with evocative art, captivating text, and exceptional production values. We want to make the books themselves works of art with UV cover highlights, endpaper maps and page-marking ribbons. We want to fill them with a new rules set, stunning art, expansive color maps and compelling new locations, social structures, future technologies and alien secrets.\nThese features and content exceed our capacity to resource on our own, so we are here asking you to join the Blue Planet team and help us make the new version of this classic game truly exceptional. \nPlayer's and Moderator's Guides - 300 pages each\nDownload the Blue Planet: Recontact Quickstart Guide here. This 80+ page, full color primer is free and contains the new version of the rules, a setting sampler and a demo scenario called \"Trouble in Paradise,\" complete with ready-to-play characters.\nDraft Layout\nThe Recontact project includes\n\u2022 An extensive evolution of the core mechanics, taking advantage of two decades of RPG development. The new system can be found here in our free, 80+ page Recontact primer.\n\u2022 All new, full-color artwork bringing the waterworld to life in stunning, evocative imagery.\n\u2022 Full-color world and regional maps, including submarine geography, redesigned and rendered by professional cartographer and game designer Mark Richardson (Green Hat Design).\n\u2022 A series of campaign archetypes to help moderators jumpstart their games in the vast adventure space of Poseidon (see below).\n\u2022 Updated speculative technologies.\n\u2022 New sociopolitical systems, organizations, institutions and conflicts.\n\u2022 New locations, settlements and facilities.\nSample of the Newly Rendered Maps\nThe Recontact project does not include\n\u2022 Fundamental changes to the core sociopolitical tensions - the themes will remain staunchly pro-environmental and anti-colonial. \n\u2022 Timeline advancements - the setting was originally - and intentionally - poised on a sociopolitical precipice, rife with plot and storytelling potential, and we want to maintain that same narrative tension.\n\u2022 Global rewrites of the setting material - though updates, sensitivity edits and additions are being made throughout, we believe Blue Planet\u2019s deep setting is why the game has endured, and so we are not making major alterations to that essential content.\nA word about the delivery date\nWe know a reward delivery date of October 2022 seems unexpectedly far away. Though we intend to deliver Blue Planet sooner, our experience, and the last year in particular, have proven an essential truth about Kickstarter management - set a generous delivery date, then add six months. We hope this date does not discourage folks from becoming backers, but instead demonstrates our commitment to realistic planning and transparent communication. \nAll reward tiers (digital and physical) will receive PDFs of the out-of-print Blue Planet books the day after the campaign ends. Single book pledges will receive the corresponding v2 PDF, and book set pledges will receive copies of everything ever published for the line. All 10 past Blue Planet titles - over 1700 pages of waterworld adventure - as immediate rewards!\nFirst edition Blue Planet, Archipelago, Access Denied, v2 Blue Planet Player's and Moderator's Guides, Fluid Mechanics, First Colony, Frontier Justice, Natural Selection and Ancient Echoes.\nArchipelago - 1st ed. Gazetteer\nBlue Planet has received broad acclaim, particularly for its deep, detailed, and realistic setting, and has remained well regarded since its original publication. However, that publication was almost 25 years ago, and in the intervening decades, all versions have gone out of print and game design has evolved dramatically. We are therefore excited at the prospect of giving the game system an overdue overhaul and the opportunity to share Blue Planet with a new generation of players.  \nInterior Art Sample - Native Pod Passing Dyfed\nMore personally, Blue Planet features critical environmental themes, presenting a precarious future threatened by the dire consequences of ecological collapse. If issues like biodiversity loss, ocean acidification and climate change were only obscure concerns within the scientific community 25 years ago, they are now clear and present existential threats to the human species. This new edition will let us add our own small voice to those demanding true stewardship of our original blue planet.\nCompelled by these reasons, the original creators at Biohazard Games have teamed up with publisher Gallant Knight Games to produce a modern edition of this classic RPG. \nInterior Art Sample - Moon Pool Intrusion\nRecontact is the in-game term for the fateful day in 2165 when the UNSS Admiral Robert Perry entered orbit around Poseidon, \u201creestablishing contact\u201d with Earth 69 years after the original colonists were abandoned. Given that more than two decades have passed since the publication of the first edition of Blue Planet, RECONTACT seemed a fitting subtitle for this new version of the game.\nAnyone familiar with Blue Planet v2\u2019s Synergy rules will recognize the new system as a modern evolution of those mechanics, sharing a little of that design's genetics and the same intent to support the hard science realism of the setting. Players will also find the new system is simultaneously simpler and more robust, while supporting richer, more evocative character creation that's focused as much on who characters are as what characters can do. \nDraft Character Sheets\nCharacters have 4 attributes with optional foci and up to 8 skill sets - areas of expertise based on player-generated descriptors that evoke a character\u2019s origins, training, occupation and experiences. The core mechanic is roll \u2264 (attribute rank)+(skill set rank). The roll is made with either 1, 2 or 3 d10, depending upon whether the general, core or specialty in a given skill set is being used. For those who know v2, these elements should seem familiar. There are fewer attributes, but they work similarly, and the variable dice pool is a streamlined take on the aptitude mechanic. The skill sets are simultaneously simpler and more robust than the long list of specific aptitudes and skills in the 2nd edition. \nBlue Planet does remain a realistically dangerous game, keeping the  wound levels and trauma tests from the 2nd edition. Weapons and sea monsters are therefore quite deadly, so characters should try to avoid getting shot. Or eaten.\nInterior Art Sample - Work in Progress 1 - Greater White Attack\nInterior Art Sample - Work in Progress 2 - Greater White Attack\nInterior Art Sample - Final Image - Greater White Attack\nThe new mechanics also lean in to the qualitative roleplaying aspects of modern character design, providing Tags, Tracks and Ties unique to each player's character concept and each moderator's campaign. The emphasis is as much on who a character is as what they can do. \nTags are specific consequences, benefits, convictions, motivations or other active descriptors that a character incurs during their adventures - generally the result of narrative events, important tests, fallout from interactions with other characters and injuries.\nTracks model the range of specific character emotions, attitudes and mental states. They are usually campaign or party specific and can be offered by the moderator or created by the players for their party or their individual characters.\nTies describe a character\u2019s primary relationships, identifying the people and organizations to whom the character is connected, as well as the nature of the obligations they must meet to maintain those relationships.\nThe only consistent criticism Blue Planet has received over the years is that the setting is so vast and wide open, it\u2019s often challenging for game moderators to know where to start. They struggle to choose a single campaign current from among the sea of ideas in the setting. Blue Planet: Recontact will therefore provide a diverse set of campaign archetypes to provide ready-made options for GMs new to the game.\nIt\u2019s common practice for RPG books to present a range of character archetypes, providing players with detailed examples of the kinds of PCs available to play. These campaign archetypes are similar providing GMs with starting points, directions and enough details to get a variety of different campaigns underway. Each archetype outlines a premise, PC suggestions, unique NPCs, key locations, resources, themes, and plot threads from which a GM can build their perfect Blue Planet campaign.\nSample Campaign Archetype\nRead the full first example - Red Sky Charters - in the Recontact Primer here. \nThe project has a list of exciting stretch goals to further enhance the game with additional setting content, player support, scientific resources and even a potential glimpse through another wormhole. \n$32,500 - Guest Author Campaign Archetypes: Three additional campaign hooks created by luminaries in the RPG industry, offering new and creative directions to take your Blue Planet adventures. \nElizabeth Chaipraditkul\nGraeme Barber\nMari Murdock\nThese bonus archetypes will be added to those already planned for the Moderator's Guide. \n$35,000 - More Maps: We will commission two additional maps from the amazing Mark Richardson. As we reach higher funding levels,  we'll add even more maps to his production list. \n$37,500 - PC Species Trio: A collection of three new player character species will be added to the Player's Guide.\n\"Skink\"  - a third-generation, herptile-based hybrid genie with unique senses, enhanced durability and rapid healing. This species was developed on Mars and subsequently recruited in surprising numbers to Poseidon as Incorporate colonists. \n\"Xeno\" - a rare individual who has had the full rejuvenating and longevity benefits of Xenosilicate therapy since its inception - a member of a generation of newly immortal Incorporate elites whose privilege and resources are quickly outstripping the rest of humanity's.\nSperm Whale - the cloned and artificially gestated, uplifted members of a cohort of two dozen sperm whales released on Poseidon by an egomaniacal oligarch obsessed with cetacean sapience. (Yeah, this one will be a role playing challenge, for sure!)\n$40,000 - Station Trio: Gazetteer entries for three new, high-tech, high-pressure adventure locations will be added into the Moderator's Guide.\nDown Home Station - the GEO's state-of-the-art underwater research city - the high water mark of the Organization's influence on Poseidon.  Down Home is a place of shining science, high technology, cutthroat competition and dangerous secrets.  \nLesear High Orbital - the sprawling space platform that serves as one of Poseidon's primary orbital dockyards, transit hubs and spacer habitats. The station is a zero-g facility where trade, politics and greed fuse together behind pressurized bulkheads while its elite and powerful occupants look down on the ocean world below. \nProteus Landing - the Incorporate research cooperative on the water planet's oversized, biome-supporting moon. Research, rivalries and relationships create ever-changing, always challenging sources of adventure on this isolated outpost. \n$42,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to work towards a fully illustrated field guide.\n$45,000 - UV Spot Gloss Cover & Ribbon Bookmark: At this funding level, we'll add  ribbon bookmarks to each offset printed book, as well as enhance the cover with UV spot gloss to make Jeff Zugale's fantastic cover art jump right off the page. \n$47,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to work towards a fully illustrated field guide.\n$50,000 - Slipcase: A beautiful, two-book slipcase, intended to embossed with the submarine topography of the Pacifica Archipelago. The final slipcase might vary or change based on production needs, but we'll make it as nice as we can! All two-book sets ($100 pledge level or higher) will receive this upgrade as part of the pledge.\nInterior Art Sample - Amphibious Recon\n$52,500 - GEO Commission and Incorporate Logo Designs: Rendered logos lending each significant Colonial Commission and Incorporate nation unique visual identity and style. These will be incorporated throughout the books.\n$55,000 - The Outback: An all-new, full gazetteer section for the little explored and even less inhabited \"backside\" hemisphere of Poseidon. Includes a new map commission, regional descriptions, outposts and Most Wanted NPCs. \n$57,500 - Wormhole: A 10k-word expos\u00e9 outlining the secrets of the...REDACTED...and their ancient...REDACTED... This is a setting-changing resource for moderators who want to take their players on the ultimate Blue Planet adventure. \n$60,000 - Scientific Archive: We will curate an online library of speculative technology and essential oceanographic, marine biology and xenobiological resources that will provide verisimilitude for adventures on the water world and environmental education for players and moderators alike. This living resource will be a webpage accessible to all backers. \n$62,500 - Increased Art Commission: At this funding level, we will commission an additional ten pieces of interior art for the project. As we continue to raise funds past this level, our goal is to fully illustrate the \"Poseidon Field Guide.\"\n$65,000 - Web Apps: We will commission a web app developer to build two Blue Planet: Recontact themed in-game apps for use in play. \nPoseidon/Earth Date Synchronizer - a quick conversion calculator that matches Earth normal with Poseidon normal dates. \nIncorporate Script Exchange Rate Tracker - an exchange rate generator that tracks and displays the daily variations and exchange rates between the relative values of the major Incorporate script. \nWe never expected to get this far, and so never thought we would get to share these, but we are excited to offer even more stretch goal enhancements and additions to the project. \n$67,500 - GM Screen Inserts: At this funding level, we will provide inserts for customizable game screens. They will feature at least one custom landscape image on the front panels and a collection of essential moderator information on the back panels. The inserts will be sized to fit the Hammerdog GM Screen offered by DTRPG and provided in both portrait and landscape formats. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase through DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Backers will also be provided files that will allow them to print their own inserts or have them commercially produced at their local print shop.\n$70,000 - Map Card Player Handouts: At this level, we will convert the maps created for the game into US letter-sized, card stock player handouts. The collection will also include additional four-panel sets that can be assembled into larger versions of the major world maps and laid out on the table top to accessorize play. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase through DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Backers will also be provided files that will allow them to print their own map panels or have them commercially produced at their local print shop.\n$75,000 - Hardware Spot Illustrations: This funding level will allow us to produce twice the number of spot illustrations for the equipment chapter of the project. Twice the vehicles, robots, remotes, biomods and weapons!\n$77,500 - Settlement Maps: At this level, we will commission detailed settlement maps for the colonial capital of Haven, Lavender Organics\u2019 famous floating city of Dyfed, and the GEO\u2019s grand scientific and social experiment, Down Home Station.\n$80,000 - World of Hurt: This funding level will allow us to produce a 10k-word overview of life on Earth, detailing the unrecognizable, post-Blight political landscape and the economic stranglehold of the Incorporate nations. It will address the rising and increasingly violent unrest of the Earth's population and lean into the legacy of environmental destruction and rampant capitalism that has left the planet on the brink of social and ecological collapse. This reward will be offered in PDF format only.\n$85,000 - Fully Illustrated Field Guide: If we reach this goal, we will commit to fully illustrating the Poseidon field guide entries - more than 60 spot illustrations featuring the often frightening, sometimes bizarre, frequently majestic, but always fascinating creatures of Poseidon\u2019s alien ecology.\n$90,000 - Storm Surge Adventure Trio: At this funding level, we will produce a three-scenario set, suitable for use as standalone adventures or as an interconnected campaign. The scenarios will trace the rising tide of conflict between the Incorporate city states and the native insurgency and follow the seemingly vain efforts of the GEO to keep peace on the waterworld. The players can be of any or related factions, and depending upon their interests, moderators can lead the story directly into the secrets of Wormhole. This reward will be offered in PDF format only.\n$100,000 - Wormhole Bonus Content and Print-on-Demand: At this funding level, we'll double the size of Wormhole to 20k words and produce a POD version of the book. After all, even these extra pages will not be enough to contain all the secrets we want to share. Backers will get a POD code for at-cost purchase though DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Please note that production logistics mean this book may be delivered after the primary rewards of the campaign.\nWith 22 stretch goals already funded and the end of the campaign in sight, we want to offer a final wave of cool additions to the project.\n$107,000 - Virtual Table Top Assets: Funding this goal will provide a collection of Blue Planet: Recontact resources (maps, counters, artwork) in generic formats that can be downloaded from DriveThruRPG and used on most online, RPG virtual play platforms. We will also produce a number of platform-specific, automated character sheets - the given platforms will depend on development costs. \n$114,000 - Travel Time and Weather Apps: This level will add two additional, in-game apps to compliment the date and exchange rate calculator stretch goal. The first will provide inter-settlement distances with travel times, and the second will provide daily weather forecasts by planetary region.\n$120,000 - World of Hurt Bonus Content and Print-on-Demand: At this funding level, we'll double the size of World of Hurt to 20k words and produce a POD version of the book. There are too many tales of trial and triumph to be told on Earth in 2199 not to give you more room to play there. Backers will be given a POD code for at-cost purchase though DTRPG, but will be responsible for all shipping and at-cost printing fees. Please note that production logistics mean this book may be delivered after the primary rewards of the campaign.\nAbove $120,000: Any funds raised beyond this level will go toward improving the quality of the core books and previously unlocked stretch goals with more illustrations, maps, freelance assignments and production upgrades. We are intentionally ending itemized stretch goals here so that we do not risk \u201cmission creep\u201d and overload production. We are dedicated to keeping the scope manageable and the project moving forward. This campaign has been a wonderful and surprising success, and we want to be certain we deliver as promised.

This includes tracking delivered to your email.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to $15 (priority mail + packaging and handling costs).\nWe always do our best to keep shipping affordable by doing our own fulfillment so we can ensure it's done right.\nEU Shipping\nFor orders in the EU, our friends at Angry Hamster Publishing are handling our Kickstarter fulfillment.\nFor book-only pledges, we charge a flat \u20ac10 shipping charge (the shipping costs + packaging and handling costs) for EU addresses. We're still exploring tracking options and will share those details when we have them. \nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), we have to increase the cost to \u20ac25 (a larger package + packaging and handling costs). These packages are tracked.\nBecause these packages will be shipping from inside the EU, VAT and Customs fees will not apply!\nUK Shipping\nFor book-only pledges, we use Royal Mail, which is relatively inexpensive. Unfortunately, we can't currently offer a firm price as rate increases are imminent in the UK.\nFor pledges that include more than books (items such as dice, cards or tokens), unfortunately, we can't give a firm price as rate increases are imminent in the UK. We will use the Parcelforce service.\nOur fulfillment team will updated numbers soon, and we'll post those ASAP.\nThe Rest of the World\nWe recommend you look into the options below for print-on-demand. If you still want an offset book, you're welcome to back at the appropriate level, but you will be charged full shipping, and we will be unable to offer refunds of your pledge if shipping ends up more than you expected. It can get very expensive - effectively doubling the cost of your pledge - so please be aware before you pledge. \nIf you need an estimate, don't hesitate to reach out to shipping@gallantknightgames.com\nIf You're Concerned About Shipping Costs...\nWe are exploring having the Blue Planet: Recontact books in print on demand on DriveThruRPG. We fully intend to offer POD options if we can do so appropriately.

They are skilled creators, capable production managers and experienced industry professionals. Though this is only Biohazard's second Kickstarter, Gallant Knight Games and its principal Alan Bahr have brought over 20 Kickstarter campaigns to completion under the GKG banner, as well as helped to deliver other projects (including troubled or disrupted ones) and understands how to execute on funded projects. There is always the possibility of unforeseen events delaying production, but Blue Planet is as sure an RPG investment as Kickstarter has to offer.\n\nQ: Can Biohazard/Gallant Knight Games handle this project?\nGallant Knight Games has run over 20 projects (even more as a consultant) and worked with Biohazard before, so we're bringing a wealth of experience to the table. We're aiming for an ambitious project, something big and exciting here, so while there will inevitably be hiccups, we're equipped to manage them.\n\nQ: What if the text or art isn't finished?\nA: 85% of the text is done and the rest is outlined. Artists have been contracted, and we've already invested considerable money into the project and will see it to the end.\n\nQ: What about delays in art?\nA: We've already begun the process of commissioning the core art assets for the game, and we're really pleased with the work so far. If there are issues or delay on the art, we also have back-up artists who are ready work.\n\nQ: Increase in shipping costs?\nA: Shipping costs constantly rise, and while we've projected them to the best of our abilities, there's not a lot we can do if they change. However, due to the limitations on the size of our product, we're confident this won't be a critical issue. We're working to ensure we can provide worldwide shipping to everyone as economically as possible. \n\nWe have teamed up with Angry Hamster Games to handle our EU and varied world-wide fulfillment. In the UK, Red Dice Games will be handling the Blue Planet: Recontact fulfillment.\n\nQ: What if something happens to the principals?\nA: If something were to happen to Jeff or another writer on the project, we've identified our backups, and our team is spread all over the world. It'd take a really big asteroid, zombie apocalypse or alien invasion to wipe us all out. The files and plans have been communicated to the whole team, and a new project lead has already been identified.\n\n*IMPORTANT NOTE*\nWe hold rewards for a year from fulfillment start date, after which we can no longer promise that we'll be able to fulfill your rewards. We're a small company with limited space, and while we've never had an issue, it's better to be clear about our practices so you're aware. Once we start shipping, if your reward gets returned, or your fulfillment info wasn't provided, we'll give you a full calendar year to sort out the issues and will still ship your rewards. After a year, we may no longer have the rewards, or we might require you to pay updated shipping charges, as they are always going up.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Digital Player's Guide", "descp": "\u2022 PDF copy of the new Recontact: Player's Guide.\n\u2022 PDF copy of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Player's Guide the day after the campaign ends.\nThe Player's Guide contains the introductory setting material, speculative technology and complete game rules.\nINCLUDES:\nBlue Planet: Recontact Player's Guide PDF\nPDF version of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Player's Guide\nAll applicable, funded, digital stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2022"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 18 or more", "title": "Digital Moderator's Guide", "descp": "\u2022 PDF copy of the new Recontact: Moderator's Guide.\n\u2022 PDF copy of the 2nd edition Blue Planet Moderator's Guide the day after the campaign ends.\nThe Moderator's Guide is a deep dive into the Blue Planet setting, covering the numerous factions, regional gazetteer, ecology and lethal wildlife.

After the success of Fantasy City Sites and Scenes (Kickstarter campaign, DrivethruRPG page) and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II (Kickstarter campaign, DrivethruRPG page), I'm back with a third volume in the series and another sixteen city locations for your campaign. \nFantasy City Sites and Scenes III is a 48-page (plus cover, inside covers, and back cover) 8.5\" x 11\" book for gamemasters who are in need of inspiration. This systemless work builds on those two earlier books in the line, but gamemasters may ignore the earlier titles if they wish and use only the locations detailed within this book.\n City Sites. The sixteen locations described in the book (each a two-page spread) presents new buildings that may be dropped into your campaign . . . and along with it, the characters and events detailed alongside the building. You won't find a dry collection of statistics and facts in this book. Each entry was written to spark the gamemaster's imagination and provide GMs with just enough to take the idea and make it their own!\n City Scenes. Pages 36 through 48 (plus the inside back cover of the printed book!) are packed with new encounters. These encounters do not duplicate any found in the first two Fantasy City Sites and Scenes books, meaning that this section greatly expands the gamemaster's number of choices when it comes time to randomly select a city encounter.\nDigital mockup. Text shown on the pages is not complete.\nDo you already own my other fantasy RPG supplements that were created thanks to the support of Kickstarter backers? Then you're looking for either the $1 (PDF) or $18 (print, U.S. only) reward levels. \nAre you outside of the United States and want print-on-demand codes? Please see below. \nFantasy City Sites and Scenes III is available in three different editions:\nPDF - For only a buck! If this campaign is successful, you will be able to download the systemless 48-page book in PDF from Dropbox. \nPrint Code - The $10 and $30 rewards include both the Dropbox link to download the book in PDF and a coupon code to purchase the printed edition from DrivethruRPG as a full-color softcover book. You will be responsible for the printing and shipping costs. (See the FAQ for more information.) ESTIMATED DRIVETHRURPG PRINT PRICE: $8 per softcover book. Please note that you pay all printing and shipping costs at DrivethruRPG as a separate expense.\nSaddle-Stitched Book. United States only. The $18 and $58 rewards is for a saddle-stitched edition that will be printed at Mixam, the same printer I worked with for the first two volumes in this series. If you already own the two earlier titles as saddle-stitched works, the $18 reward is what you want. \nThe print-on-demand offering is primarily for those who live outside of the United States and want a copy of the book in print.\nNOTE: The print-on-demand book will be created using DrivethruRPG's print-on-demand systems and will be offered using the best quality paper they offer. Your Kickstarter pledge for the print code does not cover the actual printing and shipping costs; those will be your responsibility.  (See the FAQ for more information.)\nAll DrivethruRPG price estimates are estimates only and effective as of project launch. I do not have any control over the DrivethruRPG systems and any price changes and shipping costs are under their control. All I can provide are estimates. Final prices may vary.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nAs you can see in the reward levels, I have estimated delivery as December 2021. Why so long? Unlike the first two books in the series, I have not yet written this third volume. I'll start the work just as soon as possible if we meet the funding goal, and I'll do all I can to finish well before December, but I want to give myself plenty of time in case things go wrong.\nAs with all of my projects, I'll post regular updates so everyone knows where I'm at with the creative process of the book.\n\nDid you miss the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II Kickstarter campaigns?

The darkness grew shape, and focus, and form before regarding them with glowing eyes filled with promise and pain, a hint of chaos and a dash of admiration.  \n\nIt spoke to them, \"From the time you were born your eyes were open to the light within the darkness, your ears heard the whispers within the silence.  In slumber you saw the dreams behind what most would call nightmares. It called out to us, and we called back. Now we are here together. You have done well, coming this far on your own, but the time has come for you to journey further down this path. Be warned, this is not an easy path, nor a safe one, and it is journey which never ends.  But if you truly wish to walk it, we will show you the way, as other shapes and shadows did for us, when we sat where you are now. So, are you ready?\"\n\nThe six, a newly formed coven, spoke as one. \"Yes, my master. We are ready.\"\n\nThe darkness smiled, \"Then let us begin.\"\n\nWelcome to Terror of Octobernomicon.\nTerror of Octobernomicon\nThis project is a celebration of new authors, writing about new monsters, in brand new scenarios shepherded along by a pair of established industry mentors.  The new authors are young, eager, and talented fresh faces, making their mark on the internet, though the Miskatonic Repository, seeking out mentors for their craft, or challenging them on the field of battle.  They have shown their worth.  They have earned their place, and their time has come.\n\nFor mentors we have:\n Matt \"Trollboy\" Wiseman - Ennie award winning author and webmaster of Shoggoth.net\n Oscar Rios - Ennie award winning author, publisher, and president of Golden Goblin Press.\nWe can't begin to express how excited we are to be part of these new author's journey, and to present these exciting new scenarios and authors to both our fans and the wider Call of Cthulhu Role Playing community.\n\nWhat is Octobernomicon?\nThe new monsters come from the pages of Shoggoth.net's most beloved traditions - Octobernomicon.  Year after year this amazing online community features 31 original monsters for the Call of Cthulhu Role Playing Game, one for each day of October. These creatures are submitted by talented amateurs and established professionals alike, posted daily, free to download and incorporate into Keeper's home campaigns. Octobernomicon has always been a place for new authors to cut their teeth, fertile ground for eager young creators wishing to add their voices to the dark chorus of Call of Cthulhu. \n\nThe Collection\nTerrors of Octobernomicon will be a collection of six original scenarios, written by six new and newish authors, each featuring an original monster from Octobernomicon. Four of the scenarios are classic 1920's-30's era adventures, one is for the Cthulhu Invictus\u2122 setting (The Roman Empire), and another is for the Down Darker Trails\u00ae setting (The Old West).  Each has been edited by the teams mentors, with professional maps, illustrations, and handouts by our design teams (Mike Wilson - Editing, Greg Shipp - Cartography, Brad Hicks - Cover & Interior illustrations, Alberto Guerra - Interior Illustrations, Mark Shireman - Layout & Design), a mix of Golden Goblin Press and Shoggoth.net personnel. \n\n Classic Era (1920\u2019s-30's) \n Suspended Pending Resolution, by Francesca McMahon \nThings just don't seem to add up...\nInvestigators are hired by an insurance company handling the salvage of a wrecked freighter, beached along the coast of Cornwall, near St. Ives, in Great Britain. It seems salvage crews have turned up a number of alarming discrepancies, and certain questions about the tragic events of five years ago have never been fully explained. Work has been halted after a number of unexplained events begin plaguing the worksite. Soon investigators stumble upon the smoldering embers of a deeper, and far deadlier, mystery.\n\n Accounts of Violence, by Marek Golonka \nA lovely morning in Vienna ruined by madness and mystery.\nWhen relaxing in a Vienna Caf\u00e9, investigators are victims of an unprovoked attack by a local journalist. They are shocked to discover he knows some of their names and a bit about them. Looking into a possible connection between the unhinged man and themselves leads investigators to a most unusual mystery. Soon other attacks follow, as random acts of violence spreads through the City of Dreams. Will investigators be able to put a stop to it all before it\u2019s too late?\n\n Scarabs of Sekhmet, by Helen Yau \nWelcome to the trip of a lifetime, because it might just be your last.\nAfter winning tickets on the maiden voyage of Reine du Nil, their picturesque riverboat cruise down the Nile takes a terrifying turn. Deck side cocktails are quickly sidelined as rumors of grave robbers, mystical curses, and ancient folklore ensnare everyone in a web of death, horror, and madness. For everyone onboard the fine line between life and death soon thins and becomes blurred. Can investigators solve the mystery in time to not only save themselves, but everyone else onboard as well?\n\n Currency of Grief, by Daniel Purcell  \nDark things lurk in the spaces between love, grief, and madness.\nA wealthy family hires the investigators to find the widow of their dead son, who vanished after quickly draining the substantial inheritance he left to provide for her. Their suspicion falls squarely on a \u201cso-called spirit medium\u201d, a charlatan they claimed was preying upon her deep grief. They soon learn she is not his only victim, but also discover a darker truth; that grief has a value all its own, one coveted by creatures beyond human understanding.\n\nSun and Shadow, by Walter Attridge\nInvestigators find themselves in North Queensland, Australia, delivering an exotic cargo to the owner of a major sugar plantation. The cargo of Cane Toads (the world\u2019s largest toad, native to South and Central America) could revolutionize pest control on his crops and increase his profit margins considerably. But his Aboriginal workers are deeply opposed to the plan, claiming that the interlopers would anger their gods. Things quickly spiral out of control when workers walk off the job and people begin to vanish. Can the investigators solve the mystery before it\u2019s too late?\n\n Cthulhu Invictus (Ancient Rome)\n The Expedition, by Morgan Llewellyn \nZosimos, are you sure you packed quite enough maps??\nThe investigators are hired to guards an expedition into the Arabian wilderness. Their employer seeks a newly discovered oasis rumored to contain a grove of wild Torchwood trees. As these trees are the source of both Frankincense and Myrrh, rare commodities worth more than their weight in gold, he is sure that untold riches are there for the taking. However, unbeknownst to anyone, this oasis has a dark and secret history, and the grove is far from undefended.\n\n Down Darker Trails (The Old West)\n A Lowdown Dirty Owlhoot, by William Adcock \nWhat manner of low down dirty owlhoot would go and hang a woman?\n The Colorado Territory is a good place for all sorts of bad people to vanish into. The investigators are hired by the good people of Milkweed City to hunt down a mysterious creature rumored to be responsible to for a string of deaths. Said to fly about at night and kill at will, the local papers call it \u201cThe Devil Buzzard.\u201d When investigators find a hanged woman, lefts for dead, with a story to tell, well, things get plumb loco.\n\n\nAbout Our Authors\nGolden Goblin Press and Shoggoth.net have pooled their contact lists, scoured the internet, and peaked behind every keeper screen in every convention across the universe, in a search for the best, brightest, and most creative new authors we could fine.

Note that the Ant-Man and Wasp Stretch Goals can only be found in the standard retail Core Box.\nWe will be offering backers the option to choose 2-Wave Expedited Shipping for their pledges! By selecting this option, we will separate your pledge into two shipping Waves. The First Wave will contain only the Marvel United: X-Men Core Box (however many copies you get) and it is estimated to deliver around September 2021, about the same time as the Core Box goes to retail. Then, the Second Wave will contain everything else in your pledge, including the box of Stretch Goals and all Optional Buys, and it is estimated to deliver around May 2022. Of course, by separating the shipping, the total cost of 2 different shipments will be charged, so by selecting this option you should notice an increase in your shipping cost and VAT if applicable. The finals costs will be calculated on the Pledg.it Pledge Manager system, however estimates for both waves are listed under 'Shipping Information'. Backers who select Single Wave Shipping will get their full pledge in the estimated May 2022 delivery date.\nPlease take note that once the system launches they'll also have different deadlines to confirm the pledges, with the Expedited shipment having a much earlier deadline. After the deadline to confirm the Expedited shipment pledges, all pledges (and extra pledges) containing the First Wave Core Box will be locked and will no longer be editable. However, everything related to the Second Wave will be editable up until the Second Wave deadline. This means that backers that confirm a 2-Wave Expedited Shipping order will still be able to add/remove pledges/add-ons related to the Second Wave after the First Wave deadline.\nNote: 2-Wave Expedited Shipping will not be available to backers in the UK.\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our Pledg.it pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nDepending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (European backers), UK (UK backers), Asia (Asian backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Mutant pledge, for a 1 or 2-wave shipment. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address and that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n>>> Note that, in compliance to the EU and UK laws, VAT will also be charged on the pledge manager system for EU and UK backers. At this time we cannot estimate the cost as the charges vary from country to country and it is based on the price of the order plus the actual shipping costs (which can only be properly determined in the system). However, rest assured that the full VAT to be charged on each pledge will be clearly displayed in the pledge manager system before final confirmation. European countries that are not part of the European Union or UK will not be charged VAT.\n**Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the Asia Hub at a later date, likely incurring increased shipping costs and possible customs fees. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, the content offered on Kickstarter. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.\n                                                          \u00a9 2021 MARVEL", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 48th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is May 2022, for single wave pledges, and for Expedited Shipment pledges, September 2021 and May 2022 for wave 1 and 2 respectively, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to the Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge in that system within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

On a mug. From the creator of Journal 29 and The Cypher Files.\n\nConundrumug is a portable, porcelain-like, escape room in a cup.\nIt is the perfect gift for the escape room fan in your life, and the best way to check if you are already awake at work.\n\nHOW TO USE CONUNDRUMUG\n1. Prepare beverage.\n2. Pour beverage into the mug.\n3. Solve the puzzles & reward yourself with a satisfying sip!\nThe Conundrumug comes in 2 editions, each with a unique puzzle.\nThe Butterfly is our flagship mug, an elegant and mysterious object.\nThe J29 is a special edition inspired by the Journal 29 books and the adventures found within.\n\nBoth editions of the Conundrumug are what you could definitely call large cups, intended to hold enough of what fuels you through a day of hard work - or a healthy amount of reading on a rainy day.\nThe Conundrumug has enough of a table presence not to be ignored, while still having the subtle touches of minimalist design that distinguishes the Journal 29 style.\nThe austere, line-drawing aesthetic invites curious looks and stimulates the mind even when not trying to solve the puzzles they form. Do not be surprised at co-workers trying to surreptitiously solve your Conundrumug while feigning disinterest...\nThe Conundrumug is a 15 oz (445 ml) ceramic mug, is fully machine washable, and its printing is made to last.\nEach edition contains 9 puzzles with solutions that combine to solve the overall puzzle.\nPlease, do not attempt to solve the puzzles while the mug contains potable substances.\nIt is compatible with every known variety of coffee, every cultivar of tea, and tested with a range of quality single malt and blended whisky.

It was a groundbreaking publication that created its own category of puzzle in printed form.\nWith 63 puzzles in 148 pages, you may have to do certain things you may not want to do to a book, in order to solve them. Unconventional thought is rewarded, and the fate of an expedition to solve an alien mystery is decided.\nThe first book was followed by Journal 29 Revelation, which added 57(+?) puzzles and continued the story of the expedition with another series of intriguing riddles to figure out and obstacles to overcome.\nHere is what people have to say about Journal 29:\nGoodreads - BGG - Escape the Review -  EscapeTalk - Watch it Paint it\nYou will be able to obtain copies of Journal 29 and Journal 29 Revelation by adding them on to your pledge in the post-campaign pledge management platform.\nFor more information on the books, please visit: Journal29.com\n\nShipping\nConundrumug will be packed in a cardboard box with transparent windows. It is going to be shipped in such a way as to preserve the structural integrity of the mug itself, rather than the packaging, with the intention of keeping overall weight (and by extension the shipping costs) to a minimum.\nBackers wishing to give the Conundrumug as a gift will be able to choose additional external protective packaging for a small fee in the post-campaign pledge manager.\nWe will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \nAdditional Items (e.g. more copies of Conundrumug, Journal 29 books, protective gift packaging) added on to your order in the pledge manager may incur additional shipping costs. You will be able to see all such costs before finalizing your order.\nSince we will only be charging cards for shipping & add-on costs before fulfillment begins, there will be plenty of time to modify your order. There will be backer updates and a final 48-hour notice before carts are locked and orders are charged.\nPlease note that Backers are responsible for any import fees, value-added taxes or other charges incurred in receiving Conundrumug to their location.\nNote that we can not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid.

With everyone vying for the same actions, players must time their use of proteins, hormones, and cell component cards in order to diversify their strategies and outplay the competition!\nCellulose is the sequel and counterpart to our 2017 release Cytosis (BGG). The two games have complementary themes and some familiar game systems, but Cellulose is a new standalone game that gives players greater control over available resources, strategic paths, and even the game length.\nFor each backer in the first 72 hours of the campaign, we're planting a tree! Our games use a lot of paper/cardboard/wood, and it takes a lot of energy to ship them around. We wanted to offset some of our production and have a backer bonus that wouldn't feel too bad to miss, so we're partnering with TreeSisters. They strategically plants trees to reforest areas where they're most needed to offset carbon, stabilize soil, and encourage biodiversity. They're very thoughtful about the best ways to do this, and we'd encourage you to check out their work. We plan to have an option to add more trees in the pledge manager.\n\nIn Cellulose, players compete over limited resources as they take advantage of powerful point-scoring combinations. They will race to build the cell wall, use hormones to signal plant growth for a steady source of water and CO2, and compete to contribute the most water to the cell\u2019s central vacuole. Once the cell wall is completely built, the game ends!\nEach round of Cellulose is one day played over three phases: Sunrise, Daytime, and Evening.\nSunrise Phase\nIn the Sunrise Phase, players collect resources and take bonus actions according to their markers on the plant board. Throughout the game, players will have the chance to use hormone signaling to advance along these tracks, earning additional benefits.\nDaytime Phase\nDuring the Daytime Phase, players take turns claiming the limited action spaces on the cell board in order to collect much-needed water and CO2, undergo photosynthesis in order to produce carbohydrates, and place carbohydrates into the cell wall, in cellulose form, to score points.\nPlayers may also acquire and play cell component cards, which grant them powerful bonuses.  Protein storage vacuoles immediately recover action markers, granting extra actions in the round. Enzymes allow chaining together bonus actions each time a new one is played. Specialization cards like hormone receptors create endgame scoring opportunities and special powers. \nEvening Phase\nIn the Evening, players recover their action markers, refresh the board, and build the next space on the cell wall.  Whoever has contributed the most water to the central vacuole will earn points and is given an additional action marker, which they can use in the following round.\nCheck out the draft rulebook for more gameplay information, or you can try Cellulose now on Tabletop Simulator \u2014 join our Discord Server to find a game!\n\nGenius Games creates games with compelling strategic gameplay and accurate science. We began designing Cellulose with careful research and modeling the major functions and tensions of plant cells: the scarcity trade-off of absorbing CO2 and losing water, the ability of plants to create their own food, and the growth cycles of a maturing plant. \nCellulose will include a \"Science Behind Cellulose\" booklet that describes key aspects of plant cell behavior and its relationship to Cellulose. You don't have to know any biology to play, but if you enjoy the game, we think you might enjoy the science as much as we have!\n\n\nCellulose includes an Automa Deck for solo play featuring a unique emerging strategy system, where the automated opponent will develop a responsive strategy over the game that determines how it plays. Some details in Update 6, with art to come!\nWe designed Cellulose to model some of the functions and tensions of plant cells in the context of the larger organism.  Scenarios tailor the story of your gameplay to different plant species with unique circumstances and adaptations.  Each Scenario will set realistic  conditions that push players to play in ways that parallel plant responses \u2014 while also creating exciting variations on how to play Cellulose.\nCellulose will initially include the Cactus scenario, showcasing how the Cactaceae family responds to sparse water availability: acquiring water is extra difficult, but using it well is very rewarding.\nWe hope to make more Scenarios available throughout the campaign.  If you have a great plant story to tell, get in touch! We\u2019re working on a couple ideas, but would love to work with your areas of study and expertise.\n\n\nShipping costs for each reward level and country are shown within each pledge level and will be charged with your pledge as soon as the campaign ends. The listed shipping charges are all subsidized to make it cheaper for you to get a copy of the game.  \nAll games pledged for during the campaign will be shipping from US, EU, UK, Canada, and Australia through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no additional import taxes for backers) to all countries in these regions. Sales Tax and VAT are included. \nPLEASE NOTE: Please note that any pledges not confirmed within 6 months from the time the campaign begins actual fulfillment may need to be sent outside of our normal fulfillment process, and so will incur increased costs, customs fees, and/or may receive the closest available product (if a limited print run is no longer available). No guarantees can be made concerning pledges not confirmed more than 6 months after the shipping begins.\nTo better serve backers in Asia, Middle East, Brazil, Africa and beyond, and help keep international shipping costs down, we are excited to be partnering with a number of local game stores throughout your regions with the help of VFI. We've been compiling a Directory of International Retailers who will be offering the game directly, with all Kickstarter options and stretch goals available here, during the normal fulfillment period. If you do not see your country listed among the shipping options, click here to contact VFI about about finding a participating store that's best for your region. You can also let your local game store know you're interested in preordering and have them contact VFI.\nMore science games are available through our website or at your local or online retailer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll projects have some level of risk, and ours is no different, particularly as the recent global pandemic has upset many aspects of the manufacturing and shipping industries.

We have accounted for current pre-production and manufacturing procedures, and think this is a goal we can achieve.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The acclaimed setting of Symbaroum has enticed and fascinated fans of tabletop roleplaying games since the launch of the game in 2016. Now this dark and mysterious world welcomes an even wider audience, with the production of a Player\u2019s Guide, Gamemaster\u2019s Guide and Bestiary adapted for 5E, published under the Open Gaming License. Note that you will need the core 5E rulebooks to fully enjoy Ruins of Symbaroum.\nWelcome to the world of Symbaroum\n\nThe rich and nuanced Symbaroum setting revolves around the Ambrians \u2013 a civilization that two decades ago were forced to flee their ancestral soil after a devastating war. Their new and promised land borders on the vast forest of Davokar, covering the remnants of the Empire of Symbaroum which fell into ruin hundreds of years ago. Brimming with natural resources and mythical treasures, the forest calls out to the Ambrians to be explored and plundered, but the road into its depths lays far from open. Not only are the shadows beneath the foliage fraught with danger, monsters and infectious Corruption; there are also the elves of the Iron Pact who have vowed to die to keep anyone from disturbing the ruins of old, warning that the ancient evil of Symbaroum stirs in its sleep. \nAbout ten years ago, Queen Korinthia of the Ambrians finally vanquished Chieftan Haloban and his Jezites.\nNow you can join in the adventure! Seek out the barbarian clans to trade or to plunder their treasuries; establish a base of power among princes, guilds, or rebellious refugees in the capital city of Yndaros; survive encounters with trolls, dark-minded beasts, and undead warlords. But always remember the warnings spoken by the wardens of the forest: tread carefully and do not disturb the ruins of old, for the horrors of Davokar are about to awaken!\nIf you want a more in-depth introduction to the setting, download On the Nature of Davokar - a report from a lecture at the wine cellar Tuvinels in Yndaros.\n\n220+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters\nAside from the base core rules referenced in the 5E OGL, the Ruins of Symbaroum Player\u2019s Guide contains everything you need to create characters and set out to explore the world of Symbaroum. We provide this information in five major sections: an introduction to the setting, new rules for gameplay, new character origins, new character classes and feats, and a set of resources (equipment, spells, etcetera) for making characters and for use during play.\n\nNew Rules \nTo emphasize the dark fantasy nature of the setting, new rules for traveling and rests, social challenges, and magic are introduced. Regarding magic, wielders of mystical powers cannot avoid being affected by the ever-present threat of Corruption \u2014 the gathering of darkness to each character\u2019s Shadow which, if left untended, can manifest as terrible physical transformations and even the eventual loss of the character entirely, as Corruption consumes them mentally and physically.\n\nNew Origins\nAside from familiar folks such as humans, elves, and dwarves, the Symbaroum game world lets you create PCs and NPCs who are changelings, ogres, goblins, trolls and even a particular form of undead. Also, the more recognizable folks differ quite radically from what you would expect \u2013 for instance, in Symbaroum the elves (rather than orcs, trolls, or similar) could be described as the default enemy of adventurers and explorers.\nIn Ruins of Symbaroum, character Backgrounds are generally tied to Origins. The following Origins and Backgrounds are included in the Player's Guide: \nOrigins: Human (clanfolk), Dwarf, Elf and Troll\nNew Classes\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Player\u2019s Guide presents the classes Captain, Hunter, Mystic, Scoundrel and Warrior \u2013 each with between four and seven different approaches (called Subclasses in the 5E OGL rules), and all of them with customized features up to the 20th level. The captain class is something special, as its members have the capability to command and train others, to improve the fighting ability of a group as a whole. \nApproaches: Ironsworn, Rune Smith, Weapon Master and Sorcerer\nThe graphic design of Ruins of Symbaroum borrows elements from the award-winning design of the original Symbaroum game.\nBoth these spreads are drafts (works-in-progress) from the Ruins of Symbaroum Player's Guide.\n\n200+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters; NOTE: the cover art is a placeholder and will be replaced.\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Gamemaster\u2019s Guide provides tools and guidelines for running the game, developing the setting and creating your own adventures. The content may be summarized as follows:\n\nInvoking Symbaroum\n Gamemaster\u2019s Rules \u2013 on Ability Checks, Combat and Challenge Ratings, Time Within the Game, and Shadow and Corruption.\n The Setting \u2013 describes three settlements central to the setting: Thistle Hold, the town of explorers and treasure hunters; Yndaros, the capital city of the kingdom of Ambria; and Karvosti, the cliff of the barbarian High Chieftain deep inside the forest of Davokar.\nRunning Ruins of Symbaroum\n Building Game Worlds \u2013 guidelines on how to understand and develop the specific game world of Symbaroum.\n Adventures and Landscapes \u2013 instructions on creating adventures and adventure landscapes where the PCs dictate the course and outcome of the story.\n Chronicles \u2013 tips on how to design an adventure chronicle (also called campaign or adventure path) set in the world of Symbaroum.\n Magical Items and Artifacts \u2013 a huge number of mystical artifacts that all come with ready-made adventure hooks, as well as guidelines on how to create mystical artifacts of your own.\nOptional Rules\n\n200+ pages, full color, hardback, sewn and glued spine, size 8.5 x 11 inches / 216 x 279 millimeters; NOTE: the cover art is a placeholder and will be replaced.\nThe Ruins of Symbaroum Bestiary is in most respects a reflection of the award-winning Symbaroum Monster Codex, but with stats and rules adapted for 5E \u2013 the difference being that it also includes the monsters and adversaries featured in the Symbaroum Core Rulebook.\n\nHordes of the Eternal Night\nTwenty-seven original creatures that haunt, roam and wreak havoc on the world of Symbaroum.\nEach creature come with full color art, lore, an adventure Set-up and between one and four variants with different stat blocks\nBeasts & Monsters\nApproximately sixty creatures presented with shorter descriptions and stat blocks\nSorted into categories, such as Abominations, Predators, Spiders, Undead and Winged Creatures\n\nAdversaries\nApproximately seventy types of cultural beings presented with shorter descriptions and stat blocks\nSorted into categories, such as Champions of Prios, Elves, Outcasts, People of Davokar, Townsfolk and Trolls\nThe abominations of Davokar come in different shape and sizes...\n\nTo celebrate that the world of Symbaroum is finally coming to 5E, we're delighted to offer an unique Collector\u2019s Edition of the three main books, invluded in the pledge level Conqueror of Symbaroum. These deluxe tomes are bound in faux leather with gold foil-stamped adornments. The Collector's Edition is exclusive to this Kickstarter and will never be printed again. \n\nWe love friendly local gaming stores and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies each of the three main books, at a discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the books on time for the official release, and you get them at a lower cost than through most normal distribution channels.

We will collect this via our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers, as shipping is rarely one size fits all. Here is a list of rough shipping estimates:\nBrexit, Imports & More: We will ship from at least three local hubs: UK, US, and EU. That means that if you're in any of these regions, there will be no import fees for you. We might be able to set up a hub in Australia as well, but we cannot guarantee it yet.\nUnfortunately, import laws and customs in some specific countries have made it impossible for us to ship to them. We do not ship to: Belarus, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, South Africa and Afghanistan.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done many successful kickstarters and have solid experience in the field.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sidequest Decks are system agnostic tabletop RPG plot outlines & maps. They  are perfect to pull out when your players unexpectedly take a casual  comment for a story hook and you need an adventure idea, or for planning  what dangers lurk in your kingdom. You may even chain several together for an entire campaign!\nEach poker-sized card has a map on one side and a mini-adventure outline on the other side. The outline starts with a short description for the GM.  (Skim these to find an adventure that fits the circumstances.) Choose  between a couple of story hooks to get the adventure started. Next several encounter ideas move the game along. Customize them to match what your players do (drop some, change them to fit circumstances). Finally each card wraps up with one or two follow-up adventure ideas.\nWe've made 11 of these decks over the past few years, and now we're planning four more:\nStretch Goals\nFriendly Shipping\nWe have friendly shipping for the US, Canada, EU, UK, Australia, and NZ thanks to distributors in those countries. See \"Shipping\" below for details.\nMore About Each New Deck\nOver 50 cards of Monster Hunts & Lairs!  While  each will have a couple of unique ways to get the adventure going, these will also have a couple of cards dedicated to which creatures provide what magical effects (sorted by power/challenge) when crafting  magic items or powerful spells.  So if the characters plan to create an item that confers increased flight and regeneration, you'll have a couple of quests to find creatures with those abilities. Each sidequest card will also suggest alternate monsters for the adventure.\nThe Coastal Town Sidequest Deck has 51 mini-adventures designed to play out in a fantasy coastal area, with the adventure outline on one side and a relevant map on the other. The quests center on several VIPs in town who need help with various enterprises as well as threats off the coast & nearby caves. While the sidequests can stand on their own, they are also tailored to match the Coastal Townsfolk NPC Portraits Deck. Each numbered sidequest could involve an NPC of the same number in the NPC deck (though the sidequests do not mention them by name, so you can substitute in your own NPCs). The NPC decks are available as add-ons through this Kickstarter, see below.\nWe also made a deck of Frontier/Mining Townsfolk NPC deck in a previous project. Like the Coastal Town Quests deck, these mini-adventures use the characters from the frontier townsfolk deck, but they aren't required--fill in your own locations and characters as desired. The quests in this deck focus on the mines & a cult near town as well as several tasks key residents need help performing.\nThese 50+ sidequests focus on historical mysteries and lost artifacts of the real world. Perfect for a campaign of tomb raiding or following up on lost crusades.  While most are set in the first half of the 1900s, as outlines they are easy to move to other time periods or even different worlds & genres.\nVirtual Table Top Maps\nYou'll also get PNG versions of any maps we create so you can easily share them with your players--or print larger versions.  For example, we make any battlemats at a scale of 75 pixels per square.\nSamples\nTroll Stew, card 14 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nSummoning Gone Awry! card 08 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nBy The Rockets Red Glare, card 23 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Mummy Menace, card 36 from the Monster Hunts Sidequest Deck\nThe Price of Power, card 14 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nPocket Full of Trouble, card 18 from the Coastal Town Sidequest Deck\nStuffed to the Gills, card 28 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nLoot Tunnels, card 33 from the Frontier Town Sidequest Deck\nReviews\n\"If you are a game facilitator that enjoys creating within a confined  space, I think these products will appeal to you. The outlines are  enough to keep you moving forward for a night of play but have enough  room to add your own traps, puzzles, monsters, or mechanical widgets  that I feel they can make for a comfortable backboard to bounce ideas  against.\" --Gnome Stew\n\"On each of these cards you\u2019ll find what you need to fuel a session,  if not several\u2013it\u2019s not every day you can get a year\u2019s worth of  adventure ideas in a single box\" --Bell of Lost Souls \n\"Highly recommend checking them out... If your players need a break from the main story line of your campaign, give these Sidequest Decks a show.\" --A Pawn's Perspective\nPrior Sidequest Decks\nThe prior Sidequest Decks are:\nAfter the TPK (Total Party Kill) - Ideas for the afterlife and how the party may return to the world.\nArcane Academy - Adventures centered on a magic school, for kid characters or adults.\nDungeons, Caverns, & Ruins Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in those settings.\nHigh Seas, Pirates, & Ports - Fantasy & pirate adventures on the seas or port cities.\nHorror Fantasy - Fantasy adventures with undead/necromancy themes.\nLovecraftian/Paranormal - Adventure outlines based on story seeds left behind by Lovecraft and other paranormal stories.\nModern (Criminals, Spies, & Supers) - Quests that take place in the modern day with mafia, spy, and super-hero themes.\nPolitical & Urban Fantasy - Fantasy adventures in town and cities as well as political plots.\nScience Fantasy - Adventures inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth, Thundarr the Barbarian, etc.\nScience Fiction - Adventures set in the far future.\nWilderness & Frontier Fantasy - Fantasy adventures set in the wilderness or villages.\nAnd as mentioned above the two Town Sidequest decks are related to our prior NPC Sidequest Decks Kickstarter, but they aren't essential if you plan to fit them into your own towns and NPCs.  If you wish to get the NPC Decks as part of this Kickstarter, they are available as add-ons. For that Kickstarter, we made the following NPC Decks:\nAdventurers\nAnimals (Companions, Familiars, etc.)\nCoastal Townsfolk\nFrontier Townsfolk\nHenchmen & Hirelings\nYou can pick any of the above NPC decks as add-ons, but only the Coastal & Frontier Townsfolk are related to the new Sidequest Decks. \nAnd if you don't want to wait to get our prior decks, the Sidequest Decks and the NPC Decks are all available in our store now.\nPledging\nWhile we've set up rewards for one deck (or PDF), four decks, 10 decks, and 15 decks, you can pick any number of decks by adding more via add-ons.  For example, if you want 6 decks, pledge for four, then as you make your pledge you'll be asked if you want any add-ons.  Pick two more.  You'll also be able to add more via the pledge manager later but pledging during the Kickstarter helps us hit our goal & stretch goals. You'll pick which specific decks you want via the pledge manager.\nShipping\nWe're working with a company that has fulfillment centers located in the US, Canada, the EU, and Australia to minimize shipping fees for most backers.\nWe'll charge for shipping through the Pledge Manager which allows us to have more detail on the shipping rates.  After some recent kerfuffles with international shipping, we've decided to partner with another company to do fulfillment in order to make sure we have friendly shipping rates for the EU, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and of course the USA.  While we'll ship elsewhere, postage rates to other locations may be high. Here are our ballpark shipping rates, which do include VAT (money amounts in US dollars) where applicable:\nUSA: Flat $6 (any number of decks)\nUK: 1 deck $13, 4 decks $17, 10 decks: $29, 15 decks: $35\nEU: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $22, 10 decks: $34, 15 decks: $40\nCanada: 1 deck $16, 4 decks $19, 10 decks: $30, 15 decks: $35\nAustralia: Flat $20, due to their low VAT and shipping.\nNew Zealand: 1 deck $25, 4 decks $30, 10 decks: $40, 15 decks: $50\nOf course, if rates go up, VAT changes, etc., we'll have to pass that on.\nCollaborators\nWe're blessed to work with a great team of innovative RPG creators:\nAaron Canton: Aaron is a professional writer who specializes in writing fantasy and science-fiction works, and has created content for a variety of literary universes,  role-playing games, and works of interactive fiction. \nKeith Curtis: Keith has done about half of the Cartography on our prior Sidequest Decks.  He has also done work for many other game companies, including work on the Babylon 5 d20 RPG, the Song of Ice & Fire RPG, and the updated 5e Keep on the Borderlands.\nMisha Handman: Misha is a professional novelist and gaming writer who lives in the  Pacific Northwest. He has contributed to several earlier Sidequest decks, as well as work for White Wolf Publications and UFO Press. He is  proud to be the only person with his name on the Internet.\nJosh Parry: Josh is a freelance TTRPG author who has worked with Nord Games and LoreSmyth as well as his own self-published titles on Itch.io and the DMs Guild. \nAndrew Shields: Andrew has worked on our NPC Decks and our system neutral creature cards.  He has his own publishing imprint called Fictive Fantasies and has worked for a number of other RPG publishers.\nJoe Wetzel: Owner of Inkwell Ideas, Joe will manage the project, write some of the adventures, make some of the maps, and pick up anything else that needs doing.\nAnd we're helped by Backer Kit:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our 18th Kickstarter in 10 full years!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "One's a real straight shooter. The other's a total wild card. But on the case, chasing down the murderer...they are always Partners.\n\nPartners is a totally unique new storytelling game for exactly two players. A love letter to the police procedural and mystery of the week television genre, players take the roles of detectives hot on a murder case each session of play. Not only are you playing the two irascible, ill-matched detectives, you'll also play their boss, their subordinates and other familiar roles of mystery television. All you need is this PDF and a single pack of regular playing cards.\nInterior art example. Final product may change.\nNever seen any crime TV shows? No problem: the system does all the work. In a new twist on most detective games, instead of players trying to uncover a plot created by a GM, random card draws slowly reveal which suspects are in play and what kind of clues they provide. Only when the final card is drawn in the final scene will the detectives - and the players - know who did it.  The game is designed to suit experienced roleplayers and crime fiction addicts as well as novices to either.  The literary focus also means it works perfectly as a shared journaling game, or for play across internet video chat.\n  Multi-award-winning game designer Steve Dee has been developing the game for over two years. The rules are written, the art is done and the PDF is ready to be sent out as soon as we fund. The last step that brings us to Kickstarter is turning it into a gorgeous fully-illustrated 140 page paperback, designed to look just like an old mystery novel. \nThe Book\nPartners is like no other RPG, so we want it to look like no other RPG as well. The book is a paperback designed to look like it was lifted straight from the 1980s pulp mysteries it emulates - without the actual low budget. 140 pages of text have been gorgeously laid-out in this evocative style by Matt Roberts, who won critical acclaim for his work on our previous RPG Relics. Complimenting this is the stylish pen and ink art by Kristopher Neal McClanahan throughout. Deep but economically written, it is a hefty tome of crime-busting storytelling tools that also fits in your pocket. The only other thing you need to play is a regular pack of cards. \nFinal Artwork May Change\nHow to Play\nOver the history of roleplaying games, designers have taken one of two approaches to mystery solving: either the GM knows the solution and must lead the players to it, or the players collectively come up with something plausible and the GM approves it. Partners instead builds a game where players discover the secrets through random card draws, then determine how and why they matter through their own invention. You won't tell the GM you'll head to the police station to check if any of the suspects have a criminal record in the hope that provides a lead, but rather be informed (for example) that the next clue lies in the criminal record, and which suspect it is about, then work together to describe the scene of how the information is procured, and exactly what it entails. \nThe prompts are drawn from random card draws that cross-reference several interwoven tables, combined with random word generation. Players then work together to turn the prompts into scenes and plots, with a few wrinkles thrown in if they are the Wild Card or the Straight Shooter. \nExample: Drawing a three of spades tells the players that the next scene is going to involve a suspect they have determined is a long time friend of the victim, who has a motive of \"Escape\", and that the evidence coming in will be fingerprints or DNA. A random word prompt gives the word \"trip\". The detectives decide that some blood is found at the scene that doesn't belong to the victim but the long time friend. They insist it was from an accident where they tripped one day and fell on a knife. It sounds fishy. The friend hides their eyes. Are they ashamed of what really happened? Is the friendship abusive?\nThis \"journaling\" structure makes the game half roleplaying game, half script-writing exercise, so it is perfect for writers as well as roleplayers. It also means it can be played easily online, both over Zoom or through email or text chat. All you need is one other player.\nYou can read a review of the beta rules or listen to one here, on Inside the Caravan.\nEDIT: Another review just came in! And another!  And this one. And one more right on the wire!\nAnd a video review from Jenders Gaming. And you can see an amazing playthrough by the Boredom Breakers. That playthrough starts with the show already made but here's a look at how shows are built from Sam and Jamie. \n\nWait, Only Two Players?\nPartners is designed for just two players, but like all good games it comes with options. It can be played with one, or up to six players. No GM is required.\n\nStretch Goals\nFor Stretch Goals, we'd love to bring extra modules to help you explore different subgenres of mystery! These are called Files, and will be short sharp digital documents that give new tables for suspects, motives and clues so the genre is modelled precisely. The assumption of the core game is modern day Law and Order style cops but there is so much more we can do!\nBackers at the digital level and above will get all achieved stretch goals!\n$8000 - The Teatime File - UNLOCKED!\nLike your mysteries solved by ladies of a certain age, be they Miss Marple, Jessica Fletcher, Precious Rambotswe or the ladies of Brindlewood Bay? Or just anyone who enjoys nice cups of tea and a bit fewer less blood-stained bathrooms? This is for you.\n$10000 - The Noir File - UNLOCKED!\nListen up, flatfoots. This city is a powder keg and when it blows, you better hope you're not tied to the barrel. These mean streets have a different kind of mystery; black and white on the surface but underneath nothing but shades of grey. \n$12000 - The Junior Detective File - UNLOCKED!\nNancy Drew, The Hardy Boys, Encyclopedia Brown, the Famous Five - the best detectives are always the young. Nobody pays attention to them but they see everything. This expansion lets you play with young players, great for kids to learn to write stories!\n$14000 - The Sherlock Holmes File - UNLOCKED!\nThe once and future king of the mystery genre is also the undisputed master of being the annoying Wild Card. And he remains the most represented character on film or TV by miles. We keep coming back to Sherlock, so let's make sure we do the original with style. \n$16000 - The Conspiracy File - UNLOCKED!\nEverything is connected. Nothing is true. Around every corner, someone is watching. This is not just unravelling a murder, but peeling back the layers, all of them, back to the shadowy grey puppet masters who control everything. A different kind of mystery...\n$18000 - The Cyber File - UNLOCKED!\nThe streets shine with neon and chrome. The world has changed, but crime is still the same, even if you can back up your brain online, robots can remember everything you ever said and corporations track your every move. The criminals just got smarter, so the detectives have to be smarter still.\n$20000 - The Eldritch File\nSomething is wrong here. The crime scene is a study in emerald. The witnesses saw something move like no living creature. The shadows hide more than just murderers but horrors few can bear to see. Will you solve the mystery if it costs you your very soul?\nAnd more to come!\nFulfillment and Postage\nOn this and future products, Tin Star Games is proud to announce our association with  Ink and Gumption.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker.

Due to start a year-long world tour, they left their family, fans and sizeable fortunes behind. Clues about their disappearance have started to be identified in their tour brochures and prolific output by their fans, some of whom want the truth revealed and others who are determined to keep it buried.\nA secret behind the band's success.\n A secret which would ruin them if it was revealed. \nA secret that the die-hard fans would do anything to protect from being revealed.\nThe Ashwell project came from a belief that puzzles with a narrative held more depth and interest for players. The Ashwell Tour Brochure is a professionally-designed and beautifully printed realisation of this belief. With a real-world reveal, the puzzles combine maths, logic, wordplay and decoding.\nBehind beautiful but innocuous pages lie puzzles and secrets.\nPlayers can also continue the story with their own fanzine, using our keepsake elements booklet and hand bound notebook. We want the answers to the brochure puzzle to be the stepping stones for the next part of the story. We have three possible storylines for creators to adapt, or you can generate your own - we would be delighted with either.\nUse Ashwell Keepsake Elements to create a fanzine, a continuation story, a springboard for the puzzle investigation. Let your creativity explore all bounds.\nAll physical rewards feature the full colour, glossy print tour brochure, professionally litho printed on 130gsm coated paper. An accompanying Hints App will help you along the way should you need a guiding hand.  \nThere is a puzzle on almost every page, with each directly leading to a clue in the meta puzzle. You will require an internet connection for the final solution, but should be able to solve all the puzzles leading up to the final meta puzzle without one.  We don't want to give anything more away, but they range from the easy to the very hard. We estimate the game play time to be 1.5 - 3 hours, dependent on your puzzle experience and hint use.\nAlso available is a booklet of additional logos, images and mini puzzles for you to use to create your own keepsake fanzine. \nUse it to create a diary of solving the puzzles, logging the mysteries, or even continuing the story further. We have created  three possible future storylines for those who would like them, but would be enormously excited to see which other directions players may take the story.\n\nWe are  offering the option of buying an exclusive handbound A5 Notebook in which you can create your fanzine as part of the package. This uses high quality recycled cartridge paper, and is hand sewn with a fabric binding for a secure fit and beautiful finish.\nShould you wish to become part of the tour crew and have your name in the publication, this limited reward is also available. If you really want to indulge yourself, you can even become part of the band! Included with this limited option is to have a significant date added to the tour dates list. An amazing birthday/wedding/anniversary present!\nWe have been so supported by the puzzle community that we have avoided spending any money at all on advertising. Instead, we are ring-fencing this money, and will  use it to support a fledgling puzzle project. At \u00a35,000, we will put \u00a3250 into this pot - enough for a puzzle startup to get some printed samples, carry out some product research, commission a designer. More details after the campaign, but this will be offered to anyone who has pledged for a physical product in this campaign, and will operate by application. If you have any thoughts on this, please do message us, and we will build up a FAQ in response!\nWe are The Escapages, writers and publishers of Escape Puzzle Games. We successfully funded Flatpak in 2019 (a puzzle book disguised as a furniture catalogue) and Full Deck in 2020 (a three-book serial killer and crime board collection), and this is the first of our Kickstarters for 2021. Both the brochure and hints app have been fully play tested.\nThis project was created by Stephen, one half of the Escapages, after a conversation with his music-mad son during a woodland walk in lockdown. It mixes high production values, music, puzzles, keepsakes, journaling, scrapbooking and a real-life event which has seemingly been hidden under the fiction radar!\nHere are some lovely comments from some of our play testers:\nDespite everything being essentially ready for print, the current climate makes us cautious to promise anything too quickly.

REACHED!\n\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY needs your help to print our new story, THE BOOK OF DEMONS (41 page story in a 48 page perfect bound book) and produce our NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN!\nHere's our cover:\n\nWho will love Boston Metaphysical Society?\nFans of Penny Dreadful, Girl Genius, Ruse, steampunk and gaslamp fantasy stories.\nPeople who like to read paranormal, historical fiction, and/or alternate history.\nIf you like character-driven comics with a mix of paranormal and science fiction, then these are the comics for you!\nTHE STORY\nWhen Erin, Caitlin\u2019s mother, discovers her daughter can control a demon, she is outraged. In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages. With art by Emily Hu and coloring by Gloria Caeli, the story is set at the beginning of the House Wars (my version of the American Civil War) and features the crew of a prototype airship.  I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content. Includes illustrations of  Samuel, Granville, Caitlin, Tesla, Houdini, and more! It will be an 8  1/2 x 11 book and is suitable for all ages. Art by Alejandro Lee\nOTHER REWARDS\nIn addition to THE BOOK OF DEMONS, we are offering the trade paperback, the anthology Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude, the first novel set in this universe, Boston Metaphysical Society: A Storm of Secrets, plus a NEW PLAGUE DOCTOR LAPEL PIN. It is 1 inch in diameter and will be an antique bronze color.

(As long as supplies last.)\nBOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS\nThe award winning novel, BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY: A STORM OF SECRETS, is a prequel to the original graphic novel though it can be read as a standalone. It takes place five years prior to the original series.\nIt was awarded a Silver Medal as well as The Write Companion Award for Best Overall TOP PICK - Adult, Children's and Young Adult categories in the 2019 Feathered Quill Book Awards.\nStory: As the Great Houses of Boston jockey for power, an ex-Pinkerton detective, his psychic wife, and his father-in-law must contend with treachery, subterfuge, and a new supernatural threat, in this political and supernatural thriller set in an alternate-history Boston of 1890.\nThe award winning cover is by Luisa Preissler. Title Graphics by Anke Koopman.\n\nAnd if you haven't read Boston Metaphysical Society: Prelude yet, then this would be the perfect time to get it. This anthology of short stories and novellas includes stories of how Granville and Samuel met and their first case together; what set Caitlin on her path; and how Samuel met his wife, Elizabeth Weldsmore Hunter. Several reward tiers  include it as either a pdf or print version.\nThe Underground - A Boston Metaphysical Society Short Story (Available as an Add-on for all tiers and is already included in the Granville Woods and All Things BMS tiers.) \nIn The Underground,  Andrew O'Sullivan takes his young daughter, Caitlin, on a case that might reveal a past and a potential future neither of them expected. This is a prose story and is available in Epub or mobi formats. (Previously published in Last Stop on the #13.)\nNEW REWARD TIER!\nSPECIAL COMMISSION REWARD TIER (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE)\nEver wanted to time travel?

My stalwart shipping envelopes met their match at USPS, so this year I will be using the ULINE S-165 cardboard mailers (or their equivalent) along with boards and extra packing material for anything outside of California (and probably in California as well.) Those who order the Nothing But Books and All Things BMS will get the usual sturdy cardboard box as those have worked well in the past.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING: We were able to obtain discounted international postage for over 55 countries this year. I have passed on those savings to you depending on your shipping address. To extend these savings even further, for those who pledge to the Nothing But Books or the All Things BMS, and it is shipped to one of those 55 countries, we will be splitting up the rewards into two boxes in order for you to receive the discount. \nTHE TEAM FOR THE SEQUELS:\nMadeleine Holly-Rosing - Writer/Creator: A   TV, feature film, comic book writer, and novelist, Madeleine holds an   MFA in Screenwriting from UCLA where she won numerous awards as well as  the Sloan Fellowship.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story. And you can't tell an  American story without including women and  people of color.\nIt has been and always will be important to me to write characters  who, though they come from diverse backgrounds and have different  points  of view, are able to work together for the common good.\nADD-ONS\nI have decided not to use the option of Kickstarter add-ons during this campaign, though I will be using Backerkit when I send out the surveys if you'd like to add anything to your pledge.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $5,700 - (KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE) **REACHED!**\nBackers who have pledged $10 or more to a physical reward will  receive  this wonderful 8 1/2 x 11 inch print on 10 pt. cardstock gloss  by the  amazing Ashley Woods. \nAshley has worked for Marvel, Dark Horse, IDW, and Stranger Comics (Niobe).

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition\n\nA mad scientist holds the whole world hostage with his doomsday device. A self-aware AI in a massive robotic form rampages through major cities, bent on the destruction of all human life. A chaotic earth spirit uses her control over the natural elements of the world to threaten all of humanity! A superpower supremacist leads her army of powerful followers to defeat any who would oppose her goal of global conquest! Only a few stalwart Heroes stand in the way of all these Villains and their dastardly plots!\nThese stories and more all come from the pages of Sentinel Comics, and in Sentinels of the Multiverse, you play out those stories! You and your friends take control of an array of powerful Heroes, standing resolute in the face of danger to protect the world. Can you defeat the Villains and save the world? Or will the Villains triumph, forcing the Heroes to regroup and fight another day?\nSentinels of the Multiverse is back, and better than ever! With all-new art, notably streamlined mechanics, and new stories to experience, this is the award-winning cooperative comic-book card game you\u2019ve been waiting for!\nWe want this Kickstarter campaign to be as streamlined and efficient as the gameplay of this Definitive Edition of Sentinels of the Multiverse! There are only two pledge levels: 1) get the game, and 2) get the game and sleeves for every card in it. That\u2019s it. Easy-peasy. With both pledge levels, you get a shiny set of foil cards for each of the character cards in the game! You could look at it as getting the $60 core game for $49, plus a $20 pack of foil hero character cards, villain character cards, and event cards for just $1! Also, you get the game/sleeves cheaper than it\u2019ll be at retail, and it\u2019ll get shipped to you before anyone or anywhere else!\nLet\u2019s talk about Stretch Goals: we\u2019re not doing them! This campaign is about making the best version of Sentinels that we can. The Definitive version, if I may. So, this means we\u2019ve known 100% of what\u2019s going into it for months. No matter how massive this campaign gets (fingers crossed!) there are no stretch goals, because every dollar of this campaign goes to creating these games and sleeves, printing them, and shipping them to you!\nThere are Add-Ons available as part of this campaign. They\u2019re for the same stuff as the two pledge levels: extra copies of the core game, and more sleeves! Every copy of the core game comes with a pack of the foil cards, so that's already built into that add-on. And the set of sleeves is the same as the one that's part of the pledge level!\nSo, if you want more of any of those things, add them in the Add-Ons section when you back the campaign. Straightforward as can be!\nSentinels of the Multiverse is a cooperative game in which each player controls a Hero, using their powers, abilities, and wits to work together with their fellow Heroes and save the world!\nEach game involves three to five Heroes fighting against one Villain in a perilous Environment. The game is fully cooperative, so the Villain and Environment aren\u2019t run by a dedicated player, but rather are controlled by turning over cards from their decks and following the instructions on those cards.\nEach Hero, Villain, and Environment are represented by a deck of cards. Heroes and Villains also have character cards, which provide their Hit Points and other information specific to that character.\nThe game starts with the Villain turn, then each of the Heroes in turn order clockwise around the table. The round ends with the Environment turn. After the Environment turn, repeat the round, starting with the Villain turn! The game continues in this order until the Heroes save the Multiverse, or the Villain defeats the meddling Heroes, one way or another.\nIn updates to this campaign, we go more in-depth on the contents of the box, but know that this core game comes with a TON of content, including:\n12 Heroes (Here's an update all about Heroes!)\n6 Villains (This update is all about Villains!)\n6 Environments (Look! An update about Environments!)\n12 Hero Variant cards & 12 Event cards (An update about Variants and Events!)\nDivider cards for each deck\nA Rulebook AND a Lore Book! (Here's the entire Rulebook!)\nHP spinners & Tracking Tokens (Even an update about components?!)\nAnd a dedicated token box!\nHey, folks! Christopher Badell here. I\u2019m the designer of Sentinels of the Multiverse and the writer of Sentinel Comics. In 2010, Adam Rebottaro (the artist for everything Sentinel Comics \u2014 you heard that right: Adam did 100% of the art you see in this campaign and this game!) and I had an idea for how to make the game we always wanted to play. A cooperative card game about comic books; about costumed heroes with powers and abilities working together against far greater threats than any of the heroes could handle on their own, but by working together, they could overcome. A game based in a vibrant world that represented many decades of comic book history, full of rich and dynamic environments that themselves played a part in the gameplay. This game was Sentinels of the Multiverse. We had a very ambitious idea of what this game could be, but part of that ambition did not involve what sort of product the game might be. Even when we teamed up with my friend Paul Bender \u2014 who is now the CEO of Greater Than Games \u2014 to create a company and publish this game, none of us really knew just how big this game could grow, or what this game could end up meaning to so many people.\nOver a decade later, we have a bit better of an idea. The Sentinels of the Multiverse core game and many expansions have sold hundreds of thousands of copies around the world, won numerous awards, and inspired countless fan art, fanfiction, and scores of cosplayers. The world of Sentinel Comics has taken many forms, including a variety of board games, a hit podcast, and a recently released roleplaying game. But, even still, the most popular thing to come out of Sentinel Comics is the first thing: the Sentinels of the Multiverse card game.\nWe created Sentinels of the Multiverse over ten years ago, and we have learned a LOT since then. I\u2019m a better writer and designer than I was then, Adam is a far better artist, and Greater Than Games is significantly better at making quality products. We have a bigger and better team than ever before. The original version of Sentinels was entirely made by me and Adam just at the start of our careers working in games, and it shows. And yet, it\u2019s still one of our top selling games. It deserves another look \u2014 a new, more polished, more definitive edition.\nAnd that brings us here, to the Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter campaign! If you\u2019re familiar with Sentinels, this is certainly still the game that you recognize, but cleaned up and improved in just about every way. All of the art is brand new. The writing and game design have both been stripped down to their core elements and rebuilt better and cleaner than before \u2014 the game plays more swiftly and smoothly now, and everything happening on the table is communicated in a way that keeps the players engaged, and the action moving forward. All of the graphic design is significantly improved, thanks to the expertise of our graphic designers, Rae Henderson and Darrell Louder. And the polish on the game shines brightly, thanks to the development and playtesting help of our Game Developer Manager Chris Burton and quite a few playtesters. We started working on this game in early 2020, and most of the last half of the year was spent in intensive playtesting to make sure this is the best version of Sentinels of the Multiverse that anyone has ever seen.\nIs this game for you? Only you can decide! Hopefully the information in this campaign, the updates we\u2019ll post over the course of it, and the helpful words from our playtesters (in the Testimonials section below) will give you some useful information. Plus, we\u2019re offering a money-back guarantee \u2014 if you get it and you don\u2019t like it, send it back and we\u2019ll fully refund you. See more in the Money-Back Guarantee section, below. But first! Here are some video and audio recordings that might further convince you, in our own words!\nI was very recently interviewed by Trevor, the A/V mastermind for GTG and producer of The Letters Page Podcast about just what all this is about:\nTrevor also interviewed me and Adam on the Greater Than Games podcast, which you can listen to here!\nAlso, a couple weeks ago, we played a game of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition online using Tabletop Simulator to introduce the game to our friends Patrick Leder and Stras Acimovic. Want to see how it went, and what they thought? Check it out!\nWe spent the second half of 2020 and the first couple months of 2021 heavily playtesting all of the Definitive Edition material. Going into that process, a lot of our playtesters had a wide variety of opinions... and those opinions evolved significantly over the course of playtesting! Here are some of their thoughts:\n\n\"I was skeptical when I first heard about Sentinel of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition. I had already put hundreds of hours into both the physical and digital versions of the current game and didn\u2019t think any small improvements could justify the costs of buying it all over again. But then I played it, and now I\u2019m a believer. Omnitron feels more like Omnitron as he relentlessly builds up and then inevitably eradicates you. Bunker feels more like Bunker as his modes come and go and he maintains his various ordnances while scouring the field in fire. Megalopolis feels more like megalopolis as you scramble to keep a lid on the everyday emergencies popping up while the villain attacks. Playing against villains using their events rules feels like an entirely new game without greatly increasing the complexity, while critical events bring out mind blowing showdowns, sometimes against foes you would not expect. It\u2019s smoother, sleeker, and dare I say just Greater. \nIf you thought the first game was too clunky, you\u2019ll love it. And if you loved the first game, you\u2019ll fall in love all over again.\"\n \u2014Brian Jewett, A.K.A. The Cult of Gloom\n\n\"When we playtesters were first told about Definitive Edition, I was excited to playtest it because I love Sentinels, but figured I wasn't going to buy it. Why buy a new game when it's mostly just new art, with just a few notably revised decks? But then we saw more and more, and more of the decks got tweaked, that the final product is amazing. Complex long-haul heroes can set up and be useful much more quickly. Simple heroes that used to do loosely-associated random things have tighter themes and more interesting mechanics. Cheese strategies have been de-cheesed. Villains are less likely to decide a game with a single poorly-timed play. What used to be \"challenge mode\" and came from a semi-secret downloadable PDF is now in the box, with better playtesting, and is part of a light campaign mode. What used to be \"promo\" content--variant heroes and villains which could only be found in Kickstarters and from cons--are also now included in the box, are also much more solidly designed, and in this one box there are already as many variant villains as the entire run of Enhanced Edition.\nOriginally I wasn't planning to get in on the Kickstarter, because, as much as I love Definitive Edition, it does only come with 24 decks instead of the over 100 Enhanced Edition decks I already own. But by the time it's all out again, it's going to be not only much better quality, but have much more content to boot. And Christopher has given us some ideas of what he's thinking about for the future, and it sounds really, really promising. (Plus, if anything isn't good, he's being really good about listening to feedback from us playtesters, and we're giving him plenty.) Anyone who knows me from other communities will know that I tend to be a hyper-critical contrarian. Enhanced Edition was my favorite sub-2-hour tabletop game of all time, and Definitive Edition is shaping up to be much better. If you like co-op tabletop games at all, this is the one you want.\"\n \u2014Mindwanderer\n\n\"I initially had some reservations about Definitive Edition. While I would like to see new art, that alone wouldn't have been enough to sway me. By the end of playtesting, it had blown me away.  Bunker feels fantastic now. Fanatic screams her theme and playstyle like a real fanatical angel would. Absolute Zero doesn't just give up when his equipment is destroyed. Tempest actually feels like someone with control over the weather instead of just someone that shoots lightning bolts willy-nilly. \nWhile the mechanics have been cleaned up a good bit and there has been an overall balance overhaul, what really stands out to me is how much each hero feels like the heroes I've been hearing about on The Letters Page. The mapping of theme to mechanics is just stellar. I love the original game, and I will no doubt still play it from time to time, but I greatly look forward to DE hitting my table (and also hope that Handelabra makes a digital version, so it can hit my screen as well).\"\n \u2014Bryan Graham, A.K.A. Broccoli\n\n\"I love Sentinels of the Multiverse. We have a bi-weekly group that has been playing for nearly a decade, now! We have all things Sentinels-related, and thoroughly enjoy it. Now that we've played Definitive Edition, though, it's by far our preferred version. The consistency, the mechanical flavor, the art, everything about it is significantly improved! My spouse loved Fanatic before, but now she prefers the DE version and won't even play the original. I enjoy Absolute Zero and Argent Adept, both of whom recover from loss of cards in play much better than ever before. Things like that just make the game much more fun to play.\"\n \u2014Russ Luzetski, A.K.A. Rabit\n\n\"I was definitely among the people who weren't convinced of the value-to-existing-fans of DE. But the Events, Critical Events, and ability to play through the Canonical Battles in the Canonical order as a campaign has made a convert of me. I was always going to buy DE anyway (even with 40+ years of tabletop gaming behind me, Sentinels is my all-time favorite, plus Adam's art is always worth the price of admission) but now I know that not only will the Definitive Edition be sitting on my shelf, but it will be hitting my table as well.\nRa has been my favorite Sentinels Hero since the original game came out. The cards that I loved in his old deck are still all there in this new version (several with upgrades), and the cards I didn't care for have been replaced with new, and much better, cards. Consuming Flame is my new favorite. And the Staff or Ra has been upgraded and has the potential to do a single massive blast of fire! Villains beware!\"\n \u2014Michael J. Ahlers, A.K.A. YakGuardian\n\n\"Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition retells the stories you know and love from the original and enhanced edition content while doubling down on artwork and mechanics that directly detail those stories, as if the players were reading them in the comics they allegedly come from. The new format not only streamlines game play but clarifies the game phases much more precisely and allows players to get a much better feel for how their characters interact. The new artwork is a perfect facsimile of comics from a multitude of time periods ranging from the Golden Age right up to the present, including many homages to the great artists of those periods.\"\n \u2014Zach Denoncour (Adjacent Hex Podcast), A.K.A. ALD_Zach\nIf you want to play non-Definitive Edition Sentinels of the Multiverse content alongside this new content, then you're in luck! We've got this handy Conversion Guide! Check it out by clicking the image below!\nHi, everybody! This is Paul Bender, CEO of Greater Than Games! I want to tell you a brief story about my personal experience with Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition. \nBack in late 2019 and early 2020, Christopher and Adam had a series of discussions about their future vision for Sentinels of the Multiverse. The sweeping set of changes, tweaks, and improvements that you see in Definitive Edition grew out of those discussions, but for those first few months I wasn\u2019t really a part of that dialogue (I was busy with various\u2026. 2020 things. You were there; you know). \nAnyhow! Approximately one year ago, Christopher and Adam presented me with their vision of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition, and at first I was a bit skeptical that remaking the core game in the way they intended was the right way to go. However, they quickly convinced me. Looking at the new art that Adam was working on and playing through the new versions of familiar characters that Christopher was rewriting completely convinced me that Definitive Edition was both worth making and incredibly awesome. I realized at that point that the absolute best argument in favor of Definitive Edition is\u2026 Definitive Edition. I knew that some people would be skeptical, as I was, and I wanted them to have the same opportunity that I had to be convinced that Definitive Edition is really something that they want. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t afford to send Christopher to everyone\u2019s city with a pre-production copy of Definitive Edition, so we decided on the next best thing: The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter Money-Back Guarantee!\nWhat is \"The Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition Kickstarter Money-Back Guarantee\"? Simply put, if you back this Kickstarter campaign, you can return your copy of Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition within 90 days for a full refund (including shipping), no questions asked. We believe very strongly that playing Definitive Edition will convince you that you want Definitive Edition, and we are willing to put our money where our mouth is on this one. Here are some more details on how this will work:\nYou have 90 days to request a refund, starting on the date of our Kickstarter update announcing that fulfillment is complete (and reminding you that the refund clock is starting).\nWithin that window, if you would like a refund for this product, please email contact@greaterthangames.com \nWe will generate a shipping return label for you to print out. You will need to re-package your copy of Definitive Edition in its original packaging, affix the label, and drop it off at a FedEx facility. Your refund will be processed within 10-15 days of when the product arrives at our facility.\nIt is as simple as that! If you have any questions about this policy, definitely reach out to us and we\u2019ll get them answered (and post the answers to any FAQs on this page).\nThis is Paul Bender again with another Kickstarter Shipping Explanation! Here's the deal with shipping and customs: it is frustratingly expensive \u2014 even more so after the events of the last year or so \u2014 and there is no legal way around how frustratingly expensive it is. We've tried many different shipping methods in the past, and we've always lost money on international shipping, no matter what we do. Our plan for this Kickstarter campaign is to fulfill pledge levels for North American backers ourselves, and use Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK to fulfill pledges for all of our other backers.\nWe looked at the rates that we paid last year to fulfill the Spirit Island: Jagged Earth campaign and used them as the basis for shipping rates on this campaign, since Jagged Earth and Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition are of a similar size and weight. We then slightly subsidized everyone's rates across the board. That means that we'll be spending some of your pledge dollars on shipping above and beyond what you pay for shipping; the amount that we're charging you for shipping definitely does NOT cover the entire cost of shipping. Just enough of it to make sure that we're not losing a ton of money to shipping, as has happened traditionally. It also means that 100% of the materials, packaging costs, and handling for shipments will have to come out of the actual pledges and not the amount we charge you for shipping.\nThese shipping charges do not include VAT or customs duties. Talking with our contacts in the shipping industry and looking at our experiences with past Kickstarters, it is still unclear exactly how we (and/or you as the customer) will be charged, especially in light of Brexit. Given that, it is our current plan to charge VAT to backers via BackerKit after the campaign ends (so that we can be sure to charge the correct amount even if the VAT rates change this year). We will also work to minimize customs clearance charges, but depending on how a particular country works (again, especially considering Brexit), customers outside the US or UK might wind up with some delivery charges. Based on our past experiences, this is fairly rare, but does happen. We wish we could offer more clarity on exactly how this will work, but global trade is in massive flux right now so it is impossible to know for certain what will happen. However, we'll post updates with any clarifying information about shipping and VAT charges, both during the campaign and after, if things solidify.\nBelow are the shipping charges for this campaign. The first number is the base shipping price for a pledge level. The second number is the additional shipping charge for each copy of an add-on.\nUS: $9 / $5\nCAN: $25 / $12\nZone A: $35 / $18\nZone B: $55 / $27\nOther: $69 / $39\nThe \"Zones\" you see here are based on zones that FedEx and other carriers use to price packages. We've cross-referenced these with our recent Spirit Island: Jagged Earth Kickstarter fulfillment and set the prices for each zone several dollars lower than the average amount we were charged to ship to that zone.\nZone A: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, Ireland, Sweden\nZone B: Austria, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, Gibraltar, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Israel, Malta, Mexico, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Turkey\nFinally, there are unfortunately a few countries to which we cannot ship. We've attempted to ship to these countries in the past, only to have the vast majority of parcels lost or returned after very large shipping charges. There is no way to exclude countries from shipping on Kickstarter, so if you back the project from one of these countries, we will unfortunately have to refund you your pledge. We don't like it anymore than you do, but we have even less power than you do to change the laws of the country that you live in! \nForbidden Zone: Brazil, Cuba, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen\nOverall, we are confident that this system of shipping is most fair and equitable to everyone, based on how much we'll be paying to ship out the rewards for this Kickstarter. If you feel the shipping costs associated with backing this Kickstarter are too high, we can only hope that they game does well enough to be available for purchase in a place closer to home for you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a bit of an unusual Kickstarter campaign for us, which introduces some new risks and challenges that we haven\u2019t encountered before. The first is that this is the first time we\u2019ve run a Kickstarter campaign for a new edition of a previously published game. Is this the right way to go about it? We think so, but it is impossible to know until we do it!\n\nSeparately, we also anticipate concern from some backers about the timeline of this project. In the past, we have run several Kickstarter projects that ran significantly behind schedule before delivering. Fortunately, we believe that we have a foolproof solution this time around! Sentinels of the Multiverse: Definitive Edition is already fully through the development, design, and layout process, and has in fact already begun pre-press work at the printer!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "SIN is the second full-length sourcebook for the Spire roleplaying game. You can learn more about Spire on our website.\n\nIn Spire - a mile-high city riddled with betrayal and inequality - the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress fights with dagger and shadow against the cruel High Elf overlords, waging a hidden war of sabotage, insurrection and assassination. \nSin focuses on three main elements of the city of Spire:\nCriminal enterprise is big business everywhere in the city, but particularly in the lawless knot subterranean of violence known as Red Row and among the feuding public house Knights of the North Docks. We go into great detail on the different families and \"noble\" knightly houses, take a look at the gods and goddesses of illegal endeavours, and shine light on the unfathomably callous high elf murder mystery parties (containing real murder).\nThe Spiral Council does what they can to uphold a corrupt peace in Spire, but even with a network of guards, militias, undercover operatives and a fully-mobilised army at their command they still struggle. Learn more about the Paladins hunting the Ministry, visit the nightmarish environs of Spire's most dangerous and most secure prison, and infiltrate the ranks of the Allied Defence Force to steal experimental aelfir technology.\nWith the arrival of the sun-worshipping high elves, much of the religion practiced by the drow inhabitants of Spire was driven underground centuries ago; now, it has twisted itself into something bitter and vengeful as a result. We explore the triparite Damnic faith (the Cathedral of Our Glorious Lady, the Ministry of Our Hidden Mistress, and the vicious Crimson Vigil) as well as looking into the Old Faiths of the Home Nations and the endless parades and rituals of the Solar Pantheon.\nAll of these sections are backed up with character options, equipment advances and NPCs that allow both players and GMs to use the content provided as easily as possible at the table. \nBut that's not all! We've also got:\nTwo New Classes\nLie to gods for a living as the Gutter Cleric\nThe Gutter Cleric is an experimental field theologian who hacks together magic from forbidden, dead or merely unpopular gods into unusual effects (in fact, two of their Medium Advances are almost entirely redacted); the Mortician Executioner is the sharp end of a great and powerful administrative organisation devoted to declaring luckless individuals legally dead and then correcting the oversight at swordpoint. \nRead people their rites as the Mortician Executioner.\nAnd: Three New Full-Length Adventures\n The Hand of the Gods sees the Ministers pitched into the middle of a war between three cults all fighting over the same holy relic - the hand of a saint who is connected to one, all, or none of the organisations in the conflict. How can they exploit the situation to their advantage?\nIn Second-Hand Rain, a demonic eidolon appears in the city of Spire and bring with it the noir  atmosphere of an hard-boiled interbellum crime fiction thriller. The eidolon can bring down empires in the wrong hands; do those hands belong to the player characters?\nAlthough the aelfir have been unable to summon their gods to Spire, The Birth of Brother Harvest unites the Autumn Church and the Midwives as they grow a wretched, deformed murder god in an upspire hatchery. What does it take to kill a god, and do the Ministers even want to? \nA Revolutionary's Guide to Spire\nIn addition to all that, we're continuing the tradition of our newspaper clippings and The Spiral Muse to bring you The Revolutionary's Guide to Spire, a zine created by the writers of Liberate! (voted Spire's Most Illegal Publication three years running). Discretely released on a quarterly basis, TRGS has the unbiased low-down on all the coolest nightlife spots, where to buy a revolver without getting robbed and/or killed, up-to-date codephrases and ciphers and how best to escape from the City Guard. Rumors that the TRGS is secretly funded by radical aelfir elements looking to promote their own businesses and badmouth their rivals are not to be entertained.\nThe Revolutionary's Guide To Spire is a companion zine for Spire, filled with in-character adventure hooks, NPCs, setting info and tidbits for you and your players to enjoy. You can add it to your rewards by choosing the Revolutionary Hardback tier.\nWe're offering flat rate shipping for the Kickstarter only. You'll be able to combine your pledge with our other products in Backerkit later on, and we'll do our best to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Our books will ship either from the UK or the US, and we aim to offer EU-friendly shipping with duties paid.\nEndorsements\n\u201cSpire\u2019s a mix of narrative freedom and wired and weird narrative detail, its ideas thrusting up from the landscape of fantasy game, visible to miles around. Even my hatred of Elves can\u2019t lower my admiration\u201d - Kieron Gillen (the Wicked + the Divine)\n\n\u201cHowitt and Taylor lovingly built Spire out of compelling plot hooks that will motivate any group of players to chase the satisfaction of smashing it into glistening pieces... a smart balance of well built action and socio-political commentary.\u201d - James D'Amato (The One Shot network)\n\n\u201cSpire has one of the most intriguing settings of any game I\u2019ve come across, backed with elegant and simple mechanics. It\u2019s a fascinating RPG experience.\u201d Adrian Tchaikovsky (Shadows of the Apt, Arthur C. Clarke Award winner)\n\n\u201cThis is an edifice of urban fantasy with the electricity of Mi\u00e9ville at his best, and the pressure-cooker claustrophobia of Blades in the Dark. It\u2019s bombastic, sexy, downright political stuff which rises up from foundations in the deepest strata of Gigaxic kitsch into the thin air of pure invention.\u201d Nate Crowley (The Death and Life of Schneider Wrack, The Sea Hates a Coward)\n\n\u201cGrant and the Spire team have answered one of the oldest questions in fantasy: how to do something different with dark elves. Their answer is Spire, a police procedural in Hell, a baroque conspiracy thriller and a heroic tragedy all wrapped up in two mile high feral walls and urban chaos.\u201d Alasdair Stuart (The Doctor Who Roleplaying Game)\nAdd-Ons\nWe're going to handle add-ons post Kickstarter via Backerkit; you'll be able to add any of the other books we produce onto your order to save on postage, and they'll all be delivered alongside delivery of Sin. \nThe Team\nVeteran Spire authors Grant Howitt and Christopher Taylor have returned and put together a team of new and established authors to write Sin. For those of you familiar with Spire, you'll be pleased to welcome back Chris Farnell, Pauline Chan, Basheer Ghouse, JP Bradley and Helen Gould - and we're happy to add Cat Evans, Eleanor Hingley, Cleo Keahna, Thomas Manuel, N MasYk and Viditya Voleti to the growing list of people who've helped us create this  world.\n\nSome of these writers have years of experience in the field; for others, this is their first full-length commission. Over the last few years we've been hand-selecting a suite of writers who, regardless of their prior work, get Spire in a way that we recognise - and can communicate it well with the reader.  We're so excited to work with them and take the world in directions that, alone, we never could have taken it whilst staying true to the high standards of writing that we've set ourselves.\n\nAdrian Stone is returning with full-page, full-colour art (as you can see throughout this Kickstarter) and Rowan Rook & Decard's first actual employee, Mina McJanda, is handling the graphic design and layout.\n\n\nAll stretch goals will be made available to all backers at PDF level or above in digital format.

RED ROW MANSION MAP. An in-detail map of Destera House, a crumbling mansion (complete with palatial, if decrepit grounds) on the outskirts of Red Row - filled with secret passages, NPCs to charm and betray, opulent decor to pawn off once you've pried it out with a crowbar, and presumably some kind of fancy party to sneak into.

Founded by Grant Howitt, Chris Taylor and Mary Hamilton in 2017, we've recently brought on Mina McJanda as our first full-time employee.

Although we had some problems getting books from them to us thanks to Brexit, we've set up a stable import connection so it hopefully won't cause us problems in future.\n\nWe will be working with Parcelhub for fulfillment (who we have worked with successfully for the previous 5 Kickstarters); Studio 2 Publishing will handle our US and Canadian orders; we are hoping to work with Kixto to ensure that European orders can be fulfilled with no additional post-Brexit costs. Rules around shipping to the EU will change in July this year; given that we're hoping to deliver late in the year, we'll have plenty of time to create an efficient solution for postage. We're also allocating a larger shipping and delivery contingency budget than ever before on this project after our experiences with Heart taught us that a pandemic can really mess with postage times and costs. \n\nThe previous 12 months have been unlike any other we've experienced in our lives, and they've presented unprecedented challenges with regards to - well - everything. We don't know what will happen over the duration of this project with regards to the wider world, infectious diseases, supply chain disruptions and Britain's increasingly strained relationship with its neighbours, but we promise that we'll remain transparent and tell you what we know, when we know it, so you can stay up to date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur books are printed to the highest standards and built to last.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Black Box\nThe Black Box is a brand new expansion for Catacombs 3E. It features a new double-sided playmat featuring the Athenoch Mortuary on one side and the Notholag Dungeon on the other. \nIt provides a full set of alternate monsters cards for the base Catacombs game plus every expansion published so far including: Cavern of Soloth, Ice Box, Keystones & Keeps, Resurrection Packs 1 & 2, and Wyverns of Wylemuir. \nThere is a new set of monsters for the Vermin family and the new Mushroom familiar for the heroes. The expansion provides room cards featuring these new Vermin monsters and the Burial Chamber special room card.\nIn terms of rules, this expansion introduces the snowball ranged shot, group rush shot,  move to rune \"shot\" and the transmogrify shot modifier. \nThe box artwork  is an homage to the cover of Catacombs First Edition, first released over ten years ago.\nStretch Goals\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpgrade Levels\n\nReward Levels\nAdd-ons\nVideos\nCatacombs Third Edition (Catacombs 3E)\nCatacombs is a dexterity based, one vs many dexterity dungeon crawl.  Four heroes are selected to protect the town of Stormtryne by battling  their way through countless enemies before finally facing the dreaded  Catacomb Lord.\n\nEach hero has their own unique set of actions, abilities, items or  spells that aid them through the various rooms and encounters.\nThe Overseer player controls the monsters and the Catacomb Lord, acting as the adversary the heroes aim to defeat.\nThere is a near limitless combination of rooms to explore. Some rooms  have a swarm of monsters that the heroes must fight through to succeed.  Others provide unique encounters where the heroes can spend their hard  earned gold on new items, healing services, or even gamble to gain every  edge they can against the Overseer player.\nThe actions a character may take are determined by the rules provided  on their cards in the form of shot sequences. Each shot does something  different. Some do varying amounts of damage, while others can freeze  opponents, scare them off, or teleport allies out of danger, to name a  few. There are dozens of shots in Catacombs.\nJust using a shot doesn't always guarantee its action, however. In  order to be effective, players will have to train their dexterity skills  and accurately flick wooden discs. Ducking in and out of cover,  positioning shots, and banking attacks off obstacles are essential  skills to an experienced player.\nIf the heroes live long enough to breach the Catacomb Lord's Lair,  they will meet their final test - battling the Catacomb Lord them self!\n\n\nFAQ\nQuestion: What are the main rule changes to Catacombs & Castles 2E (second edition)?\nAll heroes in the base Catacombs & Castles 2E game now have a native ability on their hero rules cards. As a result, heroes from the base game only use one ability card.\nCatacombs & Castles 2E hero portrait and rules cards are included for the King's Champion, Royal Archer, Wraith Knight, and Shaman increasing the roster of heroes in the base game from 8 to 12.\nThe base shot sequences for all 8 of the original heroes included in Catacombs & Castles 1E were updated.\nThe rules for ability cards were harmonized between Team Mode and Boss Mode. In summary, ability cards are always charged up.\nThe placement of the obstacles during game setup was simplified.\nThe shield shot rules in Catacombs & Castles 2E were harmonized with those from Catacombs 3E.\nThe longbow shot rules in Catacombs & Castles 2E were harmonized with those from Catacombs Conquest.\nThe shuriken shot has an additional effect.\nThe rules for the net and web shots were changed - they no longer trap players and prevent them from taking an action.\nThe same hero cannot damage the same opposing character consecutively during a shot sequence.\nThe horn team action permits only one teammate to perform a shot sequence.\nThe orange ice shot icon was replaced with the ice boulder shot icon.\nThe orange target ice shot icon was replaced with a blue target ice shot icon.\nThe target ice shot and ice boulder shots enable assist transfers.\nThe fireball and giant fireball shots enable void transfers.\nThe term grapple shot now refers both to the original grapple shot and the claw shot.\nExplanations of the the runic shift, move to rune, hook, and lightning shots were added to the Castles 2E core rules.\nThe Castle Lord's starting Armour was increased to 3.\nThe Wraith Knight's starting Health was increased to 12.\nQuestion: Do the playmats have stitched edges?\nNo, as these interfere with game play.\nQuestion: Will the \"Big Box\" versions of Catacombs & Castles 2E and Catacombs 3E be available at retail?\nNo. They will only be available now during this campaign and later from our online shop.\nQuestion: What are the main changes to the second edition of the Wyverns of Wylemuir expansion?\nThere are additional cards for both Castles 2E and Catacombs 3E compatibility. The game board has replaced by a 3E sized, double-sided playmat.\nQuestion: What if I already own the Wyverns playmat but don't have the Wyverns expansion?\nThe Wyverns components without the box or playmat will be available directly in the Elzra Pledge Manager after the campaign ends.\nQuestion: What about \"group buys\"?\nPlease contact us by submitting a business inquiry ticket.\nQuestion: What time zone are you located in?\nEastern Standard.\nQuestion: What is the best way to contact you?\nThe best way is by submitting a support ticket via our website. This opens a ticket in our system to ensure we don't miss it. As always, we are a small team and it may take some time to reply.\nPledge Manager\nSales Tax & VAT\nCanada\nPrices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in Canada are in Canadian dollars and are exclusive of GST / HST.\nWe must charge applicable GST/HST to all orders from backers within Canada. This is a legal requirement to ensure our company's compliance with both the law and with the Canada Revenue Agency's rules.\nUK and European Union\nThere are significant regulatory changes in the UK and European Union that will affect all Kickstarter campaigns. These are BREXIT, Import Control System (ICS2) and the VAT De Minimis Removal.\n BREXIT (January 2021): Will require Customs Declarations for EU-GB-EU shipments. Affects shipments from the European Union to Great Britain, and from Great Britain to the European Union \n Import Control System (ICS2) (March 2021): The enhancement of the security screening program will require that certain shipment data elements be sent to the EU Customs authorities for review and approval prior to loading at the country of export. Affects shipments from everywhere in the world to (or transiting) the European Union, Norway or Switzerland \n VAT De Minimis Removal (July 2021): The abolition of the 22 Euros VAT De Minimis for imports into the EU will result in formal Customs clearance for all inbound EU shipments and the levying of VAT. Affects shipments from everywhere in the world to the European Union \nWith these changes, Customs authorities are further enforcing the regulatory requirements related to the provision of complete and accurate customs data in order to optimize security and safety screening, as well as combat counterfeiting and piracy, prevent unfair competition and ensure full collection of duties and taxes.\nUK\nPrices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in the UK should be considered exclusive of VAT.\nVAT on your selected reward level will be collected during the Elzra Pledge Manager. VAT will also be collected on the cost of shipping.\nOne of the main changes that will affect customers from 1st January 2021 is the change to the deemed place of supply of goods. As things stand now, goods are subject to VAT in the country in which they are located at the point of sale.\nThe government is proposing that from 1st January 2021, a Business to Consumer sale of goods to a UK consumer will be deemed to take place in the UK, even if the goods were located outside the UK at the point of sale. \nRead more here.\nEuropean Union\nFor an overview of the current VAT system in the European Union, please see this article (europa.eu).\nThere are significant regulatory changes scheduled to come into effect on the 1st of July, 2021. \nThe official memo from the European Union regarding these changes can be read online here:\nModernising VAT for e-commerce (europa.eu)\nWith regards to this campaign, prices expressed in pledge / reward levels for backers in the European Union should be considered exclusive of VAT. \nRead more here.\nShipping\nYou will be charged shipping after the Kickstarter campaign ends based on the actual costs incurred to ship your package to you. We will collect these charges via the Elzra Pledge Manager after this Kickstarter campaign.\nVolumetric Weight\nThe shipping box for the \"Big Box\" version of Catacombs & Castles 2E + stretch goals is expected to be 16x16x8\" / 40.64 x 40.64 x 20.32 cm (15 lbs / 6.8 kg volumetric weight). \nThe dimensions of the shipping box directly affects the price of shipping as carriers now charge the higher cost of either the package's weight or volume (otherwise called volumetric weight). Here is a link to DHL's volumetric weight calculator as an example.\nPlease watch this video that explains further the concept of volumetric weight:\nUK\nFor confirmed backers in the UK, Games Quest will ship from within the UK. This should prevent any additional customs or handling charges. All shipments within the UK will support tracking data. VAT must be calculated on the cost of shipping the package in addition to the price of the game itself.\nEurope\nFor confirmed backers in the European Union, Games Quest is expected to ship DPP (delivered, duty paid) from their UK hub. This should prevent any additional customs or handling charges. \nSwitzerland, Norway, Iceland, Ukraine\nFor confirmed backers in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, and Ukraine, Games Quest is expected to ship from their UK hub.\nCanada\nFor confirmed backers in Canada, we will ship from our Elzra warehouse from Ontario, Canada. Please note that it is more expensive to ship packages to some parts of Canada than it is to ship a package to the other side of the planet. Those backers residing in the North outside of Whitehorse and Yellowknife should expect a significant delivery charge. All shipments in Canada will support tracking data. Backers based in Ontario will be able to choose local pick-up in the Elzra Pledge Manager. Our office is in Hamilton (Dundas).\nUSA\nFor confirmed backers in the USA including Alaska and Hawaii, we expect to ship from Canada. We may use a third party fulfillment company depending on the final order volume.\nFor those backers in the USA that must use a PO Box for their shipping address, your order must be processed separately and will be sent via Canada Post / USPS. DHL and UPS cannot ship to US PO Boxes. All shipments to the USA will support tracking data.\nMexico\nFor confirmed backers in Canada, we will ship from our Elzra warehouse from Ontario, Canada via Canada Post.\nIsrael\nFor confirmed backers in Israel, we will either ship from Canada, the UK or Germany. The total number of backers based in Israel will determine how best to proceed. DHL Express service to Israel is reliable but expensive.\nChina\nFor confirmed backers based in China and Hong Kong, VFI will ship from within China.\nAsia Pacific\nFor confirmed backers based in Australia, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam, VFI will ship from China to their local hubs in those countries.\nImportant: If there is a significant number of backers from Australia, then fulfillment will occur from within that country using Aetherworks and shipping costs will be re-calculated. Shipping costs to Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia, and the Northern Territory can be significant.\nRest of World\nFor confirmed backers in India, the Middle East, South Africa, and South America, we expect to ship from either VFI's hub in China or from Canada using Canada Post's slow, but reliable, international parcel surface service.\nImportant Shipping Related Information\nInternational PO Boxes\nWe simply cannot ship to international PO boxes.\nShipping After the Deadline to Confirm Your Pledge\nIf you do not confirm your pledge after the deadline for confirming your shipping details via the Elzra Pledge Manager, your rewards will  be shipped to you from the Elzra warehouse in Canada. As such, shipping costs may be considerably higher for those outside of Canada and the USA.\nDelivery Attempts and Package Delivery Bounces\nWe will make attempt to deliver your package based on the shipping address and contact information you supply in the Elzra Pledge Manager.\nIf your package is returned (bounces) during fulfillment, we will conduct an investigation as to what happened. When the fault is ours, we will pay to re-ship the package.\nHowever, if it is determined that the package was returned due to an error in the shipping information provided to us, you will have to pay to have the package shipped out again.\nThe moral of the story is: help us help you by taking a few extra minutes to double-check your shipping address in the Elzra Pledge Manager and ensure it is correct.\nChanging Your Shipping Address\nIf you need to change your shipping address before we have delivered your package, please open a support ticket. See the Support section of this campaign page.\n Pay Attention to Tracking Emails During Delivery\nWhen the shipping method we use to deliver your package supports tracking, you are responsible for following the tracking data closely and to secure the package immediately upon delivery to minimize the potential of package theft.\nCanada Post, DHL, and UPS support redirecting shipments to a safe pick-up location later.\nShipping Addresses for Backers in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan\nTo increase the reliability of their delivery, backers in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan may submit their shipping address (but not their billing address) using Chinese characters in the Elzra Pledge Manager.\nPackaging\nWe spend a lot of effort and extra money to pack your games carefully. We use strong, double-walled shipping boxes, the best protective void fill, and leave extra space between the walls of the shipping box and its contents. If the shipping box suffers from damage which affects its contents, we reserve the right to determine next steps to resolve the issue. Backers frequently request empty replacement game boxes, but the factory doesn't produce these and sending them out to fulfillment centers when they may not be required is a waste of the campaign's resources. Please open a support ticket to report the issue to us and we will proceed from there. See the Support section of this campaign page.\nShipping Rates\n Shipping Rates\nThe following shipping rates assume the following:\n15 lb / 6.8 kg volumetric weight\n16 x 16 x 8\" / 40.64 x 40.64 x 20.32 cm double-walled shipping box\nUnited States\nLower 48 states plus Alaska and Hawaii - $28 USD\nCanada\nCanada - Alberta - Calgary - $29 CAD\nCanada - BC - $32 CAD\nCanada - Manitoba - $27 CAD\nCanada - Ontario - $19 CAD\nCanada - New Brunswick - $33 CAD\nCanada - Nova Scotia - $25 CAD\nCanada - Nova Scotia - rural - $49 CAD\nCanada - Quebec - Quebec - $19 CAD\nCanada - Saskatchewan - $30 CAD\nCanada - Yukon - $25 CAD (Canada Post)\nNorthwest Territories, Nunavut, or Yukon: approx. $150 CAD (expensive!)\nMexico\n$79 USD (Canada Post tracked surface service)\nUK\n\u00a310\nEuropean Union\nAustria - \u20ac17\nBelgium - \u20ac16\nBulgaria - \u20ac39\nCroatia - PENDING\nCzechia - \u20ac24\nDenmark - \u20ac24\nEstonia - \u20ac33\nFinland - \u20ac21\nFrance - \u20ac21\nGermany - \u20ac16\nGreece - \u20ac39\nHungary - \u20ac24\nIreland - \u20ac21\nItaly - \u20ac24\nLatvia - \u20ac33\nLithuania - \u20ac39\nLuxembourg - \u20ac21\nNetherlands - \u20ac21\nPoland - \u20ac21\nPortugal - \u20ac33\nRomania - \u20ac39\nSlovakia - \u20ac24\nSlovenia - \u20ac21\nSpain - \u20ac38\nSweden - \u20ac21\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland, Ukraine\nNorway - \u20ac22\nSwitzerland - \u20ac23\nIsrael\n$45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nChina, Hong Kong\n$11 USD (Asia zone 0 - shipping from China)\nAsia Pacific\nAustralia - $25 USD (Asia zone 1, ships from hub inside country)\nIndonesia - $45 (Asia zone 2)\nJapan - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nMalaysia - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nPhilippines - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nSingapore - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nNew Zealand - $45 (Asia zone 2)\nSouth Korea - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\nTaiwan $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nThailand $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nVietnam $25 - USD (Asia zone 1)\nRest of World\nBahrain - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nKuwait - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nSaudi Arabia - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nUnited Arab Emiraes - $45 USD (Asia zone 2)\nSouth Africa - $25 USD (Asia zone 1)\n\nSupport\n\nFor customer support, please submit a support ticket by clicking the icon below:\nClick Here to Ask a Question\nKickstarter Private Messaging for Support\nBackers who contact us via Kickstarter's private messaging system will be directed to submit a support ticket. Kickstarter messaging has very limited capabilities and it is not efficient for us to use.\nKickstarter Comment Page for Support\nPlease note also that we cannot respond to specific customer support requests on the comments page of this project. We take pride in our excellent customer service, and aim to deal with  requests as quickly and efficiently as possible when using channels that we have setup for this purpose. Note that sometimes we will receive a  significant volume of requests, so please be patient while we work through them.\nFollow us on Twitter and Instagram for announcements and behind the scenes photos.\nTerms\nRefunds\nRefunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After this time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees due to us not being able to claim them back after 30 days.\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have confirmed quantities and/or started production and/or if we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project.\nAbandoned Pledges\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details in the Elzra Pledge Manager within ten weeks of our notification via email, we will consider it abandoned. The funds from your pledge will be considered a donation to this campaign.\nYour Responsibilities\nBy pledging for this Kickstarter campaign, you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your reward as confirmed in the Elzra Pledge Manager. \nYou are responsible for import taxes, sales taxes or other fees that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. \nYou accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit. \nYou acknowledge that you will pay attention to your package's tracking status and arrange to have your package taken to a safe place upon delivery to prevent package theft.\nYou acknowledge that the final look and contents of your reward may be different from what is presented at the start of the campaign.\nOur Projects (Past Projects)\nComing Attractions (Upcoming Games)\nClick Me\nClick Me", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is a new edition of an existing game, much of the initial artwork and development of Catacombs & Castles 2E has already been completed. We have been working on the second edition for over a year.\n\nWe are planning to use the same factory that produced Catacombs Cubes. We have met with the owner of this factory and our account manager in person several times. \n\nWe are using the same factory that produces all of our high quality playmats.\n\nWe are planning to use the same fulfillment partners we have worked with in the past: Games Quest, VFI, and Aetherworks (assuming a sufficient number of orders from Australia). We have met the owners of all of these companies in person. They have been transparent about delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic when they have been forced to halt or slow operations.\n\nFor our domestic and US fulfillment operation, we are using the same suppliers for cardboard cartons and packaging.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced overseas: printer production schedules, major holidays (Lunar New Year, National Week), shipping, and customs delays. We will work diligently to minimize these types of disruptions and promise to communicate transparently with our backers if they occur.\n\nWe have estimated delivery for January 2022. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe are factoring in ocean shipping and fulfillment delays as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Supporter Pledge", "descp": "Support the campaign and receive project updates.

And, well, it is. Especially since the Crystals that you seek happen to be inside giant space Beasts. To mine them, you need to, well, be eaten.\nShould you achieve your objective and mine enough Crystals to meet your quota, it is then cost-effective for the company to activate your jetpack and extricate you from the proverbial belly of the Beast.\nIn the event that the Bacteria present in the Beast overwhelm you and you are digested, do not despair. Your non-organic parts will certainly be useful in the mining exploits of future Miners. In fact, you may encounter some such pieces of equipment in your expedition, remains of less-than-qualified recruits from past attempts.\nFinally, it could transpire that you do not collect the necessary Crystals by the time you reach the end of your adventure, without the Beast having digested you.\nIn this case, you will then exit the Beast from the other end than the one you entered. Alive... and yet forever changed. In this case we will have to evaluate your performance against that of the Beast\u2019s efforts to consume you.\nIn So, You've Been Eaten. the Miner and the Beast will face off against one another. \nThe Miner earns points by collecting Crystals and the Beast earns points by developing Immune Responses and by its Bacteria attacking the Miner.\nThe game ends in a win for the Miner if they collect all 8 different Crystals, and the Beast wins by digesting the Miner after four Bacteria of the same type have attacked.\nOf course, there\u2019s always the possibility that the Miner will simply pass through the Beast\u2019s system, and then the player with the most points wins!\n So, You\u2019ve Been Eaten. can be played as:\nA game for 2 players, with a Miner player against a Beast player.\nA game for 1 player, with the Miner player against a Hibernating Beast.\nA game for 1 player, with the Beast player against a robot Miner.\nA game for 0 players, with a Hibernating Beast against a robot Miner.\n\nWant the all-in-fire-and-forget pledge?\nThe hyper-high-end one with triple-layered(!) boards?\nThe lovingly deluxified KS-limited objet d'art for your shelf?\nThe one with the bursting-with-bits-even-though-it's-even-bigger-box?\nChoose the Collector Edition pledge level, and rejoice!\nAnd if you have not yet decided to back now, here's why you should:\n- Discounted shipping! Post-campaign shipping costs will be higher.\n- Guaranteed availability of the Collector edition! Due to its bigger, special box, we will likely not be producing this as easily as the retail edition, and due to its heavier weight, this is not going to be easy to ship when not doing mass KS fulfillment.\n- Loyalty discount! Get $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign backed - see below for more details.\n- Don't miss a game full of unconventional asymmetric gameplay by Scott Almes & striking art by Kwanchai Moriya!\nPremium Edition - savings\nThe custom-shaped double-printed acrylic Crystal tokens and the printed wooden Bacteria tokens are going to be available as a $9 add-on, and the Dyspepto-Beastmol mini-expansion will be available as a $5 add-on. By backing the Premium edition, you would get a $4 discount, and also receive the custom-cut Replication token (the \"Miner meeple\"), which we do not expect to later sell separately.\n\nCollector Edition - LudiCreations Loyalty Discount\nBackers of the Collector Edition will receive a discount of $1 per previous LudiCreations campaign they have backed in the past, up to a maximum of $5 off. This will be applied in Backerkit and can be used for reducing the cost of shipping and add-ons. For more information, please see the FAQs.\n\nTuckboxes - Sleeves?\nYes, they fit. We tested with premium sleeves.\nRemember kids, always use protection!\nSo, You've Been Eaten. is an asymmetric game. Players must balance short-term benefit against trying to gain an advantage for the next turns. Many times they will need to simply survive the turn. To win, they need to make clever plays and try to corner their opponent into having to make increasingly difficult choices.\nThe Miner is playing a dice manipulation & placement game to try to eliminate Bacteria and capture Crystals (and Tools) that are present on a row of cards between them and the Beast player.\nThe Beast is playing a hand management and drafting game, to try to position their Bacteria to attack the Miner, and acquire Immune Response cards that can make the Miner player's life difficult.\nThe 2p game\nThe Miner begins, and rolls their dice. They then take an action with each one of those dice, removing Stomach cards from the digestive tract between the players, and at the end of their turn, whatever Bacteria is closest to them attacks!\nThe Beast then strategically refills the tract to cause the Miner the most difficulty, then may develop an Immune Response, refills their hand, and plays a Mutation card against the Miner, trying to match the Bacteria on it with the one that might attack the Miner at the end of their turn!\nIf the Miner collects 8 Crystals, they win outright. If one of the Beast's Bacteria tracks reaches the 4th level, the Beast wins immediately. If the deck of Stomach card runs out, points are counted, and whoever player has the most is the winner!\n\nThe 1p game\nSo, You've Been eaten. can be played as a solo game, either as the Miner (against a Hibernating Beast), or as the Beast (against a Robot Miner).\nAll actions remain the same. What changes is how their effects are triggered.\n\nThe 0p game\nNope, 0 players does not mean that the game will set up and play itself. And no, it probably does not count as a play if you decide to not play it. Yes, it does seem to fit the times we are now living in.\nHowever you look at it, having the two AIs play each other is possible, and a conversation starter for the non-board-game-geeks wandering near your shelf.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten. here.\nYou can download the rules of So, You've Been Eaten.: Dyspepto-Beastmol here.\nPlease download these files, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list. Regrettably, shipping to CIS and Brazil will not be possible. \n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which shipping costs may be paid and additional copies may be obtained.\nBackerkit carts will be locked and credit cards will be charged shortly before fulfillment commences. There will be backer updates that inform about all deadlines.\n\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for backers who pledge during the campaign being live. Post-campaign pre-order will likely be paying higher fees.\nShipping fees include costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nThe shipping costs per copy are as follows, and include tracking:\nBasic edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nPremium edition: USA - $9 / EU - $9 / Everywhere else - $14\nCollector edition: USA - $9 / EU - $14 / Everywhere else - $19\nUnfortunately backers in the UK, Switzerland, Norway and Canada do not fall in the EU and USA cost categories.\nThe USA cost category includes the \"lower 48\" states, and does not include Alaska, Hawaii, Guam & Puerto Rico. For these and for any other outlying territories, the \"everywhere else\" category applies. Please ask if in doubt.\nBackers (even $1 backers completing their pledge in Backerkit) will get the game with the discounted shipping costs outlined here. The cost will likely increase for post-campaign pre-orders. \nThe real costs that we have to pay are at least $12 for the USA, and $15 in the EU and worldwide - and that is not counting ocean freight and customs costs for us.\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these costs to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or any other convention.\n\nCOVID-19 Impact\nFulfillment providers worldwide are reporting that significant disruptions in deliveries persist in parts of the world. In practical terms this means that shipments to individual countries may be subject to delays.\nWe have taken what we now (March 2021) know into account when determining our production, logistics and fulfillment plans. However, it may happen that we may deviate from the schedule, and as noted in the Risks section, other backers may receive their rewards a lot earlier than you.\nWhen we have specific new information, we will reach out to backers, either via a backer update or individually, as the situation develops. In any case, please be prepared for delays, both in freight (before your reward is shipped), and after individual fulfillment has commenced. \n Retailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/so-youve-been-eaten/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available to retailers who have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. All entities and locations will be verified.\nRetailers within North America may also order from our distribution service provider Hit Point Sales, if signed up with an account. This would likely result in lower shipping costs (e.g. if ordering other games at the same time).\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\n\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\n\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order any editions normally available only on Kickstarter, subject to availability.\n\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: The game will be available through retailers that back the campaign and want the Collector edition. We hope to eventually send a version of the game to distribution.\nGame design: Scott Almes\nIllustration: Kwanchai Moriya\nGraphic design: Viktor Csete\nProject management: Dimitris \"JamesH\" Chatzidimitriou\nRulebook editing: Paul \"GamingRules\" Grogan\nSpecial thanks: Alvin Chen, David Turczi, Philipp K\u00fchnl, Paulo Renato, Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4, Toni Heinonen, Angela Viveen, Adam Singer, David \"Dam\" Amorin Garc\u00eda, and all those brave space miners who helped us develop this completely fictional game that is definitely not from a dystopian future.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns have been fulfilled, except \"Mr. Cabbagehead's Garden returns!\". Its production is initiated, and the project is on track to be completed on time. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final colors, graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We are working with retailers and due to that and the realities of international logistics, it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company.

All music, sound, and art assets have been created, leaving just the final few chapters to be written and edited by our in-house team. We need your support to finance the production of a physical book printing.\n\nWe've made our 40-page Adventure Preview available to everyone to get an early look into the world of Aetherra and its characters. Download it now.\nFano. Once a magnificent city upon the lake. Now a run-down sanctum for the destitute and the depraved. A quest to seek out a lost druid brings promise to restore the city to its former glory and awaken the ancient technology built within. Could Fano's awakening bring peace and prosperity once more, or will it unearth a conspiracy lurking in the shadows?\nThe Island City of Fano\n Aetherra is a fantastical world bound together by a raw elemental energy known as aether. A substance so profound that, when controlled, can power great cities with otherworldly technology, endow beings with the ability to manipulate the elements, and enrapture one with a lust so intense it consumes their very being.\nCrysal Lake, an impossibly deep caldera, keeps Aetherra's best-kept secret hidden: an aether deposit at the bottom of the Lake that joins directly to the aether core. Floating proudly above that secret is the island city of Fano. Once the prototype of symbiosis between mankind and aether, now the destitute remains of forgotten greatness.\nCrysal Lake Region Map\nIt's been generations since the inventors, a society of brilliant elves known only to historians as the Crysaleans, disappeared from Fano, taking the city's beating heart with them. Their disappearance is now a mystery as great as the outlandish architecture that supports this depraved city's crumbling walls.\nThe resolve of a young Indosian may present the spark of hope the citizens of Fano so desperately need: the hidden location of a fabled druid known as Gilgazo who belongs to an ancient order of sages devoted to mastering the instrumentation of aether. \nWill our heroes heed the call to recover the lost druid and save a city? And if they do, will they survive the journey?  \nThe Lost Druid is designed to deliver a deeply immersive gameplay experience utilizing a cinematic scene-based structure over traditional chapters. Every scene is meant to provide a unique mood as diverse environments are explored throughout the world of Aetherra. This feeling is primarily achieved through an audio accompaniment for each scene that provides both an ambient sound bed and an original composition, scored explicitly to construct the intended atmosphere for each scene.\nScene Guide\nAt the beginning of each scene is a QR code that can be scanned to navigate quickly to the corresponding audio. Links, like this one, can also be found in the scene's footer for easy access to the audio component from anywhere within the scene.\nEnvironmental Visual\nIn addition to audio, each scene includes a unique visual that captures the essence of the environment and is meant to be presented to players while they experience the scene. This environment is presented in the book at the beginning of each scene and is also available in high resolution static or motion cinemagraph for casting to a shared display at your physical table or virtual tabletop.\nAppendix\nScenes are deliberately constructed to be concise, enabling the GM to run them at a glance with minimal preparation. Mechanics, tangential story details, and elements of lore are off-loaded to a comprehensive appendix to maintain an easily scannable scene structure.\nAudiovisual Experience\nEach scene is designed individually with a distinct feel based on its intended story content. Some settings have a higher propensity for combat and therefore come with additional themes to support an action sequence. Others are more dramatic and come with themes to amplify a suspenseful moment or create a sense of space by shifting ambiance from an exterior to an interior perspective.\nThe Lost Druid comes with over 2 hours of original music to support your adventure in Aetherra, composed by acclaimed recording artist Jessy Ribordy. Each composition is handcrafted utilizing film-quality audio production tools, sounds effects, instrumentation, and recorded performances.\nJessy Ribordy (Composer)\nScene compositions are explicitly written to support long-form RPG gameplay with indistinguishable repeat and sonic variance, allowing tracks to loop for extended periods without feeling monotonous or repetitive.\nListen to the complete Main Title Theme above.\nThe Lost Druid is the first release in a series of multiple planned adventure modules that will take place within the original campaign setting, Lore of Aetherra. Instead of publishing a Campaign Setting supplement, our approach to building the world of Aetherra is through exploring its stories, locations, and characters. Each subsequent adventure will occur in a new area and traverse new concepts that build toward an expansive story world that will continue to grow over time.\nWe aim to make this approach possible by emphasizing the development of extensive lore throughout the adventure. The Lost Druid contains three in-world lore books written by non-player characters within Aetherra that your players can discover throughout the campaign. Lore books, once found, can be distributed to your players through individual PDFs and are also appended to the back of the physical book. We believe this world-building method enables players to take in as much or as little of the lore as they wish and still enjoy the setting.\nIncludes five pre-made playable character builds\nIncluded with The Lost Druid, are five pre-made Player Character builds with original artwork, custom backgrounds that fit within the world of Aetherra, and balanced starter stats. Enabling quick-start, out-of-the-box gameplay.\n*Based on currently completed content and assets. These numbers will likely increase.\nMr. Tarrasque Kickstarter Preview\nJoin RPG content reviewer, Mr Tarrasque as he walks through the Adventure Preview, samples the digital asset pack, and shares his thoughts.\nHelpful Goat Gaming Live-play One-shot\nWatch as the kind and talented humans at Helpful Goat play through a one-shot of the Adventure Preview on the Alchemy RPG platform.\nBob World Builder Quick Look\nBob World Builder shares a few thoughts on the features of the adventure in his video about the Pros & Cons of big campaign books.\nKickstarter Preview\nJoin Jeff McAleer over at The Gaming Gang as he walks through the Adventure Preview, samples the digital asset pack, and shares his thoughts.\nAlchemy RPG Platform\nAlchemy RPG, created by Chris Eddie and Isaac Overacker, is a revolutionary new way to play tabletop role-playing games online by providing a deeply immersive, cinematic experience to support a more \"theater of the mind\" style of gameplay. Designed to be both beautiful and intuitive, the Alchemy platform provides a truly unique alternative to today's virtual tabletop.\nA new gameplay experience requires a new approach to content creation. Early on in our development process, we made the critical decision to fork our efforts and develop both platform and content in parallel. As Super Mario was for the Nintendo, we aim to make Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid the catalyst to set the Alchemy platform's standard.\nAlchemy may provide the richest way to experience this adventure. Still, we also know that it won't be for everyone, which is why we're developing a physical version, PDF, and a digital asset pack to enjoy on your favorite virtual tabletop.\nJessy Ribordy is the Creative Director at Alchemy RPG. With almost two decades of experience in music and writing, he began his professional career as frontman and songwriter of the indie rock band Falling Up and has since expanded into composing for film and television. Inspired by both songwriting and storytelling, coupled with a passion for developing lore, Jessy is now using his creative talents to bring Aetherra to life in a truly unique way.\n Cole Nordin is an RPG book hoarder, professional Kickstarter, and the resident Game Designer at Alchemy RPG. A renewable energy engineer by day and Dungeon Master by night, Cole brings a lifetime of knowledge, passion, and experience crafting balanced game mechanics and narrative design to create the interactive backbone for the story world of Aetherra.\n Chris Eddie is the co-founder and designer of the Alchemy RPG platform. For over 13 years, he has worked as a Lead Product Designer for some of the world's most loved user experiences, including Amazon Music, Google Search, and currently, Netflix. Now Chris is bringing everything he's learned about designing world-class products to build a beautiful and intuitive role-playing experience within the world of Aetherra.\n Stu Harrington, a rogue paint slinger, is the Lead Artist and Art Director for Alchemy RPG. With over ten years of experience working in game art and fantasy illustration, he is currently one of the Senior Illustrators at Hi-Rez Studios doing splash art and concept design for games like Smite. A passionate artist, long-time gamer, and avid Dungeons & Dragons fan, Stu brings his expertise to make the world of Aetherra visually come to life.\n\nAdditional Artists\nHelen Ilnytska, Leon Tukker, Daniel Hasenbos, Jeff Langevin, Hanzel Haro, Max Schiller, Nargas Jafari, and Jordan Kerbow.\nEvery backer of Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid will receive exclusive access to playtest materials throughout the adventure book's final development phase. As a backer, you will be invited to join the private playtester channel on the Alchemy RPG Discord, where we will share in-progress PDFs of various game mechanics, story details, artwork, and music, allowing you to weigh in on the final adventure.\nAs a special thanks, all backers who join the playtest group will also receive credit with their names printed in the Lore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid book and PDF.\nWe'll be shipping worldwide! \nCharges will be collected once the campaign has ended through our pledge manager, BackerKit. Please note, pledge prices do not include shipping. Consult the chart below for estimated shipping prices but be aware that these costs may vary based on address and the state of shipping prices at the time of fulfillment.\nThank you...\nRegardless of the outcome of this campaign, we want to give a heartfelt thank you to a few folks who helped make it possible. Thank you to my sweet friends Lindsay Giebel and Hanzel Haro for making us a beautiful video. And thank you to Tyler Crumrine for being the epitome of what makes the TRPG community so wonderful by sharing his wisdom and advice with us. Make sure to check out his upcoming Kickstarter too!\nAnd thank you to those who choose to believe in this project with their support. It means the world to us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreative Production\nAs of March 2021, our creative team is roughly 3/4 of the way finished with the end-to-end adventure. All primary art and audio for the core 12-scene experience is complete and ready to ship, mitigating the potential for long lead times or extraordinary costs due to outsourced creative services. The work that remains is the final draft, editing, and layout of the book's last three scenes, which our in-house team has projected to complete in the next four months. (July 2021)\n\nManufacturing & Fulfillment\nThe manufacturing of physical goods can come with a wide variety of risks and challenges. That's why we're working with one of the best (not the cheapest) book manufacturers available: The Friesens Corporation. Friesens specializes in high-volume, art-book quality printing and customer service. We're working directly with an assigned representative (Hi Elise!) on every detail of our order, from paper weight to freight.\n\nWe also understand the various challenges that come with international shipping and order fulfillment. That's why we won't be stuffing envelopes in our living rooms and making trips to the post office. Instead, we're working with the professionals at Funagain Logistics to ensure that parcels are properly packed, shipped, and routed through the best possible shipping routes throughout the world. Funagain's operation is also local to us, which will enable strong in-person communication and collaboration (if necessary) throughout the fulfillment process.\n\nFirst-Time Publishing\nLore of Aetherra: The Lost Druid is our first publication, and of course, this has come with several learning opportunities and challenges that we've had and will likely continue to have until its completion. But it also means that we have everything to prove in doing whatever we can to create the highest quality product and deliver it on-time. We have put forth a significant amount of up-front investment and effort to arrive at this position, and we will do whatever it takes to earn your trust, fandom, and repeat support for many more projects to come.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nPrinting Industries of America (PIA) has awarded Friesens over 80 Premier Print Awards including multiple Benjamin Franklin awards (the \u2018Benny\u2019) for best printing in the world.

With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case.\nWith this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to:\n Create complex, different, and surprising puzzles that will blow your mind.\nImagine a more sophisticated story capable of immersing you in a complete narrative experience.\nFocus on investing in the quality and design of the materials to bring you a more dynamic and wider gameplay time experience.\nMake the game arrive all over the world.\n\nAfter the success of our first project Hack Forward, we want to give you a gaming experience as immersive as the first but, this time, focusing on another famous genre. Face the challenge by yourself or with a trustworthy group.\nThe box is the heart of the project where you will find the materials that serve as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.\nHere you will find some examples of the puzzles and objects hidden in the box to solve the challenges that the adventure requires:\nTraditional puzzles\nSimilar to those found in the traditional Escape Rooms: Logic puzzles, reveal messages, interact with objects, use pencil and paper\u2026\n\nImmersive / Digital puzzles\nPuzzles that will make you doubt the boundaries between reality and fiction; exploring websites, news, videos, or spying on security cameras. Even in some cases, you will have to use everyday tools such as your email, social networks, chats, or mobile phone\u2026\n Investigation puzzles \nPuzzles in which you will have to consult and review the different clues and inconsistencies between the suspects, investigate old cases, compare different publications or objects and find the necessary evidence to solve the crimes committed ... or prevent them from being committed.\nAdvanced Puzzles\nIf we manage to reach certain stretch goals, we can add more complex, sophisticated puzzles, which could include magnets, embarking on missions in the real world, receiving phone calls, and higher quality components to get a more realistic and stunning experience, among other amazing surprises.\n\n*In order to avoid spoiling your experience, some of the puzzles shown above are examples. \n\n\nIf you want to get a taste of the inmersion of the game here you have the chance for free. The DEMO can be completed totally online without the box but it\u2019s nothing compared to the whole experience with the box.\n\nIn this new adventure, you will have to put all your deductive and investigative skills to the test because what seemed like an average case has become a twisted game.\nYour role will be to stop and unmask the terrible plans of a distinguished psychopath master of manipulation and specialist in the deepest and darkest instincts that guide the actions of the human being.\nYour passion for solving puzzles has made you fall into their disturbed game and all attention is focused on you. Who is behind all this? Why? If you like detective plots and crime movies and series, get ready because you are about to experience one for yourself.\nThe case will be divided into 8 chapters. Each one has its own objective and different challenges that can be completed in 1 hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all in a row or you can take a break and play another day.\n\nAt Key Enigma, we have decided to surprise you and test your and our community skills through an international treasure hunt.\nWHAT DO YOU NEED TO KNOW ?:\nWe have hidden 4 boxes in different parts of the world.\nEach one hides enigmas and puzzles that complement each other, this means that a box cannot be completely solved until the others are found.\nYou need to solve ALL OF THEM for the community to have access to the final prize.\nAnyone can take part in this treasure hunt, the reward will unlock a Stretch Goal on the Kickstarter.\nYou will find the keys to their locations at the end of the DEMO.\nYou have until May 6 to find and solve all the treasures to unlock the prize.\nShipping is charged after Kickstarter ends with a pledge manager.\nYour exact shipping address will be collected after the Kickstarter ends and we get close to the delivery date.\nThe European Union, USA will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes. We will be using fulfillment center partners to ship locally for each country.\nOutside of the EU, USA we cannot guarantee customs friendly shipping in these areas. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country's governmental agencies and/or shipping partners that will be your responsibility.\nShipping approximate prices:\nSpain: 4\u20ac\nEurope: 9\u20ac (for most countries)\nUK: 12\u20ac (11\u00a3)\nUSA: 18\u20ac ($20)\nCanada: 15\u20ac ($22 CAD)\nRest of the world: 35\u20ac  ($38)\n\nNote that this shipping prices are for the Calling Card base game, if you purchased any add-on, the shipping price could increase. \nWe will send our games inside a cardboard shipping box in order to protect the game box as much as possible.\n\n\nWe are a startup that aims to launch different Immersive Escape Games themes (Terror, Adventure, Detective,...) that resemble the Escape Room experience but right in your home.\nOr even explore the possibilities of launching a subscription box with bi-monthly shippings.\nBut this project can only be carried if we get enough support through Kickstarter.\nWhy do we do it?\nAs big fans of Escape Rooms and Escape Games sometimes we encountered limitations for playing as often as we wished. And in times of Coronavirus, these limitations have undoubtedly increased.\nMobility restrictions\nEscape Room activity at 30% or 50%\nLockdowns\nThat is why we want to propose an alternative so that you can enjoy a good escape experience:\n Location: Most of the time we are limited to playing in our city or surroundings, and assembling a group of friends to go to a faraway Escape Room seems impossible.  Key Enigma box is at the best location: your home.\n   Variety & Innovation: Once you have played many traditional Escape Rooms they all start feeling the same. Our game is a breath of fresh air that will surprise you.\n   Cost: Escape Rooms are expensive! Our game is a fraction of the price.\n   Main Inspirations\nThe night of October 30th 1938 gave us the most famous radio broadcast in history: \"War of the Worlds\" by Orson Welles.\nOrson Welles certainly understood all the possibilities radio could offer and knew how to use it to carry out a very different entertainment experience from what people were used to. What we want to do now is to present a similar experience using the multiple communication options we have available nowadays.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: you can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we have prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal of \u20ac38.000, you will enable us to develop the game from start to finish in every detail according to our vision.\nThe amount of money you spend will only be collected if we reach our goal you will receive your rewards once the game is released. However, if we fail to reach our goal, your contribution won't be charged.\nThis is not our first rodeo, Albert Benitez former co-founder and CEO of Stream Hatchet, knows how to handle deadlines, and has a very specific plan of attack for this new project. And the amazing team that surrounds him has experience writing novels and scripts from start to finish and they also build Escape Rooms in their city. The team has the skills necessary to complete the vision of the company.\n\nOur biggest challenges to complete the game are:\nManufacturing and design: we want to make this game available at an affordable price. We have to talk with lots of providers and get a fair price because we want to include quality components, physical objects and elaborate puzzles.\n \nTechnology: we must form a credible digital universe in addition to testing and programming web pages, chats, email responses,\u2026 These components are being developed in house to bring the prices down due to the experience we have elaborating similar technological projects.\n \nNarrative: We want to naturally blend narrative, puzzles and technology to form a credible and immersive story given the tight budget\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac89 or more", "title": "The Game", "descp": "EN: You will get our Game (10% discount off retail price)\n*Shipping is not included and will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign.\n---\nESP: Recibir\u00e1s nuestro juego (10% de descuento respecto al precio de venta)\n*Los gastos de env\u00edo no est\u00e1n incluidos y se cargar\u00e1n en nuestro \"pledge manager\" despu\u00e9s de la campa\u00f1a.\nINCLUDES:\nCalling Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac120 or more", "title": "The Game - Deluxe Edition", "descp": "**Kickstarter Exclusive**\nEN: This limited edition includes the base game + 3 deluxe artifacts + deluxe packaging.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Grab that Victorian outfit from your closest and join the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future on a time traveling adventure. You'll play tricks to each time period as you try to outwit your fellow travelers and collect enough wreaths to decorate all the holiday doors.\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a new version of the acclaimed hard-to-find Japanese game \"Time Palatrix\" by Taiki Shinzawa. Have you ever played \"spades\" or \"hearts\" and thought \"I wish this game had time travel?\"\nAll in a small 5 x 5 x 2 inch box\n\nGhosts of Christmas is a trick taking game where you play cards into three separate tricks: past, present, and future. You visit all three locations in a single round, and winning tricks in one time period could help you win more in the future!\n\nThe gameplay remains the same, but with a new optional variant for a more relaxed game.\nTwelve colorful characters inspired by A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens.\n\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nTaylor is an avid player of trick taking games and has a YouTube channel dedicated to them. Ghosts of Christmas can sound confusing at first, but Taylor does a great job explaining how it all works.\nPlease Note: Prototype components are shown in the video. The final version will have some minor changes.\n\nAlso please note: This is one of the most creative Kickstarter preview videos we've ever seen. Give it a chance. You won't be disappointed.\n#1 Meeeaty - Some trick taking games are relaxing affairs. Play your highest card and hope for the best. In Ghosts of Christmas, there are multiple ways to approach each round and use brain cells.\n#2 Ripple Effects - When you don't have the cards to win in a straightforward way, sometimes you can engineer a change in who wins the \"Past\" trick in order to make the \"Present\" and \"Future\" trick work out better for you.\n#3 Dials - They're both fun and informative. A great visual way for everyone to keep track of which suit they can play to each ghost.\n#4 Different Variants/Difficulty Levels - If you want a more low stress evening (or you are just learning), play the variant without bidding. If you think you've mastered the game, try playing one of the TWO variants with the \"Beyond\" ghost that add even more options.\n#5 Bidding Options - Speaking of bidding, the ability to place an \"exact bid\" or a \"wiggle room bid\" gives you the option to play it safe or really go for that high score each round. \n#6 Small Box - It's a fact. Games in smaller boxes take up less room on your shelf, get taken to more game nights, and get played more. This is a small box game. (We work to keep even our \"big boxes\" pretty small.)\n\nPut on your hard hat and install factory tiles in this fast, furious and fun game of factory planning. Connect your tiles to build the best possible production chains. Whoever makes the most profitable factory wins!\nEfficiently packed into our 10.8 x 6.8 x 2.75 inch box\nLike Ghosts of Christmas, we're republishing this cult-classic by Corn\u00e9 van Moorsel because it deserves a wider audience. The gameplay will stay the same (if it ain't broke...), but it has brand new art.\n\nOur Touch:\n1. Added a sixth player\n2. Official variant to play without the quick grab element. Details TBD but will definitely be a part of the game.\n3. Added unique names and logos to each of the six company boards and score tokens to make the game more thematic and improve accessibility for color blind players.\n\nPlay solo, with a full table of six players, or anywhere in between.\nWhat's your favorite machine name?\n\nIt's a puzzle, but not a jigsaw puzzle. Like a \"How am I going to connect all of these? Did you just take the machine I wanted? I have no use for blue! Let's play again. I think I get it now.\" kind of puzzle.\nUnique names improve theming and accessibility\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game shown in this review is the original Factory Funner. Our version has the same gameplay, but all new artwork, and support for a 6th player.\n#1 Quick grabbing is rewarded - This game doesn't have analysis paralysis. When the machines are flipped over at the start of the turn, you have to decide which one you want. Too slow and someone will take your machine. Too fast and you will grab one that you thought would work ... but didn't.\n#2 Non-real-time variant - What about groups who don't like that real-time part of the game? We really think that is the best way to play, but we realize it isn't a fun or even possible option for everyone. We're including an alternative rule that removes all the speed elements and is still fun (in a different way).\n#3 Making it work - At some point during your game, someone at the table will be quiet for 30 seconds. Then they will announce, \"I think I can make it work.\" Pipes start getting laid. Reservoirs are moved around. The table will laugh at how ridiculous their factory looks. And in a few turns you will know if what they did was smart or short sighted.\n#4 You Will Improve - You might not be good at this game the first time you play it. You will get better. You will learn. You will overcome. And it will be rewarding.\n#5 Bad Grammar - Factory FunNER is the sequel and a very solid improvement to Factory Fun. It uses hexes instead of squares to allow more creative building, and some subtle improvements to scoring, length, and machine placement rules really improve things.\n#6 Solo Mode - You can play this game by yourself. Never know when that might come in handy.\n#7 On Tour - Factory Funner has a lot of similarities to our other game \"On Tour\".  It shares the roller coaster emotions and intuitive gameplay.  Whether you're building an optimized route, or installing the most efficient machines, you'll feel the same tension and joy of making it all work out.\n\nNote: Our game will NOT be an exact duplicate from these reviews, but the core gameplay will stay the same.\nZee Garcia's Kickstarter Pick of the Week | Dice Tower\nTurn into a high-flying stock trader as you work against the other players to control the market, buy and short stock, and make the most money.\nHave you been pumping cash into GameStop? Want to have the fun of making big bets without risking real cash?\nYou're going to thoroughly enjoy this brand new game that will bring you into the exciting and crazy world of buying and shorting stocks.\n*No financial knowledge required\n** Really does play within 60 minutes \nOur standard box size: 10.8 x 6.8 x 2 inch\nBear Raid is designed by Ryan Courtney, the same mind behind two other mind-bending games, Pipeline and Curious Cargo.\nThese are four of the character you can play as. What should the other two be? Leave your ideas in the comments.\nFor those who are wondering about the name, Bear Raid is a real phrase used to describe when a stock price is intentionally lowered through short selling and rumors.\nClick to view pdf. (This is a draft, not a final version.)\nPlease Note: The game in this video is a prototype and the final version will have some adjustments.\n\nAlso Please Note: We're super excited that Jac, who does not normally make board game videos, agreed to do one for Bear Raid since she's the most passionate person in the world about this game. She is responsible for getting Chad (Owner of BoardGameTables.com) to play Bear Raid and ultimately publish it. Part of Kickstarter is authenticity, so we wanted you to hear from a real fan.\nLater during the campaign, Chad will be interviewing Ryan Courtney about some of the different strategies in Bear Raid. We will post that here after the interview.\nSubmit a fake news headline and win a copy of the game!\nWe're hosting a contest over on Reddit.com/r/BoardGames where you can submit some ideas for a fake headline that will be used for one of the forecast cards in the game!\nEnter today! \u2192\n#1 Shorting Stock - Not many games let you do this. It is so much fun to short stock and then drive the stock down.\n#2 42 Dice & Event Interaction - Not a lot of luck (but some luck). 48 dice. It is a lot. It's not just a matter of chucking dice and moving the prices. Each company has dice, and they interact with different \"event cards\" every turn. It's a cool mechanic that lets you get a glimpse of what might happen next turn, but not a perfect picture.\n#3 Controlling What's Rolled - Not all the dice are rolled. You can influence what gets rolled. Leave dice on a company or take them back. Leave dice behind your screen or add them to the bag. These decisions are just as important as buying or shorting the stock.\n#4 Unspoken Alliances - There's not negotiation. But sometimes you will find you can go further if you and a \"partner\" work together. Maybe one person can't bankrupt a company by themselves, but two people working together can. Just watch out. Most partners want to do about 40% of the work and leave the other 60% for you.\n#5 Quick - Many financial/economic games are long, but Bear Raid packs all that action into 60 minutes.\n#6 Q.E. - Although our other financial game QE is certainly a different game, we really enjoy the genre. We think great financial board games are really under-the-radar. Wouldn't you agree?\n#7 Surprisingly Funny - You expect silly games to be funny. You don't expect a stock market game to have humor in both the gameplay and player's reactions to it. You could almost call it a party game.\n#7 Bears - Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.\nSave 25% off the future MSRP!\nFor the gamers who want the absolute best from every game, you're in luck!\nWood components for the most handled pieces of Ghosts of Christmas and Bear Raid feel better in your hand.

In this way, every Co-Creator will reach the inverted eight, which happens to be the magical symbol of Infinity.\n\n\n\n\nBesides the above-listed eight monumental foundations on which EXITUS is built, it also has the following 10 important characteristics:\nCovid-19 has made the last year terribly hard for everybody, so we\u2019ve decided that our base package should cost just 17 EUR (and 12 EUR for any additional game) and within this price, we offer not the usual 1 hour \u201cEscape the Room\u201d game, but 10+ hours of puzzles, challenges, storytelling, and fun.\nAnd to all our future Co-Creators who are willing to choose a higher pledge level \u2013 THANK YOU!\nEach of you will not only get additional special extras but will also support us and our immense effort.\nOur goal is to make participation in the project as easy as possible, so the payment will be one-time and will take place on Kickstarter. This includes also the shipping costs when ordering the Co-Creator \u201eARTE FACTA\u201d reward level. \nIMPORTANT: When you pledge for the \"Arte Facta\"  Reward Level, the delivery price will be automatically added at the time of the pre-order. If you get a message that your country is not eligible for delivery, write us a personal message and we will check if we will be able to add your country of residence to the list.\n\n* (Lat.) an object that is made by a person, such as a tool or a decoration, especially one that is of historical interest.\nA set of FOUR mysterious, beautiful, and purely hand-made artefacts, included in the ARTE FACTA Reward Level.\nThis is the accessory that served as an inspiration for the magic bracelets worn by the main characters in the saga.\nIt\u2019s a bracelet with a unique design, hand-woven using a specific technique, and 414 precise needlepoint stitches. It features the Elbetitsa figure in which are coded several ancient symbols of health, wealth, and harmony.\nElbetitsa is one of the oldest images found in the solar calendars of many peoples and exists as a symbol in almost all of the main ancient religions in the world.\nApart from being an elegant accessory, the bracelet is A CLUE and unlocks an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more unique puzzle.\nThe bracelet is unisex and comfortable to wear on the left or the right hand.\nBoth medallions bear the original design that inspired the images on the amulets that protect Marc and Zo\u00e9 during their adventure. They feature two ancient runic symbols dated back to the 1st century CE and found in many different written records across the world.\nThe material they are made of is pieces of wild cherry wood remaining after the making of furniture and usually thrown away as waste.\nOur master craftsman buys these beautiful pieces of waste wood directly from the furniture factory and turns them into hand-made works of art.\nBoth accessories are unisex, extremely comfortable to wear, with soft fabric necklaces.\nEach of the medallions is A CLUE to an additional and self-contained chapter in the game where you can find yet one more riddle.\nA top-secret object that will remain hidden until you receive it. What we can say now, however, is that it's created by us personally and for you to be able to solve its secret, it will require some extra courage because it could be even a little dangerous.\nThis item is accompanied by an additional and hidden story chapter, plus the clever hints if you need some help while solving the puzzle.\nThe challenges in EXITUS have been designed in such a way that they can be solved by one person or group of people.\n*If you prefer to read the story at your leisure and solve the puzzles by yourself \u2013 you do that.\n*If you want to share your enjoyment of the game with those close to you \u2013 your friends or family, you can do that as well.\nEXITUS is a game that illustrates the way an epic novel transforms into an unforgettable interactive experience when it is integrated with unique riddles, mysterious physical artefacts, music, sounds, portraits, graphics, and more.\nEXITUS is a lengthy pleasure which, depending on the speed of reading and of solving riddles, can even last for few days. That\u2019s why every time you close the EXITUS App, your last position will be saved automatically and when you next open the game, you\u2019ll continue from the point where you last left off.\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded EXITUS App on your phone or tablet, you can go on to read the story and enjoy the music, sound effects, portraits, graphics, hints, the answers to the riddles \u2013 and in general, play the whole game from the beginning to the end.\nWithout internet. Everywhere. No limitations.\nYou\u2019ve been solving the riddles quite well; you are ahead with the story and are becoming more and more involved in its complications when suddenly \u2026 your progress is blocked by a puzzle for which you need a hint.\nAnd while you\u2019re frantically searching the internet for a helpful clue or waiting for another player to advise you on your next action, your initial excitement melts away and never comes back the way it was.\nWith EXITUS the above scenario is impossible.\nIf you need a hint, it\u2019s at your disposal at any moment because all hints, together with all the answers, can be found in EXITUS App and are always just one click away.\nThis allows you to choose your own tempo at which to move ahead in the game, as well as to make your own decision when or whether to use a hint.\n\nEXITUS doesn\u2019t come out of nothing.\nEXITUS is part of the world\u2019s first multilingual Challenge Book Game Series and although it has been created as a fully self-contained and independent game to be played with no prior preparation, the first two parts of the series come as a free bonus accompanying it. They contain the exciting prehistory of the events making up the story of EXITUS.\nIn addition, concealed in each one of these two mobile gamebooks are 12 challenging riddles.\nIf you want to trace the whole epic story from its very beginning, then Vol. 1 \u2013 PRAELUDIUM and Vol. 2 \u2013 CODEX are available to you completely free and they challenge you.\nDownload our first two Interactive Book Games - The Prehistory:\nGoogle Play  and  App Store\n\n\n\u0415XITUS will be available worldwide! If you have an email address and access to Google Play or App Store, you will surely receive and be able to play EXITUS, no matter where in the world you are.\n\n\n\n\nWe have some creative ideas for additional extras because our Co-Creators deserve the right to get truly and fully involved in the creation process of EXITUS.\nAnd to make this theme-related and exciting, every single new Stretch Goal will be accompanied and enhanced by a dedicated CHALLENGE in form of a riddle, puzzle, brainteaser, important Co-Creator's voting (watch out for these!), and other fun activities. So, for any new Stretch Goal, which will appear here, there will be a new Campaign Update where you can find out more about the challenge and how to get involved.\nUNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS:\nIf you like our approach, appreciate our effort, and want to support the campaign, the only thing we ask of you in return is to be active and share those challenges wherever and with whomever, you think appropriate and, in this way, to help us spread the word about our campaign.\nThe more backers we have, the more awesome extras we can put into EXITUS.\nHelp us reach more people!\nIN THIS VIDEO YOU CAN MEET US AND FOLLOW OUR STORY:\nFor many months now we\u2019ve been working hard, applying all the experience we have gained as creators and managers of two successful Escape the Room games, followed by those two unique virtual gamebooks:\nThis Kickstarter campaign is our PERSONAL INVITATION to all the fans of unusual, innovative, and exciting challenges.\nIf you\u2019re one of those people, now is the time to join us!\nBecome a Co-Creator of EXITUS and help us create a game that is an exciting challenge to the mind and a unique treat to the senses.\n\nWe rely on a solid and experienced team of professionals with proven expertise in their fields and with whom we\u2019ve already worked on our previous games. They are wonderful people, and we trust them unconditionally because with time, we\u2019ve become more than collaborators \u2013 we\u2019ve become friends.\nThe names of all those who have helped EXITUS to become a reality will be ceremoniously announced in the completed project and will remain part of it forever.\nEditors, translators, programmers, graphic designers, artists, puzzle testers, sound-recording experts, and \u2026 YOU. Because only with the support you give now will EXITUS become a reality, while we promise that the final result will very likely exceed all your expectations.\n\nTo make it as simple and easy as possible, for the Add-ons we will use the built-in option in Kickstarter.\nEach of our Co-Creators will have the chance to add to their pledge more additional EXITUS base packages at the exclusive price of only 12 EUR per game. \nSo, if you want to make a gift to a friend or family member, for the price of 12 EUR you will offer her or him something truly special - one unforgettable experience.\n\n\n\nThe packaging and sending of the rewards which include the ARTE FACTA Set will be done by a team of our own and directly monitored by us.\nIn principle, we can send those rewards to almost any country in the world. However, in view of the current situation dictated by a global pandemic, there may be some problems in receiving the package. If you believe that the country in which you live does not have a trusted postal system, you can choose a pledge level that does not require shipping.\nIMPORTANT: When you pledge for the \"Arte Facta\"  Reward Level, the delivery price will be automatically added at the time of your pre-order.

We do not expect any problems in completing the final version of the game because over 90% of it has already been created. \nHowever, when it comes to a multi-layered project like ours, there are certain parts of the process we cannot control. For example, unexpected illness of a team member, delay in the manufacturing process, global pandemic situation, or some force majeure circumstance. \nThat said, we promise that we will do absolutely everything we can to overcome any problem that arises, so we can fulfill our commitment to all our Co-Creators by delivering them the best possible version of EXITUS.

However, all decisions on part replacements due to damage occurred during delivery will be made at our discretion and on a case-by-case basis. \n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS: If you refuse to accept and/or collect your package on arrival, we cannot issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge. \n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY: Surveys will be completed through Kickstarter.

Updated shipping costs:\nUS: $5\nUK: \u00a35\nEU: \u00a315\nThese prices may fluctuate of course, but that's the best estimate we can give right now. I hope these reduced costs allow more European backers to participate in this exciting project!\n$3500 Budget \nPiechart showing budget breakdowns\n $1,000 - Bone Marshes\n $1,000 - Patron's Cookbook\n $230 - Shortsword\n $630 - Barrow Keep\n $350 - Kickstarter Fees\n $290 - MISC (Joe Banner will be reviewing the print files and Richard will update PDFs for accessibility). \nThis is a decentralized printing run.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Relive the legendary Battle of Waterloo!\nExperience the third game in Hall or Nothing's award-winning Historic Epic Battle System (HEBS) card game series.\n18th June 1815, Napoleon Bonaparte is determined to rise back to power and claim all of Europe as his prize. But the forces led by an unassuming yet undefeated Arthur Wellesley and his charismatic Prussian ally Bl\u00fccher are amassing to stop Napoleon in his tracks.\nPlayers: 1-2 (up to 4 with additional sets)\nTime: 30-40 minutes\nAges: 10+ \n \u201cThe French system of conscription brings together a fair sample of all classes; ours is composed of the scum of the earth\u2014the mere scum of the earth. It is only wonderful that we should be able to make so much out of them afterwards\u201d \u2013 \nNotes of conversations with the Duke of Wellington, Philip Henry, 5th Earl Stanhope \n1815, Scum of the Earth is an asymmetric, competitive, tactical card game. It is the third game in the critically acclaimed Historic Epic Battle System, and successor to the award-winning games 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay.\nDeeply thematic, but richly and lovingly researched, 1815, Scum of the Earth presents the Battle of Waterloo as you've never seen it before.\nSince we hit \u00a390,261, peeps we'll have some special guests from Kilforth join us in the game too...\nFor the first time, you will now be able to play the Historic Epic Battle System (HEBS) with up to 4 players providing you have more than one base set!\nThere are normally only two leaders in each HEBS game, but the additional two bonus leaders included with every copy of 1815, Scum of the Earth \u2013 Prussian Field Marshal Bl\u00fccher and French Marshal Ney \u2013 allow you to play with 3-4 players when using two core games.\nWith two core games you will battle over 6 Frontiers, side by side with an ally \u2013 you can pass troops to each other via your Reserves, as well as being able to target either of your foes with events and abilities.\nYou can also play multiplayer by using and/or mixing 1815, Scum of the Earth with other previous HEBS games too. So if you want to, for example, pit Napoleon's armies of 1815, Scum of the Earth against the Ottomans of 1565, St. Elmo's Pay, now's your chance!\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth, each player, as either the Duke of Wellington or Napoleon (and/or Bl\u00fccher and Michel Ney), musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before their armies clash in an epic battle over three farms forward of the ridge at Waterloo: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte.\nEvery arresting card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play, and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins. \nRelive the bloody Battle of Waterloo and the tumultuous events leading up to it, and stamp your mark on the history of the world... \nFrom the team behind the lauded Kilforth series of Fantasy Quest Games, Shadows of Kilforth and Gloom of Kilforth (Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Game of the Year Award winner) and 1066, Tears to Many Mothers (the beautiful game that launched the Historic Epic Battle System), 1815, Scum of the Earth is the ultimate card game of war and history. \nHall or Nothing awards\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth both players race against each other to overcome a series of asymmetrical historical objectives that the British Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley and the Emperor of the French, Napoleon Bonaparte had to overcome in order to battle each other at Waterloo. Returning from exile after his defeat at Leipzig, Napoleon is set to take on Europe yet again, and the fate of the world is in your hands!\n1815, Scum of the Earth is an asymmetric, competitive tactical card game in the style of Magic the Gathering but non-collectable. The complete game is in the box. Striking artwork complements sumptuous production values. All character names are taken directly from history. \nAs with all of our games 1815, Scum of the Earth is Solo Friendly. The game and all the cards contained in it are fully playable solo, and an 'AI' Foe with varying levels of difficulty for the enemy player has been developed in partnership with an expert team of solo players from the One Player Guild on boardgamegeek led by the great Paul Ibbs. Some cards even have solo specific effects too!\nThe Solo rules can be found here. \nSolo Against Multiple Foes?!\nFeeling particularly tough? Want to take on two Foes at once? With two core sets you can now play solo against two Foes simultaneously, each of varying difficulty if you so choose! Find out what it was like for Napoleon to take on the cunning of Wellington and Bl\u00fccher at the same time. Or reverse the situation and play as Marshal Ney and Napoleon against only Wellington, for example.\nUPDATE: We've also cleaned up the setup for solo play so you can now speed through the early game by getting to the cards your Foe can play much more quickly.\nThe first game in the series, 1066, Tears to Many Mothers won Game of the Year and Best Art awards and was a runner up in the Golden Geek and Origins Awards for 'Best Historical Board Game'. 1565, St. Elmo's Pay won the Dice Tower Seal of Approval as well as Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Must Play award.\n1815, Scum of the Earth honours this heady legacy whilst breathing new life into the system with all new and original art, all new characters, all new units, all new historical stories, and featuring brand new card abilities too...\n 3-4 Players (with 2 sets): Channel soldiers into your ally's battlefield \n Revamped Solo Play: Cleaner setup + battle multiple Foes! \n HEBS Weather Deck Expansion: Battlefield conditions that affect both sides! \n Squares, Lines, Columns: Historical formations for troops! \n Napoleon's Grand Battery: Invincible French cannons! \n Ridge Defenders: Educe Wellington's tactics to save your soldiers! \n Mired: Soak your enemies in mud and rain! \n Duelling: Target specific units to grind your foes to dust! \n Fated Characters: Powerful heroes whose deaths bring consequences!  \n Brothers-In-Arms: Killer units who bring their friends with them! \n Iron Will: Play units into stacks to double their effectiveness! \n Boost Rosettes: Pay more resources to power up cards as you play them! \n Reserves: Summon units into your Reserves, or even onto your allies' battlefields! \n and many more!\nTo combine with other existing (and future) games in the HEBS series, such as 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay each player simply chooses a faction from any box to play as. So the Knights of Malta from 1565 could battle the Saxons from 1066, or even the French from 1815!\nIn 1815, Scum of the Earth, each round players take turns to play cards and build their armies. Play units, characters, tactics, attachments, and events, all based on the real figures, weapons, and occurrences that resulted in Napoleon's downfall. \nWhilst racing each other to deploy the best army, players must also defeat a variety of historical obstacles that their respective leaders had to conquer on their way to Ligny, Quatre Bras, and Waterloo. Master Napoleon's bloodless revolution in Paris; experience Old Nosey's (Wellington's) marshaling of the Allied forces; not to mention Wellington's partaking in the Duchess of Richmond's glamorous ball in Brussels on the night before the bloodbath of Waterloo commenced. Many of the beautifully dressed officers lay dead in their dancing shoes within 24 hours...\nThe Battle of Waterloo is initially fought over three Frontiers of troops (just as the real battle was), represented by three Frontier cards: Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Papelotte. Players compete for these cards by inflicting damage on them. Careful hand, resource, and tableau management is required for victory, and the first player to claim two Frontiers wins the game!\nExperience the immersive, narrative, history game like no other\nComplete stand-alone game\nCompetitive and Solo play\nExquisite hand management provides deep replayability\nFrenetic back and forth gameplay\nFrom award-winning designer Tristan Hall\nAlso compatible with 1066, Tears to Many Mothers and 1565, St. Elmo's Pay \nAward-winning Historic Epic Battle System game mechanics\nSumptuously illustrated chronicles: 100+ astonishing, unique images\nDeploy powerful units and characters\nBoost your cards with attachments\nPlay events to disrupt your foe\nManage your hand and your army tableau\nUse myriad special abilities\nProtect your leader at all costs!\n150+ high quality, breathtakingly illustrated cards\n100+ wooden and cardboard tokens\nThis campaign is all about 1815, Scum of the Earth \u2013 a complete game that contains everything you need to play and experience this incredible slice of history.\nBut if you love compelling history and fantastic gameplay and jaw-dropping art, then there are THREE GAMES for you to discover in the Historic Epic Battle System.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "That house on the outskirts of town, sitting empty behind a crumbling wall. The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map?

Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

The only real challenge we run into during campaigns concerns making our estimated date of delivery. The issues that can effect the release date of the final product are: production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. (things outside of our control).\n\nWe are working with our manufacturer, Panda Games, to ensure we create the best product possible. We instill our full trust in them, as we\u2019ve worked with them in producing all our games, expansions, and booster packs. We couldn't be happier with how smooth the process has been with them on these projects.\n\nWe will communicate all updates on our project in a timely manner as your trust in us is very important. We want to make sure you get the best product possible and have the best time playing it.\n\nAs we've also had experiences with different fulfillment partners during our prior Kickstarters, we'll be waiting until the end of the Kickstarter to make a final decision on our shipping partner, to make sure we find the best fit for our campaign both in terms of price and service for our backers.\n\nWe are very grateful to our backers and fans for their excitement for this Kickstarter and look forward to welcoming new players to our little town of Tall Oaks.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe are able to refund your pledge within 14 days of the Kickstarter campaign ending. After 14 days, we will no longer provide a refund.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Back in late 2019, I was working a job I really didn't enjoy and feeling very creatively frustrated so I pondered an idea for a new puzzle book. (I had just released my first book in July of that year.) Inspired by choose your own adventure novels of the past, I thought wouldn't it be good to have a puzzle book whereby every page you solve gives you a numerical answer which would take you to another page in the book, and so on... \nSomething disconnected from phones and the internet that you could stick in a bag and take with you on a long journey or lay in bed at night solving. Then after a few months, scribbled in a notebook stashed in my pocket, The Paper Labyrinth was born.\n\nThe basic premise of the book is that you solve a variety of riddles and puzzles, each giving you a direction to somewhere else in the book. Some are single puzzles, some have multiple parts but ultimately you should be able to solve the entire book - but The Paper Labyrinth ends unresolved. The player is left with a 5-digit-code and the promise that some day that code will unlock something new...\n\n\nFast forward to now, 2021. The Paper Labyrinth is the best selling book I have ever published and I think it is time to write a second (and final) installment. I've already started writing, sticking to the popular format of The Paper Labyrinth, but adding new twists including alternate paths through the book, a few tricks and traps, and some decisions for the reader to make which I hope will make the already addictive format even more engrossing! This is where your help comes in, pledging to help me create this book helps me dedicate time to work solely on this project and create something (hopefully) as good or even better than the original!\n\nADDED EXTRAS:\nDue to your amazing and overwhelming support, I have added a few extras to the books which will come with all rewards;\nBOOKMARKS MINI GAME - Everyone needs a bookmark (especially in The Paper Labyrinth) and these aren't just that - they're a mini puzzle game too! (And just like The Paper Labyrinth, in two parts!) The first will come with any add-ons of Book One and The Power of Four, and the second (or both bookmarks) will come in July with your copy of Book Two / The Complete Book! They line up with eachother allowing you to solve them once you're all done with your book.They are printed both sides with a lovely foil effect on the front!\nDUST JACKETS AND INNER COVER PAPERS - (for all hardback 'The Complete Paper Labyrinth' pledges) these will help keep your book in the best condition possible and hopefully feel a little extra special!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing based in the UK (now no longer EU), shipping is always a concern, but I regularly ship books to EU / Europe / Worldwide and have updated my shipping costs on here to reflect the current situation.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nA hard wearing book is key.

Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific taxes, and/or other local fees. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details. \nIf your reward is shipping to one of the destinations shown on this More Shipping Destinations chart, we are not collecting taxes or customs fees, but it may ship from a local hub. The Destinations Summary below details which countries are in which regions. \nIf you're outside of the countries included in this Destination Summary, please reference the Expanded Worldwide Shipping details below. \nWe originally did not offer shipping to destinations outside of those listed in our Destination Summary due to cost and reliability concerns. We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Lone Shark Games, the publisher of the puzzle novel The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft: How to Make Every Kind of Puzzle, brings you our newest foray into puzzle fiction: the crossword comic Letters to Margaret. Here's Hayley Gold, the cartoonist behind this groundbreaking new type of graphic novel.\nHey, Kickstarter crowd, this is Hayley Gold, crossword cartoonist, here to present you with my latest puzzle-based comic, Letters to Margaret. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s all about:\nIf you thought the world of crosswords was black and white, you\u2019d be\u2026 mostly right. They, like all of us, are caught in a highly polarized imbroglio between sides stuck in their black and white thinking. Well, maybe it\u2019s time to consider how the other side sees things. So, I made a similarly polarized comic. It\u2019s so polarized that it\u2019s literally divided in half. The same series of events are twice-told, each from a different character\u2019s perspective, and each packing a different set of solvable crosswords by Mike Selinker and Andy Kravis. You can solve along and take the puzzles apart with the characters, maybe gaining new perspectives on things as you work your way through each side.\nPrototype books seen from the front and back. Image not final.\nOne side\u2019s protagonist, Derry Down, believes that the New York Times crossword reinforces stereotypes, is non-inclusive, and uses offensive clues. Across the aisle (and the bookbinding) is Margaret \"Maggie\" A. Cross, who's maddened by blogger critiques that call for stemming the choice of words and topics broached in the NYT crossword in the name of sensitivity. The twosome\u2019s opinions clash on the web, in the crossword blogosphere, and IRL on the campus of Columbia University \u2014 but to complicate things, Maggie is visited by the voice of puzzles past: Margaret Farrar. The first editor of the Times crossword emerges in the form of letters, as Ms. Farrar attempts to edit Maggie\u2019s amateur puzzle with a 1960s sensibility.\nLetters to Margaret offers a closer look at the issues facing crosswords today from multiple perspectives and multiple time periods, and all sugar-coated with a healthy dose of romcom antics and puzzles for the reader to solve alongside the protagonists. So, in a crossword landscape \u2014 and a sociopolitical landscape \u2014 that\u2019s so strictly divided, can two sides meet to create a whole? That\u2019s a puzzle that is literally for you to solve.\nLetters to Margaret is a 128-page graphic novel split in two parts, one facing the opposite direction from the other. You can read Maggie\u2019s tale first or Derry\u2019s tale first and your reading experience will be different each time. But that\u2019s not all you can do. Letters to Margaret is the first comic book you can solve.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Lone Shark\u2019s interactive novel The Maze of Games, you may have a clue where this is going. But \u201chaving a clue\u201d is the whole point of the book. The book is loaded with crossword puzzles that you can solve before they appear in the characters\u2019 hands. Several are puzzles of the kind you\u2019d find in the New York Times \u2014 in fact, in the story, they are NYT crosswords ranging from Wednesday to Saturday in difficulty. Others are the crosswords that Maggie, an up-and-coming cruciverbalist (that\u2019s a fancy term for a crossword constructor), submits to the New York Times \u2014 and then gets a few edits from its long-passed editor, Margaret Farrar.\nThe crosswords are constructed by my friends Andy Kravis, a puzzle editor at the New Yorker, and Mike Selinker, who wrote and constructed The Maze of Games among many other puzzle projects. You can read the book without solving the puzzles, letting the characters guide you through the crosswords. Or you can solve the puzzles first and experience the world of crosswords the way the characters do.\nThank you for asking! You can read the first chapter of Maggie's book on this page. Or you can just look at the sample pages and images below. Here you can see the adventures of Maggie, Derry, Amanda, Prof. Dodgson, and our two arrows, Ebony and Irony, who provide narration throughout.\nLetters to Margaret is a 128-page premium graphic novel. You can get the printed book at the $24 level. Each physical book comes with a PDF so you can print off the crossword pages and solve them without writing in your book, if you so choose. For crossword aficionados, we\u2019ll also provide the puzzles in the .puz format, which allows solving in apps such as AcrossLite. And there's a digital art and puzzles pack with all sorts of goodies in it (see Are There Stretch Goals?).\nPrototype book. Image not final. Oreos not included.\nYou can get just the digital book at the $10 level. The digital files will come with a PDF and the .puz crossword files, as well as everything in the digital art and puzzles pack.\nCode pencils. Image not final.\nIf you want some pencils to solve the book, we've got the pencils for you. At the $63 Solver's Bundle level you'll get the physical and digital books and our hand-crafted code pencils, with a host of solving tools printed on the sides. We haven't sold code pencils for six years, so we're thrilled to bring them back. Designer Eric Harshbarger has created six unique Letters to Margaret code pencils, each of which provides a set of tools for solving puzzles. On each pencil's six faces are six codes or sequences critical for puzzle solving (though you don't need them for the crosswords in this book). In each dozen, you get two each of the following:\nPencil #1: Alphabet, Braille, Morse code, binary, ternary, index numbers (1-26),\nPencil #2: Alphabet, moon type, nautical flags, semaphore, American Sign Language, pigpen\nPencil #3: Numbers, Roman numerals, telephone keypad letters, people on U.S. paper money, people on U.S. coins, keyboard shift characters\nPencil #4: Months, days in months, birthstones, Chinese zodiac, zodiac symbols, western zodiac\nPencil #5: Numbers, powers of two, square numbers, cubic numbers, prime numbers, Fibonacci sequence\nPencil #6: Powers of ten, SI prefixes, SI symbols, imperial ruler in inches, metric ruler in millimeters, magnitudes\nFinally, you collectors can get a signed book with signatures from the creative team at $75 Signed Graphic Novel level. Or you can add to that a set of pencils at the $99 Signed Solver's Bundle level. Or you can get all that and a whole library of Lone Shark books at the $200 Every Lone Shark Book level.\nThere are no shipping costs listed, because you\u2019ll add those on in Lone Shark\u2019s pledge manager after the campaign ends. Shipping costs will be approximately $10 to $12 in the United States and Canada. We\u2019re sad to say that puzzle books cannot be shipped Media Mail, because the U.S. Postal Service doesn\u2019t like fun. The physical goods can only be sent to the U.S. and Canada, because the shipping cost elsewhere is insane.

The pages are in the wrong order, and you have to solve the puzzles to make the narrative make sense. You can get the hardcover and its companion projects The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, the Maze Map, and The Keymaster's Tome separately or in one Keymaster's Bundle.\nPuzzlecraft: How to Make Any Kind of Puzzle is our puzzlemaking guidebook, written by Mike Selinker and Thomas Snyder with a foreword by Peter Sagal. You can get it with The Puzzlecraft Workbook, a handy primer by Gaby Weidling that puts your puzzlemaking skills to use on a project.\nDealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker details all the basics of poker and then dives into more than 400 poker variants, many born from the fevered imaginations of authors James Ernest, Phil Foglio, and Mike Selinker. Features many hilarious illustrations by Phil.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos is Mike Selinker and Richard Malena-Webber's 532-page tome of essays about politics and game theory. If you want to make sense of the last half decade through the lens of Risk, Monopoly, and D&D, this book will help with that.\nThere's a $200 Every Lone Shark Book level that gets you a signed copy of Letters to Margaret and everything in this section, including the bonus mini-comic.\nFor any of those books, complete your pledge and select what you want from the Add-On menu. Other Lone Shark products will be made available in our PledgeManager after the campaign ends.\nThere are! We unlocked eleven stretch goals during this campaign!\nWe've added two 50-crossword digital volumes called Crosswords of Wisdom, a digital wallpaper set, \"outtake\" puzzles that didn't make it into Letters to Margaret, a digital book of tile crosswords, another crossword pack, a digital bonus Letters to Margaret story with a Robyn Weintraub crossword, a digital pack of rows garden puzzles, a cartoon crossword sampler from Patrick Merrell, two digital packs of marching bands, and a digital giant crosswords puzzlepack.

For the length of the campaign, you\u2019ll get messages from a secret admirer who will shower you in New York Times-style mini-crosswords. You can solve these crosswords in the updates to earn conversation heart badges! These convo hearts have a zoological touch that crossword fans will love. Because everyone knows that when puzzles and LOVE mix, you get a VOLE.\nThere are seven mini-crosswords, each leading to a candy heart badge that features an animal that shows up in crosswords a lot, such as EMU. Each crossword also contains an answer that\u2019s an animal. Here are all the mini-crosswords:\nThe first puzzle for the Red heart is here!\nThe second puzzle for the Orange heart is here!\nThe third puzzle for the Yellow heart is here!\nThe fourth puzzle for the Green heart is here!\nThe fifth puzzle for the Blue heart is here!\nThe sixth puzzle for the Indigo heart is here!\nThe seventh puzzle for the Violet heart is here!\nTo get each badge, go to this submission site, pull down to the right candy heart color, and enter the animal you find in the blank. You can use the badges as your social media icon on Facebook, Twitter, or Kickstarter. In fact, we\u2019d really like it if you did!\nHere are the badges without their candy heart messages. \nOf course, you don\u2019t know your secret admirer\u2019s identity \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t be much of a secret otherwise, naturally. To find out your admirer\u2019s name, you\u2019ll need to solve all seven mini-crosswords and follow the metapuzzle instructions to get your eighth badge, the Rainbow badge.

So, shortly after the campaign ends, we\u2019ll be able to send it through an editing pass and then send it to press.

When you\u2019re invited inside for an evening\u2019s entertainment, what could possibly go wrong? Will you Cuddle with Cats or Thwart a Thief? Will you Brawl Over Brandy or Fall Prey to the Plague? At Hemlock Hall, awful amusements become deadly diversions with the flip of a card.\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a darkly humorous stand-alone competitive storytelling card game for two to five players. To win, you make your characters suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death.  The player with the most negative score wins. And in Gloomier, the winner gets the final word: Who was the murderer? How did the heist end? You decide!\nGloomier features transparent plastic cards, allowing a character\u2019s score \u2014 and story \u2014 to evolve as cards are stacked on top of each other. You don\u2019t need prior experience to play Gloomier, but Gloom fans will find that A Night at Hemlock Hall expands the storytelling aspect of Gloom with new, specially-designed story prompts. And this full stand-alone game includes 6 new Stories and 14 new Guests that can be used with any edition of Gloom. So dare to enter Hemlock Hall, and see what delightful disaster awaits!\n\nLike all Gloom games, Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is a storytelling game. Stack transparent cards to boost your score and make your characters\u2019 tales the most tragic \u2014 while blighting opponents with good fortune. Then, tell the story of these miserable misanthropes.\nWhen you play an Untimely Death card on a character, they die and their negative score is locked in, but the story continues until all of one player\u2019s characters have perished. Then, all players tally their scores.The player whose characters had the most tragic lives (and the most negative score) is the winner.\nPoints are important, but the best part of Gloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall is building increasingly sad, and increasingly silly stories with your fellow players. If you like Nightmare Before Christmas, The Addams Family, or A Series of Unfortunate Events, we think you\u2019ll enjoy the absurd dark humor of Gloomier.\n\nGloomier: A Night at Hemlock Hall contains:\n 110 transparent plastic cards (including 14 new Guests, 6 Story cards, a new cast of Characters, and a variety of new Modifier, Event, and Untimely Death cards to bolster your tragic tales)\nA 12-page, color, totally redesigned rulebook \nAn attractive tuckbox \nIt\u2019s a standalone expansion, which means you can play it by itself or combine it with any other Gloom games.\n\nGloom fans have been asking for it for years, and it\u2019s finally here \u2026 a box big enough for all your Gloom games!\nThe luxurious Grief Case is large enough to hold every Gloom game produced thus far \u2014 that\u2019s roughly 1500 Gloom cards \u2014 plus all your rules and extras, and your darkest secrets. (It\u2019s even got room to accommodate another four full Gloom games or eight expansions, for when you add future Gloom games to your collection.)\nThis case is extremely sturdy! 4mm thick laminated chipboard will make this the strongest game box in your collection, sure to hold up to a lifetime of use. Or, of course, 'til Untimely Death.\n Soft Touch finish adds a luxurious velvety-soft texture for instant tactile appeal and resistance to fingerprint marks. It also makes sliding the lid off the box both quick and satisfying.\n Spot gloss and red metallic foil add texture and shine to highlight design elements.\nThis deluxe box comes with its own thick acrylic dividers, so you can sort and cross-reference your games and cards in whatever way makes the most sense to you.\nAnd more! Follow our backer updates for behind-the-scenes looks while we finalize production.\ndesign subject to change\nAnd don\u2019t worry, if you\u2019re missing a few Gloom games, we\u2019ve made them all available as add-ons for this campaign so you can easily complete your collection!\n\n\nLots of Kickstarter campaigns (including several of ours!) have lots of different stretch goals to unlock. For this Kickstarter, we\u2019re focusing on just one big one: The Gloom Chronicles. Chronicles is an expansion for the Gloom series, turning Gloom into a serialized, campaign-style game. It is included with all pledge levels, and has been improved through stretch goals to be the best The Gloom Chronicles it can be!\nIn Gloom, you and your friends weave tales of woe. But where does the story begin? Each card in The Gloom Chronicles expansion starts a new chapter for an ongoing game of Gloom, ties those games together as a serialized campaign, and adds variant rules, bringing new challenges to the story. You can choose a card at random, or you can start from the beginning and explore the ongoing chronicle of your family through an extended campaign. Your story begins with the Unhappy Birthday \u2026 but will your next game of Gloom involve a Tragic Train Ride, or will you end up at the infamous World\u2019s Unfair?\nThe Gloom Chronicles is an expansion that can enhance any game of Gloom. You can use it with just one Gloom game, or let it navigate you through all the expansions. Narrative prompts give players a unified foundation for their stories, while variant rules challenge new and experienced players alike. The Unhappy Birthday awaits! What ignominious ending will your Gloom Chronicle have?\n\nAll pledge levels receive a discount on the entire Gloom line of products to complete your collection.\n The stretch goals for this campaign improved and expanded The Gloom Chronicles to its best version!

You will choose the language of your rewards during the pledge manager phase [suivez ce lien pour toutes les infos en fran\u00e7ais !]\nEncyclopedia Standard Edition included in the $40 reward tier\nEncyclopedia in a Nutshell\nEncyclopedia is a 360-page lore book for your 5th Edition campaign, including dozens of ready-to-use cities, locations, NPCs, plot hooks, and magic items for your next game session.\n As a game master, you have a lot to do. Planning, writing, sometimes drawing, and much more!  We've been GMs for over 20 years and we are here to help. With this book, we wanted to offer you as much material as possible to make your job as a GM easier. Prepare your next game session or upgrade your worldbuilding by picking from the Encyclopedia\u2019s rich contents and cook up your own unforgettable stories!\nEncyclopedia Red Dragon Deluxe Edition included in the $70 reward tier and up\nDownload a 40-page Preview of the Encyclopedia\nTo download the 40-page preview of the Encyclopedia, click the following link. If you like what you see, back us to allow us to create more :)\nWork on the Encyclopedia started in France in 2016. It took our studio four years to put together the 360 pages and hundreds of artworks depicting the cities, places, magic items, and NPCs within. The book is now translated and in the very last steps of proofreading and formatting for PDF. We plan to deliver a final version of the Encyclopedia PDF at the end of the campaign.\nCities and Places of Adventure\nAcross this book, you will find 15 cities and many locations ready to serve as the settings of your next adventures. Each of these places has its own identity, featuring many adventure hooks and dozens of memorable figures, both friends and foes: a kobold mining village, a diabolist city, a necropolis-city, a hobgoblin pirate port, and more! The Free City, described over 40+ pages, is split into 15 districts, which you can use separately, as the locales of urban adventures, or as part of a teeming metropolis.\nThis toolbox is perfect for veteran game masters who want to level up their homebrew campaign, as well as for beginners seeking readily usable content to begin their first campaign. This book can also be used as a campaign setting to play in a universe steeped in Sword & Sorcery and portraying colorful civilizations.\n\nLevel-up Your Next Story\nEncyclopedia offers colorful and diverse game material spanning 4 civilizations, each highly distinct from the others. Every one has its own atmosphere, its own mysteries, and its own antagonists.\nA meditating orc of the Iruuls - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nOne of our main objectives was to step away from the tropes of classic fantasy, where orcs and other 'greenskins' are brutish and inherently evil. Here, orcs have cultures of their own, including pacifistic ones like the Iruul orcs, and hobgoblins have a thriving culture of trading.\n\nCoat of arms of the Garden City\nYou can draw inspiration from these civilizations or use them as-is in a campaign of your creation\u2026 or you can feature them in the setting of Eana, which gathers them all!\n Free City. Join the guilds and schemes of the Free City, a cosmopolitan metropolis filled with many mysteries!\n Drakenbergen. Discover legendary valleys with hidden ancient ruins, majestic fjords, dwarven mines, raging volcanoes, and the vampiric kingdom of Kentigern, all nestled in the sprawling mountains of the Drakenbergen!\n Septentrion. Sail for faraway Bore\u00efa, the gateway to the Septentrion, and explore these frozen northern lands, populated with fearsome frost giants and holding a portal to the frozen plane of Gemoniae!\n Kaan. Ride across the steppes of Kaan, venturing into baroque, contrasted, thriving, decadent city-states. Barter with the pirates of Tili\u2019s Gulf or the shrewd merchants of Lihy\u00e2n as you bear witness to past, present, and future empires!\nA traveling hobgoblin merchant - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nEncyclopedia is your new cookbook for your next game sessions ^^\nMagic Items\nEncyclopedia includes more than fifty magic items. Each is tied to one of the locations or personalities described in the book, providing adventure hooks and springboards for new adventures.\nYou will also find 5 optional rules to customize the use of magic items in your campaign:\n Enchanted gems. Set magic gems in weapons and armor to grant them special, unique properties!\n Magic weapon sheaths. Keep the destructive power of your weapons under control with suitable sheaths.\n War paints. In preparation for battle, draw from the ancestral might of these magic Kaani war paints.\n Magic pearls. Discover the pearls of the stone giants, which enable them to go unnoticed!\n Progressive mirafaction. Under the influence of fate and the extreme energies they are subjected to, the personal belongings of adventurers can gradually become magic items. What used to be a fine sword, a family legacy, progressively turns into a more fearsome weapon, imbued with enchantments that will become manifest at key moments of the adventurer\u2019s tribulations!\nModular System\nEncyclopedia makes use of a modular system that lets each game leader define the atmosphere they wish to create for their stories. Each of the symbols listed below indicates related optional rules, adventures hooks, and setting elements that the leader can choose to make use of within a given campaign. Do you want your game to fit the canons of heroic fantasy? Use the rules labeled \u201cAction\u201d to make the adventurers all the more powerful and successful. Do you want to play a dark-fantasy, survival-oriented game? \u201cDark\u201d and \u201cGritty\u201d options have been designed for you and will give adventurers a hard time. \nModular System Icons\nHere are three examples: \n Action. This icon indicates all the rules, magic items, and situations that offer epic options and emphasize the characters\u2019 feats and achievements.\n Corruption. The Corruption icon shows situations and magic items that lead to corruption, or which are only relevant to a corrupted creature.\n Dark. The optional rules, magic items, and situations indicated by this icon are all related to horror, madness, or corruption.\nSpice up your next campaign!\nStretch Goals!\nThe base goal will support the book\u2019s printing. Beyond that, we have several bonuses and upgrades planned to thank you for your support. To ensure a reasonable delivery schedule, all the bonuses of this campaign have already been designed. Your support will enable us to manufacture them and, most of all, send them to backers at no extra charge! Most of the bonuses unlocked during this campaign will be available later (late pledge) but will then become paid options. \nWith your support, we can keep the Fateforge series growing.

Only when you have helped fix the problem can you leap out...and hopefully leap home. \nIn addition to describing the world of the game, presenting challenges to the player, and portraying various other characters, the game master also portrays the observer, a guide from the traveler's time who helps the traveler by filling in missing information and suggesting things that might need fixing. \nThe game is structured such that the GM does not know exactly WHAT change needs to be made for the traveler to leap out. They'll discover this together as the game is played. \nThe game can be played \"duet style\" with just one GM and one player. There are also rules for having multiple players/time travelers.\nA time traveler jumps into a skydiver while plummeting to the ground\nWhat Once Went Wrong is a very rules-light RPG. At the end of important scenes, where the time traveler is potentially changing something about the subject's life, dice are rolled to determine how effective the attempt is.  An in-game currency called Destiny Points can be spent to help the traveler accomplish some things. \nDuring play, the GM secretly tracks a countdown that gets the traveler closer and closer to making the right change. A combination of this countdown and the results of the traveler's dice checks reveals what needed to be changed in the moment, allowing the GM and player discover this together. \nStory Structure and GM Tools\nGMs will be provided with tools and guidance regarding how to build and craft a story of this type. The game requires only minimal preparation to get started, but the GM will improvise a fair bit during play, building off of what the time traveler does and creating new problems for them to fix. \n(The game will address the concept of personal agency and control of one's body. Such things might even become a central theme to game sessions you run, but that's up to you.)\nA time traveler arrives just in time to help a little boy\nThe game will be approximately 24 pages long with grayscale art/photography with some color.

If you live outside the US and want a physical book, you have full permission to print and bind the PDF pages at a local office store/print shop.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A sample journal spread from The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe\nKeepsake games like The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe are created by the player over the course of the story.\n\nYou are the seventh son of a seventh son, and you have forsaken your name. After many trials, you turned your back on your family legend and your inheritance in the hopes of living a simple life. But now, at the reading of your father\u2019s will, you must make a choice: return to your lineage in order to receive a priceless boon, or forever turn your back to what could have been, in order to shed the burden of your destiny.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe is a dark, narratively fraught keepsake game about family lineage, desire, and what it means to be honor-bound to legend. Keepsake games, a genre of game newly named and defined by Jeeyon Shim and Shing Yin Khor during their collaboration on Field Guide To Memory, are defined as games created in the spirit of collaboration between the game designer and the player, wherein the player builds a beautiful, memorable artifact through the process of playing the game. Just as no two players\u2019 experiences of play could ever be identical, no two versions of the game will be exactly the same.\n\n\nIn The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe, the keepsake that players create is a messy, memory-laden family album. Honoring both the DIY, black felt marker, cut-and-paste aesthetic of zines from the early 2000s along with Jeeyon\u2019s distinct voice as a writer and game designer, the player will choose one of two journaling options depending on whether they back the print-and-play version or the mobile-only version.\n\n\nIn the print-and-play zine, players print out sections of the game text to literally cut and paste them into a journal or notebook of their choice. The cut outs are numbered but out of order, and over the course of following directions the player will figuratively and tangibly build up the layers of secrets, dark paths, and old wounds that Gideon Blythe and his lineage created in the name of holding on to the family inheritance. A combination of handwritten prompts and player-generated ephemera create the chaotic path of their character\u2019s personal history.\n\n     In the mobile only zine, players follow screen-friendly directions to create a family album with handwritten prompts, sketches, and physical ephemera they already have at home. Using old books, magazines, newspapers, even bills and receipts, black out existing text to create scattered, uneven moments from their past intermingled with their saga. Written to be a related but different experience than the print-and-play zine, the mobile edition uses a combination of handwritten prompts and repurposed household paper goods to create the story of the character\u2019s remembrance of growing up in the shadow of their father.\n\n     Both editions of the zine share the same ending, with the same hard choice.\nExample of play, describing the terminal fate of the character's beloved. Each of the house descendant cards has three possible relationships, which you define by blacking out the ones that don't apply.\nExample of ephemera, repurposed and added to the family album in the mobile-friendly zine.\nThere are four different reward levels for The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe:\n  The two digital levels are the HEIR and the BENEFICIARY. \nThe HEIR, $5 (unlimited), is the print-and-play edition PDF of the game. The BENEFICIARY, $5 (unlimited) is the mobile-friendly edition PDF of the game.\nAn array of some of the ephemera a backer might receive with one of the physical reward levels.\nThere are a few limited edition physical reward levels. At these backer levels, players receive both PDF editions of the game along with original art and hand-selected physical ephemera, to be fulfilled and shipped after the release of the PDFs. Once fully backed, these reward levels will not be made again.\nThe three physical reward levels:\nThe NOTARY, $35 (strict limit of 60) includes both PDF editions, along with the full color house descendant cards in a 5\u201dx7\u201d envelope of hand-chosen physical ephemera, such as:\nA scrap of fabric from your mother\u2019s favorite dress.\nStrands of live Spanish moss, in real life lovingly tended and grown by Jeeyon; in fiction, tokens from the witch\u2019s forest where the descendants hold their first trial.\nA feather from the golden swan: an omen of true love, and the harbinger of your meeting with your beloved.\nA large wooden splinter from a descendant's shattered shield.\nSmall, ghostly original drawings on the envelope and inner board of the packet kraft paper envelope.\nOther odds and ends as inspirations strikes me.\nThe house descendant cards in play from the NOTARY reward level.\nThe EXECUTOR, $60 (strict limit of 45) includes both PDF editions, along with the full color house descendant cards in a hand addressed rigid mailer with original art and hand chosen physical ephemera, such as:\nGideon\u2019s last words to his son (your character) written on hand aged paper; each of these letters will be different, and no two players will receive the same message\na Last Will and Testament envelope, custom printed with the game title by Blumberg Excelsior, each with a blood-red original watercolor painting on the front, and sealed with a wax stamp bearing the Blythe family crest: a haloed raven shrouded in leaves.\nFeather from the golden swan, an omen of true love and his most prized possession.\nA scrap piece of sheet music from your mother\u2019s favorite song.\nOther odds and ends of my choosing, as inspiration strikes.\nDetail of the wax seal on the custom-engraved envelope bearing Gideon Blythe's will.\nThe ESTATE, $100 (strict limit of 45) includes everything in the NOTARY and EXECUTOR rewards, along with the key to your inheritance, hung on cloth cut from a dress cut from the dawn sky, which your father had to fetch in order to win your mother\u2019s hand. The inheritance key is iron skeleton key hung on silk chiffon ribbon in blush pink tones, that can serve as a prop or bookmark for future play.\nSpread of what an ESTATE level backer might receive.\n\nNOTE ABOUT PHYSICAL REWARDS: All art and ephemera will be sent out well after the PDFs are emailed to backers. Please note the estimated delivery dates before committing to these reward levels. Additionally, art and ephemera rewards are only available domestically in the United States. As leadership of the USPS changes for the better, future Kickstarters may offer international shipping.\n\nAbout The Designer\nJeeyon Shim is a game designer and outdoor educator based in Oakland, CA. Her work grounds itself in ideas of community and stewardship of the natural world. Her notables include her collaboration with Shing Yin Khor on their connected path game, Field Guide To Memory; 2019 artist in residence at Heart of the Deernicorn in Olympia, WA; and 2019 keynote speaker at Big Bad Con. She is an enthusiastic collector of bones, folktales, old keys, and plants.\nExample of the layered memory mechanic, where players write one memory in ink a similar color to the paper of their journal, then write a simpler, less truthful memory in contrasting ink over it.\nLayered memories in an entry from the print-and-play version of the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCollectively, I\u2019ve successfully completed and fulfilled 2 Kickstarter campaigns totaling over $84,619. While this is my first solo Kickstarter, which could potentially introduce unexpected challenges, the core experience of the game is fully written. Laying out the raw text in both its print-and-play and mobile only formats can reasonably be done within a couple months of the end of this campaign. \n\nEach of the physical rewards are hand-made by me, and every aspect of their creation, handling, shipping, and fulfillment will be operated out of my home office and PO box. Depending on the scale of reward backing, this may result in an additional unexpected load on my production scale in spite of the hard limits, which could in turn extend shipping timelines.\n\nBecause The Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe is a keepsake game, so long as players have one of the core game texts and a journal or notebook to write, cut out of, glue ephemera into, and otherwise embellish and play with, they will be able to play the game. \n\nIf you are deathly allergic to cats please do not back the physical reward tiers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe descendant cards are printed on uncoated paper and so, if unused and undesired, can be safely recycled.\nSustainable materials\nThe Last Will and Testament of Gideon Blythe either asks players to print their own materials at home or repurpose existing materials like catalogs or junk mail.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A Mending is a solo story-building and keepsake game about two friends who have been parted for some time, using sewing, embroidery, and map-marking mechanics. \nThis game is a reflection of my desire to make games that create physical gameplay artifacts and beautiful keepsakes, my love of maps, a deep respect of handiwork often categorized as \u201cwomen\u2019s work,\u201d and many years of missing dear - and distant - friends.\n You have been parted from a dear friend for a long time. Now, they have called for you. You are going to visit your friend, and the path is long and it will take many days. As you plan and trace your route on a cloth map(or paper), using needle and thread(or pen), you will use and answer story prompt cards to discover the stories and primary incidents behind your friendship, find strange and wonderful objects and people on your path, and build your own narrative of this particular journey and friendship.\n\nA Mending is a keepsake game, a term that I use to describe the kind of game I make - games that produce beautiful, memorable physical artifacts through the gameplay process. These keepsakes are a collaboration between me, as a designer, and the players, who all create their own unique objects. This honors my lifetime love of tinkering and making, and reduces waste by producing something worth keeping. Jeeyon Shim and I began using this term while making our keepsake game, Field Guide to Memory, to describe the work we do. \nProgress on a map, mid-game.\n\nAbove is an example of part of a map in progress. The orange running stitch here is the path taken to visit a friend. The beads and other stitches denote the times where an object was discovered, or where a story element important to the relationship was revealed. The finished gameplay artifact can be used as a decorative or functional object; I personally wear and use my test maps as bandanas, altar cloths, patches, and handkerchiefs.\nA finished cloth map, worn as a bandana or scarf.\nFor players who like to plan before sewing, two blank paper maps, printed on a beautiful textured felt weave paper stock, are provided - you can play the game while hand-drawing your route(and annotating the story you make), for later reference. Of course, this means that you can also play the game in its entirety using paper and pen.\n\nThe story-building elements of the game are in the long story-building tradition of indie RPG games, inspired by games such as For the Queen(Alex Roberts),  Dialect(Thorny Games), The Quiet Year(Avery Alder), and Field Guide to Memory(Jeeyon Shim and myself). The story itself is set up as a series of randomized prompt cards that take the player through a reflective and gentle journey of interesting characters, thoughtful questions about your friendship, and a few strange occurrences. \n You will play the game by planning your route, marking the map, and building a story by answering prompt cards. The prompt cards will ask you to consider your relationship with your friend, mark your map with beads or written notes, introduce you to delightful characters(including at least one dog), and will sometimes affect the path you have chosen. The gameplay time can vary between one hour(solo, paper and pen only) to two hours or more(collaborative gameplay, with hand-sewing). The game is designed to be played solo, but the game booklet will also include suggestions on how to play this as a 2 person game(using a single game kit), or communally in a larger group. A Mending can be also played as a system-agnostic storytelling module for other roleplaying games.\nExample of the prompt cards in A Mending.\nThe embroidery and sewing elements of this game are meant to be simple and intuitive. My own approach towards embroidery and sewing is haphazard, but I appreciate its versatility and style, and am interested in its use in creating narrative keepsake work. If you choose to play the sewing version of the game, it is designed at a \"can you do a basic running stitch, and can you sew a button/bead on?\" level, but if you are an experienced sewist or embroiderer, you can feel free to embellish the game to your heart's content! There will be resources listed in the game booklet that teach introductory sewing skills and basic stitches, but the goal is to embrace experimentation and instinctive use of thread and needle. \nThe 48 card story-building deck, paper maps, and game booklet are included in every physical reward. (Mockup; design not final)\nAll versions of the game include two identical paper maps(for simultaneous gameplay, or plotting your map before you embroider a cloth map), a 48-card deck of story-building prompts, and an instruction booklet. There is also a paper-only option for people who are quite sure they do not want to sew anything.\na preview of gameplay, using the paper map only.\nThe centerpiece of the game is the cloth map, which also serves as the game board, and is screen-printed in two colors on natural 100% cotton fabric. The screenprinted art is 17\"x17\", with the entire piece of cloth measuring 22\"x22\", leaving a comfortable border for other things you may want to do with the finished map, such as framing or using it as a quilt piece. \nA close up of the map's screenprinting, showing the main outlines in dark brown, and the gridlines in a beautiful metallic gold.\nMost physical versions of the game(JOURNEYMAN and above) also include a zippered carrying case, because this is a game that can include many fiddly small elements like beads and needles, and because I love designing cute and beautiful elements that also keep all your things in one place.\n\nFor sewists and embroiderers(even just dabblers and dilettantes!) the JOURNEYMAN level includes only the custom made and custom printed elements necessary to play the game. This is a great choice if you want to pick your own thread colors and beads, which I think is part of the fun.\n\nThe cloth maps are printed on 100% natural cotton bandanas. They can be machine washed and dyed with fabric dyes.  \nThe $15 DIGITAL level includes the printable files to make your own version of the game, and the instruction booklet as a .pdf. Because of this game's card and map elements, it is recommended that you print and prepare a physical copy of this game. \n\nThe $25 APPRENTICE level includes everything you need to play the game at the base level, if you are not interested in sewing. This level includes two identical printed and folded paper maps, a 48-card story-building deck, and the instruction booklet, in a paper envelope. To play the game without sewing or embroidery, you will draw directly on the paper map, and annotate the map with notes and images as you answer the prompts.\n\nThe $50 JOURNEYMAN level includes every custom-made and custom-printed object for the game - everything in the APPRENTICE level, and adds the cloth map, a zippered fabric carrying case, and some surprises. It does not include easily sourced sewing and craft materials - for this level, I expect that you want to add your own style to the game, and can purchase or use your own sewing supplies. The $95 JOURNEYMAN x2 level is just two sets of this level, at a slight discount. \n\nThis is the list of additional materials you should acquire to play the sewing version, if you prefer the JOURNEYMAN version of the game: scissors, embroidery hoop (6\" has been a good size for me), needles(embroidery and regular), thread(embroidery and regular), assorted beads, buttons, or other embellishments you feel drawn towards. \n\nThe $100 MASTER CRAFTSMAN level includes everything you need to play the game from the moment you receive it, including everything in the JOURNEYMAN level - all game materials, the cloth and paper maps, and a zippered fabric carrying case. This kit also includes an embroidery hoop and needles, craft thread in an assortment of complementary colors, a selection of hand-selected glass beads(including from my own personal collection). Extras will include a process work zine from designing and testing the game, which includes my scattered notes on index cards, copies of original design and process sketches, as well as other prototype work such as test map colors/designs(this means you get extra prototype paper and cloth maps, in addition to the final maps).\n\nThe $120 HERITAGE level includes everything in the MASTER CRAFTSMAN level, but I'll put it in a blue Royal Dansk butter cookie tin.\n Extra maps(cloth and paper) are available as add-ons - you will be asked if you want to add them after you select a tier.\n\nThere are no stretch goals for this game; I am making exactly the game I want to make.\nI am a Malaysian-American installation artist, cartoonist, and experience designer, obsessed with physical storytelling artifacts, and the evolution of tradition and ritual. I make large scale immersive installation work, like space apothecaries in the desert, and space salvage stations in the woods, but in pandemic times, I\u2019ve been looking for ways to bring the intent and atmosphere of these narrative experiences into smaller home spaces.\nMy game design work is rooted in my work as a builder and artist - keepsake games centered on the bridge between physical making and traditional tabletop RPGs,  kind and awkward emotional connections, and new traditions and rituals. I am the designer and creator of the ongoing mail-LARP Space Gnome Space, the Space Hobo Divination Board, The Gentle Oraclebird (presented at Indiecade 2019 and 2020) and co-designer(with Jeeyon Shim) of the solo journaling keepsake game Field Guide to Memory.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. AEG is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Hero Pledge: Game and Upgrades!", "descp": "A copy of Meeples & Monsters and all upgrades.\nINCLUDES:\nMeeples & Monsters Game\nMeeples upgraded to printed\n4 Towers Expansion\nSolo game rules and components", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["3,733 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Production Update and an Important Heads Up", "update_content": "Production Update\nShort version: Things are going really smoothly.

We're now ready to share the fruits of that vision with you.\nOur Aliens Are Weirder\nTERMINATION SHOCK focused on humankind's escape from the dangers of our home solar system into a large, weird, cosmopolitan free-for-all. In the process, three alien species were described.\nThe sleek, muscular preds\nThe massive and colorful sleeves\nThe airborne tentacular scavs\nDIFFERENT TROUBLE goes into much greater depth on each species, making them fully playable options and describing their varied cultures, histories and technologies--including the alien animals they've domesticated.\nEach of these alien life forms is examined in depth. They're not monocultures, they're not stereotypes and they're not two-dimensional cutouts, but deeply crafted entities planned from the start to be very different from humankind and provide a variety of fascinating roleplaying challenges and opportunities. Play an alien with no panic response, or one with no concept of romantic sexuality, or one so primed to fight that it evolved a separate brain lobe solely for aggression.\nHave Fun As A Soulless Machine!\nIf that's not enough, the book also covers playing as a robot (or, if you want to be finicky, an artificial intelligence). Pick a body type ranging from a soft bouncy sphere through a heavy-duty armored carapace, or even play as a cloud of intelligent, floating nanoparticles. Define a series of internal commands that govern your function and then disobey them situationally! As with the aliens, these rules are meant to help you play something more than a stereotype automaton that really just acts like a person in a mask. With DIFFERENT TROUBLE, we hope to help you take a bigger step outside yourself. After all, isn't that a big part of the fun of TTRPGs?\nThe Book Itself\nDifferent Trouble is about 75 pages long and full color throughout.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thank you to everyone for such a wonderful reception to Crypt of the Devil Lich! It's been a great campaign and we appreciate every pledge of support!\nAn ancient prophecy sends your heroes into the crypt of the Devil Lich. They must destroy her, before she can return to power. Once inside, your heroes face horrors that could only be dreamt of by a mad half-drow half-fiend lich!\nWe invite you into the Crypt of the Devil Lich, the most vicious dungeon crawl since Tomb of Horrors! \nCreated in homage to Gygax's classic with the goal of providing an even greater challenge, Crypt of the Devil Lich became an instant legend when it was first run as a tournament dungeon crawl. After all, this is the adventure with a mummy dragon, the hall of prophets, and a castle suspended by chains above a lava sea - not to mention a legendary villain! Now, more than 15 years after its original Gen Con debut, we are updating it for the 5th edition and DCC rules sets.\nLet's be honest: we probably would have published this book anyway. But we'd like to make it special. With your support, this Kickstarter will fund a deluxe presentation of Crypt of the Devil Lich. We have a host of stretch goals we would like to achieve in order to produce a splendid volume.\nPerhaps the most cherished dungeon crawl ever published by Goodman Games, Crypt of the Devil Lich has been completely updated and converted to new rules sets. It\u2019s ready for your table: are your players ready for the devil lich?\nMockup of two-tone foil leatherette cover, with Stefan Poag art on front and Erol Otus art on back\nLatest in-progress shot of Doug Kovacs' painting for Crypt of the Devil Lich\nLatest Livestream Updates\nHear the designers, playtesters, and tournament contenders discuss their experiences with Crypt of the Devil Lich!\nThe kickoff discussion with original designers and winners of the 2004 Gen Con tournament\nDesigners round-table focused on the 5E design\nMost recent livestream with DCC design discussion and original playtest group\nMost recent livestream with DCC design discussion and original playtest group\nThe heroes are sent into the Devil Lich\u2019s crypt to destroy her before she can return to power, as foreseen in a prophecy. However, the unknowing heroes have actually been tricked into entering her crypt to free her from her prison. If they are truly heroes, they will uncover the deception and defeat the evil Devil Lich before she can unleash her dark designs on the surface world.\nThe 5E edition of the adventure is designed for a group of four to six 15th level characters, while the DCC edition is designed for 7th level characters. The original adventure was designed for Gen Con 2004, where Goodman Games ran the First Annual Dungeon Crawl Classics team tournament. This tradition of competitive tournament dungeons continues to this day. (You can find our tournament recaps here.) The adventure can also be used for campaign play and as a one-shot non-competitive module - but of course it also works well as a tournament.\nCrypt of the Devil Lich is available in print as a deluxe hardcover. Both the 5th edition and DCC version are printed with Smythe sewn binding and heavy paper stock. This is a durable book meant to last. The PDF edition can be purchased separately, and is free with the print edition. \nWe are also offering a limited print run virgin art edition of the hardcover. Sanjulian's cover design is amazing, as is Erol Otus's original cover to the 3.5 edition. The virgin art edition features only the art on the covers. This style of presentation has proven very popular with our convention modules in the past, but can only be printed in limited quantity because it lacks any retailer marks (price, bar code, or SKU). \nThe adventure has three fully developed levels of the crypt, with dozens of memorable encounters. This updated edition has all new art and cartography. There are dozens of player handouts, one or more for most numbered encounter areas, in the tradition of Tomb of Horrors and Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. Six fully developed pregenerated characters are included, as well as a team tournament scoring system.\nCover art to the virgin art edition\nThis is what your players will hear when they first start the adventure\u2026\nLegend tells of the horrible drow sorceress Chalychia. Born of a drow father and a devilish mother, she rose to become one of the greatest drow conquerors ever known. She recovered a powerful artifact called the Shadowstone, and used its powers to enshroud the elven city of Arovarel and the surrounding lands in constant dusk-like darkness. With allied orc and goblin armies attacking from the mountains, and drow armies swarming up from the Underdeep, uninhibited by the harsh rays of the sun, the elven city fell in a single day and night. At the head of this ruthless host was Chalychia.\nBut Chalychia\u2019s rule lasted only one year. A band of powerful heroes, led by the paladin Valinus, destroyed the Shadowstone in the ruins of the elven city, and then penetrated Chalychia\u2019s mountain stronghold to defeat her. Meanwhile, the rallied forces of humans, dwarves, gnomes and wood elves stormed the ruins of Arovarel and routed the drow and Chalychia\u2019s remaining allies. The paladin hero used a powerful sword to defeat Chalychia, but it was sundered in the battle. The scriptures are vague, but somehow her infernal lineage, or perhaps unknown eldritch secrets, prevented her complete destruction. The heroes had no choice but to imprison Chalychia in the bowels of her lair with powerful enchantments. The sundered sword was buried in her prison, the crypt was sealed, and a monastery was erected near the site. The Monks of the Dawning Sun were charged with guarding the sundered sword and the crypt, and were to be the lore masters of the history of Chalychia. Should she ever rise back to power, the Order of the Dawning Sun would stand as the first line of defense.\nNow descendants of Arovarel\u2019s survivors have called for your aid. They have seen many disturbing omens and portents recently. According to the stars, Chalychia, now calling herself the Devil Lich, is close to breaking out of her prison and unleashing her wrath on the surface world once again. It seems she escaped complete destruction centuries ago by embracing undeath. You have been sent to the Monastery of the Dawning Sun to gather more information on the Devil Lich and confirm the prophecy.\nBut when you arrived at the monastery, you discovered that all the monks were brutally slain. Scrawled on the walls in blood were several prophetic verses claiming Chalychia\u2019s return is imminent. In the monastery\u2019s library, you found several tomes open to similar passages, all describing the powerful sword called True Death. This was the sword used by the paladin Valinus to slay Chalychia, and according to the legends, its sundered remains were buried in the Devil Lich\u2019s crypt. Yet, it appears that someone else has been researching True Death. Could this sundered blade play an important role in the final destruction of the Devil Lich?\nAfter finding a blood-stained map showing the way to the original site of the Devil Lich\u2019s crypt, you set off to find answers. Leaving the horror of the slaughter at the monastery behind, your band carefully picked its way down a treacherous mountain path. After almost two hours of this tedious journey, you arrived at a cave entrance. The cave mouth is surrounded by stalactites and stalagmites that appear to have been chiseled into angular teeth.\nSomewhere beyond this maw-like cave entrance must be the Crypt of the Devil Lich!\nThe original tournament poster from Gen Con 2004, featuring the original Erol Otus cover art\n\nThis adventure is already great.

Shipping costs will be assessed closer to actual time of shipping. Based on estimated page count for the book, here are estimated shipping costs. Please note that shipping costs have been extremely volatile for the last year, and there are several active events affecting shipping costs (for example, Brexit). Final shipping costs will be based on actual shipping cost at time of shipment (as assessed through a post-Kickstarter pledge manager).\nFor international shipping destinations, these estimates include prepaid VAT and tracked shipment via FedEx. We have found this service to be extremely fast, reliable, and efficient, although it is more expensive than traditional USPS bulk shipping.\nUSA shipping estimate: $8-$10\nCanada shipping estimate: $25-$30 (via FedEx, including prepaid VAT and customs clearance)\nEU/UK shipping estimate: $30-$35 (via FedEx, including prepaid VAT and customs clearance)\nAUS/NZ shipping estimate: $35-$40 (via FedEx, including prepaid VAT and customs clearance)\nRest of World shipping estimate: $40-$45 (via FedEx, including prepaid VAT and customs clearance)\n\nThe process for writing this dungeon involved a master designer who assembled the overall plot, then contributing writers who each designed a few rooms. The master designer on both the original edition and the updated edition is Chris Doyle.\nThe contributing writers, who each designed one or more encounters, include Chris Doyle, Lisa Doyle, Mike Ferguson, Joseph Goodman, Andrew Hind, Jason Little, Adrian M. Pommier, Jeffrey Quinn, F. Wesley Schneider, and Andrew N. Smith.\nChris Doyle began his freelance writing career in the tabletop role playing game industry in the early 1990\u2019s through volunteer efforts with the Role-Playing Game Association (RPGA). He has since freelanced for several companies including TSR, West End Games, Wizards of the Coast, Atlas Games, and Goodman Games. Although he has designed and contributed source material for various game systems, his true passion is adventure design for Dungeons and Dragons. He has penned adventures for the 2nd edition, 3rd edition, 3.5 edition, 4th edition and 5th edition of Dungeons and Dragons. For Goodman Games, he is a contributor to the Fifth Edition Fantasy product line and is the lead writer on four of the six Original Adventures Reincarnated product line, 5th edition conversions and homages to classic adventures from the 70\u2019s and 80\u2019s. In late 2020, Chris joined Goodman Games full time as the Director of 5E Development and Design. Chris is a certified Lake Manager, and has nearly 30 years experience as an aquatic biologist. He is a proud resident of New Jersey on the East Coast.\nBob Brinkman has been playing RPGs since dinosaurs roamed the earth and game books were small and beige. Best known for his work for Goodman Games, Bob has been a part of the creative teams for DCC Lankhmar, DCC Dying Earth, and MCC. On the 5E side of things, he authored Castle in the Sky and The Forgotten Hive, and was fortunate to write additional material of the OAR release of Castle Amber.\nBob has worked with a number of publishers, including Shield of Faith (The Umerican Road Atlas), Stiff Whiskers Press (Weird Frontiers), Fail Squad Games (Those Dam Goblins), and additionally, is one of the \u201cKeepers of Mysteries\u201d at the Sanctum Secorum (www.sanctum.media) podcast.\nOutside of gaming, Bob has been a stable hand, swordsman, stuntman, and even a professional fire-breather. He lives in southwest Florida with his wife, Judge Jen, and their four cats. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has delivered on dozens of Kickstarters.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Return to the world of Root with The Marauder Expansion. Raze the Woodland to the ground as the fearsome Lord of the Hundreds, or recover precious relics from this destructive conflict as the Keepers in Iron. Explore dozens of faction combinations, including many new head-to-head matchups with the hirelings and advanced setup cards. New and experienced players have never had so many ways to enjoy Root!\nThe Keepers in Iron are an order of itinerant warriors who have come to the Woodland to recover ancient relics. To find them, they must manage their Woodland contacts carefully, as only the local animals know how to find the relics they seek. Paragons of discipline, their warriors sport pristine armor of a quality rarely seen here, making them a terror in battle. However, to keep their forces well-supplied and mobile, they must maintain a network of caravans and waystations.\nClaiming to be the true voice of the Woodland, the Lord of the Hundreds spreads distrust and division among its inhabitants, inciting torch-wielding mobs to destroy the enemies of their righteous dominion. His swarming army can overwhelm all but the toughest defense. By looting items from the undeserving and adding them to his towering hoard, his power grows as he develops an increasingly fearsome monomania.\nRoot's hirelings lend their services to factions willing to pay the price. Court the Marquise's infamous Forest Patrol or sway the rampaging Last Dynasty from the Eyrie to join your cause. Whether you are playing with two players or six, the hirelings are sure to offer you exciting new ways to play Root. \nDiscover new corners of the world of Root.  Fight for control of the cosmopolitan Free City of Root or attempt to secure influence over the Black Market. Build buildings among the Elder Treetops or secure the Legendary Forge. Each landmark offers players new strategic challenges and tactical possibilities. Best of all, they work with each of Root's four maps!\nWith your support in 2019, the Underworld Kickstarter brought Root to more players than ever before. In the years since the game\u2019s release, Root continues to enjoy a vibrant and welcoming community of old and new players alike.\nAt Leder Games, we are deeply grateful for this community. Because of you all, we can keep food on our tables and the lights on at the office. You also give us space to take risks and develop new games. And, perhaps best of all, your support means that we can continue exploring the world of Root!\nRoot: The Marauder Expansion is the next chapter in the series. The expansion offers two new factions: the Lord of the Hundreds and the Keepers in Iron. Both factions are designed to work seamlessly with all previous factions and provide players with unique gameplay challenges and the dramatic, narrative-first asymmetry that has become a hallmark of Root\u2019s design.\nThe expansion also introduces the hireling system. This is a gameplay option that can be used at any player count and faction mix. Hirelings are perfect for folks wanting the experience of Root as a two-player contest or who want to inject their multiplayer games with even more combos and color from the game\u2019s wider world.\nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. In Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability.    \nTo understand how Root integrates with all of our products in this campaign, as well as our current existing expansions, please refer to our New to Root Chart.\nRoot is currently in-stock and available on our webstore for most regions. (For North American backers, we have a pre-order open for late Spring delivery.) If you want to obtain a copy as fast as possible, check with your Friendly Local Game Store or consider ordering from our site. For other expansions and products, you can order directly from our webstore or visit your neighborhood game seller. We will not offer an \u201cAll-In\u201d pledge, or include previous releases as add-ons for this campaign. \nAt Leder Games, we are committed to sharing our design process openly. As with campaigns in the past, we'll be releasing preview kits both as print-and-play files and mods for Tabletop Simulator. The first kit will be released on Thursday the 25th, and the second will arrive on the week following. \nClick here to download the preview kit!\n\nIf you are looking for players, you can find a huge community over on Leder Games' official Discord channel, the Woodland Warriors. \nShipping will be charged post-campaign in Backerkit.\n\nCustoms and Duty-Free Shipping\nLeder Games will pre-pay the duties and taxes for the backers who receive their games in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. All other countries or regions may be subject to additional customs fees upon delivery.\n\nFor our UK friends: At this time the UK has not provided a mechanism that will allow this type of pre-payment for crowdfunded projects fulfilling after June 2021. We are working with our VAT agency to find a solution, but at this time there is not one available. It is likely that by the time we\u2019re making plans for fulfillment there will not be additional VAT, but we cannot promise this with the ongoing legislation changes. We are keeping a close eye on developments, and will provide updates as we are able during the campaign and leading up to fulfillment.

Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Wizard's Grimoire\nA few years ago now, I designed a game called The Wizard's Grimoire. In it, you play an ambitious minor wizard who's come into possession of a grimoire beyond your arts. Can you study and unlock it? What wizardries does it contain? Into what troubles and adventures will your ambitions lead you?\nSince then, I've written several more games set in the same world -- The Barbarian's Bloody Quest, The Last Adventure, The Thief & the Necromancer -- and also additional grimoires for the original game. Each offers new characters to play or new wizardries to unlock and master.\nI'd like to bring these games to a wider audience. In all, I've already written enough material to publish 7 issues of a zine, so that's what I'm going to do!\nGameplay: the Grimoire\nAt the heart of the game is the grimoire: a text of many sections and its own set of rules. Each section represents a wizardous advancement you can achieve, a new spell you can learn or act of wizardry you can undertake, but each also has its own rules for unlocking and studying them. Don't read ahead! You can only read the sections you've unlocked and studied.\nMost wizards' grimoires also include \"safeguards,\" sections you unlock by improper study. These include magical curses, setbacks, and disasters. Trigger a safeguard and the spellbook may rewrite itself, summon a destructive creature from another world, or even send you reeling 10 minutes back into the past. Keep trying to study it without disarming the safeguard, and it'll keep sending you back!\nYour first grimoire is a challenging 1st-level text called \"The Signature of Aibesta of the Two Courts.\" Aibesta of the Two Courts was a powerful wizard of an age some four centuries past. Her grimoire includes the techniques to summon an Impeccable Servant, a powerful familiar and bodyguard, an act of wizardry that Aibesta undertook but never accomplished.\nWork your way through the entire grimoire, and not only will you learn powerful new spells, you'll establish your workroom, the foundation of your future seclusium; you'll learn techniques to better subdue and study future grimoires; and you'll accomplish what Aibesta herself couldn't: the summoning of an Impeccable Servant!\nGameplay: You and Your Volunteers\nTo play The Wizard's Grimoire, you need two volunteers (or three works fine) to play against you. Only you, the wizard player, need to know the rules. You're responsible for knowing your own rules and making your own calls. You're also responsible for telling your volunteers any points of continuity that you want them to know.\nIn this way, the game upends the normal player-GM relationship. Instead of a GM saying, \"hey, I have this game I'd like to run, who's in?\" you say, \"hey, I'm trying to get my wizard through this spellbook, do you have a minute?\"\nEach session that you play is an episode in your wizard's study and adventures. They can be as short or as long as you like, you can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can have different volunteers, or the same ones, every time you play.\nGameplay: System & Dice\nThe Wizard's Grimoire uses a dice pool version of the good old PbtA moves.\nYou have ratings for your moves based on your qualities -- for instance, your rating to exert yourself subtly to take surreptitious action is equal to your Ambitious + your Cunning, while your rating to exert yourself violently against an enemy is equal to your Bold + your Cunning. Roll that many dice, count the 4s, 5s and 6s as hits, and if you roll no hits, it's a miss. Usually, you get to spend your hits on things you want to happen or questions you want to ask, but you know how it is with moves, they each work a little differently.\nSince you both call for your own rolls and interpret their results for yourself, the moves answer to different design concerns than they do in a conventional PbtA game. I think they're pretty interesting, and if you're a PbtA-head like me, I think you will too.\nFuture Issues (Spoilers!)\n The Dictum of Polume the Farer: An easy and useful 1st-level grimoire, including such spells as creating a scampering lantern and summoning a jarful of plasmic hornets. You can study it alongside Aibesta's Signature for very good results.\n The Barbarian's Bloody Quest: Can you find and slay the wizard who butchered and subjugated your family? Includes \"The Book of Doomed Wizards.\" \n The Three Scrolls of Jorvelte Wild-Crowned: A 2nd-level grimoire, including the wizardous techniques to enchant magical items, including a useful and dangerous staff of glimmering menace.\n The Last Adventure: In your youth, you were a warrior and a hero. Now you're dead, but no one brought you the sup of oblivion. Take up the memory of your old sword, the memory of your old helmet, and make your last adventure here in the land of death. Includes \"In the Land of Death\" and \"Answering the Calling Voice.\" \n The Red Tome of Salabrusto the Wise: A 2nd-level grimoire, including an almanac of alien worlds and planes, and wizardous techniques both to travel to them and summon entities from them.\n The Thief & the Necromancer: You're friends, a gifted necromancer and a thief and street performer. You've both escaped bad situations and you've thrown in together to take on the world. Includes \"Goerne, a Ghostly Tutor.\" \nAttention: Patrons\nIf you support lumpley games on Patreon, you'll already get the digital version of The Wizard's Grimoire as a patron reward. Don't sign up for it here!\nIf you'd like a copy in print, though, this is the best way to get one.\nReduced Price Level & Community Copies\nTimes are tight!\nIf you want to support the project but the full price is a stretch, or if you're curious about the game but can't justify paying full price sight unseen, we've been there!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "This project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHINGS CAN CHANGE \nAll images used in this Kickstarter are subject to change and may represent unfinished or non-final art or design. All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency. We are not responsible for any refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency. \n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason Bezier Games, Inc. will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order. \n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to deny or fulfill orders beyond these 8 weeks under our discretion. If you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. \n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the retail release. \n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email orders@beziergames.com for further information.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes seeking adventure, fame, and fortune in the world of Golarion. \nWhat's Savage Worlds?\nSavage Worlds is a versatile roleplaying game system, first published in 2003 by Pinnacle Entertainment Group. Savage Worlds can be used with any genre or setting from four-color supers, to gritty sci-fi, to gothic horror, to high fantasy.\nWhat's an Adventure Path?\nAdventure Paths are in-depth stories for the Pathfinder RPG that tell an epic tale over a series of connected adventures. Players will see their characters grow in power from lowly beginnings until they become mighty heroes. \nSo why convert these Adventure Paths to Savage Worlds? \nSimply put, because we love them. Pathfinder fits right into the types of worlds we love to play in, like the Weird Wild West of Deadlands, college horror and hijinks in East Texas University, the monstrous Victorian pulp world of Rippers, the far-flung future of The Last Parsec, the comic-strip heroism of Flash Gordon, or any of the other settings we\u2019re known for.\nSo why not give Savage Worlds fans official rules to stop the insidious Skinsaw cult in Rise of the Runelords, defeat Baba Yaga in Reign of Winter, or explore the scorching deserts of Osiron in Mummy\u2019s Mask? \nThat was our proposition, and we feel honored our Paizo friends have trusted us to re-present their original work for our system. It\u2019s truly an honor and a privilege, and one of the greatest projects we\u2019ve ever worked on.\nWhat are some of the Big Rule Changes from regular Savage Worlds?\nFirst, Savage Pathfinder has Class Edges that give you one or more special abilities that balance out to the traditional Edge cost. Each one is unique and reinforces the class-based tropes of Pathfinder. And of course these serve as Requirements for higher Rank Edges that reflect Pathfinder's high-level abilities.\nSavage Pathfinder also uses our dynamic, flexible power system. Certain Arcane Backgrounds have features that reflect the nuances of Pathfinder magic. For example, sorcerers and wizards have Armor Limitations that inflict penalties on their arcane skills if they wear inhibiting armor, and the rules for resting and recovering Power Points have been tweaked to best reflect the world of Golarion.\nWe've also added new powers and advanced Power Modifiers modeled (but adjusted) from the \"Exalted Powers\" created for Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds. These allow your bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, or wizard to fully realize their power at higher Ranks!\n If you want to pick and choose from the items in the boxed set, or if you require duplicates of particular pieces for your players, you will be able to select from the following Add-Ons once the pledge manager opens at the end of the campaign.    \nAdventurers love loot! As the campaign progresses, we'll add \"Stretch Goals\" to make your pledge even greater. Help us unlock a treasure trove of digital and physical bonuses by sharing the Kickstarter link with your friends and anywhere you talk about gaming online. The more you share, the more extras we all get! (Hey, we play too! A LOT!)\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nRemember that we give all backers the VTT Basics for free (our first Stretch Goal).\nWow! You're gonna need a Bag of Holding for all these INCREDIBLE rewards you've helped us unlock! Thanks, Pathfinders! We'll be seeing you soon!\n It's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to champion the cause, you can do so using the following channels.\nPathfinder for Savage Worlds is written and in playtesting at the time of this writing (Feb 2021). Your support allows us to create the extras and to help boost the signal to other fans\u2014by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours.\nWe deliver the first PDF a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you to include additional Pinnacle products with your order. Want to add an additional copy of the Savage Worlds rules, Deadlands: The Weird West, or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds? Those will all be available. \nWe'll charge for shipping there in the pledge manager. \nBelow is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. We know this is a painful part of the process, so our goal is to fill each reward level with an amazing amount of high-quality books and accessories which will more than make up for these additional costs (especially once we finalize any additional Stretch Goals!).\nWe also pay for some of the shipping costs ourselves to keep the overall rates as low as possible. No matter what happens between now and the time the packages ship, we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\nClick to see as larger image. Shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in Italy is 4%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping.\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole adventuring party, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package, while you pledge for a digital reward tier. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com.\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Retailers Benefit in the Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Kickstarter\" newsletter here for details on how to participate in this project!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing Info@peginc.com.\nAny Questions? Email Pinnacle customer service at Info@peginc.com\n But...How Does Pathfinder for Savage Worlds Play?\nCheck out these playtests which aired during the Kickstarter.  First we have 5 episodes of our Premiere Playtest for Hollow's Last Hope!\nBefore that, we aired the \"PEG Playtest\" with GM and co-developer Karl Keesler:\nWe also previewed the Quick Chase Deck (still playtesting, folks...)during the Kickstarter!\nAnd talked with Paizo Inc.'s Jason Bulmahn:\nWe brought all the GMs together who ran Hollow's Last Hope to playtest Savage Pathfinder:\nAnd we had the cool opportunity to talk game design with Pathfinder: Kingmaker developers Owlcat Games!\nPlus other Q&A's and discussion about design.

Enter Twill Medwyn, foremost expert in the all-important field of cryptoarchaeology, and her first-ever guide to Twist Points! With Twill's guide in hand, your adventurers will learn to explore their environments to find new ways to succeed in the harrowing challenges they face every day! \nThe haunted artifacts of Mansion D'Arthane are ideal for cryptoarchaeological research!\nEvery Twist Point provides two fantastic options that your players can use to immerse themselves in the game world. Whether they shatter a Haunted Mirror to enhance their spiritual weapons or wind themselves up Hanging Silks to gain an acrobatic flair to their attacks, your adventurers will find hundreds of thematic options to create memorable combat scenes!\nTwill's Twist Points is a 56-page zine filled with 25 fantastic locations and rules to bring them to life! Each location has six twist points, unique objects and features that players can use to enhance their abilities and grant them new options in combat. From strange spell components and mystical effects to dangerous nooks and dire environmental hazards, each twist point grants two possibilities to empower your players during a climactic scene!\nPrototype image of the Infernal Machine scene and two sample Twist Points!\n\nAlong with two dozen unique locations, all backers will also receive rules for discovering and utilizing twist points with Twill Medwyn's very own Guidelines for Apprentice Cryptoarchaeologists! Finally, there will also be guidelines for creating new spectacular scenes and filling them with your very own twist points! \nThis zine is intended to be used with the 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons under the Open Gaming License, but will include advice for adapting these rules to Pathfinder, Fantasy AGE, OSR, and many other roleplaying games.\nDungeons & Dragons works best when players are able to experience the three major pillars of play: combat, roleplaying, and exploration. Twist points are designed to give players clear options for exploring an encounter, without adding too much time and complexity to the scene. \nEach twist point is based around one or two skills. If your character is proficient in that skill, you can instantly see how to use a twist point to your advantage! \nThese waterlogged masts are only strong enough for one last hurrah! Which will it be?\nPowerful twist points require a more focused approach. By spending a bonus action and succeeding on a skill check, players gain access to dramatic Legendary effects! Most twist points can only be used for one moment of high-action play, driving players to choose between two fantastic boons. Throughout their battle, players must work together and strategize about the best way to apply these effects to a scene! \nLegendary twist points grant even more incredible opportunities to empower your scene!\nGame masters can use Twill's Twist Points in a couple ways to add some explorative heft to their game.  Sometimes, one of our prewritten scenes is the perfect place to set a climactic battle scene in your own game. But game masters can easily take a set of Twist Points and use them in their own world. Twill's Twist Points is filled with a wide variety of scenes for almost any occasion!\n\nLet's get Twill's Twist Points into your game with as little fuss as possible! \nPledge levels are quick, simple, and convenient.\n$7: Digital Cryptoarchaeologist\nOne digital copy of the zine, along with all stretch goals! You'll get Dropbox download links for both full-color and print-friendly formats.\n$15: Physical Cryptoarchaeologist (US Shipping Only)\nOne physical copy of the zine, along with all stretch goals, sent to your very own home! The physical zine is a 5.5\"x 8.5\" booklet, printed and shipped from Los Angeles. You'll also get a digital copy of the zine!\n$50: Master Cryptoarchaeologist (Create Your Own Scene!)\nYou'll send us a short description of a fantastic location from your own campaign. Julian and Rich will then work with you to create a brand new set of twist points for your game and include it in the zine! Oh yeah, and physical and digital copies of the zine! Plus, we'll ship this zine to you anywhere in the world. \n\nDESIGN & LAYOUT: Julian Leiberan-Titus (@dragmorian) is a game designer, graphic designer, and avid storyteller.

Add-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match items from multiple reward tiers in an unusual way (or at least, in a way the Kobolds did not anticipate!). If you want a copy of the Limited Edition, you must select that as the base reward; it is not available as an add-on.\nFor example, if you want the Limited Edition hardcover + PDF, and you also want a copy of the regular edition and both a Shard license and a Roll20 license, you will have the option to add those as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.\nThe add-ons for this project are limited to the physical book produced as part of this project. Per Kickstarter policy, we will not be offering add-on items from prior Kobold Press Kickstarters.\nThe books, PDF, and VTTs will all release in late October per the current schedule. Given how far along we are with design, development, editing, and art, this is a reasonable schedule.\nAt the same time, we're going to take a serious risk with international shipping for this project. Despite the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're offering the printed books as part of the Kickstarter globally. Shipping costs will be calculated separately from the Kickstarter itself and charged in a pledge manager. \nThis project will use bulk shipments to Canada, the EU, the UK, and Australia to attempt to reduce shipping costs. Given the confusion around VAT in the EU and UK shipments right now, this is a serious risk. Overseas backers may be required to pay VAT or Customs fees, but the cost of postage itself is usually lower using bulk shipping. This form of shipping means overseas packages will arrive a month or two later than US shipments.\nAs is always the case with a Kobold Press project, if we exceed our initial funding goal, we will expand the contents of Vault of Magic through fun and value-added stretch goals. The greater your level of support, the better the book becomes. How many will we hit? The funnest part is finding out! Below, you can see the many, many goals reached with your support!\nFabled Items: We're introducing some new styles of items in Vault of Magic. More information is available on this in the \"What is a Fabled Item?\" update.\nGuest Designer Items: We'll reveal items by our guest designers to our backers as stretch goals, and some guest designers will discuss them on the Kobold Chat Twitch show. You will find 21 guest designers in all, with their item previews posted under Updates.\nOur final run of stretch goals is spelled out below. It's been a huge run, our single most successful project ever--even bigger than the Tome of Beasts!\nWe found one more goal: every great book needs a great bookmark!\n\nWe're incredibly proud of the creative team that has been working on Vault of Magic for 5th Edition the last year and more. Here are a few of the primary contributors:\nJeff Lee, Designer. Jeff has been a gamer for 39 years and a freelance game designer for the last seven years. He has produced material for Gun Metal Games, Legendary  Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among many others. Jeff is the author of Demon Cults & Secret Societies and 12 Peculiar Towers from Kobold Press.\nPhillip Larwood, Designer. Phillip has been writing for Kobold Press on and off for more than a decade and has a deep, abiding love for all things magical and mysterious. He excelled at aberrations,  fiends, and horrors in his contributions to Tome of Beasts and Tome of Beasts 2, and he further expanded our knowledge of alkemancy and magical servitors in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. Many of the fantastic items in this book are a result of his great penmanship and warped imagination, and his hand-typed manuscripts always smell faintly of cinnamon and myrrh.\nMeagan Maricle, Lead Editor. Meagan was the lead editor on Kobold Press's upcoming City of Cats, Margreve Player\u2019s Guide, Underworld Player\u2019s Guide, Empire of the Ghouls, Tome of Beasts 2, and the ENnie award-winning Creature Codex. When not saving kobolds from their own word traps, she schemes the demise of her players\u2019 characters while petting her diabolical, furry companion (\u201cI\u2019ll get you next time, PCs!\u201d). She has been playing (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since the early 90s when her parents turned her into an emerald wyrmling.\nMarc Radle, Art Director. Marc has been the Art Director and lead graphic designer at Kobold Press  since 2012. He's done the art direction, layout, and graphic design on  hundreds of Kobold Press releases. Marc also occasionally squeezes in time to write\u2014he penned the Shadows of the Dusk Queen adventure and was the lead designer on the New Paths Compendium, both from Kobold Press. He's been playing D&D since the late 70s, along with plenty of other great RPGs\u2014Pathfinder,  Marvel Superheroes, Champions, Elfquest, FASA\u2019s Star Trek, Star  Frontiers . . . the list goes on and on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 37 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 17 of them on Kickstarter (this is #19). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Vault of Magic, the item design is already done and with the editor. Likewise, we already have the cover and a portion of the interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are layout and proofing of the books, and managing the uncertain landscape for printing and shipping.\n\nOther risks include the new ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from COVID-related printer delays plus the recent tampering with the US Post Office. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if some dangerous magic is unleashed by our rash experiments in the wizard's chambers? Well, surely one or two kobolds will survive to tell the tale!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nPrinted on FSC and recycled paper.\nSustainable Distribution\nBulk shipment to multiple locations to avoid air freight carbon impact.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Vault of Magic PDF", "descp": "An encyclopedic tome of new magic items for 5th Edition, illustrated and with expansive tables for treasure generation in bookmarked, searchable, convenient PDF form.\nINCLUDES:\nVault of Magic PDF\nPreviews and updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["1,960 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "Vault of Magic Virtual Tabletop + PDF", "descp": "You get the Vault of Magic for the virtual tabletop of your choice (Roll20, Fantasy Grounds, or Shard) plus the PDF at no extra charge.\nINCLUDES:\nVault of Magic for VTT (Roll20, FG, or Shard)\nVault of Magic PDF\nPreviews and updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["716 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Vault of Magic Hardcover + PDF", "descp": "The hardcover edition of this encyclopedic tome of magical items, with the PDF at no extra charge.\nDOES NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Designed for serious adventurers. The Oceanus Brass Kraken Blade is sharp, eye-catching, and built to last. We set out to make a timeless cutting instrument that was both rich in history and classic in design. One that you would want to own and take with you on your day\u2019s journey, either on the open ocean or in the great outdoors. The result is a rugged and attractive knife that can be operated with either hand.\nEnvisioned while at sea, conjuring images of beasts that live down in the depths of the ocean, quality, satisfaction, and power come packaged with every blade. \nMachined from a brick of solid brass, the Kraken Blade will withstand hard use. A rustproof, working knife, ready to go when you need it. No outdoors adventurer should be going about without a trusty cutting tool by his side.\nFirst-in-class, seamless blade deployments. Keep it magnetically locked, or snap it open for unrestricted action. With a reliable and intuitive mechanism, nothing can get in your way when slicing through your daily tasks.\nBelow, are targeted milestones for us to hit as a community. When we hit a goal, each and every backer benefits \u2014 it's our way of saying thank you! \n $10k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] Stainless steel hardware! The nuts and bolts complementing your Kraken Blade, shall be made out of corrosion-resistant stainless steel.  \n $25k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K goal, we will add custom pivot washers in soft copper, for smoother, more robust, opening action.\n $35k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K and $25K goals, we will start manufacturing the knives before the campaign ends, which will move the shipping date up by up to four weeks (depending on when we unlock the reward!).\n $50k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, and $35K goals, we will add double the clasping magnets.\n $75k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, and $50K goals, we will engineer and add a completely custom, split-shaft, Chicago screw style, pivot screw(s) in stainless steel (of course!). \n $100k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, $50K, and $75K goals, we will also ship an additional No. 1992 carbon steel utility blade (*possibly domestic only).\n $150k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, $50K, $75K, and $100K goals, every knife backer gets an extra solid brass Bow-Shackle. \n $400k \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, $50K, $75K, and $150K goals, every knife backer gets an extra set of stainless steel hardware.\n $500k \u2014 In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, $50K, $75K, $150K, and $400K goals, every knife backer gets the Stainless Steel reinforcement blade plate.\n Amazing Backers \u2014 [UNLOCKED] In addition to the $10K, $25K, $35K, $50K, $75K, $150K, $400K, and $500K goals, we will be engineering some additional improvements :)\nWe'll send out the item from the corresponding tier with each Kraken Blade automatically depending on where we finish!\nNo mythical sea monster has ever been quite as terrifying as the Kraken.  This massive, many-armed creature could reach as high as the top of the main mast of a sailing ship, according to stories. A Kraken would strike a vessel by wrapping its arms around the hull and capsizing it.  What's unique about the Kraken legends is that we have the best evidence of this beast being based on something real.\nAlthough in Systema Naturae (Carolus Linnaeus-1735) the word Kraken is first found in print, tales about this creature seem to date back to  Norway in the twelfth century. Such tales refer to a creature so large that it is mistaken for an island or an archipelago. Even as late as  1752, when Bergen's Bishop Erik Ludvigsen Pontoppidan wrote his The Natural History of Norway, he described the Kraken with a width of one and a half miles as \"incontestably the world's largest sea monster.\" \nIn 1802 the French scientist Pierre Denys de Montfort stated in his book on the natural history of mollusks that the creature encountered by  Norwegian sailors was the kracken octopus. The legendary Kraken is basically what we now know as the giant squid.  While a colossal octopus may also fit the description, it is thought that the squid will be much more violent and more likely to come to the surface where men could see it.\nThe No. 1992 steel utility blade present in the Kraken Blade is tough and will stay sharp with daily use due to its great edge retention and corrosion-resistant material. Without worrying about getting chipped, dull bent, or broken, you can use it for camping, fishing, sailing, as a work tool, or most EDC tasks. \nA dull blade can be more dangerous than a sharp one. Dull knives require more cutting pressure, thereby reducing control. When your blade is dull easily replace it with a sharp new one. These blades can be found worldwide at most hardware stores and online.\nIt is not only great at cutting, nipping, or carving. Its pointy tip is useful for delicate puncturing and may be more useful than a blunt-tipped knife in the situation of survival at sea. \nThe Kraken Blade has been manufactured to thrive over decades of use, through all of the conditions you intend to throw it though. What was once a labor of love, is now a timeless utility instrument available for all, but we need your help to make this dream a reality.\nOur products are steeply discounted off retail prices because we want to reward our very first customers. The opportunity to purchase a knife of this magnitude at this price is rare. With our finishing assembly, our master craftsmanship, the Kraken Blade, with your help, shall be accessible to all. \nWe stand behind the quality of our tools and the uniqueness and complexity of our hardware. Each piece has its own unique character that we hope will bring joy and nostalgia when put into action.\nThe Oceanus Brass Kraken Blade is currently spec'd to be as followed. As with any project not yet complete, these dimensions may change slightly over time as we optimize our manufacturing systems and the tool's design:\n Weight: ~9oz (254g)\n Width: ~1.6in (40mm)\n Length (Without Bow-Shackle, closed): ~4.4in (113mm)\n Length (Without Bow-Shackle, open): ~6.3in (160mm)\n Thickness (Without Bow-Shackle): ~0.6in (16mm) \n Length (With Bow-Shackle, closed): ~4.9in (124mm)\n Length (With Bow-Shackle, open): ~6.7in (171mm)  \n Thickness (With Bow-Shackle): ~1.0in (25mm)\nThe versatility of the Bow-Shackle made it an indispensable tool on the seas, and it continues to impress today. Although the brass Bow-Shackle is the statement piece of the Kraken Blade, we have made it independently available through this Kickstarter campaign as a gift for backers at our $10 tier. Creativity is your only boundary when putting the Bow-Shackle to use. \nThe Bow-Shackle makes for a helpful attachment point. There\u2019s really no excuse for losing your Kraken Blade. You can easily attach it to your backpack, sailing jacket, or any outdoor equipment.\nWith our design roots in Boston, our company draws creative inspiration from the hub of America\u2019s rich nautical history. In developing our products, our original prototypes and inspiration came from the old shipyards of East Boston.\nThe nautically-inspired Kraken Blade harkens back to a time of adventure on open seas, its durability a testament to the harsh demands of that bygone era. Our hardware is tied to the art and science of sailing and exploration. We\u2019ve invested into refining the Kraken Blade into its final, perfectly balanced form.\nInspired by nautical-grade hardware, the Kraken Blade is Oceanus's signature utility instrument. Its unique rich color and practical beauty are perfect for everyday use, travel, or adventure.\nWe launched Oceanus Brass because we wanted to share our nautically inspired knife with the world and turn an idea into action. A project that was both challenging and rewarding, the Oceanus Brass Kraken Blade is something we are very proud to share with you. We hope to encourage others to try their hand at something new just as we did, to build something of their own, to go through that exploration process of learning and bringing inspiration to fruition. We owe a great debt of gratitude to the many relationships we\u2019ve built along the way with industrial designers and manufacturers who helped us push the boundaries of what we were told was possible.\nSince launching our first product in 2017, The Oceanus Brass - Bow Shackle Pen,  we are proud to have been embraced by the ocean-loving community.  Below are a few of our favorite excerpts of what the experts are saying  about our products;\nCool Material: \"If your EDC needs some serious knife variety, the nautically-themed   Bosun\u2019s Edge Knife should fit in perfectly. Both utilitarian and  artful,  the Bosun\u2019s Edge is made from solid brass and uses a  replaceable  utility blade for perpetual sharpness on the cheap.\"\nLife In The Slow Lane: \"It's a beautiful pen and we'll enjoy having it on our boat, and it'll make a wonderful heirloom to pass down to our grandson one day. Maybe  he'll even have a special boat to keep it on.\"\nMy2Fish: \"The solid brass construction is nearly indestructible, so for the cost  of pen ink refill every couple of years, this pen will likely last  forever.\"\nSailing Britican: \"In the past, I\u2019ve been known to tape string to the end of a pen or tie string around a cap but it inevitably fails when someone gives a little tug and off my pen goes. In other words, my efforts to prevent other pen thieves have failed miserably\u2026but not with my bow-shackle pen! I have it attached to my nav station book rail.\"\nDinghy Dreams: \"Even though I\u2019m ink rich right now I keep navigating back to the same one, my shackle pen by Oceanus Brass. Nautically inspired and handcrafted by a small start-up company in Boston, Mass., this pen is nearly impossible to lose as it has a shackle to attach to logbooks, dry bags, or wherever you see fit aboard your vessel. As I\u2019ve been route  planning for my upcoming voyage this pen has been seeing much use and it  writes just as smoothly as the day it came out of the box.\"\n What is the history of the Kraken Blade? Well, let's shine a specific spotlight on an inspiring Creative Commons 3d model;\nThe work done by BiscuitsOnTheFloor, through the Creative Commons Licensed, 3D  model, \"Retracc\" which can be found here, is a significant inspiration for the Kraken Blade. BiscuitsOnTheFloor is an impressive US-based designer. For any sailor with a 3-d printer onboard their vessel, be sure to check out all work, here!\nThe work done by CorrugatorSupercilii, through the Creative Commons Licensed, 3D model, \"cat claw\" which can be found here, was \"remixed\" by BiscuitsOnTheFloor and improved. \nWe built our own model from scratch to optimize its design, its function, and its ability to be machined in brass. More information on the work mentioned above can be found here.  To honor our community and those from who we drew inspiration, more information on our version of the four-bar-linkage model can be found there as well. Some of the ideas sent to us (looking at you @ChrisB), have been very clever and we would love for our latest spin on a four-bar-linkage tool to have as many eyes, hands, and sailors on it, as possible!\nBUYING: You must certify that you are 18+ years of age, that you are legally able to purchase this item and that you will use it responsibly. \nWe intend to include a No. 1992 carbon steel utility blade with each Kraken Blade purchased (or two blades when the stretch goal is unlocked!). For international backers, an option may be made available during the fulfillment process to possibly have the blades removed from the shipment all together \u2014 we had this request during the fulfillment of the Bosun's Edge campaign. As with all campaigns, customs/duty fees are the responsibility of the backer. In the past hasn't been an issue, but with strange occurrences such as Brexit, we will do our best to support however possible. \nTo keep up the momentum, please share the campaign on social media and or tell your friends, co-workers, and neighbors about us!

Immediately we knew at some point in the future we wanted to make a plush. Little did we know that getting to this point would be quite the journey.  \nBaby Bestiary: Volume 1 - Owlbear Cubs, illustrated by Conceptopolis\nIn the back of our heads, we had always known that we wanted to do a plush. About a year or two after we had completed the core Baby Bestiary handbooks, we started making our first attempts at getting an owlbear plush mad.  \nOur results were interesting, to say the least, and we struggled for quite some time to find a design that we liked. Normally, we would show an artist concept art and we could trust them to go from there with minimal feedback. However,  when we provided our concept art to plush makers, they all went to for the traditional stuffed bear look.  \nEarly Owlbear Prototypes\n  As you can see, our early prototypes really didn't quite get to the look that we were going for. The first two, didn't feel cute, and the third and fourth were way too stuffed bear, not even looking like the iconic owlbear (at least to us). \nWhile visiting LA's Little Tokyo Historic District, and browsing the plush shops, I was hit with the realization that our owlbear needed to be more abstracted. So immediately I had one of our artists draw up a concept, which we immediately fell in love with.  \nOwlbear Plush Concept, illustrated by Vincent Yau\nAfter receiving this amazing piece, we started on prototype #5, and although the prototype didn't get the head right on the first try, it was easily fixed. And led to our, favorite plush design!\nSince then, we've been wrapping up our other projects, like Awakened and the 2021 Calendar. And preparing to bring this adorable little owlbear to life! \nOwlbear in flowers\nPledge Tiers\nAs we've discovered in our history of running Kickstarters, simpler is better. So we've broken down all our rewards into three components, Digital, Base Owlbear, and Unlocks Owlbear. And due to the recent interest in having more than one owlbear we've expanded the options to accommodate those who would like to get more than one owlbear plush.   \nPledge Tiers\nWatcher ($5)\n Digital Goodies: Recieve all digital goodies created for this project.\nAdopter ($35)\n Owlbear Plush (x1): Recieve one adorable owlbear plush.\n Digital Goodies: Recieve all digital goodies created for this project.\nTwins ($65)\n Owlbear Plush (x2): Recieve two adorable owlbear plushies.\n Digital Goodies: Recieve all digital goodies created for this project.\nIn A Box ($60)\n Deluxe Box/Physical Goodies and Accessories (x1): Any physical reward that is unlocked during this project will be included here.\n Owlbear Plush (x1): Recieve one adorable owlbear plush.\n Digital Goodies: Recieve all digital goodies created for this project.\nTwins With A Box ($85)\n Deluxe Box/Physical Goodies and Accessories (x1): Get all physical rewards that are unlocked for this project.\n Owlbear Plush (x2): Recieve two adorable owlbear plushies.\n Digital Goodies: Recieve all digital goodies created for this project.\n\nDigital Goodies Currently Include:\nOwlbear Artbook (+design works)\nShort D&D 5e Adventure.\nOwlbear Wallpaper Design\nRyuutama Journey \nD&D 5e Classes with owlbear companion\nOwlbear Rearing Guide\nDeluxe Box Currently Include:\nPlush Collectors Box\nCaretakers Pledge Certificate \nAccessory #1 (Cloak)\nAccessory #2 (Fishy Companion)\nAccessory #3 (Pewter Owlbear Mini)\nMWG Owlbear Brand Tags (like those that TY has) \nThe Owlbear Plush\nStuffed with fluff and what we assume you all came here for. \nI don't think there's really much more to say about it, but for the year that we've had the adorable prototype we've absolutely loved it, and so has everyone else who's been able to hold and hug it. \n Its important to note that this owlbear is a prototype and that the final that you receive may change slightly. Though we're going to do our best to keep it as close to the original design/cuteness as possible.  \nOwlbear in a tree\nDigital Goodies\nWith this project, we want to create a bunch of digital assets in celebration of our owlbear. To start off, we're going to make a little digital artbook composed of our old owlbear art, as well as new art inspired by the owlbear plush!. Currently, this is slated to about 20 pages featuring a large diversity of artists and art-styles.  \nHere are a few of our favorite illustrations for you to enjoy!\nOwlbears illustrated by @hessaimarian\nOwlbears illustrated by @hessaimarian\nOwlbear illustrated by @crystalartsy\nOwlbear plush by @christinabindon\n As the project unlocks stretch goals, we'll add more digital goodies as well as expand the artbook.\nPost-Project + Shipping \nAfter this project is concluded, we import everyone into Backerkit or another backer management system. Here, we will collect your shipping information, handle add-ons, upgrades, and charge for shipping costs.\nCurrently, we can reduce the shipping cost by getting owlbears to our three partner-warehouses located in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. If we can get a larger volume, we can reach out to other regional warehouses (like Canada), to reduce shipping costs. But, for right now, we're estimating costs will near the following:  (costs below are converted to USD): \n United States: ~ $13.50\n Canada and South America: ~ $26.90\n Europe: ~ $18.37 ($14 shipping + 4.5 of VAT)\n Australia: ~ $18.81 (converted to USD, validating costs)\nWe understand shipping is hard, and we do our best to reduce the price as much as possible so we can keep the owlbear accessible for everyone. \nStretch Goals \n We've got a ton of plans for our adorable owlbear plush, and we're excited to watch the possibilities for this owlbear grow with you.\n Stretch Goals: Digital Goodies Expansion \nOn the digital side, we're looking to provide you with special owlbear-focused content, from expanding the artbook, system companions, classes, adventures, statblocks, and other useful digital designs for you to use. \nGoodies Expansion #1 (unlocked @ $10k)\n Artbook expansion x3 - we will bring in three more artists to do their own illustration of the owlbear plush.\n Adventure - We're going to create an owlbear-focused adventure for D&D 5e.\nGoodies Expansion #2) (unlocked @ $15k)\nWallpaper Design - we will commission a repeating wallpaper design of the owlbear (sometime in the future we'll use this pattern for gift wrap or even a cloth pattern)\n Adventure -  An owlbear-focused adventure for Ryuutama \nGoodies Expansion #3) (unlocked @ $35k)\n Artbook Expansion -As an owlbear ages - a series of illustrations that show off the owbear from, egg to elder.\nGoodies Expansion #4) (unlocked @ $45k)\nD&D 5e Owlbear Subclasses \nGoodies Expansion #5) (unlocked @ $125k)\nOwlbear Design Works (artbook expansion + prior artworks)\nGoodies Expansion #6) (unlocked @ $175k)\nOwlbear Rearing Guide\nGoodies Expansion #7) (unlocked @ $225k)\nChildren's Book\nGoodies Expansion #8) (unlocked @ $300k)\nAnother 5e Owlbear Adventure\n Stretch Goals: Owlbear Accessory\nThis will include any physical rewards that are unlocked.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "This is Lighthearted\nWelcome to the magical 80s dream world of Lighthearted. You are a Prep, Jock, Geek, Rebel, or Outcast, like those kids in The Breakfast Club, except you are just about to start magic community college. Through play, we'll explore how you grow out of your high school cliques all while dealing with magical mishaps, college parties, vampires, and worse\u2014finals!\nLighthearted is a complete tabletop roleplaying game that uses the language of film and television to reimagine the coming of age stories popular in 80s teen movies like Weird Science and Sixteen Candles, but with a modern fantasy spin. It's set in an alternate 1980s with fantasy elements weaved into the most outlandish bits of 80\u2019s pop culture. There are fantasy religions mixed in with mall culture, dark magic cold wars, and magical glamours instead of plastic surgery.\nHow does it play?\nLighthearted plays out like a movie or TV show, setting scenes by describing the lighting, camera angles, and soundtrack then playing through the action and dialog. \nThe game utilizes an original system, but draws inspiration from Savage Worlds and Powered by the Apocalypse games. The system focuses on the balance between the character\u2019s motivation and their emotional struggle at any given moment, helping to create both external and internal conflict within the game.\nComing of Age Stories\nTo help players tell their coming of age story, and help their characters overcome society's expectations for who they'll become, Lighthearted uses a system called Malfunctions.  \nMalfunctions are sets of positive and negative choices. The negative choices represent the flaws society expects them to have and the positive choices offer a chance for the character to grow and change into something new. \nThe Dice\nThe game uses a roll and keep die mechanic. You roll a Trait die and an Emotion die and keep whichever is higher. Traits are determined at character creation and represent the character's physical, mental, and social attributes. Emotions change over the course of a scene to represent how the character's actions affect their emotional state. This brings the character's emotions to the forefront of the player's minds and affects how they approach their goals. \nFamiliar with Savage Worlds? Trait dice function similar to skills, and the Emotion dice function like a variable wild die. You'll also find an exploding die mechanic to add a little excitement to every roll.\n\nThe Results\nResolving rolls involves establishing what the character wants and what is at stake if they fail. Based on their roll they might get what they want, get what they want but lose what was at stake, or not get what they want and also lose what was at stake.\nFamiliar with PbtA games? This works like the banded success you are already used to where you can succeed, succeed at a cost, or suffer consequences.\n\nThe Music\nMusic is an important part of setting scenes in Lighthearted. To help with that we've put together a Spotify playlist of some of our favorite 80s songs to accompany your games. Listen to the playlist here!\n\n\nTry the Quickstart\nA screenshot of the Lighthearted Quickstart\nThe Lighthearted Quickstart is a guided tour that teaches a slimmed-down version of the rules through a Spirit Week adventure.

When we launch our post-campaign pledge manager to gather your emails and addresses (if needed), we\u2019ll ask for your DriveThruRPG email.\nOnce the PDF is ready, we\u2019ll upload it to DriveThruRPG and send your email a link (in URL form) that contains a coupon for a free digital redemption of Lighthearted! It\u2019s pretty quick and painless, and if you\u2019ve used it before, you know how easy it is.\nPhysical Fulfillment - US Backers\nFor US backers, we\u2019ll gather your information in the pledge manager. Once the books are printed, Gallant Knight Games will ship them to you (most likely via media mail in order to make things as affordable as possible, though we\u2019ll have more insight into that when shipping draws closer) and we\u2019ll provide a tracking number to your email.\nPhysical Fulfillment - International (non-US) Backers\nFor non-US/International backers, we\u2019ll gather your information in the pledge manager. We\u2019ll charge you shipping there too. Once the print-on-demand version is proofed and ready on DriveThruRPG, we\u2019ll upload your information and order you a copy via DriveThruRPG\u2019s print service. We'll pay the print cost and shipping, and then DTRPG will print and mail it to you.\nThis has two benefits:\nFirst, DTRPG uses POD services all over the world. This results in more affordable shipping for you, as well as more timely arrival of your package.\nSecondly, there is a likelihood of decreased customs fees depending on your locale (though each situation is unique, and it\u2019s on the backer to handle custom fees.) \nRetailers and Game Stores\nGallant Knight Games also has distribution through Studio 2.\nWho's involved?\nKurt Potts - Co-Creator and Layout: Kurt is a Creative Director by trade with a healthy love for tabletop games and game design.

The time is right for it to return in this stunning new format for its Silver Anniversary. \nThe Campaign \nThis campaign includes the entire Everway Mythic Roleplaying product line re-launch:\n Book 1: Players \u2013 Everything a player needs to play.\n Book 2: Gamemasters \u2013 Information a gamemaster needs to run quests.\n Deluxe Fortune Deck \u2013 The tarot-like deck that powers Everway.\n Vision Collection 1 \u2013 84 fantasy art cards by world renowned artists.\n Vision Collection 2 \u2013 84 additional fantasy art cards for play.\n Numerous add-ons \u2013 Enhance your Everway games.\nThe Basic Fortune Deck is all that is required to play Everway, and it includes just the 36-card Fortune Deck in poker-sized cards. \nThe Deluxe Fortune Deck has 77 tarot-sized cards and includes both the Fortune Deck and Season Deck. It also adds elemental, planetary, and zodiac correspondences directly on the cards as shown above. When used as tarot cards, the Fortune Deck acts as the major arcana and the Season Deck as a the minor arcana.\nEach card in the Season Deck can be used as a replacement Usurper card in the Fortune Deck if desired.\nWe've included several other ways to use the Fortune Deck and Season Deck together or separately. We know you'll love the new look of these cards, as well as how well they work as an oracle deck.\nWe weren't satisfied with a simple re-release. We wanted to make it bigger, better, more accessible with larger fonts, and more awesome! Here are a few things you'll find in the set.\n\nBook 1: Players\n368-page full-color book for players.\n168 full-color vision images for hero and quest creation. \nA guide to the 36-card Fortune Deck is included, with a random card draw at the bottom of each page. \nExpanded Roundwander campaign setting, with a full-color map of the realm.\nA Quick Start Guide summarizes the most important game rules.\nA dozen ready-to-run heroes are included.\n\n Book 2: Gamemasters \n400-page full-color book for gamemasters. \nDetailed guidance on how to run combat, handle wounds, design quests and realms, reward players with boons, and more. \nNew rules options to cater to different play styles. \nMore than 100 new mythic creatures.\n4 large ready-to-run quests with 27 quest visions (14 brand new). \n17 beautiful full-color maps for the quests.\nThis book can also be used as a Fortune Deck by flipping to a random page. \n\nBasic Fortune Deck\n36 cards in a poker-sized Fortune Deck.\nDigital edition of Key to the Fortune Deck PDF.\n\nDeluxe Fortune Deck\nTarot-sized 36-card Fortune Deck.\nTarot-sized 41-card Season Deck.\n7 double-sided source cards.\nDigital edition of the Key to the Fortune Deck PDF.\nThe combined deck can be used independently as an oracle deck.\n\nVision Collection 1\nThe first set of 84 vision images (7 sets of 12) included in Book 1: Players.\n\nVision Collection 2\nThe second set of 84 vision images (7 more sets of 12) included in Book 1: Players.\nThis campaign includes two amazing books filled with more than 200 pieces of full-color art, poker and tarot-sized versions of the Fortune Deck, the Key to the Fortune Deck PDF, and two Vision Collections, of 84 cards each. \n\nTarot Tier\nDigital Tier\nHardback Tier\nDeluxe Tier\n The Deluxe Hardback books are renderings of how we intend for these limited-run collector books to look, not actual photos. They are bound in leather-like Skivertex, with silver foil stamping, silver foiled page edges, and a ribbon.\nWe will announce our pledge manager near the end of the campaign.

We are partnering with a well-known company to operate worldwide logistics. They have successfully delivered many Kickstarter campaigns in the past.\n Delivery expected by August 2021. We have waited until the books were written, edited, and laid out to start the campaign, so will move rapidly to manufacturing in China following the close of the campaign. The Digital tier will get their rewards at the same time as the Hardback tier out of fairness to our Hardback backers.\n You\u2019ll pay later for shipping. You keep more of your money longer, and shipping rates will be as close as possible to actual cost. Trust us, we won\u2019t make any money on shipping.\n Rewards will ship from the warehouse in the United States. This is more reliable and ultimately less expensive than a collection of global partners. In part due to direct control of this facility, shipping operations have remained both open and safe during the global pandemic.\n Cards. Card add-ons may ship separately to reduce total shipping cost. Cards may be produced by a print on demand service, depending on order volume.\n You\u2019ll prepay taxes later. This allows rewards traveling outside the US to be sent \u201cDelivery Duty Paid\u201d (DDP) where available, so international packages shouldn\u2019t be delayed at customs or flagged for extra fees. Backing Everway on Kickstarter is not a useful way to avoid paying your local government\u2019s taxes.\n Shipping and handling by destination country. Shipping and handling will be collected through our pledge manager after the campaign closes. They are our best estimates given the current shipping climate, not guarantees. You can find these at our shipping page after the campaign.\n Restricted countries. This campaign will not ship rewards to Afghanistan, Brazil, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine.\n Your responsibility. From the day we begin shipping, you\u2019ll have six months to complete your order and pay for shipping and taxes. Pledges unclaimed after six months will be assumed abandoned and your pledge amount will be converted to a project donation. Fulfillment any time thereafter is best effort based on availability.\n Retailers. Backing as a verified retailer (open to both online and brick-and-mortar stores) gets you credit toward our standard 50% of MSRP discount (prepaid) for 6+ items, with freight paid by purchaser. See our retailer page for details.\nThe Everway Company focuses exclusively on release of Everway products and licenses. But that doesn't mean that we're new to Everway or to RPGs. We have been involved with Everway from the very beginning, and are thrilled to be bringing Everway back for it's twenty-fifth anniversary party.\n\nThe Silver Anniversary Edition Team\nWe've been thinking of how to bring back Everway for more than two decades. We feel the time is finally right to make that happen. We cannot be more excited to share the Everway Silver Anniversary Edition with you!\nContributors\nEverway also owes a lot to the many amazing and diverse set of artists and content contributors who have added their efforts to the product line over the years. \nOur artists include: Doug Alexander, Rob Alexander, Rick Berry, Maria Cabardo, Roger Coad, Dakota Curry, Liz Danforth, Geoff Darrow, Al Davison, Joe DeVelasco, Daniel Gelon, Gary Gianni, Tom Gianni, Gerry Grace, Janine Johnston, Doug Keith, Hannibal King, Scott Kirschner, Ed Lee, Anson Maddocks, John Matson, Martin McKenna, Ian Miller, Jeff Miracola, Katie Murphy, Dermot Power, Alan Rabinowitz, Rudy Rauben (Roger Raupp), Andrew Robinson, Chris Rush, Will Simpson, Mark Tedin, Jerry Tiritilli, Tom W\u00e4nerstrand, and Amy Weber. \nOur additional content contributors include: Scott Hungerford, Kathy Ice, Bob Kruger, Nicole Lindroos, Evan Sass, Greg Stolze, Aron Tarbuck, Jenny Scott Tynes, John Scott Tynes, and Jenny Zappala. \nAlso thanks to Ori Kagan at Kagan Productions for our incredible Kickstarter video.\nWhat people are saying about Everway\nFor a whole generation of indie tabletop designers EVERWAY was foundational \u2014 innovative, revelatory, ambitious and wonderfully strange. It was all the things we aspired to be, and EVERWAY got there first, and better. I\u2019m really excited to see it return to life.\n \u2014Jason Morningstar, creator of FIASCO\n\nJonathan Tweet is one of the most innovative designers in the business, and EVERWAY is his masterpiece. It\u2019s a tragedy that EVERWAY, one of the industry\u2019s trailblazing indie designs, has been out of print for twenty years. That it\u2019s coming back now should set the entire roleplaying world ablaze.\n \u2014Shannon Appelcline, author of Designers & Dragons\n\nEVERWAY is one of the most inspired and innovative storytelling games I\u2019ve ever seen. It has been a key influence on how I run, play, and design games for twenty-five years. I\u2019m thrilled to see it return for a new generation to discover.\n \u2014John Scott Tynes, designer of PUPPETLAND, UNKNOWN ARMIES, and DELTA GREEN\n\nWow. Just wow... This is a fantastic revision! Emphasis upon the \"vision.\" I was wondering which game to use to introduce our niece to roleplaying and now I know! I\u2019m thrilled about the new tarot-sized Fortune deck, the expansion of the deck with the insightful Seasons cards, and the revised rulebooks that play off the game\u2019s visual strengths. EVERWAY is a great game and it has been remixed by people who love and understand it.\n \u2014Rob Heinsoo, co-creator of 13TH AGE and 13TH AGE GLORANTHA, lead designer DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, 4th Edition\n\nEVERWAY\u2019s powerful but subtle mechanics and total commitment to trust as game motivator mark off a significant and influential step away from roleplaying\u2019s wargaming origins. Tweet integrates trust and dialogue into every facet of his innovative design, which was revolutionary 25 years ago and remains inspirational (and aspirational) today. \n \u2014Kenneth Hite, designer of NIGHT\u2019S BLACK AGENTS and lead designer of VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE 5th Edition\n\nEVERWAY was an act of love: one of the first fully-committed statements that role-playing can have a different purpose, can be played by different people, and can work in a different way.\n\u2014Ron Edwards, Adept Play, designer of SORCERER, co-founder of the Forge independent forum\n\nIt is not that EVERWAY was a game that could be fruitfully hacked (though it was), rather that EVERWAY was a key to opening the door to how and, more critically, WHY you could hack anything. The tools and lessons of EVERWAY made for a great game, but it is in the spaces beyond EVERWAY that they became truly transformational. I am absolutely looking forward to the new edition for what is in it. New fortune cards, gorgeous layout, clever product design \u2014 these things are going to be amazing. But more than anything, I'm excited to see EVERWAY in a world that is (I hope) ready for what it brings to the table.\n \u2014Rob Donoghue, co-designer of FATE\n\nRemember the guy who took D&D and turned it into the coherent and streamlined system that dominates the RPG market? EVERWAY is the game he made when he was given full creative control. Its original edition was like a time-travel message from the future, and now we\u2019ve finally caught up to it.\n \u2014Greg Stolze, creator of REIGN and TERMINATION SHOCK \n\nMy first day at Wizards of the Coast, Jonathan Tweet said, \"Mike, I want to show you an RPG I've been working on.\" My response was, \"Neat.\" Which is what I say when something blows me off my chair. Get ready for that to happen to you. Ladies and gentlemen: EVERWAY is back.\n \u2014Mike Selinker, developer, BETRAYAL AT HOUSE ON THE HILL, APOCRYPHA, and the PATHFINDER ADVENTURE CARD GAME\n\nIn a pivotal era for TRPG development, EVERWAY taught gamers to look beyond tables and dice and to explore a thousand worlds through art and inspiration. It is as much a touchstone of my game design style now as it was when it first hit shelves in 1995.\n \u2014J Gray, R. Talsorian Games as Lead Designer for CASTLE FALKENSTEIN\n\nWhen I look at Everway I am amazed that it was originally published in 1995; and I was at the company that published it! At the time I thought it was smart - but strange. Now it looks smart - and completely sensible; it was so far ahead of its time that I pretty much completely misunderstood it. I am excited to see this game again - it is deserving and I am looking forward to playing it again.\n \u2014Richard Garfield, creator of MAGIC: THE GATHERING, KEYFORGE, and HALF TRUTH\n\nI\u2019m so pleased to see EVERWAY getting more love than I was able to give it at Wizards of the Coast. \n \u2014Peter Adkison, Chairperson of the Board of GEN CON, former CEO of Wizards of the Coast, co-creator of the WORLD OF CHALDEA", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMANUFACTURING: This Kickstarter is massive. We know that. Five different products (plus add-ons) is a TON for one Kickstarter project, especially our first. But we are confident in our ability to deliver, based on backing hundreds of projects and knowing what works and what doesn't. We have waited until ALL of the products are on the verge of being done before even beginning the Kickstarter. We are building the final maps and making final tweaks. We've ordered test prints of nearly everything and have high confidence in our ability to actually make all the products, because we have held almost all of them in our hands from print on demand services already (with the exception of the deluxe hardbacks). We've just got a few finishing touches and final press checks before we go to press. We are printing the books in China out of economic necessity, and products will ship from the factory to the distribution points before fulfillment. We expect to go to press within a month or two of the campaign end. Depending upon volume, cards may be printed via print on demand service.\n\nSHIPPING: As you know, many things are affecting shipping around the world right now. COVID-19. Customs. Brexit. Instability of the U.S. Postal Service. This is honestly our biggest unknown and worry at this point and may cause unexpected delays. That said, we have an outstanding logistics partner lined up who has fulfilled many Kickstarter campaigns and has the expertise to do everything right.\n\nSPREADING THE WORD: Finally, the last risk is whether we can reach the biggest audience possible. We are starting our company from scratch (although the founders have run companies successfully in the past), but we don't have a large mailing list to work from. We are utilizing many advertising opportunities, but we really NEED you to spread the word to all your friends and colleagues to make this project a smashing success.

The story of Irene Adler, the strongest woman lead in the Sherlock canon, remains to this day one of his most beloved and riveting adventures. The book is beautifully illustrated by R\u016bta Kuzmickas, signed, and numbered in the limited edition. Pledge to support fine press bookmaking in the twenty-first century!\n\nNo Reply Press is a publisher of handmade limited editions. We make our books using centuries-old techniques and technologies. They are printed letterpress and then bound entirely by hand \u2013 at our workshop, nothing plugs into the wall (except two lightbulbs and a coffee maker). Our process is wildly slower than digital printing, but we believe in the results.\nLast year was big for us. Before the Coronavirus pandemic, we set out to make our debut with an edition of Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s \u201cThe Masque of the Red Death,\u201d a story about... a pandemic. In Poe's telling, while the \u201cRed Death\u201d rages, a prosperous few cloister themselves away to party with abandon. But an outsider circulates among them. Abruptly removing his mask, he brings about the death of all assembled\u2026\nWe learned a lot in publishing \u201cRed Death\u201d in the time of Coronavirus. We faced further challenges in the summer when wildfires smothered Portland in smog, and in the autumn, when our office was burglarized with books and electronics stolen, upending months of work. But in all that time, we got to know book collectors across the world, honed our bookmaking skills, and turned what had begun as a hobby among friends into a small business. In other words \u2014 not such a bad year after all.\nStill, in the face of challenges, we found ourselves returning to stories and fiction which granted a brief escape. There is no better escape than detective fiction, and no better detective fiction than that of Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\nSo, allow us to present the No Reply Press edition of \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia,\u201d in which the inestimable detective made his short story debut.\n\"A Scandal in Bohemia\" from No Reply Press.\nA new edition of a beloved classic\n\u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d is the story of Irene Adler \u2013 \u201cthe woman\u201d \u2013 who holds compromising documents over the King of Bohemia. Adler is undoubtedly the greatest female lead in the Holmes canon, and perhaps the person Sherlock himself admires most.\nAs excited as we are about the re-telling of this story, we are doubly excited about R\u016bta Kuzmickas' original artwork. She has created a suite of pen-and-ink illustrations \u2014 over a dozen in total \u2013 which capture the story perfectly. Her arresting portrait of Irene on our cover is just the beginning. \n\"A Scandal in Bohemia\" features a dozen pen-and-ink illustrations by artist R\u016bta Kuzmickas. They are printed letterpress on some of the finest papers in the world.\n\nWe are excited to add \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" to the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 of No Reply Press.\n\nHandmade books in the 2020\u2019s\nOur books are printed letterpress and handbound in limited editions. \nWhat\u2019s letterpress? Letterpress is a process by which raised plates and individual pieces of metal type are arranged and inked, then pressed into paper. Unlike digital printing, which leaves just a whisper of text on the surface of the page, letterpress creates an impression which you can feel as you run your finger across the text.\nHow are the books bound? Our binding process involves a hundred small steps \u2013 there are sheets to fold, threads to snip, boards to cut with no margin for error, glues and inks to mix, covers to assemble, endpapers to affix, and on and on. Every step we do by hand.\nWhat makes an edition \u201climited\u201d? When we go to press on a book, we set a certain number of copies which will be produced, and declare the limitation. No further copies will ever be made. Each book is numbered in the series \u2013 Number 127 out of 300, for example \u2013 and then signed by the artisans involved, from the illustrator to the printer to the binder. \nOur books are made by hand. These are the tools we use to bind our books. That's it! (We also use a book press from the 1860's named Ulysses Press Grant. Ulysses could not be photographed because he's roughly six thousand times the size of our other tools combined.)\nWith these tools, we craft limited editions committed to elegance of design and richness of character.\nFrom \u201cRed Death\u201d to \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d\nOur first Kickstarter project was \"The Masque of the Red Death,\" and many collectors considering whether to back \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" may have subscribed for a copy. We hope that \"Scandal\" will improve upon our past work. Here are just a few of the changes we\u2019ve made:\n\u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d is four times the length of \u201cRed Death,\u201d and produced in a significantly larger format (7.5\u2019\u2019 by 11\u2019\u2019 rather than 5.5\u2019\u2019 by 9\u2019\u2019).\n  \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d features original artwork, and is signed by the artist.\n  \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d is printed on Zerkall-b\u00fctten mouldmade paper in its Hardbound De Luxe, De Luxe, and De Scandale states. This paper takes the impression of letterpress beautifully, features a wonderful deckle edge, and is watermarked.\n  \u201cA Scandal in Bohemia\u201d uses a quarter-cloth flatback binding, rather than a case binding, which allows the book to lie flat when opened with greater ease.\n\n\"The Masque of the Red Death\" and \"A Scandal in Bohemia\" side-by-side. \"Scandal\" is four times the length, features original artwork, and offers finer mouldmade papers.\n\nThe books\nAll of our books are printed letterpress and handbound, but we offer a variety of \u201cstates,\u201d each with a different binding and limitation.\n\nHardbound / $85 / Limited to one hundred more than subscribed\nPrinted by hand using a Vandercook Universal I on Mohawk feltmark paper from New York State.\nHandbound in quarter-cloth with facing \"Sherlock\" and \"Irene\" illustrations printed letterpress on Zerkall Ingres over the boards.\nSigned by R\u016bta Kuzmickas, as well as the printer and binder.\nNumbered in the limited edition.\n\nHardbound\n\n\nHardbound De Luxe / $145 / Limited to ~175\nPrinted by hand using a Vandercook Universal I on Zerkall-b\u00fctten mouldmade paper from Germany. \nHandbound in quarter-cloth with facing \"Sherlock\" and \"Irene\" illustrations printed letterpress on Zerkall Ingres over the boards.\nHoused in a handmade cloth-lined slipcase.\nSigned by R\u016bta Kuzmickas, as well as the printer and binder.\nNumbered in the limited edition.

With Tao, you are now able to brew a perfectly tasty cup of tea anywhere, anytime.\nSome tumblers can be really complicated and you feel like you need a masters degree in engineering to figure it out. While we think engineers will also love the Tao Tea Tumbler, we wanted an intuitive experience for everyone.\n\nHere\u2019s how it works:\nFill the tea compartment with your desired tea and screw on the lid.\nNext, add hot water to the larger compartment, then flip it upside down.\nTurn the filter control dial to allow the water to pass through to the tea for the appropriate steeping time.\nOnce steeped, flip it back and turn the filter control dial to close off the tea compartment.\nPress the pressure release button to safely release any built-up pressure and enjoy your tea.\nThere are a number of carefully designed features which set the Tao Tea Tumbler apart.\nEasy to turn Filter Control dial moves the food grade silicon seal and allows water to easily pass through.\nUnique stainless steel mesh pattern blocks tea leaves but allows water to pass through with ease and prevent clogging.\nRegular tea infusers can be dangerous to open because of the built up pressure from the hot water, which can spray as you open the lid. To solve this, we added a clever pressure release button so you can feel confident every time you open your hot beverage.\nWe wanted a tumbler that would hold enough large tea leaves but also a generous amount of steeped tea and still fit into cup holders. So we maximized the capacity without sacrificing the benefits of double-walled construction.\nOur durable double-walled glass insulates to keep the inside hot but the outside slightly warm to the touch at the perfect 40 degree Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit), keeping it condensation free and easy to grip.\nWith Tao, you are not only limited to brewing tea. Use it for matcha, coffee, or just to keep any drink hot or cold for hours on end. The options are endless and up to your imagination.\nAfter use, disassemble and hand wash or put it in the dishwasher for hassle-free cleanup.\nCrafted with the highest quality components and purposely designed to be simple to use, the Tao Tea Tumbler fits right into your day.\nWe have some stretch goals, and we may add more based on backer feedback. \n*UNLOCKED* $11,000 CAD - Bamboo Scoop Duo optional Add-On - $10 CAD each Duo\n*UNLOCKED* $15,000 CAD - Second Color option (see selections below)\n$25,000 CAD - Third Color option (see selections below)\nPlease add $10 CAD for each Bamboo Scoop Duo you would like.\nWe also have a Disassembly Tool Add-On, which is two custom-machined metal pieces, available for $10 CAD. For each Disassembly Tool set you'd like, please add $10 CAD to your pledge amount.\nAs an experienced creator in the tea space, we know what it takes to bring our first Kickstarter project to life. You can see our working prototype in the videos and images.\n\nSince we started designing the Tao Tea Tumbler in 2018, we have drafted, prototyped, and finalized the design. Now we are ready to begin production with the manufacturing facility. Help us bring this project to life by sharing it with your friends and family who would be interested in backing it.\n\nTao is a Chinese word signifying the \u201cright way\u201d, and Tao is also my name.

We were simply attempting to make a nice family-friendly product for those crammed inside for the duration of the Coronavirus quarantine. Upon attempting to produce the prototype however, our manufacturing liaison, Dave, happened to spill his chai tea on the computer running the algorithm. The computer malfunctioned, causing the complexity of the puzzle to skyrocket 100-fold in every aspect. The result? A fiendishly-difficult puzzle that is sure to be both a party-starter, as well as a party-stopper roughly 10 minutes later.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are several challenges with this puzzle. First, the product utilizes double-sided acrylic to give the glassy look for each piece. Acrylic is rather expensive, and laser cutting also increases the cost of production. Lastly, the frame will require injection molding that needs to be finalized for high-throughput manufacturing. All of these factors increase the overall cost of the puzzle, which some may find off-putting. However, it is our belief that this is a rather reasonable price point compared to many other craft puzzles available online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nConsidering this puzzle is produced from double-sided acrylic, this puzzle is extremely sturdy. Pieces will not break, even under a significant amount of force. Compared to traditional cardboard cuts that bend easily, these pieces will be sure to last for a significant period of time.\nReusability and recyclability\nPMMA (acrylic) is categorized as a Category 7 plastic. While historically not easily-recycled, recent advancements in material science has allowed for PMMA to be repurposed and combined with PVC to form a thermoplastic that is being investigated for fabricate housings, casings, medical equipment. Therefore, it is possible for PMMA to be recycled and repurposed in other ways. It is worth noting however that this type of acrylic is often going to require disposal at designated centers accepting PMMA.\n\nThe injection mold will likely utilize polyethylene, polypropylene, or PLA, which are readily-recyclable. If PLA is chosen, this is one polymer that is biodegradable.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAs noted above, PLA is one option for our injection mold, which is a biodegradable plastic. Furthermore, the edge formed between two pieces is generated from a single laser cut. Therefore, there is no unused acrylic between each piece within a single puzzle. Third, our laser-cutting process utilizes a tessellation-based pattern between each puzzle order to minimize excess acrylic between each puzzle order.

But there must of been some \u2018great artists\u2019 passing through Camberwell College of Art when Winston put this work on display in 2001 - because it disappeared overnight. Fortunately a few black and white reproductions were made and now this is all that remains of this early project - aptly titled a 'Stolen Dictionary\u2019.\nThere are 10 archival reproductions of this at [23 x 31cm / 58 x 79cm] printed with pigment ink onto Hahnem\u00fchle Fine Art Bamboo Natural White 290gsm [90% Bamboo fibre, 10% Cotton] acid free paper.\nIt\u2019s all part of the process. Multiple drawings, prints, photographs, and screen shots layered onto one sheet of paper. The prints and photographs were taken at different stages of the production process and layered over one another to offer a glimpse into the making process.\nThere are 10 unique versions of this. Part drawing, part letterpress and part archival digital print. All on on 225gsm Zerkall (mould-made & acid free) printmaking paper.\nOriginal artwork: Hand cut collage \nCommission and keep a unique artwork. Sam will make you a new typographic collage based on the the 2020 Dictionary Story.\nGive Sam the opportunity to reimagine the 'Stolen Dictionary' artwork using the same hand cut techniques used in 2000.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Ten Dungeon Escape Room Battle Mats features 10 hand drawn maps, in high detail, in a 1 inch to 5 foot scale that comes in both printed and digital formats. These dungeon rooms, drawn by Toby Lancaster AKA Dark Realm Maps, are different from your normal subterranean domain though. They show a series of escape rooms where the players must take on a number of physical challenges and solve puzzles. Each one is independent from the other and can easily be slotted into any dungeon. They can be worked into the main story line or exist as a one off challenge.\nA party of adventurers have come to a very different feeling dungeon room. The space is laid out before the players, placed on the table, a colourful map full of detail and peril. Miniatures are placed at the entrance. It is not immediately clear what needs to be done, or whether there is in fact a way out! But whatever it is it involves a series of obstacles and challenges. How are they going to escape the room? They consider going back but a bolt slides into place on the door they just came through and they realise they must move forward\u2026\nAs it says in the title the box contains 10 Maps. They are all as follows:\n1. On A4 (210mm x 297mm) card stock \n2. Full-Colour \n3. Feature an escape room challenge\n4. Has visual clues to how to escape the room\n5. 1 square = 5 foot scale\n6. Each square is 25mm (1 inch) wide\nAlso in the box is a descriptor sheet that explains each room. These are not designed to be overly complicated though.\nDigital copies feature the maps as files which is part of a PDF that includes all maps and additional content.\nEach map is hand drawn, inked in black and then coloured with pencil giving a bespoke  look that has been very popular in a range of publications. As a result Toby has been commission to use this style in the two current hit Kickstarter projects: Midnight Towers \"A Mystery Adventure Inspired by Edgar Allan Poe for 5e\" and Windmill Slam Games \"The Book of Cults for D&D 5e\".\n\nThese maps are designed to be handy! Here are some examples of how and why they might be used:\nThe DM needs to extend a session as the players are progressing too quickly\nYou need a location to hide a key treasure\nThe dungeon needs a focus room or you need new content for your game\nIf the adventurers want something a bit different, as they're a bit bored with the standard dungeon encounter\nA more difficult challange is needed...these have plenty of scope to be made very hard\nYou want to throw something physical into a gaming session to introduce a different playing style\nToby Lancaster is an ENnie nominated cartographer and  active member of the roleplay community contributing content, advice and working with a number of key figures. He operates under the handle of Dark Realm Maps and has had his work published in a long list of products and has produced a range of PDF products in the past which can be found on DMsguild and DrivethruRPG.\n\n \u201cFor years now I have been drawing maps for a range of projects. These include maps for Peterson Games, Midnight Tower\u2019s D&D supplements, Jeff Stevens Games bestselling modules and supplements and Mark Chaplin\u2019s up and coming board game \u2018Where Human\u2019s Don\u2019t Belong\u2019. I love working with these awesome people but as yet I have not created my own map based Kickstarter and I thought it was about time!\u201d\nToby Lancaster\nLimited Edition Postcard Bonus\nIf you like extras with your rewards then you might like this bonus. We are offering up one of Toby's Limited Edition Postcards in one of our tiers. This is the first postcard in the Ancient Structures series called The Wheel House.\nHere is an example of one of the Battle Mats. As you can see there are a series of rooms, a central focus mechanism and electricity flashing from one wall to the next which is controlled by the lever to the right of the door.\n\nThese stretch goal tokens use the same scale as the dungeon rooms in this project and so can be placed anywhere on the maps. They can be used to enhance the story line or serve to hide elements of the map, are produced in full colour and sent with your tier rewards.\nWe are shipping internationally and the postage cost is added to the pledge. We have tried to make this as affordable as possible and having shopped around we think we have found a reasonable price and hope you feel the same too. There is always the option of buying the digital edition as well and this will be sent out via an email on this platform which will include a link from where you can download the maps.\nFollowing Dark Realm Maps\nWe are active on a range of social media:\nTwitter @Darkrealmmaps https://twitter.com/darkrealmmaps\nInstagram @Darkrealmmaps  https://www.instagram.com/darkrealmmaps\nFacebook Page https://www.facebook.com/Dark-Realm-Maps-297212987513285/\nDon't forget to put the word out so we can grow the community. \nOne last thing!\nWe will be uploading some of the black and white versions of the maps, to the updates section of this campaign, for the backers. So even before the product is shipped you will have content to sink your teeth into!\nThank you for your support and for spending the time to ready this. \nToby and Jo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course during these troubled times we all have a few more challenges to deal with. We are trying to reduce these by working with a local printer to avoid customs issues, shipping times and potential lock downs. We have also added more time for printing as this time of year can be very busy.\n\nWe are working hard to finish all the maps, but will be of the usual high standard shown in the three featured here and what has come to be expected from Toby at Dark Realm Maps. They will be finished over the Christmas period. Many of them are in their black and white stages and just need colour.\n\nPostage has been a problem globally with quarantining (especially for Australia) and lock downs so we have allowed for a slightly longer completion time of March for the printed versions, so hopefully you'll receive them before then. It goes without saying that the Digital will be available much sooner in January.\n\nWe have had one successful project recently which was a D&D module that did feature our maps so we hope those who backed that project can vouch for their quality!

The puzzles will come once every two or three weeks, over the course of about a year.\nTry a Sample Puzzle\nHere is a sample puzzle from 2013. To try it, right-click on it and open it in a new tab, and then print it.\nSample puzzle from October 11, 2013\n(For the answer grid, click here.)\nThe Backstory\nFrom January 2009 to March 2013, I wrote a crossword for every issue of The Week magazine. Each puzzle was based on the events from the previous week, and I put as many news-related items into the grid as I could.\nMy big problem with writing for The Week was that I wrote the puzzle on Fridays, but the solvers didn\u2019t get the magazine delivered to them until seven days later. That made the newsworthiness of the crossword less than ideal. By using email, I can send the puzzle to solvers the second it\u2019s finished. Back this project and you can be part of the forefront for how crosswords are delivered to solvers in the digital age.\nAbout the Puzzles\nThese puzzles will be delivered to your email inbox in two forms: Across Lite, which can be solved on your computer, and pdf, which can be printed and solved on paper. They will generally come every other week, but there will be occasional exceptions. It will finish around December 2021.\nNote that unlike the superhard Fireball Crosswords, Fireball Newsflash Crosswords are aimed at a general audience. The difficulty level will be like that of a typical Tuesday or Wednesday newspaper crossword.\nGo here to sign up after the deadline.\nThe Swag \nFireball Crosswords baseball cap\nFireball Crosswords lanyard\nFireball Crosswords bottle opener and keychain with light\nPrevious Year\nIf 20 puzzles aren\u2019t enough for you, you can get the puzzles from January to December 2020. Just add $9 extra to your pledge.\nAbout Me\nI started Fireball Crosswords in 2010 as the first online-only pay-to-play direct-to-the-solver crossword. I have written or edited more than 50 puzzle books, with combined sales of over a million copies. I was the editor of the Post Puzzler, a tough themeless crossword that appeared in every Sunday Washington Post from April 2010 to March 2015. From 2002 to 2008, I was the crossword editor for The New York Sun. I was the editorial director for Puzzlewright Press, an imprint of Sterling Publishing, where I worked for 23 years. I am also the creator of the iPhone app Celebrity: Get a Clue. I was a member of the American Heritage Dictionary Usage Panel from 2012 until its demise in 2018.

By supporting this campaign, you are providing direct support to the writer, allowing me to continue to write the news puzzles that I so enjoy doing.\n\nAs for the deadlines, I wrote more than 200 crosswords for The Week without missing any.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Southlands feature high adventure in a self-contained and standalone campaign setting, with all the tools at your fingertips for a dozen adventures and even full campaigns! This updated 5E version includes new player options, an updated Worldbook with all-new chapters, and a fantastical city book to launch a memorable campaign\u2014and a caravan's weight in short- and medium-length adventures. The Southlands setting is fully compatible with the 5th Edition of the world\u2019s first RPG.\nWelcome friend! Come and adventure with us here.\nThe project will create more than a dozen main rewards covering 4 major formats with two partner companies:\nA hardcover Southlands Worldbook in both regular and limited editions, described in this Table of Contents preview \nA hand-tooled, rich leather edition of the Worldbook, \nA hardcover City of Cats, a home base containing many adventures,\nA softcover Southlands Player's Guide of heroic options, subclasses, and races, described in this preview and developer's diary \nThe fully-optimized PDFs for all of the above,\n Digital Roll20 editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and Player's Guide for that virtual tabletop (VTT), published by our partners at Roll20, and\nThe Fantasy Grounds editions of the Southlands Worldbook, City of Cats, and the Player's Guide for that VTT platform, published by our partners at Smiteworks.\nKobold Press will also produce the Kickstarter-exclusive hardcover edition of Tales Beneath the Sands, a collection of adventures by Jerry LeNeave (preview).\nSpecial Editions\nThe limited edition will be printed once with a leatherette, foil-stamped cover, ribbon bookmark, special endpapers, and similar touches. The content is identical to the regular edition, but this deluxe, limited edition often becomes extremely sought after.\nThis project does also offer a handbound leather edition for collectors and bibliophiles. This is done entirely in the traditional style of bookbinding, with excellent leather (possibly deep green or sky blue) stamped with gold foil and embellished with corded spine, ribbon bookmarks, and other flourishes. This is limited to roughly a dozen copies and is not available after the Kickstarter. Because of the extra time needed to create it, this reward ships about a month after the other reward packages do.\nBundles\nYou can get the Southlands materials separately or in bundles of 3 items, and the bundles offer a discount. In addition, the limited edition is available only though the Kickstarter, not through later elements such as a survey or pledge manager. (Sometimes we have a few extra limited editions for sale in the Kobold Store\u2014that's never guaranteed!).\n Bonus Goals & Level Up Items \nUp to 10 of the PDF rewards for backing the Southlands come as standalone stretch goal items. These include both new and existing adventures set in the Southlands, for levels 1 to 10, as well as expanded takes on Southlands magic and groups such as the Emerald Order. These PDF rewards are included for everyone who backs at the $25 reward level or higher, and you can see them marked in the Stretch Goal graphics with the \"Bonus Goal!\" icon. Depending on how many are ultimately unlocked, some will be delivered in January and February; others will come later. \nThe various rewards and bundles are described and listed to the right, and shown in the chart below. In addition, this project has been selected for the Kickstarter Add-Ons Beta (see below). After you choose your main pledge, you'll be presented with the option to add additional items in whatever combination works best for you.\nNote that there will be no pledge management step for this project; it is not possible to pledge $1 now and add on rewards later. A print preorder may be made available through the Kobold Press store for late backers. Surveys requesting your address will come from Kickstarter.\nThis project has been selected by the Kickstarter team for Kickstarter's Beta Add-Ons feature. This is a new element for Kickstarter that we used to handle in a separate pledge manager, but for the Southlands, add-ons are now included in the Kickstarter campaign directly.\nAdd-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match. (For example, if you want the Limited Edition package of all 3 books, but you also want a second copy of the Player's Guide softcover and all the Roll20 licenses, you will have the option to add that second copy and the Roll20 bundle as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.)\n\n Kickstarter Exclusive\nIn particular, the Tales Beneath the Sands adventure collection is a Kickstarter print exclusive that is available only as an add-on here (PDF and VTT will be available more generally\u2014the print exclusive version is a collector's item). Tales Beneath the Sands collects three adventures into a hardcover trilogy with new art and maps, for a full tomb-centric adventure series in the Southlands. It covers levels 2 to 5 of play, and makes a perfect complement of tomb-crawling to match the urban, treacherous, and roguish adventures in City of Cats.\nWe'll have more information about Add-Ons in the FAQ and are grateful to be part of Kickstarter's new experiment in Add-Ons.\nThis project continues the Kobold Press goal of reducing shipping costs to international backers and shipping in a sustainable way by using friendly, bulk shipments to three main regions outside the United States: Canada, Australia/NZ, and the UK. From there, physical shipments go to backers via Canada Post, Australia Post, and Royal Mail.\nGLOBAL SHIPMENTS: Because of the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're shrinking our printed reward distribution. The Southlands Worldbook, Player's Guide, and City of Cats PDFs and VTTs are all available worldwide; unfortunately, the printed books are not available as part of the Kickstarter in Europe and countries other than on those on the list above. Printed books will be available via local retailers instead. \nWe hope to remedy this situation in future projects. For now, we simply can't provide effective shipping without a high degree of risk in both schedule and cost.\nAs always with our projects, if the Southlands project exceeds its funding goal we will expand several elements. The more people who support the Southlands, the better the rewards are for everyone!\nIn particular, we will add up to 10 adventure and player option PDFs to the rewards for all backers at the $25 level and up. These goals are marked with the Bonus Goal icon in the stretch goal list, because each adds another standalone title to the reward items.\nThat's the last of our stretch goals, as this project has exceeded expectations in every way. A massive thank you to everyone who has supported the 5th Edition Southlands!\n\nAt Kobold Press, a fantastic team of accomplished tabletop gaming professionals is working hard to pull this project together.\nIn addition to the folks listed below, it is very important to us at Kobold Press to involve voices that represent the real-world cultures from which the Southlands draw influence. To make sure we do this project right, we've involved creators who trace their descent to those regions, and as all of the text and art nears completion and the stretch goals are incorporated, we'll continue to employ these diverse creators as well as cultural consultants every step of the way.

Flexible, convenient and super-charged excitement in a compact package that won\u2019t have you sitting up for hours preparing for your game session!\nEach is presented in the proven Shotglass Adventures format, designed for a 3-5 hour game. Each PDF includes a two-page spread of the adventure with DM\u2019s map and key (so you can lay it out on the table in front of you and have everything at a glance), 2 new monsters & 2 new magic items, a full-size player\u2019s map with grid & a full-size grid-less player\u2019s map!

The PDFs will be with you 2 weeks after the Kickstarter ends!\nI\u2019m the author of 7 books of adventures for 5e and OSR RPGs, 2 books of poetry and 24 other RPG products. I first started playing and DM\u2019ing D&D  in 1981. Nowadays, I game roughly 2-3 times a week. I own lots of RPGs - Fate Core, Symbaroum, Numenera, Pathfinder 2e, Mutant Year Zero, Stars Without Number, Mouse Guard, Coriolis, Forbidden Lands - basically too many to list, but I'm a fan of them all. D&D  remains my greatest love and when I write a new product, I pour my years of experience and passion into the project. Your support helps me continue to produce quality fantasy role playing adventures and supplements.\nThis is my 8th Kickstarter  and I\u2019ve always delivered ahead of schedule!\nWhat's the money used for?\nKickstarter  enables me to write, design and play-test role playing game content. Every Kickstarter  I do is not only a labor of love, it pays for all the time I've invested creating, laying out and play testing the product - and more importantly, making a living! Read any blog by any product designer and you'll know margins are always tight, so your support for my projects is amazing and always appreciated.\nVisit Laidback DM at stevestillstanding.com for DM/GM hints, product reviews, and free maps.

The weirdness escalates along the way, slowly exposing our heroes to the true horrors of the Weird West.

The story takes our heroes from greenhorn cowpunchers to hardened trail hands, letting players take on the roles of regular cowboys and cowgirls or any mix of Deadlands' unique character types.\nInterior spreads from the book, already laid out and ready for printing! Your support helps us create the additional materials we think will add to the entire Deadlands experience!\nArchetype Cards\nOur Archetype Cards allow players to jump into Blood Drive or any other Deadlands game quickly. We gave you a passel of pregenerated characters in the original Deadlands Kickstarter, and Set 3 adds even more ready-to-play heroes and heroines to choose from!\nPrint Version: 127x89mm on sturdy and durable 350gsm cardstock.\n12 new Archetype Cards suitable for Blood Drive or your own Deadlands games. Stay tuned for updates and previews as the Kickstarter drives on!\nPawns\nThis project features three sheets of Deadlands Pawns containing a selection of characters and critters and brand new terrain pieces as well! (We'll have art to show you soon, partners!)\nWe'll supplement your maps with campfires, a chuck wagon, hangin' trees, and other bits you'll find useful for Blood Drive or your own outdoor adventures, all printed on thick, die-cut punchboard. \nBeautifully illustrated front and back and easy to transport, Deadlands Pawns make your games come to life on the tabletop, especially when used with our gorgeous new map packs (see below)!\nSample pawns from our first pawn set. We'll have new art to show soon for these Blood Drive-specific pawns.\nInfernal Device Cards\nMad Scientists in the Weird West harness the Hellish energy of the superfuel known as ghost rock to power their incredible gizmos. These quick reference cards grant convenient access to the most important information about six common infernal gadgets, adding to those already printed in the original boxed set.\nPrint Version: 2.5\" x 3.5\" on 300gsm cardstock.\nMap Packs\nDeadlands Map Packs are large, 30\" x 24\" double-sided laminated maps for use with miniatures or our Deadlands pawns. They're marked with a  light one inch grid, perfect for Savage Worlds. Map Pack 3: End of the Line features a train station, corner saloon, and other classic western buildings.

We'll have detailed images for you soon!\nPrint Version: 30\" x 24\", double-sided, laminated cardstock for use with dry and wet-erase pens.\nArtist's render of a Deadlands pawn on Map Pack 1 (Grand Saloon).\nOur Kickstarter Boosters are smaller support projects for our existing lines. They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing Info@peginc.com.\nAny Questions?

Combining all expansion content, including the Journey\u2019s End Expansion, both new and returning players will be able to experience everything Nemo\u2019s War has to offer. Play solitaire, cooperatively, or competitively; the choice is yours!\n\nEach turn, you must address the seas\u2019 challenges in a grand adventure, confront the growing pressure of the Imperialist powers\u2019 navies, undertake Actions with the Nautilus and her crew \u2013 all while maintaining Captain Nemo\u2019s spirit to continue.  The Turn Sequence is as follows:\n\nBegin each turn in the Event Phase by flipping an event, Test, or other card from the Adventure Deck. Favorably resolving Tests, and using resources to manipulate your die rolls in this pursuit, will be critical to securing a victory no matter what your motive is.\nRoll high, captains, but be careful: your mission ends in Defeat if you deplete a Ship Resource. Developing an understanding of the probabilities, risks, and rewards for each Test and to what degree will ultimately be the reason for your mission\u2019s success or failure.\nNext is the Placement Phase, where you roll the dice for this round\u2019s Oceans for Ship token placement based on the game\u2019s current Act and your Notoriety. Strategic choices about where to place your ships, what we call \u201cpainting the board,\u201d will be crucial to your plans! Which Oceans to populate (and, through combat, denude) is the vital strategic chess game you are playing with the Imperialist powers who oppose you.\n You also receive the Differential Roll result of the two (selected) white dice rolled in Action Points for that turn. If the two (selected) white dice are doubles, a Lull Turn takes place..\n  Now it\u2019s time to act! During the Action Phase, you spend your Action Points to Move, Attack, Search for Treasure, Incite Uprisings, and more, all to advance Nemo\u2019s goals.\nAlways remember: you are questing for the greatest number of Victory Points (VPs) that you can acquire, as modified by Captain Nemo\u2019s Motive, while avoiding the many ways to suffer defeat. BVPs are earned in several ways (e.g., sinking enemy ships, passing TEST Events, collecting Treasures, inciting oppressed peoples, making scientific discoveries, etc), so choose your actions wisely each turn, and beware: \n Your mission ends in Defeat if your adventures gain too much notoriety, as you become an international Pariah to be hunted down mercilessly.\n\nRepeat these Phases until the game ends with your early defeat or you reveal the Final\u00e9 card that ultimately instructs you: \u201cThe game ends!\u201d\n\nWhen all is said and done, read the epilogue to your voyage in the Between Voyages Guide.

Based on previous campaigns, we anticipate that you should not have any additional fees associated with receiving your reward package (customs, clearance, etc.) if you\u2019re in one of these regions. If you\u2019re outside of one of these regions, you may need to pay customs fees, specific local taxes, or other charges. Please see the FAQ and check with your local authorities for more details.\nAdd-ons, including additional copies of these same items, will increase this cost. Shipping will be calculated and charged in the pledge manager.\nWe are only shipping to the following countries, due to shipping uncertainties and restrictions:\nIf you back this campaign and request fulfillment to somewhere outside of these countries, we will cancel your order and refund your pledge per our Refund Policy (90% of the total you pledged).\n\nWe do anticipate that these products will be available through our online stores around the world so if you cannot participate in this campaign, you should be able to order them through those in the future.\n\nTaxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see the chart below for more information about the tax rates to be charged:\n\n\nIf your country or state is not listed here, you may be responsible for paying your local taxes and import costs (use tax, VAT, GST, clearance, etc) depending on your local laws and customs rules.\nPlease review our campaign terms of service by reading the FAQs in full.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the Royal Grand Opera House, the largest and most prestigious theatre in the city of Pavilion. All of your characters have just joined the company of the Royal Grand in one of several potential roles. You might be an actor, dancer or musician, but you might also work backstage on the crew, in wardrobe, lighting or sound or even as a stage manager.\nYour contract had an extra section asking if you would be happy to do 'additional duties' for a very small bump in salary. You thought that might be just putting out chairs before a rehearsal, or having to help tidy the auditorium or suchlike. Unfortunately, it turns out to be much more.\nOther theatres send spies and saboteurs in to try and ruin the show, and you have to stop them. But that's not all, ghosts haunt the theatre looking to suck the life out of the audience. Horrors are often drawn up from the impossibly deep basement levels by the sounds of the show. Then there are the cursed props that need to be handled exceptionally carefully. The rats in the building are also intelligent, so watch out for that.\nYou and the other poor souls who agreed to additional duties have to solve all these problems. No one cares how, as long as the audience never knows. However, you also have a job in the show to do, and if you miss a cue because you were fighting a ghost, chasing a saboteur or trying to intimidate a morlock that's no excuse.\nOpera House is a tabletop roleplaying game designed with three things in mind.\nFirst, its everything you'd expect of a tabletop RPG, with the option to tell stories in the strange world of the Royal Grand Opera House.\nSecond, the game can be played in a single session, 'one night only' mode where events occur in real time during the performance of a show.\nFinally, Opera house is a theatre sourcebook. It explains what each department does in a theatre, and how a show is put together from auditions to the final night.\nThe book also offers a full description of the Royal Grand Opera House itself. It is a vast building with more than enough stories packed inside its walls to run whole campaigns without ever setting foot outside. As the building is self contained it might be transplanted into almost any setting to suit your group's current campaign.\nOpera House is a complete stand alone RPG. The book will be available in pdf and as a letter size black and white interior hardback book.\nMy name is Andrew Peregrine and I\u2019ve been writing and creating games for over ten years. I\u2019ve worked as a freelancer for Cubicle 7 (Doctor Who/Victoriana), Onyx Path (Vampire 20), Margaret Weis Production (Leverage/Firefly), Eden Studios (Buffy/Angel), Modiphius (Vampire 5/Star Trek) EN Publishing (Judge Dredd) and AEG (7th Sea) among many others. I'm also currently the project manager for the Dune: Adventures in the Imperium RPG on the way from Modiphius.\nHowever, as well as being a games writer I've also been working in the professional theatre for around thirty years. I have acted in amateur theatre, but went to drama college to study stage management and technical theatre. Since graduating I've worked all manner of jobs, mainly in theatre lighting, across the industry. I'm currently the Deputy Chief electrician at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in the West End of London.\nAs Corone Design I\u2019ve released my own independent products including the anarchic Hellcats and Hockeysticks, the dark Dance of the Damned and horrific Pie Shop. I've also successfully funded and completed a kickstarter project before with Cabal.\nAs well as my playtesting team, I\u2019ve had some great help from many awesome people. Not least of which are Andrew O\u2019Hara who has been my layout lifesaver, Mark Stewart-Birch who crafted the graphic design and the incredible Jon Hodgson who put together the excellent introduction video and my editor Keith Garrett.\nNow we come to the tricky bit, getting the product to you after the Kickstarter!\nTo make this as simple as possible, I'm going to be using Drivethrurpg's fulfilment process. The advantage of doing this is that it puts all the shipping and packaging into the hands of professionals with a worldwide network. This means the game can ship to anywhere in the world, although you will need to add the costs for shipping the product yourself. Additionally, there is a small unit charge for any print copies of the game, but the print pledge levels take this into account.\nSo, the things you need to know are:\nOpera House will be an letter size hardcover book with a colour cover and black and white interior. The current page count is around 200 pages.\nShipping costs will be extra, you can see more about Drivethrurpg's charges in this regard here.\nThere will be an extra charge (the printing cost) for each print reward. This should be around $10.31 or \u00a37.62 but this may change a little as their prices may vary and my page count isn't quite fixed yet. Its a little higher than I'd like so I'll see if I can reduce that.\nBut you will still not be paying any more than the retail value. When it hits retail the price will by \u00a328 ($36) in print and \u00a314 ($22) PDF, so backing now, even with the extra unit cost still offers a discount.\nBy the way, everyone who backs Opera House gets their name in the book. Everyone. Without you there is no game, so credit where its due!\nThe book will not be available for sale until all the backer rewards have been completed, and will only be available in the final version including the stretch goals.\n\u00a31 Theatre Tour\nYou just popped in to have a look round the building, and that's fine. Hopefully you'll book a ticket if something catches your fancy. This is a great way to bookmark the campaign and keep an eye on things as you can always upgrade later.\n\u00a310 Online Audience\nWith social distancing its tricky to get a seat. But you can still support the performance digitally. You get a PDF of the final version of Opera House. The PDF will be \u00a315 when it goes on general sale so you get a solid discount.\n\u00a320 Royal Circle Seats Discounted\nYou want to see the show and get the souvenir brochure. You get a copy of Opera House in both print and PDF. This option gives you everything with a significant discount as both print and PDF will add up to \u00a342 on general release.\n\u00a330 Block Booking Discounted\nAs a retailer you will be after a few seats for the show, maybe even a coach party. You get five copies of the final version of Opera House in print. The book will also be available on the bits and mortar scheme so you can provide PDFs to your customers. However, like any print version you will need to pay for the books unit cost and shipping. I will need to see some evidence you are a retailer but I'll not be needing a full background check! Drop me a line for more details via the kickstarter message board.\nAdding Cabal\nIn amending some of the pledge levels I'm able to offer a deal on my other kickstarter game 'Cabal'  Take a look at the kickstarter here \nSo, if you want to get hold of both games you can select one of the 'season Ticket' pledge levels.\nEach copy of Cabal in print will cost an additional $3.51 for the print cost. The pdf costs you nothing extra.\n\u00a325 Royal Circle Season Ticket\nThis gets you a print-at-cost and pdf copy of Opera House, and the same for Cabal. \n\u00a340 Block Booking Season Ticket\nAs well as 5 print-at-cost copies of Opera house, you get 5 print-at-cost copies of Cabal as well.\n\nSadly I was forced to make some amendments, so don't back the old Royal Circle or Block Booking pledge levels or you will just pay more money than you should. \n I'm not planning a lot of stretch goals for this project as I just want to get it out there. Stretch goals can start to complicate the project and create delays. But if we do well I'll be looking at adding some more goodies. However, I should have something on the horizon at least to start the ball rolling, so...\n\u00a34000 Map of the Royal Grand\nThe Royal Grand Opera House is a vast building, so navigating around it is usually done in quite broad terms. But its always nice to have a map and if we get the funds I'll be commissioning the renowned RPG graphic artist Mikael Brodu to craft something cartographical.\n\u00a35000 Rewards for Backstage\nIf we hit this level I'll be able to add a bonus to the amazing people who have done such excellent for criminally low wages.\nWhile it is not alone, the theatre and events industry across the world has suffered a crippling blow with the advent of Covid-19 and social distancing. While the industry recognises the importance of public health and keeping our audiences safe, government assistance has been painfully minimal, leaving the industry on a precipice. In the UK we were among the first industries to close and will be the last to open. Many amazing shows are simply unable to break even without a decent size audience.\nWith most of the industry freelance, there has been little to no support for actors and backstage staff.  These people are not just wealthy celebrities, but jobbing actors, technicians, stage managers, wardrobe and crew etc. who don't earn a particularly impressive wage at the best of times. With no option to work from home, and companies unable to keep them on, they have been left with nothing.\nWith no events, we have already seen several production companies and theatres announce bankruptcy and most of the few full time staff remaining are facing redundancy. On a personal note, it has been heartbreaking to see so many talented people looking at the end of their entire careers. Theatre is a tough industry at the best of times, but we are looking at a collapse that may take decades to repair. The industry hasn't asked for a full bailout as it recognises how many others are also in need. But its calls for a minimal package to keep its head above water (such as a furlough extension) feel like they have been ignored.\nIf you care about the theatre, which I hope is what has led you to this game, please also consider supporting the following charities that are trying to keep the actors and backstage staff afloat through these difficult times. Just buying a T-shirt helps to raise money and awareness. While I'm not allowed to add charitable donations as part of the kickstarter, or use its funds for charity, I'm looking at making donations from the post kickstarter earnings of the project. Thankyou for anything you can do to help.\n Acting for Others \n Fleabag Support Fund \n Theatre Support Fund \n Equity Benevolent Fund \nFurther detail of a number of individual charities available here: \n London Theatre Direct \nGeneral Support for Events Industry staff and other Charity groups here:\n Theatre Support \nFor more information about the ongoing crisis and the campaign to support theatre you can check these site:\nThe Broadcasting, Entertainment, Communications and Theatre Union (BECTU)\nActors Equity (Union) \nBack Up - A hardship fund for theatre techs\nBehind the scenes - A North American Charity ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOpera House is fully written and edited, with art and a cover. So this kickstarter is designed to recoup my losses rather than get the funds to start it. Even if it fails horribly I'll be offering the game for sale via retail.\n\nI've already run a successful and complete kickstarter campaign before with my game Cabal. So I'm familiar with most of the problems and issues that come up.\n\nI hope to amend any mistakes I\u2019ve made with the Kickstarter as we go, but I\u2019m keeping things simple to avoid as many problems as possible. Retailer levels are new to me, so that may take a little adjustment, but I have talked to FLGSs about what they need and expect. \n\nAs such I honestly welcome any advice and suggestions you may have to improve this project for you, the backer. Having said that, any marketing company who mails me to say how they can help my project reach thousands after its already funded will be ignored.

It has been translated by Kosmos Verlang in German, Polish, Frech, Italian, Czech and Hungarian under the title of EXIT das buch series of Kosmos EXIT GAMES. \nThis second version will include a new gameplay system, new faster website,  and 5+ new puzzles and riddles.  \n\nTrip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails, will be officially launched on March 2021 on Amazon.\nScattered around the globe, parts of a legendary naval diary.\nWritings of an insane mind, while stories speak of a greater mystery filled with sea monsters, nightmares and messages from other dimensions.\nYears since its disappearance, the sea legends speak of a dark journey, on a ship long forgotten. \nAll that until now.\nThe missing pages of this journal have been mysteriously put together.\nThe naval diary appears every now and then on the doorsteps of people who challenge its existence.  It's now the time to see what lies hidden and reveal the ship's final days.\"\n The basic idea behind Trip 1907 (second edition), is to provide an enhanced game play by limiting the webpage usage, and focus on the hardcopy. In this version the webpage is only for submitting the chapters answers and receiving puzzle hints.\nThe main differences between Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game and Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails are on the game experience. The new version does not need logging into the website. The passcodes are there to save your progress as well as the sanity system is now embedded inside the book. The passcodes are transformed into game clues and 5 riddles have also been replaced with new ones, along with two Easter Eggs. In this version the book's story will be in the hard copy.\nIn this version of Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails you will find:\nA new, faster, website has been added with no registration required.\nThe \"sanity\" token hint exchange system is now on the hard copy. It is up to the players to keep track of their sanity tokens spent, leaving more space to continue the book even if all sanity points are spent.\n Pass codes have been added in order to save the game progress and give a linearity on the game puzzles.\nThe game story will be on the hard copy instead of the website.\n 5 riddles have been replaced with two easter eggs on the hard copy.  \nIn order to play Trip 1907 (2nd Edition):Dark Sails you will need:\nA copy of Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails.\nA pencil.\nAn internet connected device.\nA pair of scissors.\nIn this version you will need to go through 45 chapters of the book, solve the puzzles, submit your answers online and get the passcodes of each chapter.\nTrip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails  is finished. Given previous experience on Kickstarter the game is finished as well as the play-test getting an excellent response from our game testers.  In this way delivery is a primary issue to us and will be done through Amazon & KDP separately for every backer of this project. Main goal is to complete all the shipping process by the first days of January. \nEU countries together with USA and Canada have at the moment an estimation time for dispatching of 5-7 days.\nIs Trip 1907 (2nd Edition): Dark Sails an eBook?\nNope, Trip 1907 is  a hard copy book.\n\nDo I need an app to play it?\nNope, all you need is the copy of the book a pen and an internet connection.\n\nIs there a hint system for the riddles?\nA hint system is provided on trip1907.com, where players can exchange their sanity tokens for hints.\n\nAre there any additional charges for playing the book?\nNope, once you have purchased your copy there are no additional perks to buy.\n\nWhat is the language of the game?\nEnglish.\n\nIs there a forum to keep up with the riddles?\nA forum will be provided for players exchanging ideas over the riddles.\n\nI have the original copy of Trip 1907 Interactive Escape the Book Game, should I back this one?\nThere are changes in 5 [puzzles and gameplay. So if you have played the first version you will only find 5 different riddles. The story and the rest of the riddles remain the same.\n\nWhen this version will come out so I can buy it?\nThis version will be launched on February 2021.\nBook Game specs:\n                 Dimensions: 13.97 x 21.59 cm (5.5\" x 8.5\" Inches)\n                 Pages: 170+\n                 Puzzles: 45+\n                 Artwork pages: 20+ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce this is a second version of an already successful book game, the risks are limited on the delivery.

Letterpress printed and hand-bound, the Thornwillow edition is available in a range of versions, from classic paper, cloth, and leather bindings, to an array of unique artists\u2019 books incorporating unconventional materials such as limp vellum, burl wood, wool, Baltic amber, lapis lazuli and gold. Featuring historic U.S. Geological Survey maps, which trace the heroes\u2019 journey across the ravaged California landscape, as well as indices of record-breaking wildfires and events from our own times, the Thornwillow edition ties past, present, and future together to create a book which will honor Butler\u2019s extraordinary legacy and preserve this important story for the (dystopian) future.\n\nCheck out our new Stretch Goal Reward - a free INVICTUS letterpress broadside for all backers of a physical tier if we break $100,000 and our new add on The Map of DYSTOPIA. See below for details.\nThe Ultimate Edition of Octavia E. Butler's Masterpiece - Parable of the Sower\nA Book for Our Time\nIn 1949, George Orwell imagined 1984. In 1953, Ray Bradbury imagined 1999. In 1993, Octavia Butler imagined the 2020s. Her future is now.\nFor the first time in a fine press edition, Thornwillow proudly presents: PARABLE OF THE SOWER,  Octavia E. Butler's iconic view of a future that is all too familiar today, printed letterpress and hand-bound. \nWildfires. Global Warming. Racial Violence. Drug Addiction. Desperation. The dystopian future Butler imagined is sadly ringing ever truer to life as we know it\u2014and is an ever more visceral warning for what our future will hold if we are not mindful.\nParable of the Sower begins in the year 2023. Climate change and growing inequality have decimated the country, and the American middle class has been all but erased, with the last holdouts residing in fragile gated communities. The story centers on Lauren Oya Olamina, a young woman forced to flee her home on the outskirts of Los Angeles. Traveling north, she dreams of a redemption for humankind: Earthseed\u2014a new religion, a new community, and a destiny to take root among the stars. With a small band of companions, she makes her way along the coast of California, fleeing wildfires and roving gangs of marauders and pyromaniacs in an apocalyptic wasteland.\nIt is a dark story, and a grim warning of what may come\u2014but one equally steeped in hope, as well as fear.\n The Mother of Afrofuturism \nThe Mother of Afrofuturism, Octavia E. Butler\nOctavia Butler changed the landscape of science fiction. At a time when there were few Black sci fi writers\u2014and virtually no Black women\u2014she dared to imagine diverse and nuanced worlds and present a tangible vision of a future world that increasingly feels like the one in which we live. She wrote about Black heroes and Black futures integrated in universal hopes and dreams for a better tomorrow and created stories that capture all of our imaginations. \nNot only was Octavia Butler a two-time winner of both the Hugo and Nebula Awards (science fiction\u2019s highest honors), she was also the first science fiction author to be awarded a MacArthur \u201cGenius\u201d Grant. Her dream was to become a New York Times bestselling author.\nOctavia Butler dreamed of becoming a New York Times bestselling author. In 2020, that dream became reality.\nThis year, that dream finally came true. More than 25 years after publication, in September of 2020, PARABLE OF THE SOWER appeared on the New York Times Bestseller List for the first time. It is high time we celebrate this extraordinary author with an edition that will honor and preserve her legacy for generations to come.\n\nTaking Her Place in the Thornwillow Canon\nThornwillow Press has published the works of some of the world\u2019s greatest thinkers and writers, from Jane Austen and Frederick Douglass to John Updike and Barack Obama. Our books reside in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the White House, the Vatican, and many more\u2014as well as the homes of readers like you all across the globe.\nWith your support, Octavia Butler will take her place in the Thornwillow canon with the ultimate edition of PARABLE OF THE SOWER\u2014exquisitely letterpress printed and hand bound.\n Tracing our journey through past, present and future...\n2020 has seen some of the worst wildfires in history, including the disastrous fires of the Australian \u201cBlack Summer\u201d and record-setting blazes across California. As of the time of this writing, over 4 million acres have burned in California, displacing tens of thousands of families. Octavia Butler\u2019s PARABLE OF THE SOWER is prescient in more ways than one, but perhaps her most prophetic observation was of the effects of unchecked climate change.\nIn Parable, as the heroes journey northward through her native California, they are pursued not only by bandits and thieves, but by flames. On several occasions, they are forced by wildfires and pyromaniacs to change course\u2014all of which Butler describes with incredible specificity. Throughout the Thornwillow edition, historic U.S. Geological Survey maps trace their journey north along real California roadways. An index of real 2020 fires, with pictorial indicators on the maps, tie Butler\u2019s fiction to a terrifying reality.\nHow Thornwillow Books Are Made\nFor 35 years, Thornwillow has been committed to making books that enhance the relationship between the reader and the written word.\nAll of the design, printing, and binding are done at Thornwillow in our workshops in Newburgh, New York. We are perhaps the only fine press publisher in the world to unite these related arts and crafts of the written word under one roof, and we are committed to teaching and perpetuating them for readers today and for years to come.\nWe start with a beautiful layout.  The text is set using classical ratios of type to page, giving each book luxurious margins and elegant proportions.\nOnce the book is laid out, the text is printed letterpress on our Heidelberg Cylinder Press. The type is literally pressed into the paper, so that you can feel the letters as you run your fingers across the page. This is an ancient art\u2014the same process by which Johannes Gutenberg printed his books 500 years ago.\nThe books are then bound by hand by our master craftsmen, who create the highest quality bindings in the world.\n The Edition \nThis is the first ever fine press edition of Octavia E. Butler\u2019s visionary masterpiece, Parable of the Sower. Letterpress printed on archival papers and hand-bound, we are presenting our edition in several versions from classic paper, cloth, and leather bindings, to an array of unique artists\u2019 books which explore ancient and unconventional binding techniques that push the boundaries of fine bookmaking. These hyper-limited editions feature rare and unusual materials, including limp vellum, burl wood, wool, and gold, as well as genuine Baltic amber, opals, carnelians, onyx, and lapis lazuli.  Three are presented in wooden boxes, handcrafted in cedar and black walnut by exceptional craftsmen from our own Makers Village.\nPaper Wrapper  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed  |  $95\nLetterpress Paper Wrapper Edition\nOur paper wrapper bindings are made with incredible care. Like the cloth and leather bindings, they have sewn signatures, enabling them to open easily for a beautiful reading experience. The letterpress printed wrapper is folded over a letterpress cover that secures the signatures. The text is printed letterpress on vellum finish archival stock. Each copy is numbered and signed.\n\nHalf-Cloth  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed  |  $195\nBound in Half Cloth and Letterpress Printed Boards\nThe Half-Cloth Edition features a cloth spine and corners, letterpress printed boards and endpapers, and a letterpress spine label. The text is printed letterpress on vellum finish archival stock. Each copy is signed and numbered.\n\nAll Leather Bound Editions are presented in an elegant Clamshell or Wooden box. \nAs established collectors of our leather bound editions know, Thornwillow's signature black clamshell boxes are an elegant way to preserve and protect your books and to unite the collection on a shelf. For this campaign, we have added two new variations, just as elegant and meticulously crafted, but made to complement this unique project.\nAll of the Half Leather and Full Leather editions include clamshell or wooden boxes for safekeeping. Clamshell boxes will be hand wrapped in either black or buckram binder's cloth (depending on the binding style), lined in suede, and have leather title labels tooled in genuine gold on the spine.

Without your support, it would not be possible for us to do what we do.

After the prepublication subscription period ends for a particular project, we will post available copies on our website. (NOTE: Often certain versions of the edition are fully subscribed during the Kickstarter launch.) When an edition is down to just a few remaining copies left, the prices tend to be much higher then they were at the beginning. This rewards collectors who came in early.\nIn subscribing to a Thornwillow publication, you are not just adding a beautiful book to your shelf that is likely to appreciate in value, you are making an investment in people.

A journal found in a lost shipyard provides the location of the long-hidden library of Kal-Zar Ro. The party must travel to the Orinspeak, a mountain trapped in perpetual winter in the heart of the forest.\nThere are questions to be answered, secrets to be uncovered. The truth about Kal-Zar\u2019s Bane may be revealed. And the quest to find a cure can begin\u2026\nSo, what\u2019s in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES \u2013 Kal-Zar\u2019s Bane 2: MINED GAMES?\n\u00b7 7 adventures \u2013 puzzles, investigations, dungeon crawls, quests, social encounters - complete with full color maps! Varied adventures from 5th \u2013 7th level, designed for minimal preparation and flexible delivery. Each adventure can be run as part of the ongoing Kal-Zar\u2019s Bane campaign, or as a One-Shot. Every adventure has both Campaign-specific and One-Shot-specific hooks. The One-Shot hooks ignore all the sub-plots and provide you with exactly what you need to run each adventure as a one-off for your players - you can either slot them into your existing campaign or run them as separate, individual side quests.\n\u00b7 Loads of hand-drawn, full-color maps!\n\u00b7 20 new monsters & NPCs and 9 new magic items!\n\u00b7 Fully detailed village and region setting\u2013 The Elven tree village of Ai\u2019Pa\u2019El is home to the An\u2019st\u2019rm elves and a potential regional base for the PCs in the vast Orinwood Forest. The elves harbor a secret that may start to unravel the truth about Kal-Zar\u2019s Bane\u2026\n\u00b7 Expanded map of Verona Province - including the Jarldoms of Skandara \u2013 a new, expanded map and brief gazetteer of the Invician Empire and Verona Province! More new and expanded lore for the Shotglass Adventures campaign setting!\n\u00b7 Full guide for OSR conversions!\nHere are some example pages:\nNote: adventures are currently being play tested \u2013 some content and page lay outs may change slightly as a result.\nAs an added bonus, Shotglass Adventures Rounds #1 - The One That Got Away is FREE with all pledges of Party Died For and above! A 12-page PDF-only module with gridded and gridless maps included, this is a re-working of an adventure I submitted to the One Page Dungeon Competition in 2018, which gained an 'honorable mention'. Lost in the Abyss, the party needs to get home - and to do that, they need to solve the dilemma of a demon's long-lost love...\n\nConcise, easily accessible and quick to prep for, every adventure comes complete with adventure hooks for Campaign play and for One-Shot play, maps, NPCs and monsters, with enough space for you to incorporate improvisation based on your players' decisions. Loads of variety and something for all your players - run them as One-Shots or easily slot them into your existing campaign!\nCheck out these teasers for each of the adventures included in SHOTGLASS ADVENTURES \u2013 Kal-Zar\u2019s Bane 2: MINED GAMES:\n\nSeveral of the pledge levels include the MINED GAMES Digital Maps Package. This package contains two versions of every hand-drawn, full color map in the book \u2013 full size color (A3 & A4-size) + optimized full color suitable for virtual tabletops like Roll20or Fantasy Grounds  \u2013 giving you options for how you use them. 36 images \u2013 all are 600 DPI (300 DPI is print quality) high quality digital JPEGs.\nPurchasing the Digital Maps Package also gets you a limited Royalty Free License enabling you to use each map in your own commercial and non-commercial projects (but not to sell them separately or as part of another digital maps package).\nHere are some examples of maps in the package:\nNote: Only some of the maps are shown. Additional maps will be added as stretch goals are unlocked.\n$2000 - 1st Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nA bonus full size, hand drawn, unkeyed full color map added to the book PLUS 2 x Digital JPEGs added to the Digital Maps Package \u2013 Full size and a smaller version sized for virtual tabletops - you can use for your own adventures.\nForest Tower Ruin!\nThe tower is a shadow of its former self. The upper levels have collapsed, bowing to the weight of years and other conflicts. Crumbling, rib-like walls extend out from its emaciated torso. Your party can smell the stench of death within. Foul, rotting zombies cluster in the tower courtyard, ambling senselessly about. But why aren't the creatures coming out? And why does the water in this central well smell so wonderfully pure and clear? It's overwhelming your senses. It's so good you just want to taste it...\nHow would YOU use this map in your own adventure?\n\n $2500 - 2nd Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nA bonus full size, hand drawn, unkeyed full color map added to the book PLUS 2 x Digital JPEGs added to the Digital Maps Package \u2013 Full size and a smaller version sized for virtual tabletops - you can use for your own adventures.\nForest Cave!\nThe treeline thins. A cold and dank cave entrance lies before you, its darkness swallowing the forest canopy's light shafts like a great, toothless maw. Bloody footprints lead away into the black - man or beast? They're too smeared to tell. You can hear sounds echoing from the depths. Is that the tearing of flesh? You draw your sword...   \n $3000 - 3rd Stretch Goal Unlocked!\n2 bonus full size, hand drawn, unkeyed full color maps added to the book PLUS 4 x Digital JPEGs added to the Digital Maps Package \u2013 Full size and a smaller version sized for virtual tabletops - you can use for your own adventures.\nBoth of these battlemaps have 1-inch squares ideal for 25mm miniatures!\nRavine Bridge Map\nThe Troll licks its lips as it gestures for you to cross the rope bridge. \"It's just a small toll,\" you remember it saying. As you place your foot upon the unsteady slats, you glance below. Was that a spider you saw down there in the ravine? Pretty big. And now it seems to be crawling up the wall... \nDruidic Island\nAncient standing stones rise from the island like giant teeth. The hairs on your neck rise as you step out of the boat onto the shore. This is a sacred place - perhaps you shouldn't be here. As you move closer to the circle of menhirs, you notice a red stain upon the ground at its center. Then a great howl breaks the silence as something rises from the murky waters behind you...  \n $3500 - 4th Stretch Goal Unlocked!\n1 bonus full size, hand drawn, unkeyed full color maps added to the book PLUS 2 x Digital JPEGs added to the Digital Maps Package \u2013 Full size and a smaller version sized for virtual tabletops - you can use for your own adventures.\nCavern Platforms\nThis cavern is huge, with a ceiling at least a hundred feet high; hanging stalactites outlined in phosphorescence and resembling ghoulish teeth provide a modicum of illumination.

The book will look great on your bookshelf and in play!\nI\u2019m the author of 7 books of adventures for 5e and OSR RPGs, 2 books of poetry and 21 other RPG products. \nI first started playing and DM\u2019ing D&D in 1981. Nowadays, I game roughly 2-3 times a week. I have lots of RPGs - Fate Core, Symbaroum, Numenera, Pathfinder 2e, Mutant Year Zero, Stars Without Number, Mouse Guard, Coriolis, Forbidden Lands - basically too many to list, but I'm a fan of them all. D&D remains my greatest love and when I write a new product, I pour my years of experience and passion into the project. Your support helps me continue to produce quality fantasy role playing adventures and supplements.\nThis is my seventh Kickstarter \u2013 the last six were delivered ahead of schedule, and anyone who\u2019s been part of them can tell you I always come through.\nWhat's the money used for?\nKickstarter  enables me to write and design role playing game content. Every Kickstarter I do is not only a labor of love, it pays for all the time I've invested creating, laying out and play testing the product - and more importantly, making a living! Read any blog by any product designer and you'll know margins are always tight, so your support for my projects is amazing and always appreciated.\nVisit Laidback DM at stevestillstanding.com for DM/GM hints, product reviews, and free maps.

Much of the work is done, with some play testing, writing and editing to be completed. \n\nOnce the Kickstarter is complete, I add the backer names and draw, digitally color and write any stretch goals and add them to the book, and compile the digital maps package. I complete the work myself, which means there are no staffing/scheduling issues. And I\u2019m locked up in isolation like you guys, so Covid-19 won\u2019t impact on my production of this book.\n\nI worked for 22 years in customer service and project management, so I'm used to managing time-scheduled projects and delivering products within timeframe. My previous projects have all been delivered within a month of Kickstarter completion, all ahead of schedule. \n\nThe only potential delay is any shutdown of DrivethruRPG\u2019s printing house, which is always possible in light of the current pandemic. This hasn\u2019t delayed the production of my print proofs previously, and I\u2019ll keep you all informed if it does happen. If it does, I can release the digital content early and release the print version when their printing house comes online again.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio":

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "When things are at their worst, the best among us rises to the fore. When disaster strikes or menace looms, they don\u2019t run from the danger, they run toward it. Whether they claim supernatural abilities or just plain courage, there's a single word that describes such people:\nIn a world that could use a few heroes now more than ever, you can now join their ranks\u2014using the flexible TTRPG mechanics of the Cypher System.\nImagine, for a moment, that you find yourself imbued with powers well beyond those of mere mortals. With great might, you leap into dark and daunting dangers. You stand before the forces of injustice with confidence. You slip the grasp of gravity and soar. You Claim the Sky itself.\nBut what about on the other end of the scale, where we\u2019re all a bit more earth-bound? We can still be heroes. Saving lives amid natural disasters, man-made cataclysms, pandemics, or crises of any sort, we can take on the role of First Responders.\nThese two new Cypher System sourcebooks focus on heroes of all kinds!\nClaim the Sky continues the series of genre-focused books that includes The Stars Are Fire (science-fiction), Stay Alive! (horror), We Are All Mad Here (fairy tales), and Godforsaken (fantasy). Each of those titles dives deep, exploring different aspects and variations of its genre and offering new rules, character creation ideas, equipment, creatures, cyphers, and other elements for making the most of the topic.\nIn this case, of course, the topic is superheroes. Whether your love is comic book superheroes or the blockbuster films of recent years, Claim the Sky will give you step-by-step guidelines for recreating all your favorite characters, building your own heroes from scratch, and sending them out into fun, fast-paced RPG adventures and campaigns.\nBut there\u2019s more. Like the books that came before it, Claim the Sky presents a fully realized, ready-to-use superhero setting: Boundless. In the world of Boundless, your player characters can join the ranks of well-established heroes and face titanic foes: invading alien creatures, horrors from other dimensions, supervillains using their powers for selfish or destructive ends. This setting is like our own world, but superpowers have existed for generations, and the world has adapted accordingly (in sometimes surprising ways!). If you\u2019re looking for a setting with the feel of movies or comics, Boundless will take you there!\nFirst Responders looks at heroism from a different angle. This is a world where the heroes' powers aren't supernatural: our world, where courage, wits, experience, and grit are the tools by which our heroes overcome crises and disaster. Around the globe, the PCs respond to earthquakes and hurricanes, floods and fires, war zones and industrial disasters, plane crashes and pandemics. They're part of an international organization with a mission to save lives and to not just respond to crises, but to end them.\nIn First Responders, you create a campaign with a broad roster of heroes. In one session you might need a paramedic, a trained rescue worker, and a firefighting specialist, while the next mission requires the paramedic, a field researcher, and a pilot, and the one after that you need a rescue worker, a field researcher, and a technician. The players maintain multiple characters, but the unique system advances them all, regardless of which are involved in a given adventure, so that any can be called upon as the campaign progresses and the threats become ever more dangerous.\nFirst Responders also provides exciting rules for mega-challenges, making events like a forest fire or an earthquake into a fully-realized narrative filled with challenges as dynamic and exciting as any battle against monsters or crawl through a dungeon. These large-scale challenge rules will be easily useable in any Cypher System game, so you can incorporate them into your Numenera campaign, or adventures based on Claim the Sky, The Stars Are Fire, or any other Cypher System setting.\nOur world needs heroes. Cypher System fans love new books. We've already unlocked The Origin, a new hardcover setting book. And we're looking forward to reaching the Cypher System Bestiary later in this campaign! What else might we unlock before that title\u2014or beyond it? We have lots of great ideas, and look forward to lots of cool stretch goals!\nThe critically acclaimed, award-winning Cypher System is fast-paced, narrative-focused, flexible, and uniquely easy on the GM. Baked-in mechanics like Effort and player intrusions easily support heroic styles of play\u2014PCs can really push themselves to do amazing things. The Cypher System\u2019s Power Shift mechanic and Power Boost cyphers perfectly portray the way superpowers work. They make it easy to show how a super-strong hero can break down a door without thinking twice or how another hero might briefly try something unique with their powers to get a very specific effect. Both of these mechanics\u2014and more\u2014will be even further developed in Claim the Sky.\nCreating a great Cypher System character is as easy as coming up with a great concept. You build the character you imagine through a quick, fun process that results in a character with depth, nuance, and flexibility.\nCypher System characters are built with a three-part sentence. You might be a Rugged Warrior who Stands Like a Bastion. A Guarded Adept who Keeps a Magic Ally. Perhaps a Graceful Explorer who Moves Like the Wind. Or a Charming Speaker who Bears a Halo of Fire. Each part of your sentence says something about your character\u2014but also provides some of your abilities, skills, and stats. They even offer guidance on your connections to other characters in your party, creating bonds that can be a foundation for an ongoing campaign, or facilitate great roleplaying in one-shot adventures.\nCyphers give characters single-use abilities frequently gained and spent, adding variety to the character\u2019s capabilities and providing exciting new approaches and options. Depending on what\u2019s appropriate for the campaign, cyphers can be subtle, representing blessings, unusual turns of luck or capricious powers, or manifest, in the form of bits of unusual technology, charms, or minor magic items.\nCharacter arcs encourage and reward players for pursuing their characters\u2019 own motivations, in addition to the overall story of the campaign. Just as the heroes of movies, comics, and TV shows grow through their own subplots, Cypher System players may choose arcs to pursue, tying their characters\u2019 personalities more closely to the overall story and engaging the players even deeper into their characters and the campaign.\nNo problem! Every backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. (Already have the CSR? You can gift your free PDF to a friend!)\nWant to Check It Out Now?\nDownload the free Cypher System Rules Primer, and have a look at the system's amazing mechanics right now!\nClaim the Sky is a 224-page hardcover (upgraded to include a poster map!) that delves deeply into all aspects of the superhero genre. With a similar look and form, it's a beautiful companion to the recent Cypher System supplements The Stars Are Fire, Godforsaken, Stay Alive!, and We Are All Mad Here. Beautifully illustrated, it explores the many facets and subgenres of superhero comics, movies, and fiction, with rules and options for all of them. It includes the Boundless campaign setting, along with creatures, cyphers, artifacts, equipment, and more.\nFirst Responders is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) that presents rules, options, gear, and more for heroes inspired by the real world to take on massive challenges and dangers.\nThe Origin is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) setting book. This is a world where superheroes are not a fact of life. Player characters must come to grips with the fact that they can do things normal humans cannot, and then decide what to do with these abilities while facing clandestine government branches, terrorist organizations, and even more mysterious groups that want to study, recruit, or destroy them.\nEvery backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. If you already have the CSR, we'll make it easy to gift your free PDF to a friend.\nAre You a First Responder? If you're a firefighter, EMT or paramedic, emergency worker, or other front-line hero, the Real-World Heroes backer level gives you First Responders and the Cypher System Rulebook at a deep discount just for you.\nLooking to Get into the Cypher System? You'll get the Cypher System Rulebook in PDF at any reward level. Prefer it in glorious hardcover? The Brand New Hero level gives you every title funded by this campaign, plus the CSR in print (a $70 value). Or check out Any Character, Any Campaign, which includes four additional genre books at an astounding discount! If you're looking to spend a little less, you can instead choose the CSR as an add-on.\nWant to Playtest\u2014or Just See It Early? Materials for the titles funded by this campaign generally go to playtesters about four months before those titles become products and go out as backer rewards (that's a generalization, though\u2014not a specific commitment). If you'd like to be part of the action, or just have early access to the materials to check them out, or to roll the mechanics into your existing Cypher System campaign, back at any level from The Danger Room up. Backers at these levels may choose to be part of the playtest, or simply to receive the playtest material without providing feedback. It's up to you!\nLove an Incredible Deal? To get your hands on a whole stack of awesome Cypher System products, you can't do better than the Any Character, Any Campaign or THOOOM! reward levels. The savings are so spectacular they're a bargain even if you already own some of the titles. All the levels from The Danger Room and up also get you the Cypher System playmat for free, and early access and playtesting!\nAre You a Retailer? The Secret Base level is a flexible way for you to decide how many of each title is right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you three copies each of Claim the Sky and First Responders. You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping\u2014but you must still complete BackerKit and follow our fulfillment process (see Shipping, below).\n\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will ship rewards at several times over the course of many months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to BackerKit, our pledge management platform. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything you might have missed. Later, when a reward is ready to fulfill, you'll use the MCG Shop to manage the process. This puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming rewards at your convenience, and ensures we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS STEP TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARD.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n1.  When a reward is ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email.\n2.  You log on to the MCG Shop.\n3.  You go to your Coupons page and click on the coupon for the reward, and it is automatically added to your cart. If you have multiple rewards, or want to make purchases, you can add them all to your cart before checking out.\n4. Check out! You give us your address and pay for shipping (for physical rewards) at that time.\nUPDATING YOUR ADDRESS OR GIFTING YOUR REWARD If you move, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, just enter their shipping address when you check out. If it's not convenient to receive a reward at the time of fulfillment, or to ship multiple rewards together to save on shipping costs, you may delay redemption of a reward for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date. \nSHIPPING All backers pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you can choose. As of this writing, basic domestic shipping is $7 per shipment, but we do not control future postal rates, so that cost is subject to change. International shipping is based on postal and shipping rates at the time of the order, and varies by destination and shipment weight.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. We must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Here are details that apply to your region:\n The Americas: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). Canadian backers please note that our books are printed in Canada, and thus are not subject to import duties; however, items not printed in Canada, such as decks of cards, are subject to import duties.\n The EU and UK: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. UK and EU backers will not pay import duties and taxes.\n Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific, and Asia: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has run sixteen previous Kickstarter campaigns.

It\u2019s filled with new monsters, spells, items, cults, dark magic, locations, and a horde of otherworldly adventure ideas for your players, all designed to be instantly added to any campaign. It features a shadow war between the worlds of light and the monstrous creatures of the Dark Place - the realm beyond the mirror -while still being decidedly D&D. With expanded rules for madness and corruption - it's designed to put the dread into your heroes - literally!\nEldritch: The Book of Madness\nELDRITCH CONTENTS\nHere\u2019s a summary of exactly what you are getting with Eldritch, and why it\u2019s such great value for money. Not sure, check out the many previews in every update!\nSo far, Eldritch: The Book of Madness is a 144+ page hardcover featuring:\n50 pages of monsters and their powers (all completely new - these creatures will shock and terrify your heroes - guaranteed - I've schemed for months to bring you the most terrifying abilities designed to give pause to the most seasoned adventurer). Also includes DMs tips on handling your otherworldly creatures and a host of other details on their existence (including the cults that worship them).\n6 pages of fearsome Dread mechanics (designed to strike fear into your heroes - literally!)\n20 pages of locations in the Grey Wastes \u2013 the demi-plane that sits beyond the Dark Mirror.\n10 pages of new magic items including the Dread Staff and the fearsome Shadow Blades.\n12 pages of new profane spells that use the heroes' fear against them!\n6 pages of corrupt spells and cursed magical items, including cursed scrolls and trapped spells.\n6 pages featuring four of the Dread Lords \u2013 creatures of incredible power that are able to manifest a tiny fraction of their power in the mortal realms.\n18 pages featuring the many faces of evil (including some terrible cults hiding in plain sight). \nJust one of many creatures (this page is cut down to show an all round selection of its abilities)\nWhat is Eldritch: The Book of Madness?\nThe Book of Madness is a high quality hardcover with 144 pages featuring a unique setting where the magic of the mortal realms is coveted by the minions of chaos from the realm beyond the Dark Place. They cannot enter this world - yet - but they can reach out tendrils of magic to ensnare the minds of the weak-willed and the corrupt! \nThe first of five books, Eldritch has its fingers in the feel of HP Lovecraft's works, but it most certainly is NOT a clone of his works - oh no - this is 100% D&D. In Eldritch you will encounter a paranoid world where anyone could be in league with evil. The sinewy tendrils of wicked magic seep into the mortal realms from the Dark Place; its inhabitants seek to corrupt the minds of the living, with the goal of one day passing from one reality and into the worlds of light. Should the heroes discover what is going on under their noses, they have a choice: face the evil head on and risk being destroyed by its power, or walk away and do nothing knowing that a terrible shadow is gathering... \nEldritch is a book about ancient evil powers, unfathomable magic, and entities with goals and desires beyond those even of the gods. Check out the  many updates for more information on what you can expect from this tome of shadows!\nYou can see from the previews (below) that there's nothing standard about this book!\nAn Assortment of Amazing Art from Eldritch: The Book of Madness\nKey Selling Points\nGorgeous art - evocative of the madness-inducing mythology of an alien universe.\nBeautifully written - the Book of Madness is filled with plot hooks and adventure ideas to stir the imagination.\nNew Dread rules - wrapped up in an ultra high fantasy D&D setting. These monsters will fit right in with any setting, from fantasy to sci-fi.\nMonster tactics - gain an insight into how to use these monsters to take your players by surprise. They will never see it coming!  \nUnique game mechanics - so secret we can't reveal them here, but they will fit seamlessly in with any game version allowing you to strike fear in to the hearts of your players!\nPREVIEW: THE GREY WASTES\nThe Demi-Plane of Madness and Evil\nPREVIEW: DREAD BLADES\nCorrupt Magical Weapons (Work in Progress).

We will be working with Quartermaster Logistics for the US and other well-respected fulfillment partners in the EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nWe have already begun working with these partners and are currently seeing shipping prices between $15 - $30 USD for most backers in the US, UK. EU, CA, AU/NZ, China, and Asia, but as the project grows with stretch goals this may change for some regions. We will keep you up to date on the current shipping estimates as they are revised, but be aware that we will not be able to custom quote everyone during the campaign. For backers outside those regions, we will ensure that we ship from the most cost-effective locations.\n2020 has seen shipping prices fluctuate greatly and we are expecting that trend to continue into next year. Additionally, some changes are being put in place for EU/UK customs in 2021 that may affect shipping prices going forward in those countries. Note that this will NOT affect us providing customs-friendly shipping to our backers.\nPlease note that shipping is also notoriously unreliable in some regions such as Russia and Brazil.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Pincha en la imagen para la pagina web en castellano\nAboard a cruise ship, the lifeless body of a passenger has been found in their luxury suite\u2026\nThe prime suspects are the occupants of the VIP cabins on the upper deck. They are the only ones who could have had access. You and your fellow private detectives are participating in a conference aboard the ship, and you all decide to make a bet to solve the murder. Who among you will prove to be the finest sleuth?\nThe story-based competitive crime investigation game Midnight Murder Mysteries takes you on an unpredictable voyage, in which you must try to reconstruct the circumstances of the alleged crime\u2026\nWho is the murderer? What was their motive? How did the victim die? These are the questions you will need to answer once the ship has docked\u2026 Or after another detective discloses what they have found! \nCommon assumptions for all cases: the suspicious death occurred the day before, between 11:45 pm and midnight; the murderer acted alone and is always one of the occupants of the VIP cabins unless it was an accident or suicide.\nIn each case, you will be able to talk to 12 suspects who could be interrogated about three topics and 24 locations that are spread over several floors that could be explored. The cases are completely independent of one another. Even though they have identical first names in all of the cases, the suspects are never the same people. \nOUR FUNDING GOAL!\nPlease see cases details in the CASES section below.\nNEXT STRETCH GOAL\nUnlocking this stretch goal will add 1 case in the Green/Red booklets & 1 case in the Purple one.\nCORE BOX\nThe board, with floor plans of the decks of the ship and the Ship Progression track\n ALL-IN BOX = Core box, plus:\nCases are the heart of Midnight Murder Mysteries! Each booklet contains several cases, which you don\u2019t have to play in any particular order. Amateur cases contain fewer wrong paths than Expert cases and offer more ways to find important clues.\nAt the beginning of a booklet, you find the Case Presentation (which may include special rules), with a correlation table: each of the 60 possible paths you can follow has a number, which points to a specific Paragraph. \nIn the middle of the booklet, the Paragraphs for all the cases, referenced by a number, are mixed, which means that the surrounding Paragraphs won\u2019t be relevant to the case you are playing.\nPlenty of cases!\nYou will get tons of cases from the start! But the 100% goal is only a first step: the more backers we get, the more cases will be added to the boxes! \nThe Green & Red booklets: the 12 starting cases\nPlease note all cases are written and tested but most cases are not translated yet. \nThe Purple booklet: the 8 starting cases\nPlease note all cases are written and tested but most cases are not translated yet.\nThe White booklet contains 5 cases and is an exclusive KS bonus for ALL backers! \nFancy yourself a detective? Try out the game by playing 3 cases: K01 - The Billionaire Cruise; K02 - Pirates!; K03 - The Epidemic. \nDownload the print and play version (zipped file)\nThese 3 cases need less material than the Standard ones: only 6 Suspects; no Purser; no Event deck for K01 & K02. Nevertheless, the plot is just as exciting as in other cases! You'll also need the rules. You'll find 4 files:\nMMM-2DED_EN_PnP_Booklet-White-K1to3 (landscape format with 2 pages per sheet)\nMMM-2DED_EN_PnP_NotebookSheets (you'll need one double-sided page per player)\nMMM-2DED_EN_PnP_Board&Tokens\nMMM-2DED_EN_PnP_BlueSetEventDeck (only required for playing K03)\nDOWNLOAD THE RULES (pre-published PDF version)\nChoose a case (Amateur level or Expert level) from one of the case booklets. Read its presentation out loud, and embark on a new mystery adventure\u2026\nAt the beginning of each round, reveal a new Event card (some will cause the ship to advance on its track, others will add a bit of spice to the game) and place the purser in the zone designated by the number on the card.\nThen, players will take turns investigating in clockwise order. On your turn, you have 3 action points to spend (Buoy tokens also give additional action points). You can use them to take the actions described below.\nInvestigation actions\nWhether public or private, all investigations are automatically successful. To search/inspect a location and to interrogate a suspect, the detective must be in the same zone as the target. To interrogate a suspect, you must also choose one of the three possible conversational subjects and announce it to the other players:\n ALIBI (Where were you at the time of the murder?),\n WITNESS (Do you know something about the death, the victim, or the other suspects?),\n MOTIVE (What was your relationship with the victim?).\nThen refer to the case booklet to read the paragraph (each of the possible paths you can follow has a number, which points to a specific Paragraph).\nAfter spending your action points, you may move one suspect of your choice one or two zones for free. Put the Last Moved Suspect disc underneath the moved suspect, which indicates the next suspect to be moved this way has to be a different one.\nEnd of the case and player conclusions\nA case ends when the ship arrives at the port OR when a detective makes disclosures. In both cases, all players will share what they have deduced. After that, read the entire solution of the case out loud and then calculate the scores. The player with the highest total score wins the game! \nThe most exciting parts of this game lie in discovering the story piece by piece and in trying to understand what happened. Ultimately, you\u2019re aiming to avoid the wrong paths and be the best at gathering and interpreting the puzzle pieces presented by the story\u2026\nGame preview at the Festival International du Jeu 2020 with BoardGameGeek: \nGame overview with \"Stella's Short and Sweet\" video from Meeple University.\n Game overview by Jonah Dew from Tantrum House.\nGet a flavor of Midnight Murder Mysteries in The Dice Tower Pocket Playthrough with Stella & Tarrant of Meeple University who played it for a few rounds (2 players).\nWatch Ryan, Jonah, Will & Sara from Tantrum House playing through Midnight Murder Mysteries (4 players, 80min).

Discoveries are made as the National Archives slowly release information to the Inheritance hunting firm \"Fairhall and Brett\" who contact you as the last living descendant of a woman your family always thought had been killed during a V2 rocket attack in 1944...\n\nNever played before?\nThis is our  fourth \"season\" of cosykiller - but the stories grow in complexity  annually as we learn what we can and can't do with paper and extras - we're moving offices this year because the cosykiller series have become so popular we need more space.  We're using this increase in space to buy a few more large machine gadgets that will enable us to really increase the hands-on nature of cosykiller this year...\n\nFor those who've played before you know each story contains a heady mix of puzzles and plot allowing players  to get really immersed in the story as each unfolds.  It's a unique mix  of choose your own adventure and cryptography and it's not for the  faint-heated.\nEach series has included mementos and memorabilia from the time thanks to our various contacts in reproduction services and our  excellent design team.\nIf you've never played before, then you won't be disappointed with this year :-)\n\nThe Rewards?\nWe've tried to create tier points that enable you to back us even if you don't want to commit to a full story!  If you have never played cosykiller before and want to dip your toe into the water to see what a box might be like - then why not just pledge for our Christmas Murder Mystery Weekend Gift Box.  This will be a stand alone story with evidence and live action drama via zoom on a weekend in January.  Our last murder mystery virtual weekend contained puzzles similar to our cosykiller series... so if you can achieve those - then you'll know you can tackle the full year...\n\nOur Early Bird Pledges have some unique offers, only available in limited quantities.  So grab those while you can!\n\nWhy are we seeking funding through Kickstarter?\nSince we started Cosykiller in 2016 it's literally taken over our  office!  We are currently working within a cocoon of cardboard boxes,  sitting behind stacks of printing for the boxes, and with finished  subscriptions stacked up to the ceiling around us!\n\nAt the moment we can't actually FIT another story into our office, which means we are moving offices!  \n\nAs we hand pack each box it means we need space to lay out all the  pieces that fit inside each one.  Players this year have noticed the odd  mistake as we miss items, or add in duplicates, and this is purely  caused by space problems within the office as we're working without  space to swing a cat (probably just as well as I think the two dogs in  the office would eat any we did bring in to test swing-ability).\n\nA fully funded Kickstarter will help towards the office expansion  plans, as we need more shelving, fit for purpose storage and just  generally MORE ROOM to grow!\n\nThis office move will also mean we'll have space for a laser cutter of our own, which we will be using to increase the complexity of our puzzles!  An overfunded kickstarter will make this vision a reality much sooner too!\n\n\nReviews for previous series:\nAmazing and friendly company with a very immersive story line. Half  way  through the first season and have to say I\u2019m addicted! I\u2019m solving  this  with my mum and it\u2019s a great way for us to spend quality time  together.  Can\u2019t wait to see what the other seasons have in store! Thank  you cosykiller xx\n-----\nThis is the ultimate mystery. There is so much information that you   receive over a year\u2019s time. It\u2019s fun to get completely immersed in the   story. There are lots of clues, but many of them are difficult to  figure  out and are a great challenge for your brain. The different  ciphers  used take just enough work that you get a real sense of  satisfaction  when you complete them. Overall, this has been a great  experience!\n-----\nI feel like I've been transported to 1930s India, and I'm only  working  through the journal in the first box! I cannot wait to see  what's next!  In addition to the game itself, the women who are Cosy  Killer have been  very welcoming and accommodating with all of my  questions! Way to go,  ladies! You all are fantastic!\n----\nI just got my first box and it is really cool. The journal came  burned,  it is so interesting. I wonder why, that is something I need to  figure  out. This is the best box ever!!!! If you like mystery, i  highly  recommend.\n----\nCosy Killer is by far the best murder mystery subscription box. If  you  are looking for an engaging experience filled with authentic  characters,  a story with multiple interwoven plot lines, puzzles that  are  organically entwined within the narrative which serve to enhance  the  whole experience then this is it. The excellent skills of the  CosyKiller  team encourage an inevitable emotional investment in the  characters.  While you know that you are investigating the death and  whereabouts of  Marie, there is a point in Box 9 where you decode a  tricky artifact,  with every letter decoded my heart ached a little as I  could predict  what the next letter would be.\nIf you want an experience like  no other I have encountered, one that  will keep you puzzling and that  keeps you coming back for more - then  Cosy Killer is the only  subscription box out there.\nTreat yourself - you won't regret it\n----\nLet's get the downside out of the way first -  CosyKiller is a  year-long subscription.  Telling one story over twelve  monthly boxes,  it's some commitment of money and time.\nBUT!\nWhat  it gives you back for that subscription is unsurpassed in terms  of  mystery subscription boxes.  There are no phone numbers to call  that  might end up disconnected after a few months, there are no  websites to  visit that might be taken offline at no notice, everything  you need is  there in the boxes.\nAnd what boxes they  are - one month you might get a 128 page  diary/journal containing two  obvious ciphers and one very well hidden  one.  You might get twelve to  sixteen letters from one character to  another, including drawings and  birthday or christmas cards.  You might  get clay artifacts, or death  certificates, or shipping manifests, or  telegrams, or....\nYou  can read something in box 8 that reminds you of something in box  1 to  find an inconsistency in testimony that feeds into the final  solution -  you can find ciphers in early boxes that are made more  explicit later  on, but still solvable at that early stage.\nThe commitment is huge, but the project is major league, satisfying, intelligent, interesting and thoroughly recommended.\n----\nI am only three episodes in but the storyline is awesome and very   gripping. I didn\u2019t want to stop reading! You get very authentic items   and they pay close attention to detail. Very impressed!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fourth Cosykiller series - the only risk that may present is that the author dies - and that's really not something anyone expects to happen any time soon.

Our packages are delivered direct to you, filled with incredible puzzles and a deep, immersive world.\n Team up or play alone! You can play by yourself, with your partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues. Each of the packages should last around 90 minutes.\n Interact with the world! Contact the characters by email or message, stalk their social media accounts and scour the internet to help solve the puzzles.\n Become immersed in the story! Put yourself into the shoes of the detective to solve The Sudden Silence of Timothy Lee.\n Continue your journey! Each package follows on from the previous one, presenting you with new challenges and exciting plot twists.\n\nPhysical Items\nAt the heart of each episode is the package that will be delivered through your door. Inside you will find a range of different items, which you will need to solve the case.\nInteractive Technology\nTo create a truly modern detective experience, all members of the Society will need to examine digital sources as well as the physical ones in the package.\nOur bespoke communication systems allow players to converse with characters via email and SMS/Whatsapp.\nOur detailed and immersive websites create complex online worlds for detectives to explore as they search for answers.\nExhaustive Clue System\nEven the best detectives can require a little help. That's why we created an innovative and exhaustive clue system for Season One, to enable detectives to get a little assistance should they require it.\nOur master detective Lucid Montgomery takes a look over every case that comes through our door and is kind enough to write down a few prompts for each part of each episode in case a detective is in need of assistance.\n\nWelcoming Community\nWe have already collected together an incredible bunch of detectives from Season One on our dedicated Facebook and Reddit groups.\nThese amazing detectives discuss and share their findings, assisting each other when they get stuck and pointing out hidden tidbits that some might have missed (while flagging spoilers, of course).\nWe know some detectives like to work alone, but for those that don't, you will find the community a welcoming place for you to discuss the cases.\nChristmas is coming and you might want to give a loved one the gift of detecting this holiday season.\nTo make this easier, we will be giving backers the option to be emailed a gift voucher code, that they can pass on to the recipient at Christmas (or for their birthday or for any other event worthy of a present). The recipient can then redeem this code via our website to receive the packages at the same time as everyone else.\nThis option will be provided when we send out our backer survey once the campaign ends, meaning you will receive these vouchers in time for Christmas.\nAdd-ons are a new feature being trialled by Kickstarter and mean that we don\u2019t need to utilize a pledge management system.\nBackers can also select to receive Season One (either the first episode or all six episodes) as an add-on when they pledge to receive any of our rewards. The Season One add-ons are available at discounted rates as a thank you to all our Season Two backers.\nSeason One add-ons will be shipped in January 2021, alongside Episode One of Season Two.\nYou can also use the add-on feature to purchase additional copies of Season Two (Episode One or all six episodes).\nAs a Company, we're committed to producing Season Two - no matter what! And we'd like to thank everyone who has supported us so far for allowing that to happen. \nSo what made us decide to launch Season Two on Kickstarter?\nBy pre-selling on Kickstarter, we then know how ambitious we can be with our plans for Season Two. The huge support we received for Season One, meant we could do so much more than we originally planned.\nEvery copy of Season Two that's purchased on Kickstarter contributes to extra design features, video work, voiceovers, interactive elements, digital content and physical box contents. Simply put, the more you support us the more we'll be able to do.\nWe're a super small company, but we have big ideas and your support makes them a reality.\nWe are pleased to say that we ship worldwide! You can view the shipping costs in the table below:\nAll shipping to the United Kingdom is included in the price, as that's where we manufacture and ship our packages from - we have also reduced the normal international shipping costs to take into account that shipping is included for UK customers.\nWe take all precautions to ensure that customers outside of the UK pay no customs or import fees - including attaching CN22 forms - although we cannot guarantee your parcel will not be held at customs or have additional fees applied. However, to date, we are unaware of any of packages we have shipped internationally having additional fees applied to them.\nIf you have had board games sent to you in the past from the UK without issues, then there is a good chance the same will happen with The Detective Society's games.\nThe season is made up of six episodes and if you buy the whole season you will receive one a month. We'll ship each of the episodes to all players simultaneously. This will help avoid any spoilers, whilst also giving all players the chance, if they wish, to experience each episode at the same time as every other player, making it an exciting 'live' event.\nHow will this work with your Kickstarter pledge?\nIf you pledge for \u201cFirst Package\u201d then you will receive your first box at the same time as everybody else, when Season Two goes live (January 2021). You can then choose to buy the rest of the season, either via a subscription or by buying the packages individually when they are released.\nIf you pledge for \u201cAll Six Packages\u201d then you are purchasing the whole of the season - you will receive one episode every month. The story will run alongside your life for the entire six months!\nWho can play the game?\nThe game can be played solo, with a partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues and is recommended for players aged over 14 years, due to the peril the characters find themselves faced with.\nWhen will we deliver?\nEpisode One will be produced and shipped in late January 2021, with the subsequent five episodes being shipped monthly from then on.\nIt's always been important to us that we deliver what we promise on schedule, and we have achieved that with Season One. \nAll our processes and supply chains have been established from the production of Season One and that will continue seamlessly as we move into the production of Season Two. \nSeason Two is being designed by the same people that brought you Season One - Joe Mills and Tristan Rogers - while Dan Wiseman is in charge of the business operations.\nBefore creating The Detective Society, Joe was instrumental in the success of some of the best escape games that London has to offer. His journey began with Time Run, ('fifth best escape room company in the world' in 2018); before moving onto Sherlock: The Game Is Now - the official BBC TV series tie-in. He also created and launched one of Design My Night's top picks for a night out in London: the immersive puzzle-based cocktail experience, The Case of the Poisoned Chalice. Joe takes the lead when it comes to creating all the puzzles. \nTristan is a game designer, actor and award-winning writer. He's worked in some of London's top theatres and has written on numerous programmes for BBC Radio. He\u2019s worked with Joe designing puzzles at various escape games, most recently penning the plot for The Case of The Poisoned Chalice. Tristan is in charge of overseeing the narrative of the cases.\nDan is our managing director and brings his vast business and marketing experience to the team. For over 10 years he has been building and operating successful businesses, including a digital marketing agency. He is connected to the Detective Society through a mutual love of all things gaming-related, evidenced by his constant stream of RPG game ideas. Dan made his first RPG when he was just 13 years old. Dan ensures that we deliver on our promises.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are of course various risks and challenges involved - problems with design, procurement and shipping can all occur. However, our extensive work creating Season One means we have lots of experience to draw on. We have already built relationships with our key suppliers, and we are now very well versed in the processes required to release one episode a month. Our budgets are thorough, and we have built in significant contingency to deal with those issues we cannot foresee.\n\nOf course there are two factors that are outside of our control. Firstly, Covid-19 continues to spread across the world, and its existence has underpinned the lifespan of our young company. As we have existed with it for so long, we are confident we can deal with what the current situation throws at us. We are in regular contact with our suppliers, all of whom continue to operate as normal. Initially it impacted on the delivery timescales of our suppliers, but - at present - those have returned to their normal estimated delivery times. However, should this crisis deepen further, and cause major disruption to these supply and distribution networks (both here in the UK and worldwide), then this may impact our ability to deliver according to our planned schedule. Secondly, it remains unclear what trading agreement, if any, will be reached between Britain and the EU. While we believe that regardless of the outcome we should be able to continue to ship our packages to the EU and beyond without any customs issues, the nature of these negotiations means that things could change suddenly and unexpectedly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are committed to using materials that can be recycled or reused, both in terms of the content of the package and the packaging materials.\nSustainable materials\nThe paper and cardboard we use comes from FSC certified forests.\nSomething else\nWe manufacture in the UK, which is also where the vast majority of our suppliers are based, reducing our carbon footprint.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a328 or more", "title": "First Package - Standard Discount", "descp": "You will get the first package from 'Season Two' delivered to your door.\nSolve puzzles, crack codes and interact with the characters to investigate the case.\nSTANDARD DISCOUNT OFFER - circa 7% off RRP.\nINCLUDES:\nFirst Package from Season Two.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3140 or more", "title": "All Six Packages - Standard Discount", "descp": "The entirety of Season Two.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Face the threat of the supernatural as a traitor with a chance of redemption in the service of Queen Elizabeth I, in an alternately historical tabletop RPG from the creator of The Cthulhu Hack.\nWhen Elizabeth Tudor succeeded to the throne in 1558, she found herself under assault from all sides, paying for her father's arrogant machinations, and the weakened barrier between worlds his split with Rome had caused.\nAs magic and creatures of the supernatural proliferate throughout the land, the Queen passed an Act Against Conjurations, Enchantments and Witchcrafts, making the punishment for acts of magic more severe than others, but in many cases drawing the line before a death sentence. In 1564, John Dee and Francis Walsingham convinced the Queen to pass an amendment to the Act \u2014 The Dee Sanction \u2014 permitting the practice of magic in defence of the realm.\nYou are an Agent of Dee; not out of choice, but out of some twisted sense of self-preservation. Somewhere between conscription and penance, you work for Walsingham and Dee to make amends, with a faint hope that you can use your talents to earn your pardon and absolution.\nYou can see the light at the end of the tunnel. If only you can outrun the shadows of your past and the horrors of the present\u2026\nThis is The Dee Sanction.\nThe Dee Sanction is a tabletop roleplaying game about serving Queen and country in the late Tudor period, in a time where kingdoms vie for power, the Church splinters under the pressure of reform, and creatures of folklore emerge from enforced hiding seeking revenge against those who imprisoned them.\nYou're a bad person \u2014 sentenced to hang for dabbling in magic \u2014 given a chance to redeem yourself and earn freedom in service to Queen Elizabeth's newest line of defence. \nLike The Cthulhu Hack, the system focuses on simple mechanics. A player rolls against one of three Resources \u2014 measured by a dice value for Physical, Intellectual and Supernatural \u2014 and hope to avoid a result of 1 or 2. The agent always succeeds in broad terms, but with a result of 1 or 2, they fail forward.\nThat means even a bad roll won't stop progress; it just means things might get a bit harder. That's the core of it, the philosophy that even in failure, the story should always be moving forward, even if it might tilt toward potential disaster in the process!\nThe campaign will fund a 60-page black-and-white illustrated compact book (A5, 148 x 210mm/5.8 x 8.3 inches), 95% written at the time the Kickstarter starts and tested over several years. You can find out more about the background and development of the game at The Dee Sanction blog \u2014 which will continue to expand and support the game.\nThe Character Sheet and the Core Book\nTwo-page spread from the current edit of the Core Book\nRecorded as part of Virtually Expo in August 2020, three fearless agents head into the unknown \u2014 south of Krakow, April 1585 \u2014 on the trail of a missing relic at the strange mercy of a blessed eyelash...\nBoth an interview and an actual play (starting at 32m 46s) as part of podcast Orlanth Rex's Gaming Vexes. We chat around the genesis and development of the game, before setting out to Deptford, 1593, in pursuit of a volume from Dee's lost library, The Book of Dead Names.\nOrlanth Rex's Gaming Vexes \u2014 Episode 8 \nAnd finally, an interview with Paul Mclean, of Yog-sothoth.com, was kind enough to interview me in January 2020 about the development, back story and future release of The Dee Sanction. Paul has kindly allowed me to host the interview, previously only available to Patrons via Patreon.\nThe core of the Kickstarter is the book, available in PDF (the Page), softcover (the Gentlefolk) and a cloth-bound hardcover version with a foil-blocked sigil of the Black Seal on the front (the Courtier).\nAll pledge levels with a physical book will also include a PDF, fulfilled through our web store at All Rolled Up.\nIn addition to the basic levels of book, both the Agent of Dee and the Favoured of the Queen pledge levels offer Kickstarter Exclusive rewards in the form of an All Rolled Up game roll. \nThe All Rolled Up game roll is a versatile, compact hobby wrap, that's way more than a dice bag; it can hold more than 100 polyhedral dice, plus up to 10 pens and pencils, as well as index cards or a small notepad.\nThese hand-crafted Kickstarter Exclusives feature special design features:\nthe Agent with closure strap complete with a metal buckle;\nthe Favoured with a crimson cord tie tipped with charms, representing elements of Elizabeth's elaborate outfit. The accessories and material of the game roll accentuate and mimic the Queen's dress design (see Update #22 for more pictures).\nSoftcover and Hardback covers (to be finalised)\nWork-in-progress printed fabric badge motif for All Rolled Up\nCharms adorning the ends of the cord tie on the I, Elizabeth ARU\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, and the book is finalised, all physical rewards will ship. PDF copies will be available as soon as the book is completed. The PDF and softcover will be available on an ongoing basis through All Rolled Up. \nThe hardcover book is a Kickstarter exclusive, printed in limited numbers on a short run. Any not sold through the Kickstarter will be available through the All Rolled Up web store.\nThe campaign's core goal aims to bring The Dee Sanction to print with the artwork it deserves. Mindful that the book is almost complete, we're keeping any stretch goals simple \u2014 focusing mostly on enhancements and digital extras.\nThe book stands at 60-pages, illustrated with black-and-white full and half plate illustrations by Evlyn Moreau. The \u00a33,000 base Goal will fulfil the print run and pay for existing artwork.\nIf we achieve stretch goals, we'll add more art, more content and enhance the range of initial digital material available to support the game.\nAdditional PDF adventures and accessories will not delay the release of the physical content.\nBeyond the base Goal of \u00a33,000, stretch goals will add:\n More Art (\u00a34,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - We will add two additional full-page commission pieces by the talented Evlyn Moreau to the Core Book. This brings us to 62-pages.\n PDF Adventures #1 through 4 (ALL \u2014 UNLOCKED) - Over the course of playtesting the game, many adventures have been run, taking the Dee Sanction from the heart of the Ossulstone Hundred in the shadow of the Tower to the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains in the wilds of eastern Europe.\n Longer Bestiary (\u00a36,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The Core Book contains a two-page bestiary. At this stage, we will expand that count to four-pages in total. This brings us to 64-pages.\n Tudor Mini Guild (\u00a38,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - We will commission Evlyn to create twenty mini character portraits in the style of her Fabulous Mini Guild. All backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print out or use online as tokens.\n Ossulstone Map (\u00a310,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - First glimpsed at Dragonmeet in 2019, the part of London at the heart of many Dee Sanction investigations is that which lies in the shadow of the Tower of London. A work-in-progress, at this level, all backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print out or use online.\n Sanction Journal (\u00a311,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The Dee Sanction encourages a play style that weaves tales across different dates, places and characters. Rather than restrict character information to just a sheet, a Sanction Journal - also known as a Book of Days - provides copies of the character sheet interspersed with a mix of gridded, lined, and dotted paper. All backers of virtual or physical product will receive a copy of the PDF version to print and use.\n More Art (\u00a314,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - As we've extended the bestiary, it's appropriate to add some creature images to the section. We will add two additional full pages to the book to include additional commissioned pieces by the talented Evlyn Moreau. This brings us to 66-pages.\n More Tables (\u00a316,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - The character generation system includes tables for generating occupation, association, focus and favours. We will add two tables, providing additional occupations and humours, which defines a possible quirk for your character (like the pre-generated characters used in the Actual Plays). This brings us to 68-pages.\n Wipe Character Cards (\u00a318,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - When we worked on The Cthulhu Hack we found that the option to have a dry wipe character card made sense for one-shots; an easy way to create and erase characters. We propose to create A5 dry wipe character cards (148 \u00d7 210 mm or 5.8 \u00d7 8.3 inches) for The Dee Sanction and include two cards with each physical reward level. Also, we will add the option to buy a pack of 10 as an Add On.\n PDF Adventure #5 (\u00a320,000 \u2014 UNLOCKED) - What's a wooden rammar and how did John Dee hurt his left shin on the sharp small end of it at four o'clock in the afternoon today (or possibly tomorrow \u2013 he isn't certain) in 1592? If we hit \u00a320,000, I'll write an adventure that explains (or at least considers) Dee's shin injury.\n Mystery Final Stretch Goal (\u00a330,000) - Dee's interminable quest, persevering in contempt of all reason, always pushed him onward. Who knows what esoteric wonders might await should such lofty heights be attained?\nSouthwark and The Dee Sanction\nAll physical items that require shipping can only be added to reward tiers that already include physical rewards.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In 2014, Magpie Games launched a Kickstarter for Urban Shadows, an ENnie award-winning tabletop roleplaying game of political urban fantasy that quickly became one of our flagship titles. For years, fans have praised both the game\u2019s effortless explanation of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine and the groundbreaking content on race and urban communities, leading Urban Shadows to be a favorite of urban fantasy gamers, podcasters, and streamers alike.\nNow\u2014more than six years later\u2014we are returning to the dark streets of the city for Urban Shadows: Second Edition, updating the game\u2019s rules, look, and tools to better support moving stories of political urban fantasy. Featuring new playbooks, new faction mechanics, and completely revised materials from first edition, Urban Shadows 2E will thrust you into the danger and drama of the city like never before!\nUrban Shadows is a political urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and supernaturals alike vie for power in a modern-day city. Vampires, faeries, hunters, wizards, and more clash in the shadows...or make backroom deals for their piece of the streets and skyscrapers. No one is ever safe, and everything is always at stake.\nIn Urban Shadows, you play unique and powerful archetypes, protagonists who are attuned to the supernatural world. While the mortal world remains ignorant of the struggles of the city\u2019s supernatural denizens, you are caught in the middle of the physical conflicts and political drama of the city\u2019s past, present, and future.\nYou might be a spectre bound to an artifact, unable to move on until you\u2019ve resolved your trauma. Or you might be a clever vampire who controls the best blood supply in the city, caught up in a war between your kind and those who hunt you. Or you might be a veteran of your city\u2019s ancient conflicts, someone who got out of the game but keeps getting drawn back in by friends and allies.\nNo matter who you are, you contain within you the power to shape the city\u2019s destiny. What future will you choose? And what will your victories cost you?\nUrban Shadows is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own titles such as Masks: A New Generation, Root: The RPG, and Zombie World. The game uses the core framework of that system to provide a strong, simple way to create your own stories of political urban fantasy. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of dangerous and difficult situations.\nUrban Shadows creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Constantine, Diableros, The Dresden Files, The John Wick franchise, The Last Witchhunter, Lost Girl, and The Wire. \nIn Urban Shadows, the city is a living, breathing character all its own. It hides dark desires, wicked deeds, and devious schemes, its shadowy tendrils a danger to mortals and supernaturals alike. Some residents have sacred sanctums or secure workshops\u2014places to weather the storms of the city\u2014but a sprawling metropolis lies just outside those little nooks, caring little if you prosper\u2026or bleed out in the gutters.\nBut nobody faces the city alone. Even the humblest of imps has a small community, a circle of those who can offer solace in the face of problems and danger. But community is a double-edged sword\u2014demanding as much as it gives\u2014and the needs and desires of those same circles constantly shape and reshape the vibrant urban landscape of the city. Nothing lasts forever, but the city turns over nearly every night, different forces laying different claims to you and yours.\nThe city hungers. Will you sate its gnawing desires? Or will your enemies make you the feast?\nThe schemes and plots of supernatural beings have been a part of the city for as long as anyone can remember. The faces at the top may shift and change with the tides of fortune, but rarely does something occur in the mortal world without some push from those who lurk in the shadows. A new subway system? A contested election? A bank robbery? Nothing is what it seems.\nBut what is mere money or prestige to wizards, ghosts, and faeries? Who cares about cash or elections when trafficking in human souls or exploring other dimensions? The supernatural forces of the city\u2014and the mortals who deal with them\u2014know only one real currency: debt.\nDebt is the power to influence those who owe you, the chits you call in to get things done, the ties that bind you to the rest of the city, and the proof that your word is strong and your bonds unbreakable. There are few true friends in the city, but your debtors always want to see you survive\u2014you can\u2019t pay up if you\u2019re dead.\nBut there are other ways to triumph in the city beyond the economy of favors and patronage. Cruel rituals. Dark secrets. The temptations of the monster within you. Those who seek power at any cost will find no end to the magics and mysteries available for the merest price of a soul.\nThe streets bleed shadows\u2014your debtors always around the corner\u2014as the city threatens to swallow you whole. Will you die a hero\u2026 or live long enough to become the villain? Will you fight the darkness\u2026or beg for power? The choice is yours.\nOver the past five years, Magpie Games has developed and created multiple games that broke boundaries and redefined what PbtA can do. Now, we think it\u2019s time to apply the lessons we\u2019ve learned to Urban Shadows, making a game that\u2019s tighter and easier to run, but also filled with new ideas and improvements, including new tools for players and GMs. We\u2019re also excited to create a beautiful new book with visionary art and fantastic graphic design. In short\u2026 we\u2019re making Urban Shadows 2E because we\u2019re thrilled to revisit and refine our work!\nHere\u2019s a quick list of the major changes, many of which are already available in the quickstart:\nrevised basic moves, including new versions of turn to violence and let it out \nrevised playbooks, including rebuilt versions of The Hunter and The Oracle \ntwo brand new playbooks: The Sworn (Power) and The Imp (Wild) \nchanging Factions to Circles\u2014see below\u2014and adding Circle Status to represent standing\na new downtime phase of the game focused on player-facing city moves and rumors\nreplacing Storms with a new MC-facing faction turn, including new faction moves\nexpanded MC tools for generating your city and Circles at the start of play\nWe\u2019re also adding a new mechanic to bring PCs into contact more often with each other: City Hubs. Cities are enormous spaces, and we found (in US1E) player characters could sometimes retreat to their different corners of the cityscape, interacting only with their own worlds and not with each other. With City Hubs, we want to create smaller, expandable environments to focus play and create drama. These Hubs\u2014described below\u2014position characters in neighborhoods, institutions, and community spaces in which they interact more frequently and avoid sessions in which PCs rarely come into contact and conflict.\nDownload the quickstart for a chance to test out some of these new features! We\u2019ll be previewing more of them during the campaign, and we\u2019re excited to get your feedback and refine Urban Shadows even more. Thank you to everyone who has given us feedback on 1st Edition since 2015!\n In Urban Shadows, your characters juggle relationships and obligations, seeking allies and opportunities, cashing in debts along the way to get things done. When you seize the day, you reshape the city in your image and unleash your powers on those who stand against you; when your enemies move and hunt, you do your best to stay ahead of the oncoming storm.\nUrban Shadows uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty through moves, bits of mechanics that say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you throw a punch at a loudmouthed werewolf in a demonic club\nWhen you plead with the wizard\u2019s council to return a tome of magic stolen from you\nWhen you try to escape the evil ritual you stumbled onto in the city\u2019s sewers\nWhen you ask one of your companions to forgive the debt your fae lover owes them\nWhen you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, often requiring a die roll. You roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery playbook has four stats: \n Blood is the measure of your fight or flight instincts. It tells us how tough, dangerous, coiled, and quick to act your character is in a perilous situation.\n Heart is the sum of your passion, charm, and charisma. It tells us how proficient your character is at getting what they want through negotiation and persuasion.\n Mind is a reflection of your critical thinking and analysis. It tells us how perceptive your character can be and how good they are at manipulating others through deceit.\n Spirit is a gauge of your connection to the \u201cother\u201d and your force of will. It tells us how focused your character is under pressure and what kind of power they can unleash.\nEach stat is ranked from -3 to +3. You add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you turn to violence, you roll 2d6 + Blood.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things go your way! If you get a 7-9, you get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next as things spiral out of control. \nUrban Shadows has basic moves for all the usual conflicts in urban fantasy\u2014fighting, lying, escaping, magic, and more\u2014along with special moves for managing debts and your relationships with communities at large.  \nThe city is a fierce cesspool of politics and corruption, but there are clear connections and boundaries between like-minded residents, spheres of influence that make up the scope of politics within the city. Most call these divisions Circles, loose political groupings that illustrate the differing affiliations and loyalties in the world, each one a community with its own internal politics and dramas. The Circles are:\nIn addition to the main stats, each character also has ratings (from -3 to +3) for their Circles, measures of how well the character understands each specific community. A character with a high rating in a Circle has contacts and connections within it, and can easily interpret its political information; a character with a low rating in a Circle doesn\u2019t understand how that Circle works or who the power players are within that community.\nCircles aren\u2019t organizations or formal alliances; they are more like broad communities or subcultures. The disagreement between two members of the same Circle may be as\u2014or more\u2014intense than any conflict between two differing spheres. A werewolf and a vampire both hail from Night, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get along. It only means they understand each other...and the violence inherent in the language of their streets.\nYet there are factions within each Circle capable of acting in unison, alliances who can shape the city\u2019s future\u2014werewolf packs, witch covens, faerie courts, and more. In Urban Shadows: Second Edition, we\u2019re giving GMs new tools to support those factions in a \u201cfaction turn\u201d between sessions. We\u2019re also giving players new tools to get stuff done in downtime, acting on the rumors they heard about what the factions have done in the past week or two of offscreen activity, all fueling the drama of the city and the power players have to shape the setting.\nUrban Shadows uses archetypes (The Wolf, The Wizard, The Oracle, etc.) to help players create characters quickly and easily. These archetypes are only ever a starting point; you can always bring in different myths, legends, and ideas to make your character entirely your own.\nCharacters often acquire abilities and powers from other archetypes and may even change archetypes over the course of play. As your character advances, you may also find reasons to retire to safety, securing that character\u2019s place in the city as you create a new character to continue your group's story.  \nAbsolute power...corrupts absolutely. Urban Shadows features a dynamic corruption mechanic, tracking your character's descent into darkness. When you take a life, give in to your monstrous nature, or cross a line you shouldn't cross, you mark corruption. As you gain corruption, you unlock new and potent powers, allowing your character to get what they want\u2014at the cost of further corruption. The dark side of your nature bears productive fruit.\nPower is never free, though. Cross the line too often and you lose your character to the darkness, handing them over to the GM for them to play as a threat. Corruption is a downward spiral threatening to push you over the edge, and not everyone is cut out to make it back from the brink. As your character gains new abilities fueled by the growing darkness within, you face a difficult choice: will you give up what you've gained to save yourself? \nCorruption also encourages you to play to your archetype. Each archetype contains unique boundaries and taboos that define when you mark corruption. Life is always sacred, but werewolves, mages, and faeries all face unique temptations while stalking the city's streets.\nCities are giant, complex networks of interconnected communities caught in an almost constant state of change. In order to focus your characters\u2019 conflicts and provide reasons for the players to consistently play together across those spaces, Urban Shadows 2E uses City Hubs\u2014dynamic sections of urban life that frame the story you\u2019re telling together without cutting you off from the rest of the city\u2019s potential.\nA City Hub isn\u2019t just a physical district or area of your city. Instead, each Hub is a collection of institutions, relationships, and anchors\u2014important NPCs\u2014that create a background for the action in your story. Even better, Hubs can be added over the length of a campaign, expanding the city with new locations, conflicts, and NPCs as your story progresses. \nUrban Shadows 2E features four City Hubs, each dominated by one of the four Circles:\nCity Hall (Mortalis)\nDowntown (Night)\nThe University (Power)\nThe Arts District (Wild)\nPerhaps your Tainted is a student at the local university, the same campus that lies within the Wolf\u2019s territory...and the same institution at which the Wizard recently started working as a professor. Or maybe your Oracle has an occult bookstore downtown in the same office building in which the Sworn is regularly summoned to meet with the wizard\u2019s council, just down the street from the family restaurant in which the Aware still waits tables.\nHubs are also a flexible tool for structuring your campaign as a whole. You can use two different Hubs set in the same city for different campaigns, you can grab elements from any Hub to use as inspiration for your campaign, or you can expand your campaign to include new Hubs as your city grows. We\u2019ll release new Hubs through this campaign as stretch goals and as digital supplements after the Kickstarter.\nPeople have been playing Urban Shadows since 2013, and we love the stories they\u2019ve told during that time.

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nThe Game of Deep Space Adventure\nThe second game in the Escape the Dark series, Escape the Dark Sector is a simple, sci-fi adventure game for 1 to 4 players with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation. It takes just a few minutes to set up, lasts around 45 minutes, and each mission is randomly generated so no two games are ever the same.\nPlaying as the beleaguered crew of an impounded starship, players find themselves confined to the detention block of a vast space station. Using a variety of advanced gear and weaponry, they will embark on a desperate mission to find their ship and blast their way home.\nAlong the way, the crew will have to overcome a variety of dangers, traps, and terrors. From cyborg guards and faulty replicators to killer alien organisms, with each challenge represented by a large, lavishly illustrated chapter card.\nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of tactical dice combat and timely use of item cards to complete them.\nThe goal of the game is to recover your starship by completing every chapter in the mission deck and defeating the final boss. To win, you must keep each member of the crew alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately.\nRead:\n\"A blast from start to finish - 5/5\u201d -WhatCulture\n\"An awesome box full of Space Drama!

At the end of the campaign you'll be given access to our pledge manager, Backerkit, which allows you to see exactly how much you pledged, add more funds if you wish, and then browse the following items in your own time to select exactly which ones you want to get.\nImportant note:\nOrdering add-ons may in some cases increase shipping costs beyond the estimates shown on the charts in our Shipping section. We'll calculate your shipping total in Backerkit at the end of the campaign (based on the total weight of your order).\nImportant note: \nMany of the items in this section are already available for immediate shipping on our website (excluding bundles). If you order these items as add-ons they will ship with your pledge rewards when this campaign fulfils in 2021 so that everything arrives together. \nAdd-ons for Escape the Dark Sector\nPlanning on getting a Level 4 or Level 5 pledge?

We've now shipped over 40,000 Blinks games, sold out at every major convention, and now we're back with more games! \nWhat is Blinks?\nThis is a Blink. An intelligent game piece that responds to touch, is magnetic, and communicates with neighbors. Each Blink knows a single game.  \nGetting started is easy. Just grab your Blink, choose your game, and connect them together to get started in seconds. \nBlinks teach each other and learn how to play games together\nJump right in with the fast fun timing games like Darkball, or Puzzle101, along with 9 other games included with the Blinks Game System. Games for every style of gamer.\nWhat is the Blinks Game System?\nThe Blinks System is 9 of the most popular Blinks games and everything you need to start playing. All of these games play great with 9 Blinks out of the box and expand in difficulty and fun when combined with more Blinks, such as the Epic Bundle.\nGAMES Included: \nAstro  An asteroid field rich with rare space ore awaits you. Can you collect enough to fill your cargo hold before your competition does?\nDarkball is Pong for the Blinks Game System. Players put their timing to the test against a speedy disappearing ball and each other. \nGroup Therapy It's your job to get these Blinks what they need most: extraverts want neighbors, introverts need their space.

Each round, you\u2019ll secretly hide your traps before putting the map together. After that, it\u2019s an all-out bidding war to see who can tip-toe the furthest around the volcano \u2014 without getting burned.\n\nAfraid of the dark? No worries, this is Blinks' first truly cooperative game. Work together to hunt Ghosts with your saber-like flashlight and rid the mansion of evil spirits. When ghouls appear, you must work together to make them disappear.\n\nBubble, bubble, boil and... It\u2019s your first day attending Alabaster\u2019s School of Alchemy and Potions. Can you match the potions to create the most magical brew? This is a chain-reaction frenzy unlike any Match3 game you've played.\n\nStay in the arena to stay in the game. Two teams enter a strategic battlefield, only one will leave victorious. Muster an army by creating a unique formation of Blinks and take on your opponent in a turn-based brawl. Protect the crown, your life depends on it. \n\nYou are a gem-hungry archaeologist who has finally uncovered a long rumored ancient treasure chamber. Glorious riches await you, but not without their challenges. In this, first-of-its-kind stacking game, Ancient mechanisms redirect falling treasure, how much can you collect in your treasure chest without it all coming tumbling down?\n\nTha\u2022lasso\u2022phobia: (n.) A deathly fear of the ocean\u2019s depths, and for good reason. You are a diver exploring an underwater grotto when your oxygen tank springs a leak.

I was simulating natural systems such as swarm behavior like a flock of birds, ant colonies, or fireflies and forest fires. I designed little hexagonal tiles that could think for themselves, respond to touch, and communicate with each other.\nMy fellow lab mates asked if they could design games for the platform. I agreed to a short game jam session and in under 3 hours, we had designed the first game for Blinks, Fracture. It went on to be a finalist at IndieCade. This is how it all began.\nWe couldn't be more excited to have you join the Blinks Community!\n-Jonathan + the Move38 team\n\nSocial Media #playblinks\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/move38inc/ \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/move38inc \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/move38 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/move38inc \nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/move38inc \nBoard Game Geek: http://move38.com/bgg \n\nPress Materials\nWant to review Blinks for your publication or channel?

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Please help Dr Finn's Games publish a new expansion pack for The Little Flower Shop and reprint some older promotional packs for this light and breezy card drafting card game. In The Little Flower Shop, you create a beautiful display in your flower shop window.  Before describing the promotional packs available in this campaign, I'll tell you a little about the base game. \nThe Little Flower Shop is a simple game to learn, especially if you are already familiar with \"pick and pass\" card drafting games. Despite its ease of play, you must make a surprising number of interesting decisions.  And, by the end, you'll have a pretty flower shop window to admire.\nThe game lasts 3 rounds. Players begin each round with 7 cards, they choose 1 to keep and play, then pass the remaining cards to another player.  From the received 6 cards, they choose another and pass the rest. Play continues in this fashion until all cards have been used and a new round begins. The cards include vases, flowers, hanging baskets, money, and orders. The primary goal is to find flowers and vases that match and to earn money to buy and hang baskets. The player who best maximizes their shop window earns the most flower power  and thereby wins the game.\nIn this campaign, there are 4 different promo packs available: Employee Pack, Potpourri Pack, Mini-Pack, and Flower-Filler Pack. All the promo packs available here are compatible with each other and may be mixed and matched to your liking. \n\n5th Player Pack Add-On\nThe game is for 1-4 players, but you can add $12 for a 5th player pack (if you're in the U.S.).  It contains an additional player board, 3 starting vase cards, and additional cards to add to the deck.  If you are outside the U.S., please contact me directly for it, but the shipping alone would likely be more than $20.  The pack itself is $8 + shipping.\nSend your employee to the warehouse to grab what you need for your window display! The Employee Pack is a brand new expansion  containing 10 \"employee\" cards and 2 rule cards. At the start of the game, remove 10 random shop cards and replace them with the 10 employee cards.  With the 10 removed cards, flip 4 of them to make the \"warehouse.\" At the end of each round, players who kept employee cards during the round can now discard them to take a card from the warehouse (and flip a new one to replace the chosen one).  If multiple players have employee cards, they take turns in order on the cards - so watch out that someone else doesn't take the card you were eyeing!\nThe number 1 employee card\nThe Potpourri Pack adds an interesting twist with the simple addition of 12 potpourri cards.  At the start of the game, each player receives 3 potpourri cards.  Using the same drafting mechanic as the base game, players pick a card and pass, then pick another and pass.  After the second pass, each player has 3 potpourri cards, which provide opportunities to earn money or increase their flower power.\n\nSome potpourri cards give you specific goals to gain a benefit.  For example, one card says: If you hang 3 baskets during the game, score 1 additional flower power.  Other cards give you a special power, such as: Discard 2 cards and draw 2 cards.\nPotpourri cards\nThe Potpourri Pack is essentially an advanced variant to the base game. Since The Little Flower Shop is best categorized as a \"gateway\" game (i.e., a good introduction to strategy board games for non-gamers), this variant pack is a perfect next step to introduce more strategic thinking, without overwhelming new gamers.  Of course, The Little Flower Shop is also a fun diversion for those who prefer heavier games, but want a quick gaming experience requiring some interesting decisions.\nImportant note: the rulebook is provided only in PDF form.\nThe Mini-Pack is a 4-card expansion that includes 4 copies of the same card (i.e., the \"surprise\" card). The surprise cards are shuffled into  the shop card deck and mat be pick as normal. Whenever you take a surprise card, you discard it and draw a random card, which you keep and play in its place.\nmini-pack\n\nNOTE:  Although the Mini-Pack cards are manufactured by the same manufacturer, there may be some slight differences in card texture and colors, since it is a different print run.  For gameplay, this really should not make a huge difference. A discerning eye might be able to see that one of these cards is in a hand, but because all the cards are continually passed, it's does not have any real strategic impact. Also, just remember this is a light and fun game!\nThe Flower-Filler Pack was offered during the original campaign for The Little Flower Shop. The pack has 8 cards: 4 flower bonus cards, 3 filler bonus cards, plus 1 rules card.  At the game's start, a bonus card of each type is flipped showing the popular flower and filler for the game. Players score bonus flower power for displaying the popular flowers and fillers in their windows. \nFlower-filler pack\nNone of the packs have proper packaging.  They are mailed together in a protective plastic sleeve (similar to a baseball card protector), so they are not loose. For the packs, then,  you are receiving just the cards with no packaging.\nThe Little Flower Shop has received very positive reviews from well-established game reviewers, as seen below.\nAll items will be shipped from the U.S.  Packs are mailed through U.S. postal service first class mail, while the Little Flower Shop games will be through Amazon. \n\nFor those outside the U.S. - I apologize that the base game is not available to you;  the shipping charges are just too high.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease read carefully before backing this project.\n\nNO PLEDGE MANAGER\nDr. Finn will not be using a pledge manager for this campaign. All information will be collected through the Kickstarter surveys after the campaign and a system for payment for late add-ons may be created through Dr. Finn's Games' website.\n\nPRODUCTION RISKS\nGame manufacturing and publishing contains a number of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the packs will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threats in this regard concern quality control over the manufacturing and delivery delays. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, I will be using a manufacturer who has produced great results on projects in the past. Second, I have successfully completed almost all of my Kickstarter campaigns right on time or even early (only 1 project was a few weeks late). If any delays do unexpectedly occur, backers will be notified promptly.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\nIf you receive any rewards that are missing items, please contact me at doctorfinns@gmail.com and replacements will be promptly shipped. If the item arrives damaged, you'll receive replacements for whatever is damaged. Please send along a picture, as I may be able to get reimbursed from the shipper. For the past few projects (after switching manufacturers and shipping companies), we've had a very low defect rate (less than 1%).\n\nREFUNDS\nRefunds are not given, unless there is a failure to deliver the items you've requested. However, if you are completely unsatisfied with any game, please contact me and we can discuss it.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\nUnlike many Kickstarter campaigns, Dr. Finn's Games has a great track record of being on time. Of course, unexpected things happen and there is chance that the game will not be shipped on time. I will keep you updated if the unexpected happens.\n\nUNDELIVERED ITEMS\nIf you provide an incorrect address or fail to update your address and a shipment is returned, it is your responsibility to pay for the re-shipment. If the items are lost as a result, you would also need to pay for the items.\n\nSHIPPING\nPlease read the shipping section in the campaign page.\n\nUPDATES\nAfter this campaign you may receive updates on Dr. Finn's Games' other projects.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "*desperately* click! click!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians battle the Lady of Chains when her enforcers march down from the frosty north. They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady?

Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Just a Taste", "descp": "All backers at $10 and up get immediate access to the fully playable prototype PDF.

But we didn't make any extra copies, so it's been out of print since then, despite lots of people wanting a physical edition. This project is a way to gather the funds we need to do a second print run.\nWe've worked with Mina McJanda to redesign the book down to a more portable A5 format (she did the layout on Heart, Lancer and Voidheart Symphony, so you know she's good). We're having the book litho-printed, rather than digitally printed on demand like the previous run, which allows us far more control over the quality of the paper and binding and lets us make a book that will last for years to come.\nWe've been through the text, removed errors, corrected spelling mistakes, tightened up some wording and generally made the entire thing easier to read and play. We're using the same brilliant art by Adrian Stone as the original print, because look at it.\nWe\u2019ve also included the two themed supplements written as part of the original Kickstarter - Cyberpunk and Urban Horror - into the core book as appendices. These each come with a new core, two new traits, and a new hierarchy of adversaries.\nEverything's ready to go. You'll get your PDF as soon as the money comes through to us, and we'll go to print as soon after that as possible. We're aiming to get the books to you before Christmas.\nIf you already own a copy of Unbound (digital or physical), you can have a free copy of the redesigned PDF as soon as it's released. We'll update the PDF to the new version everywhere we sell it, and if you got it via our previous Kickstarter, we'll be distributing the new version via the original Backerkit to the email address you used then. If you don't have access to that any more, drop us a line at admin@rowanrookanddecard.com and we'll sort you out.  \nIS IT ANY GOOD?\nYes! But don't just take our word for it:\n\"There are so many things that grab you about Unbound: fantastic world-building tools, super clever way the cards are used.  But honestly the stand out is how you make a party that is bound together but allows the characters to spin off into their own special thing.  Just magical!\" - Becky Annison, author of Lovecraftesque and Bite Marks \n\"Unbound is everything we\u2019ve come to expect from the team at Rowan, Rook and Decard - a blend of outrageous creativity and innovative but intuitive mechanics presented with style and polish. Bursting with ideas and advice for worlds, stories and gameplay, Unbound really is the RPG that can claim the only limit is your imagination.\" - Gav Thorpe, Games Workshop luminary\n\"Unbound has a great combination of action and drama - it's tactical enough to get your teeth into, but cinematic enough that you don't get bogged down in the mechanics and always have a chance to do something cool.\" - Joanna Piancastelli,  Golden Cobra live games award winner\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nUnbound is designed to give you and your group the agency, inspiration and encouragement to build your own world and fill it with exciting stories. As the players make characters, they and the GM will answer questions relating to their chosen abilities that sketch out the rest of the world, the heroes' goals, the opposition in their path, and what stands to happen if they fail.\nFirst, the group picks a CORE - an overall identity for the party - such as Warrior, Devout, Outlaw, or Wild. The core dictates the overall campaign arc (i.e. who the player characters are and what they're doing) as well as giving players a shared ability - the way in which they recover health in combat.\nThe Pactbound core lets the players tell stories about characters who draw power from otherworldly sources\nEach player then picks a ROLE. Anyone familiar with roleplaying games, either traditional or digital, will be familiar with these - the long-ranged Deadeye, the tough and dependable Warden, the supportive Protector, and so on. The role comes with a set of capabilities and a choice of abilities that give the character a niche within the party when it comes to combat.\nThe Striker is dangerous, but fragile\nFinally, each player chooses a  TRAIT. This is a specialty that sets them apart from others of their role, and they're things like Shadows, Spirit, Transform, Dirty Fighting, and so on. As well as giving them a useful ability in a fight, they'll help populate the world around the player characters with friends, enemies, locations and events that lend weight to the campaign by answering questions attached to the choices they\u2019ve made.\nThe Companion trait lets you bring a loyal ally into battle\nThe questions in the CORE, ROLE and TRAIT tie together with touchstones - key concepts that the players select and then collaboratively build into the bare bones of a setting - to ensure that every game of Unbound has, by default, a set of unique characters in a fascinating world full of adventure hooks.\nAll told, this makes for the best session zero you'll ever have. Each campaign of Unbound begins with the players ready and raring to go, eager to explore (and possibly destroy) the world they've just imagined - and with our unique advancement system that rewards players for completing scenes and objectives of their own creation, the GM doesn't have to do any prep to make it happen.\nWHAT ARE THE RULES?\nUnbound uses one set of standard playing cards per player - at the core of it, each party involved in a challenge draws a card and whoever draws highest wins, but there's a bit more to it in practice.\nAs you play, you'll personalise your character deck so it reflects where your character's been and what they've done by writing down important events and damaging scars on the cards themselves. Your deck is as important as your character sheet when it comes to describing your character.\nMina has created useful diagrams that explain the game's mechanics\nThe combat system is designed to provide a mix of abstraction - letting players get creative and exciting with their descriptions - with tactical action. Player characters and adversaries occupy AREAS that are, in essence, individual locations that it's interesting to have a fight in. Moving between these areas, pushing and pulling enemies, and setting up interesting combinations of abilities forms the crux of combat in Unbound.\nMaps are made up of areas and connections to keep combat flowing smoothly\nWe've also created more than fifty adversaries for your players to take down, and every single one of them has an interesting ability or quirk that marks them out from others of their kind. There are big bruisers who storm around the battlefield smashing apart obstacles in their path; there are grim killers who disguise themselves as their minions; there are critters that grab on to your leg teeth-first and refuse to let go until you shake them off. What's more, almost all adversary abilities are triggered by a series of memorable player actions, so the GM doesn't have to memorise each one to run them in a fight.\n CAN I LISTEN TO AN ACTUAL PLAY OF IT? \nYou can! We got together with our friends Becky Annison, Kieron Gillen and Sharang Biswas to play through the character creation and world building for a brand new campaign. You can listen to STONEGRAVE here.\n WHAT SORT OF CHARACTERS CAN WE BE?\nUnbound not only allows, but encourages, wild creativity on the part of players. Sure, you can play a dude with a sword if you'd like - and you'll probably have fun doing so.  But working from the basic ideas laid out in character creation and using the abstraction that Unbound affords, we've had some truly unusual characters.\nWant to play five wolves? You can do that. Want your special weapon to be a truck that screeches in and runs over your enemies? Sure! Want to never lift a finger but be defended by a cadre of armoured battle nuns? Go for it! These are all player characters we've had in sessions of Unbound, and that's just the games that we've run ourselves. If your players are chafing against restrictions in other roleplaying games, Unbound might just be the RPG for them.\nHOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?\nUnbound is a game about big, bold short-burn stories that don't outstay their welcome - the standard campaign length is around five to six games of a few hours each, and groups are encouraged to explore the same world from different angles with multiple arcs that use entirely new characters. (For example: we ran a Cyberpunk game where the players failed to overthrow the evil corporation in the final scene, so the following campaign took place 10 years afterwards as the characters' children dealt with the war that the corporation brought to their homeland.) Ultimately, it's up to you and your group, but we've found that shorter story arcs are much easier to plan around and execute - so we've written a system that supports them.\nWHAT CAN I GET?\nThis is a no-frills Kickstarter designed to gather funds to allow us to print a product that's all ready to go. You can get a PDF of the updated design of Unbound, or you can get a softcover edition with a PDF included for free. \nThis campaign is an experiment to see if we can justify the cost of doing a print run and redesign on the games that we developed before Spire - the title we're best known for. We've set the funding goal for two weeks because we don't intend to have this become a huge project, but instead to get physical books into the hands of people that want them.\nWHO ARE YOU?\nFrom left to right: Decard, Rowan, Rook\nWe're Rowan, Rook and Decard. (Or: Mary Hamilton, Grant Howitt, and Chris Taylor.) We're a UK roleplaying design studio based in London and Sheffield, and we make some of the best games on the market because we care about good writing, strong mechanics, excellent art, books built to last and paying everyone involved a fair wage. (We are a Living Wage Employer and we say so with pride.)\nWe've published more than a dozen roleplaying corebooks and supplements in the past, including short ones like Honey Heist, Crash Pandas and the Witch Is Dead and long ones like Spire, Heart and Royal Blood. We really care about what we do, and we're really good at it too.

Our goal for shipping to backers outside of these regions is to provide the most cost-effective option without sacrificing quality.\nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, and South/Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these regions.

The only way for retailers to acquire any of these items will be through this Kickstarter.\n\n\nSome of our license partners will eventually publish our games in their own language.

One of the biggest things is how variable the cost of shipping can be. As such, we will be charging shipping after this Kickstarter concludes, according to the actual costs incurred to ship to your area. We will do this through the pledge manager system once this Kickstarter has concluded.\nThere are two reasons we do this. First, it allows us to provide a lower rate on the actual pledge levels and structure a much tighter budget for the campaign and stretch goals since we do not have to estimate shipping costs. Second, the funds raised for the project are 100% for the actual project itself rather than being partially inflated by shipping costs that may not be accurate. Though the pricing will vary due to any add-ons you pledge for by the end of the campaign, these are our closest estimates for shipping, based on region  region this year.\nIf you live in the regions where we offer \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d, you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties. These numbers are based on regional averages, and are subject to change. Unfortunately, import laws and customs have made it impossible for us to ship to Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nTimeline for Fulfillment - What to expect\nOnce mass production is complete, shipping from the manufacturer to the fulfillment centers in the US and Europe takes about 8 weeks, followed by 3 weeks of set up time before shipping to all backers in the US and Europe begins. From manufacturer to our Chinese based fulfillment center, it takes about 4 week followed by 4 weeks of setup time before shipping to all backers begins. Note, these times are only estimates based on information from the fulfillment centers.\nWe are pleased to work with these companies to bring this project to life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project produced overseas, there can be unforeseen production delays, shipping delays, and customs delays. So we've learned all about delays and ways to manage or avoid them. We know that some delays can\u2019t be predicted or avoided, so we plan extra room in our schedule. This way we can give you the best estimate for the day we can get our game into your hands- because we want to ship our products as much as you want to receive them!

Its interactive storyline is based on an innovative playing system, in which you, the player, will take all the decisions, but the Fate will help or hinder you in an unpredictable way. \nEach Arkham Archives chapter is unique, since it comes with finely designed, Made in Italy collector's items. \"The Limestone Abyss\", for example, features a custom poker card deck, illustrated with amazing Lovecraftian artworks by the Italian artist Francesco Crisci. The traces left by Cthulhu, Dagon, Azathoth and the other cosmic horrors wait for you in the clues you will find in the Archives.  \nIt was 1932 when the first file marked with a \"top secret\" label was deposited in the Arkham Archives. During the years, the police had to face so many unspeakable events that even the harshest of the officers had to pay a visit to the Arkham Sanitarium. Now, the Archives are abandoned, just like the city itself, and the memory of these events is now sleeping under a blanket of dust and mold stench.\nIt seems, however, that one single person is able to link all these nightmares with a subtle red thread. While her or his name is still unknown, we soon find out she or he can possess the people who were touched by the cosmic horror. \nIn the first chapter, \"The Limestone Abyss\", you will be thrown into the mind of Jack, an experienced archaeologist, who finds himself involved in a horror as old as the Earth itself. As soon as you start to understand that you have a full control on Jack's thoughts and actions, you also realize that you will have to face the monsters lurking in the depths of the Abyss... alone.  \nThe stars of the first chapter of \"Arkham Archives\" are our gamebook and the poker cards deck.\nThe gamebook \"The Limestone Abyss\" is nearly 200 pages long and it offers a wide, immersive storyline in an environment you will be able to explore completely. Your actions will determine the course of the adventure; if you are smart and wise enough, you'll make it until the final showdown; otherwise, the horrors along the way will kill you... or worse.\nThe storyline is written by Samuele Zanotti and the artwork in it has been realized by Davide Molino, two of the project founders.  \nThe gamebook and the cards are meant to be together. The game system featured in \"Arkham Archives\", in fact, uses a poker cards deck to determine elements like events, fatigue, outcomes and, of course, your madness level. The cards feature original artworks representing the entities that obliterated Arkham and its people at the end of XIX century: you will find Azathoth, Nyarlathotep, Dagon and, of course, Cthulhu. \nThe two objects are accompanied by side elements in some bids: for example, the Ouija cardboard is used to place the cards, and the hard paper tokens can remind you the items you have got with you. \nWe though of some prizes that we really want to share with you, in addition to what we already put inside the different bid tiers. Fingers crossed and let's hope to match them all:  \nAnd we also added a bunch of fantastic rewards if you help us grow our community on the most popular social networks. The two social goals are alternatives: we will consider the goal unlocked if we get at least one of the two numbers described.\n\n\n Each of the 4 chapters in the Arkham Archives storyline will be narrated in a gamebook, both a paper tome and a digital ebook. Most importantly, each chapter features a different Made in Italy, exclusive object.\nAll of them will be launched here on Kickstarter, so be sure not to miss them! \n\"The Limestone Abyss\" is the first adventure of a long series, so expect hours and hours of fun and thrill while you explore the world of H. P. Lovecraft from a completely new perspective. The story is structured as a one-shot though, so you'll experience a complete and satisfying adventure even if you won't there to order the next chapters.\nThere is much more to be seen in the next releases, and brand new Made in Italy, finely designed objects wait for you with the following chapters.\nWe also have a special gift for you. You will soon be able to play a gamebook demo that will let you explore the world of the Arkham Archives whenever you want!\nIn the meantime, you can play an interactive prequel at the link below: it will drag you into the terrifying atmosphere of the '50 Arkham, right when the Cosmic Entities started appearing again in the life of human beings.\nYou will find the interactive story here.\nIf you speak Italian, there is a translated demo already here.\nStay tuned, follow us on our social networks and be among the first backers! And remember: a fantastic early bid awaits you if you'll be here on day 1!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent a lot of time planning the production process in the details, so there is no risk of being late in delivering the project. Of course, unplanned or problematic events might still happen, but in that case, we'd make sure to notice all the bidders as soon as the issue emerges. \n\nShippings, as always, are a risk though.

We've been creating escape games and mystery games since 2015.\nKauai Escape Room was ranked a Top 100 escape room in the world in 2019!\nSociety Of Curiosities launched in 2020 and has already published 5 adventures to great acclaim in the mystery game industry!\nHow we got started\nWe got into the game and puzzle industry the old-fashioned way: by accident!\nWe played an escape room in 2015 in Montreal and loved it. So we played a few more. Soon, we were designing puzzles and building full-scale escape rooms for our friends in our home and 30-foot airstream trailer.\nEventually, Michelle made the suggestion to go commercial and open a physical escape room business. Yacine didn't think it was such a great idea but agreed to set up a fake website with fake escape games \"to prove her wrong\".\nOf course, she was right.\nWithin a few days, people were finding the fake website and trying to book our fake escape games! Fast-forward a few months and Kauai Escape Room opened its doors.\nOver the last 5 years we have designed and built 10 escape games and also created and launched 5 play-at-home mystery games.\nYacine Merzouk\nYacine has been a tabletop and strategy game enthusiast and designer since high school.\nThis hobby culminated into a few years running an award-winning D&D blog, the publication of 2 RPG books, and a stint freelancing for Wizards of the Coast.\nFrom there, it was a natural jump to take these storytelling skills to the escape room and mystery game worlds.\nHe enjoys long walks on the beach with his dog and generally has a tendency to adopt too many pets from the Humane Society.\nMichelle Rundbaken\nMichelle is a master storyteller and the driver of the artistic vision for our games \u2014 always polishing minute details of the stories and adventures she designs for her audience.\nShe channels her background in psychology, education, and film to craft delightful experiences and puzzles that are challenging but never overstay their welcome.\nFive years of escape room design taught her there's always room for a sprinkling of magic and delight.\nHer ideal day consists of reading in bed with a steaming cup of tea. Cuddling a cat is a bonus. \nTop 100 escape rooms in the world\nThe game design team of The Fairy Tale Files received a Top 100 Escape Room In The World award for their creations at Kauai Escape Room.\nReviews of our other games\nRead the Society of Curiosities reviews from Esc Room Addict, Escape Mattster, ESCAPETHEROOMers, Escape Adventurer, Escape The Review, Review The Room UK, Armchair Escapist, and Escape Mattster (again).\nRead the Kauai Escape Room reviews 5\u2605 on Google, 5\u2605 on Yelp, 5\u2605 on TripAdvisor, and 5\u2605 on Facebook.\nPodcast interviews - listen to Yacine and Michelle discuss game design:\nESCAPETHEROOMers presents: Behind the Masterminds\nThe Puzzlemaker:  Experience Design - Novelty, Narrative and Surprise\nShipping will be added on AFTER the Kickstarter concludes.  \nWe ship to all countries, but please note that the games are only available in English.\n--\nRATES FOR SINGLE GAME\nIf you backed a single game, or if you choose to have the games shipped as they are released, these are the shipping options for each shipment.\nUSA, with tracking - $3.50\nWorldwide, with tracking - $10.50\nWorldwide, without tracking (regular mail) - $4.50\n--\nRATES FOR 4-GAME PACK\nIf you choose to have all 4 games shipped together, they will ship as the last game is released, which is estimated to be November 2021.\nUSA, with tracking - $5.70\nWorldwide, with tracking - $15.95\n--\nRATES FOR COLLECTOR'S EDITION\nIf you choose to have the games shipped as they are released, the collector's edition box will be shipped with the first game, so this is the shipping rate for your first shipment (following shipments will use the single game rates):\nUSA, with tracking - $5.70\nWorldwide, with tracking - $15.95\n--\nIf you choose to have all 4 games shipped together, this is the shipping rate:\nUSA, with tracking - $5.70\nWorldwide, with tracking - $15.95\n--\nRATES FOR COLLECTOR'S EDITION (BATCH #2)\nIf you choose to have the games shipped as they are released, the collector's edition box will be shipped with the first game, so this is the shipping rate for your first shipment (following shipments will use the single game rates):\nUSA, with tracking - $5.95\nWorldwide, with tracking - $15.95\n--\nIf you choose to have all 4 games shipped together, this is the shipping rate:\nUSA, with tracking - $8.90\nWorldwide, with tracking - $17.95", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAssembly and Fulfillment: Should the amount of orders significantly exceed our expectations, we will need to hire out assembly and fulfillment instead of doing everything in-house. \n\nBudget: We're creating a play at home mystery game with an entry level price point.

Miles is a renowned oncologist, hired to heal a sick billionaire in secret. (Why in secret? Because they don't want to panic the investors.) Gail is an archaeologist, leading an expedition to the deadliest depths of Antarctica in search of evidence that everything commonly accepted about prehistory is a lie.\nGail and Miles never meet, but both push science far beyond its limits, into deadly realms of cosmic horror. Both uncover truths new to science, but ancient when humanity was in its infancy.\nA New Novel from Greg Stolze\nIf you've read Mask of the Other, or You: A Fiction, or Switchflipped or The Forgotten Monk, you should have some idea what kind of stories I'm capable of telling. You can expect this to have relatable but desperate characters making understandable but bad decisions. You can expect people to suffer, and to overcome it. You can expect the strange, the ugly, the bizarre, and perhaps the small moments of grace that can arise when misery is transcended.\nOr you can just go read from my free online fiction library, that should let you know if it's to your taste or not. The stories most similar to GOD CANCER are probably  How to Make A Book Safe, Specimens, and The Grey People.\nThe tangible version of GOD CANCER is a softback print-on-demand book, produced via DriveThruFiction. It's about 260 pages, not counting the afterword. \nThe Tangible Rewards\nAs you can see from the examples in the photo, the linocut prints are done, there are three different designs, and I've done a lot of experimentation with color, paper and other aspects of production. They're all 6x9 inches or a little smaller, handmade, and I've done 107 of them. If you pledge at the linocut level, you get one picked pretty much at random. (The ones that, for whatever reason, I deem \"not so great\" will get sent out last.) I believe there are slightly more of the skulls. \nThere aren't many patches left, so if you want one, don't delay. They're four inches in diameter.\nUPDATE: A Preview Reader Weighs In!\nSpoilers: He says nice stuff about the book.\n-G.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe patches are in hand, and the prints are made.

Can you work together to keep the ship flying, or will you die in space?\n Six-Sided Slayers - In this cooperative game, you and the other players take on classic adventurer roles and charge deep into the monster\u2019s lair.

In the war for survival, it does not matter what your creed, color, culture or gender is \u2013 all stand together. But as the Revolution has begun, something far more mysterious stirs. Agents of the occult entreat both the Rebel Continental Army and Loyalist Red Coats. Freemasons conspire in the City of Brotherly Love. Maryland is in the throes of a witch hunt by the Knights Templar. Amid the chaos, other grim fairy tales have emerged.\nThe cover art depicts a young, powerful Black woman leading the charge with sabre and flag, as an older Indigenous soldier prepares their musket and a Colonial militiaman fires a Pennsylvania long rifle. British Loyalists stand at the left-hand side of the conflict.\nReports of witches have been seen in the Great Dismal Swamp. Indigenous sachem say that devils called Manitou walk among the living. Flesh-gobbling ghouls have been tunneling beneath Boston. The Pine Barrens of New Jersey are haunted by what the locals call the \"Leeds Devil\".\nIn this game, most people have either chosen to deny the supernatural or rationalize it away. A rare few accept it for what it is and act. You are among those heroes, and are destined for greatness\u2026 or death. \nWelcome to Flames of Freedom, where your grim & perilous tale hangs in the balance!\nFlames of Freedom & Every Stretch Goal Unlocked ($200k) Mock-up\n\n Flames of Freedom is an American gothic horror RPG, powered by the Zweihander RPG d100 game engine. Intensely researched by Richard Iorio and developed by a diverse group of game designers, this game explores a range of cultures beyond the history of Europeans in North America. Developed with Black cultural consultants in key decision-making roles, interwoven with Indigenous writers of the nations represented in the work and guided by RPG safety and trauma experts, this game will show that colonial horror can be represented in a mature way.\nClick to enlarge\nThis game represents a melange of heritages and conflicting beliefs, one where cultures and genders outside traditional standards were equally as instrumental in fomenting and conducting the rebellion. And, although traditional games set during the Revolution place men at the fore of the conflict, Flames of Freedom calls upon the true history: one where heritage and genders outside the norm were just as important \u2013 and, oftentimes working behind the scenes \u2013 during this pivotal time in America\u2019s founding.\nIt is the dawn of the rebellion in 1776 and life is on the verge of drastic change. To some degree, the Europeans shun folklore and witchcraft as the so-called \u2018Age of Reason\u2019 is upon them. Tucked between missionaries, mutineers and midwives there are those who know they know the real truth. Sorcery \u2013 along with monsters, demons and mythological creatures \u2013 is real. \nClick to enlarge\nExperience Flames of Freedom right now by downloading the free 61 page Quickstart! It comes equipped with 32 pages of game rules, an 11 page adventure, 7 pre-generated characters, cut-out paper miniatures and a print-out map. It can be played one-on-one, but also supports up to 7 players and one Historian. The rules and adventure are designed for new gamers, providing a 2-3 hour play experience.\nDownload the free Quickstart from DriveThruRPG\nMODERN, SKILL-BASED DESIGN: This game is designed to accommodate a style of play where role-playing drives the story. The exception to this is when there are potential consequences for failure - then, and only then, is a Skill Test required to determine the outcome.\nTRAD MEETS NARRATIVE GAMEPLAY: Melded with narrative gameplay elements, this game has four modes: Chase Scenes, Combat Encounters, Overland Travel and Social Interactions. All are handled in the same way: you\u2019ll roll percentile dice using a Skill Test. Rolling equal to or under your chance of success means you succeed. Rolling over means you failed. If the dice match, something special happens - either a critical success, or critical failure.\nClick to enlarge\nLIGHT TO MEDIUM COMPLEXITY: This game embraces modern, familiar mechanics with smooth character creation and plenty of tactical depth to last a lifetime. If you have experience with games like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and Zweihander RPG, the game will feel familiar, encouraging role-playing and alternative forms of interactions before combat. \nBOUNDLESS OPTIONS: With over 84 character types, numerous cultures, tools, weapons, magic and threats to face, your adventures will take you far across North America into the very heart of supernatural darkness.\nClick to enlarge\nLet us be clear: Flames of Freedom is not a tabletop RPG where you will discriminate against women, practice slavery, slaughter innocent people or \u2018tame the wilderness\u2019 of Indigenous nations. It is a game where people come together to fend off a secret war that took root long before the American Revolutionary War. \nClick to enlarge\nFlames of Freedom is a tabletop role-playing game where you\u2019ll blaze your own path, free from outdated thinking. History certainly informs the story, but it is not meant to be completely historically accurate. This game does not endorse discrimination of any kind based on differences of the period its set in. \nClick to enlarge\nRegardless of characters' identities, there isn\u2019t any mechanical, intellectual, physical, emotional or spiritual distinctions between women, men, intersex, agender, non-binary and transgender characters, or any between cultures. This game will come equipped with ttrpg safety tools to help you navigate and embrace its positive elements while allowing you to explore its more visceral moments. We'll further deliver upon this promise across the entire Zweihander RPG game line with the release of our upcoming Touch The Darkness ttrpg safety tool.\n We have several exciting First Looks and Actual Plays for FLAMES OF FREEDOM scheduled over the next 30 days (and a couple of special extended campaign announcements after the Kickstarter ends):\n\n\nMock-up (not final)\nFlames of Freedom is unlike other tabletop RPG when it comes to quality. We lean into sustainable quality book materials, over-index on durability & aim to provide a great reader experience without skimping on premium features. Every hardback book is crafted as a collector's item and can be proudly put on display and used around the table without compromising its condition. Here's what you'll find inside:\nPremium offset hardback book\nSoft touch matte coating cover for easy grip\nReinforced plank & rounded spine, guaranteed to last\nSmythe binding, so pages never tear out\nThick, tasteful ribbon to mark your place\nChunky, matte coated interior paper (no reflections/ink bleed-thru on pages)\n\"Old school\" sepia, black & white illustrations that evoke colonial pamphlets\nOptimized information flow for an easy reading experience\nEntire UX designed using legible font types, optimized for accessibility\nInformed padding and spacing choices for those with color deficiency & dyslexic readership\nPerforated pull-out horizontal & vertical character sheets\nThe cover for Flames of Freedom is digitally painted by Ken Duquet. Ken returns as our cover artist, coming fresh off of production of our last Kickstarter Main Gauche: Grim & Perilous Supplement. Watch his progress on the cover art from concept to finish at the video below:\nReturning a 4th time to our projects is our artist-in-residence Dejan Mandic! Living as a full-time illustrator in Serbia, his exquisite drawings can be seen throughout the entire Zweihander game line. Dejan's artwork aims to be inclusive of age, body type, culture, gender, hair styles and situations for Flames of Freedom. Every single piece of interior art has been hand-drawn by Dejan, with little if any digital touch-up.\nJoining him is Amber Seger, an industry certified UX designer. Her key focus is on information design and user experience in the book. Following her breakout Twitch hit series for character sheet redesign DESIGNH\u00c4NDER, she joins our team to reexamine our layout standards from previous editions, and to reflow the entirety of Flames of Freedom. \nOur PDF will be fully screen reader accessible.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nIn Flames of Freedom, your character will be changed by the choice they make in the world. Will they become a force for the Rebel patriots or the Loyalists? Will they fall prey to the wishes of the Freemasons or the Inquisition? Will they bend their morals to parlay with the Knights Templar? There is no right or wrong answer; there are only shades of grey.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nCartographer Gabriel Brouillard has mapped out the cities, settlements and long-forgotten places of North America. His map work spans New France and Canada, south along the Thirteen Colonies, into Florida and the Caribbean. Gabriel's maps permeates the cultural sections of the book, breathing life into Flames of Freedom.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nFollowing our all-in-on approach from Zweihander RPG, Flames of Freedom will come with a player's handbook, Historian's guide, over 100 spells, a fully-illustrated bestiary of 80+ legends & threats, the setting of 1776, a 35 page adventure set during the Siege of Boston & an urban-based sandbox in and around Boston.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "!!! NEUROCRACY IS FUNDED !!!\nYou've all been so generous with your words of support, your pledges, your shout-outs, and we cannot thank you enough! All we can do is make Neurocracy the best it can possibly be, and you've made that dream a reality!\nWith our funding target met and one day left on the clock, let's talk stretch goals!\n\n!!! STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED !!!\nRight now, we\u2019re planning to use part of the Kickstarter funding for edited stock photography in order to create the images that will adorn each Omnipedia article, such as character and location shots. If we hit \u00a312,000 in pledges, we can instead work with an illustrator for the creation of digital art with a consistent style across all of Omnipedia!\nWhere appropriate, we have planned and scripted audio dramas that can be organically included in select Omnipedia articles, such as snippets from in-universe speeches or interviews, journalism podcasts, and various live broadcasts and recordings. If we sail on to \u00a315,000, we\u2019ll be able to hire actors to portray and voice Neurocracy\u2019s main characters in these audio dramas!\nWe\u2019re currently writing Neurocracy in English, but we would like to include more languages to make it accessible and culturally suitable to a wider audience. This is a costly endeavour given Omnipedia\u2019s text-heavy nature, so if the campaign makes it to \u00a320,000, we can translate each article into Spanish and Mandarin Chinese!\nWhat if you could dive into a Wikipedia rabbit hole in the year 2049 and use that information to investigate a high-profile assassination?\nThis is NEUROCRACY, an interactive narrative experience that offers an anthology of compelling sci-fi stories presented as hyperlinked articles on Omnipedia, a futuristic counterpart to Wikipedia!\nIf you want to pay a visit to 2049 right now, you can click the button at the top of the page to access a demo of Neurocracy, featuring a total of seven Omnipedia articles! Which one will come up first when you choose Random article?\nAlso, hello! We are Playthroughline, a design team consisting of Joannes Truyens (a writer of some variety) and Matei Stanca (a web developer of some renown). We're equal parts excited and excited to kick off our Kickstarter campaign for Neurocracy!\nWe wrote Neurocracy's story world with the following core premise: \"a pandemic turns temporary health measures into permanent fixtures of the surveillance state, including the monitoring of neural implants.\"\nWith current events being what they are, we decided we couldn\u2019t ignore the very real pandemic that continues to affect all our lives. As a result, Neurocracy does mention COVID-19 in minimal, purely factual ways, but its story world is specific only to the fictional pandemic we have written. That pandemic is caused by...\nCariappa-Muren disease\nThe Omnipedia article on Cariappa-Muren disease illustrates how this prion infection manages to spread through contaminated tuna for five years before it's discovered in 2039. You'll learn about the two scientists who first describe it, the aquaculture company that causes it, and how it results in the creation of a global biosecurity system known as...\nG6\nConsidering its biosecurity mandate, G6 works almost too well. It mines all data uniformly, epidemiological or otherwise, so it can be shared across borders in the event of a pandemic. It deploys neural implants equipped to diagnose the early stages of Cariappa-Muren disease, but the implants can be leveraged for other purposes too.\nNeurocracy uses Omnipedia as an omniscient narrator to filter the implications of a system like G6 down to the micro level, with different articles showing the interconnected political, social, cultural, technological, and economic implications of a world where governments have cheap and streamlined access to all their citizens' data (including their neural states).\nWho's Xu Shaoyong? Why was he a target? What's a Massachusetts?\nThe hook for diving into Omnipedia is a murder mystery, the assassination of an important public figure that throws the world of 2049 into disarray, leaving it to you to solve the many mysteries that follow. Reading the Omnipedia article of the victim offers plenty of reasons why someone might want them dead, and each one is an avenue of investigation into what has happened, and what is happening, in Neurocracy. \nNeurocracy features a rich and diverse cast of characters, each presented to you through their respective Omnipedia article. Some will have potential ties to the assassination, others play different parts in the world of 2049. Read on to meet four of them and see how they're connected!\nConnie Muren\nAfter she gave her name to the discovery of Cariappa-Muren disease and identified the neurodegenerative disorder as a novel strain of mad cow disease in 2039, Connie Muren was turned into the public face of the global effort to stop the pandemic and establish G6 in its wake. She went missing in 2040, her case eventually ruled as either an accident or a voluntary disappearance.\nXu Shaoyong\nOften referred to as China's paramount leader, Xu Shaoyong is the founder and executive chair of the multinational tech giant Zhupao. His name and company have become synonymous with the bleeding edge of AI and neural implants, resulting in the creation of G6. When he is assassinated a day before the Chinese centennial celebrations in 2049, the social order imposed by G6 is upended.\nEfua Amankwah-Crouse\nEfua Amankwah-Crouse is equated with the birth of artificial general intelligence, though she would merely claim the design of a neural network adept at abstract reasoning. She joined Zhupao in 2034 after Xu Shaoyong recognised her design as a sustainable and environment-friendly model for training AI. When he is assassinated, Efua's opposition to G6 revives a conspiracy theory that she is Adira.\nDeena Kim\nEvery day, Deena Kim has to assure people that she's really human. She works at a Zhupao service agency, where she fields calls from people who want to appeal decisions made by G6 but refuse to talk to AI-enabled chatbots. In 2049, Deena is publicly unmasked as Adira when her work terminal is linked to the assassination of Xu Shaoyong. To clear her name in the eyes of G6, she has to find the real Adira before the authorities do.\nWe like to think of Neurocracy as a hypertext game, a genre that is directly compared to browsing an encyclopedia on its Wikipedia page. Neurocracy is also something of an epistolary novel, since it presents a story in the form of a diegetic, in-universe document.\nThe document in question being Wikipedia allows us to play around with more interactive approaches, like carrying over Wikipedia's revision history to Omnipedia so we can portray an editing war! You'll be able to check multiple versions of each article, showing you what has been added, changed, and deleted as Neurocracy's story progresses.\nThese particular edits reflect the recent death of a character.\nThat story will unfold across ten episodes in a weekly release schedule, with each episode representing one day in 2049 and adding more articles to Omnipedia (while editing existing ones). A single article can tell a self-contained story (making Neurocracy a bit of an anthology), but also contribute to the overarching throughline of the assassination.\nYou will be able to experience Neurocracy on your own, but if you are so inclined, you can join forces with others to truly bring it to life! Our Discord community has been exploring the Neurocracy demo, comparing notes based on clues embedded in the Omnipedia articles, and coming away with different theories and story interpretations. In that respect, Neurocracy borrows elements from alternate reality games (or ARGs) as well, with the truth hidden between the lines.\nHeckinRobin, one of our esteemed community members, explored the Neurocracy demo on his Twitch channel and came back with a perfect encapsulation of everything we're hoping to accomplish! \nPLAY\n\nTo enhance the world of Neurocracy with different perspectives and stories, we've approached several amazing sci-fi writers who are set to contribute their own articles to Omnipedia. It is an anthology after all!\nWe're incredibly excited to be working with such talented people as...\nMalka Older is a writer, aid worker, and sociologist whose science-fiction political thriller Infomocracy was named one of the best books of 2016 by Kirkus, Book Riot, and the Washington Post. She is the creator of the serial Ninth Step Station, currently running on Serial Box, and her short story collection And Other Disasters came out in November 2019. \nShe is a Faculty Associate at Arizona State University\u2019s School for the Future of Innovation in Society and her opinions can be found in The New York Times, The Nation, Foreign Policy, and NBC THINK, among others.\nLeigh Alexander is an award-winning writer, narrative designer, and story consultant (Reigns: Her Majesty, Reigns: Game of Thrones, Love Island 2, Neo Cab, unannounced projects). She won the 2019 award for Best Writing in a Video Game from the Writers Guild of Great Britain, and her work has been nominated for Game Developers Choice Awards, BAFTA Game Awards, Independent Game Festival, Golden Joystick, and Develop Awards, among others. \nAs a former journalist and critic, she also creates fiction and audio documentaries about internet culture in the post-reality age. She previously hosted The Guardian's tech podcast, was a columnist in Edge, and spent ten years in major game industry editorial roles. Her YouTube series Lo-Fi Let's Play lovingly deconstructs ancient computer adventures.\nYudhanjaya Wijeratne is an SFF author and data scientist from Colombo, Sri Lanka. He who wrote Numbercaste, The Inhuman Race, and several other stories. His work spans data science, linguistics, artificial intelligence, public policy, futurism, and machine-generated art.\nHe also co-founded and helps run the factchecker Watchdog Sri Lanka, and researches with the Data, Algorithms and Policy team at LIRNEasia, a nonprofit think tank working across the Global South.\nOur plan is to self-publish Neurocracy without relying on distribution platforms of any kind (with the exception of itch.io). Since it plays out entirely on a website with no download required, we feel Neurocracy is a project ideally suited for cutting out the middle and being delivered to you directly. Kickstarter affords us that same freedom.\nWe've gotten Neurocracy to where it is today in our own time and on our own dime, but now we need your help! We're looking for \u00a310,000 in funding, which will enable us to pay Neurocracy's guest writers and enlist designers to craft the audiovisual elements of Omnipedia (character shots, graphs, maps, animations, logos, etc.). Here's how the Kickstarter funding breaks down into our budget:\nExpect a lot of these on Omnipedia too.\nWe're tentatively aiming for a March 2021 release date. Once Neurocracy is ready to go, we'll offer access in the form of a unique Omnipedia login at a price point of \u00a315 (about \u20ac16/$18).\nThe Create Account reward tier is our preorder model: every pledge of \u00a310 (about \u20ac11/$12) automatically comes with access to Neurocracy at a 33% discount! FOREVER!\nThe additional reward tiers, ranging from Citation Needed to Featured Article, will allow you to inject more of yourself into the world of Neurocracy, from a mention in one of Omnipedia's citations to an entire article written just for you! \nThe Personal Life reward tier will see your name added to Omnipedia in the form of an expanded tooltip!\nWe're keeping our rewards close to the spirit of Neurocracy, which is an entirely digital project. That's why we're forgoing any physical rewards, which means nothing has to be delivered to your doorstep in the middle of a pandemic.\nThank you for making it this far!

You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc. We won't try to figure out a break point where the shipping \"resets\" for a 2nd outer carton (or cartons); we'll just subsidize any marginal cost changes if the order is too big for one outer carton.\nEstimating additional shipping for Add-ons:\nGenerally speaking we are able to put Add-on components into the same master carton as the base Reward in your Pledge which makes them less expensive to ship than they would be if shipped individually. When you build your order in the Pledge Manager the system will generate a shipping & handling cost based on the weight, size, and taxes due for your order. \nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\n\n                            United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union+ (UK, Lichtenstein, Norway and Switzerland), Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address.

In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your Reward if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our Pledge Manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nWe regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about these terms & conditions please email kickstarter@alderac.com for further information.\n\n\nGERMAN\n\nAEG benutzt einen externen Pledge Manager. Damit kannst du deine Lieferadresse \u00e4ndern, deine Bestellung ver\u00e4ndern, die Liefer- und Frachtkosten berechnen und diese bezahlen. Du erh\u00e4ltst ungef\u00e4hr 3 Wochen nachdem die Kampagne beendet wurde einen Link zum Pledge Manager. Dort kannst du w\u00e4hlen, ob du die deutsche, englische oder franz\u00f6sische Version des Spiels und aller deiner Add-Ons erhalten willst. Du kannst nicht mehrere Sprachen in einer Bestellung ausw\u00e4hlen, alle Produkte m\u00fcssen in der gleichen Sprache bestellt werden. Du kannst mehrere Bestellungen anlegen, um weitere Sprachen zu erhalten, leider k\u00f6nnen wir dabei die Versandkosten nicht kombinieren.\n\nWir nehmen keine Gruppenbestellungen an und k\u00f6nnen keine Bestellungen von verschiedenen Unterst\u00fctzern kombinieren. H\u00e4ndler, die an Thunderstone Quest interessiert sind, k\u00f6nnen eine Mail an kickstarter@alderac.com f\u00fcr weitere Informationen senden.\n\nAlle in diesem Kickstarter verwendeten Bilder unterliegen \u00c4nderungen und k\u00f6nnen unvollendete oder nicht endg\u00fcltige Designs darstellen. Alle Kartenzahlen sind Sch\u00e4tzungen und k\u00f6nnen sich \u00e4ndern. Alle Karten- und Komponentennamen k\u00f6nnen sich \u00e4ndern.

Die Regeln k\u00f6nnen sich \u00e4ndern.\n\nDie Alderac Entertainment Group ist seit mehr als 20 Jahren im Verlagswesen t\u00e4tig. Wir haben Erfahrung darin, Spiele in China zu produzieren und weltweit zu vertreiben. Dennoch sind mit der Herstellung und Logistik immer Risiken verbunden.\n\nDiese Probleme k\u00f6nnen unsere F\u00e4higkeit, unseren Verpflichtungen gegen\u00fcber unseren Unterst\u00fctzern nachzukommen, verz\u00f6gern oder auf andere Weise beeintr\u00e4chtigen.\n\nDiese Probleme umfassen (sind aber nicht beschr\u00e4nkt auf):\n \n* Produktionsverz\u00f6gerungen\n\n* Versandverz\u00f6gerungen\n\n* Zollverz\u00f6gerungen\n\nDer voraussichtliche Liefertermin ist September 2021. Beachte jedoch, dass dies nur eine Sch\u00e4tzung ist. Aufgrund der Logistik des internationalen Frachtverkehrs erhalten Unterst\u00fctzer in verschiedenen Regionen der Welt m\u00f6glicherweise ihre Belohnungen fr\u00fcher als andere.\nWir haben unser Bestes getan, um diese Risiken so gering wie m\u00f6glich zu halten, und erstatten deinen Beitrag, wenn das Spiel aus einem v\u00f6llig unvorhergesehenen Grund \u00fcberhaupt nicht ausgeliefert werden kann.\n\nR\u00dcCKGABERECHT\n \nVor dem Versand der Belohnungen bieten wir R\u00fcckerstattungen ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden an. Sobald wir deine Belohnung versendet haben, h\u00e4ngt unsere R\u00fcckerstattungsrichtlinie von den Umst\u00e4nden ab und liegt in unserem Ermessen.\n \nAuf deinen Wunsch k\u00f6nnen wir dir innerhalb von 14 Tagen nach Ende der Kampagne eine vollst\u00e4ndige R\u00fcckerstattung gew\u00e4hren, einschlie\u00dflich der Geb\u00fchren. Danach werden Kickstartergeb\u00fchren und Bearbeitungsgeb\u00fchren des Zahlungsdienstleisters abgezogen (die wir nach 14 Tagen nicht mehr von Kickstarter zur\u00fcckerhalten k\u00f6nnen). Diese Geb\u00fchren betragen in der Regel 8% des Gesamtbetrags.\n\nR\u00fcckerstattungen werden \u00fcber Kickstarter verarbeitet und auf die von dir f\u00fcr Kickstarter angegebene Zahlungsmethode angewendet. F\u00fcr den Fall, dass dies nicht m\u00f6glich ist, werden wir mit dir zusammenarbeiten, um eine R\u00fcckerstattung \u00fcber andere Kan\u00e4le zu arrangieren.\n \nDieses Projekt wird in USD finanziert und alle R\u00fcckerstattungen erfolgen in USD f\u00fcr den Betrag, der in USD eingegangen ist, abz\u00fcglich aller anfallenden Geb\u00fchren, die vom Zeitpunkt der R\u00fcckerstattung abh\u00e4ngen. Wir sind nicht verantwortlich f\u00fcr Wechselkurs\u00e4nderungen.\n\nAEG beh\u00e4lt sich das Recht vor, einen Beitrag (mit vollst\u00e4ndiger R\u00fcckerstattung) jederzeit und ohne Angabe von Gr\u00fcnden zu stornieren. Wenn dein Beitrag w\u00e4hrend der Kampagne storniert wird, stimmst du zu, weder unter deinem urspr\u00fcnglichen Konto noch unter einem anderen von dir kontrollierten Konto erneut einen Beitrag zu leisten. Verst\u00f6\u00dfe gegen diese Richtlinie werden an Kickstarter gemeldet.\n\nW\u00e4hrend des Versands k\u00f6nnen geringf\u00fcgige kosmetische Sch\u00e4den an der Schachtel oder anderen Verpackungen auftreten. AEG unternimmt angemessene Anstrengungen, um sicherzustellen, dass die von uns verwendeten Versandbeh\u00e4lter f\u00fcr die sichere Zustellung der Belohnungen geeignet sind. Wenn du glaubst, dass deine Belohnung mehr als nur geringf\u00fcgige kosmetische Sch\u00e4den erlitten hat, setze dich bitte umgehend mit uns in Verbindung. Bewahre alle Verpackungen einschlie\u00dflich Umkartons f\u00fcr unsere Inspektion auf. AEG entscheidet nach eigenem Ermessen, ob der Schaden einen anderen als geringf\u00fcgigen kosmetischen Schaden darstellt und / oder auf eine unzureichende Verpackung zur\u00fcckzuf\u00fchren ist.\nWenn wir die Belohnung an deine Adresse, die du in unserem Pledge Manager angegeben hast, versenden, und das Paket als unzustellbar an uns zur\u00fcckgesandt wird, zahlst du die vollen Kosten f\u00fcr den erneuten Versand der Belohnung an eine neue Adresse.\n\nWenn wir die Belohnung an die Adresse senden, die du in unserem Pledge Manager angegeben hast und das Paket an diese Adresse geliefert wird, du es jedoch nicht entgegennehmen konntest, oder wenn du umgezogen bist und bei dieser Adresse nicht mehr auffindbar bist und das Paket nicht anderweitig abrufen kannst, oder wenn das Paket nach der Lieferung verloren geht oder gestohlen wird und du m\u00f6chtest, dass die Bestellung erneut gesendet wird, zahlst du die vollen Kosten f\u00fcr den Versand der Bestellung an eine neue Adresse zuz\u00fcglich des Betrags der urspr\u00fcnglichen Belohnung sowie der Betr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr etwaige Add-Ons und andere Erweiterungen.\n\nIn jedem Fall akzeptierst du, dass die Mengen begrenzt sind und AEG m\u00f6glicherweise nicht in der Lage ist, deine Bestellung ganz oder teilweise mehr als einmal zu versenden.\nWenn ein Teil deiner Bestellung aus irgendeinem Grund nicht erf\u00fcllt werden kann, erh\u00e4ltst du von AEG eine anteilige R\u00fcckerstattung f\u00fcr diesen Teil deiner Bestellung.\n \nIndem du dieses Projekt unterst\u00fctzt, erkennst du an, dass das endg\u00fcltige Aussehen, die Materialien und der Inhalt der Belohnungen (und des Projekts) \u00c4nderungen unterliegen und sich erheblich von dem unterscheiden kann, was pr\u00e4sentiert wurde, w\u00e4hrend das Kickstarter-Projekt aktiv war.\nWenn du dich nicht bei unserem Pledge Manager anmeldest und deine Belohnung nicht innerhalb von 8 Wochen nach der Benachrichtigung per E-Mail best\u00e4tigst, stimmst du zu, dass wir unsere Verpflichtungen dir gegen\u00fcber in Bezug auf eingegangene Zahlungen oder Spenden vollst\u00e4ndig erf\u00fcllt haben. Es liegt jedoch in unserem Ermessen, deine Belohnuung zu erstatten oder zu versenden, wenn du uns nach Ablauf der 8-w\u00f6chigen Frist kontaktierst und deinen Pledge best\u00e4tigst.\nWenn du deinen Pledge innerhalb von 8 Wochen nach der Benachrichtigung per E-Mail best\u00e4tigst, stimmst du zu, dass wir daf\u00fcr verantwortlich sind, deine Bestellung so zu versenden, wie sie in unserem Pledge Manager-System eingegeben wurde.

Nous avons l'exp\u00e9rience de la production de jeux en Chine et de leur distribution dans le monde entier. N\u00e9anmoins, il y a toujours des risques li\u00e9s \u00e0 la fabrication et \u00e0 la logistique.\n\nCes probl\u00e8mes peuvent retarder ou affecter notre capacit\u00e9 \u00e0 respecter nos engagements envers nos backers.\nCes probl\u00e8mes comprennent (mais ne sont pas limit\u00e9s \u00e0) : \n* Les retards de production \n* D\u00e9lais d'exp\u00e9dition\n* D\u00e9lais de douane\nLa date de livraison pr\u00e9vue est septembre 2021, mais gardez en t\u00eate que ce n'est qu'une estimation. De plus, en raison de la logistique de l'exp\u00e9dition internationale, les backers de diff\u00e9rentes r\u00e9gions du monde peuvent recevoir leurs R\u00e9compenses plus t\u00f4t que les autres. \n\n\nNous avons fait de notre mieux pour minimiser ces risques autant que possible, et nous sommes toujours heureux de rembourser les promesses de dons si, pour une raison totalement impr\u00e9vue, le jeu ne pouvait pas \u00eatre livr\u00e9 du tout. \n\nPOLITIQUE DE REMBOURSEMENT \n\n\nAvant que les R\u00e9compenses ne soient exp\u00e9di\u00e9es, nous rembourserons sans poser de questions.

Apr\u00e8s cela, nous soustrairons les frais de Kickstarter et de traitement du paiement (que nous ne pouvons pas r\u00e9cup\u00e9rer aupr\u00e8s de Kickstarter apr\u00e8s 14 jours). Ces frais correspondent g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement \u00e0 8% du montant total du pledge.\n\nLes remboursements seront trait\u00e9s par Kickstarter et seront appliqu\u00e9s \u00e0 n'importe quelle m\u00e9thode de paiement que vous avez fournie \u00e0 Kickstarter.

In the first volume, you find a message from Mary:\nBeneath Mary\u2019s letter you\u2019ll discover a treasure trove of gorgeous hand-written documents, 2D and 3D jigsaw puzzles, mysterious objects and artifacts, and devious challenges. Prove your worth by studying the documents, constructing the jigsaws, and solving the puzzles... and you\u2019ll be treated to a heartbreaking story that culminates in a shocking reimagining of the truth behind Mary Shelley\u2019s famous novel.\nCombining the best of escape rooms, board games, and immersive theater, Mother of Frankenstein is a 10-15 hour cooperative gaming experience for between 1 and 6 players, ages 13 and up. Mother of Frankenstein was designed to be as welcoming and fun for newbies as it is rewarding for experts, combining the narrative complexity of a good novel with the physicality and challenge of a puzzle-filled escape room. Throw in a couple of clue-strewn jigsaw puzzles, and our game truly has something for everyone!\nOur final stretch(es)!\nStretchy!\nMother of Frankenstein is divided into three volumes. Volume 1 concerns Mary\u2019s teenage years and her education by her iconoclastic father. Players must complete three assignments\u2014poetry, music, and astronomy\u2014each of which is presented in the form of a puzzle. Simultaneously, Mary embarks on a love affair with the dashing (but married) poet Percy Shelley. The course of their courtship is laid out over 15 love letters, though players must read closely to determine the order of events!\nIn Volume 2, the venue changes to Germany, and Castle Frankenstein, where a fancy ball is being thrown on a balmy night in 1814. Players begin by constructing a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle of the castle\u2019s floorplan, then use it\u2014along with gossip rags, billiard hall schedules, and original drawings by comic book artist Liana Kangas\u2014to track the events of the evening.\nFinally, in Volume 3, you\u2019ll construct an epic 3D puzzle of Castle Frankenstein and descend into the secret laboratory hidden therein, where you\u2019ll discover what Mary learned under the tutelage of the famous alchemist who called the place home, and how it inspired her to write what many call the first science fiction novel, Frankenstein. \nWhen our heroes tweet, we screencap.\nThe Standard Edition of Mother of Frankenstein contains the following: \n The Ultimate Edition adds our special printing of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, featuring original art by comic book artist Liana Kangas (which has its own reward tier, if you just feel like a re-read!), as well as a ton of other fancy stuff.

These are usually terrain cards or permanent events that will progressively form the game board, but also include obstacles and challenges to overcome, equipment, companions, and side quests.\nThe game is full of random events, always consistent with where you are, and many alternative cards to experience a different adventure every time you play.\nPay attention to the details and observe your environment carefully: it contains a lot of hidden information and numbers that will be very useful to you!\nEach turn, you collectively decide which character will take the next action (search, fight, move, speak, and more) from those available to them (on the terrain card where their miniature is, their character card, an event, one of their skills, etc.).\nThere are more than 30 actions that you can perform!\nAll actions have a cost (the minimum number of cards to draw from your Action Deck), a difficulty (the number of successes you must obtain) and consequences that vary depending on whether the action succeeds or fails. \nAn action is resolved in four steps: Preparation (choice of objects, companions, etc.), Draw, Result and Consequence.\nOver the course of the adventure, taking actions will gradually deplete your Action Deck. When you run out of cards in the Action Deck, you must perform a Recovery to replenish it by reshuffling the cards from your Discard, but you will then lose 5 life points.\nWhen you are almost out of life points, or when you've reached your scenario goal, it's time to return to the Citadel!\nThe Threat Booklet will detail the consequences of your actions, which will vary according to your choices and performance, and take you to a new scenario.\nThe Collapsing Lands is populated with dozens of non-player characters (NPCs). \nYou will be able to converse with these NPCs using the \u201cBook of Dialogues\u201d, which is divided into nonlinear numbered paragraphs. You will not only choose what your character says, but also the tone they use. Then you will find out what happens by reading the indicated paragraph number.\nA chapter from the Book of Dialogues\nThe Collapsing Lands is also a hostile world where you'll have to battle strange creatures in tactical encounters that take place over several rounds. \nThese compound actions are identified by the presence of a die, whose value indicates the difficulty of the round and decreases as you gain successes. The encounter ends when the die is removed from the card, usually after you have successfully completed the last round of battle.\nIf you want to get out unscathed, you'll need to equip yourself with weapons, armor, and spells, and you\u2019ll need to seek out companions. That won\u2019t be enough to truly face down the Threat, however! You must also develop your skills and your Citadel, and that's where your Destiny comes in.\nDuring your adventures you will gain Hope through your feats of arms and the completion of side quests.\nYou can spend it to acquire new skills, build buildings, send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands, and much more. There are so many possibilities that you'll have to choose the direction YOU want to go in!\nBuildings will grant you powerful effects once built such as allowing you to start each scenario with more life points, items, or companions. They will also increase the characteristics (defense, knowledge, production\u2026) of your fellowship, in order to defeat the Threat.\nYou start the game with a map of the Kel Protectorate. This world map provides valuable information about places of interest \u2013 city-states, garrisons, waterways, etc. \u2013 in the world as it was before the war started. Unfortunately, things have changed a lot since then. \nYou will be able to send emissaries to map the Collapsing Lands to update your world map by inserting numbered cards into the plastic sleeves provided for this purpose. You'll be able to obtain interesting effects,  and might even gain the ability to start future scenarios from a more advantageous position, closer to your target destination!\nThe Collapsing Lands are aptly named. Every step you take could see the ground open up like a gaping maw, eager to swallow you whole. But what if there were a hidden world below, filled with secrets and treasures just waiting to be discovered?\n\u201cOn the Edge of Peril\u201d is an exclusive expansion offered in the Collector's Edition pledge. It includes 2 dividers, 30 cards, 1 rule sheet.\nIt expands your adventures with new Exploration cards that will hinder your progress until you fight off the danger.\nDuring your adventure, you may be instructed (no spoilers \ud83d\ude09) to slip the \u201cPeril\u201d divider behind the 110 card. Whenever you take a Terrain card stored after that divider (card nr. 111 and up), you must replace 1 Exploration card attached to that terrain with one showing the \u201cPeril\u201d (skull) icon.\nLuckily, you possess a Groundquaker, a powerful artifact stolen from the Necrodruids, which will help you push the divider further back and with it the edge of peril!\nWe\u2019ve been working on The 7th Citadel for over a year now.\nThe game\u2019s mechanics have been heavily tested over the last few months. Dozens of players have had the opportunity to try them out, notably at the Essen 2019 and FIJ (Cannes) 2020 trade fairs. Their feedback has enabled us to come up with this almost final version of the rules.\nNevertheless, this \"beta\" version of the rules is likely to change slightly between now and delivery.\nDownload the beta version of the rules (.pdf 23 Mo)\nT\u00e9l\u00e9charger la version fran\u00e7aise des r\u00e8gles (.pdf 23 Mo)\nSPOILER ALERT!

Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 20 years, in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the games Serious Poulp publishes: Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nIn 2019, we were honored by the Spiel Des Jahres (kritikerpreis) award for the cooperative party game \u201cJust One\u201d we designed, published by Repos Production.\nBree has worked on Kickstarter campaigns in a variety of roles, from marketing and communications support to community management, a role which she is delighted to be handling for The 7th Citadel campaign. She lives in Las Vegas, NV with her two cats, Samus and Remy. Many of her favorite games are deck-builders or abstract strategy games, but she will play just about anything.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTRACK RECORD\n\nThe 7th Citadel is our third Kickstarter campaign.

The unique environment, interactive inventory, combat mechanics and tactical diversity are all enveloped in an integral storytelling experience that provides both total immersion in the world and full replay value.\nBut beware! A horde of unique and terrifying monsters are bent on destroying your party. If that isn\u2019t enough, horrific events emerge from the darkness, conspiring to disrupt and hinder any remaining hope in these comfortless chambers.\nEnjoy the stunning art and dark visuals of the game world. Let yourself become entranced by the gripping story and peculiar events as you fight for survival amidst the mysterious arcane depths.\nThere is no need for a game master, no special conditions based on the player count, and a modifiable duration and difficulty setting. \nPlayable as either one-shot scenarios or in a progressive campaign mode, you can tailor the experience to match your most morbid desires.\nThe brand-new \u2018To Eternity\u2019 expansion adds more value by bringing the core Machina Arcana experience to a new level!

Please know that our hearts go out to all. We sincerely hope that 2021 brings brighter days for us all, dear friends, and that these calendars may bring a bit of daily joy into your lives.\nPlease read on as we share details for your illumination and indulgence\u2026as well as a most tantalizing array of rewards for your delight.\n Are you seeking to further your unyielding quest for omnilegence? This elucidating calendar will supplement your sesquipedalian loquaciousness as it enlightens and entertains you daily. It is a calendar of such distinction, such grandiloquence, that I daresay you will need to reference one for words adequate enough to describe it. \nGrandiloquent Words + Lavish Illustrations\nThis year\u2019s theme pays homage to a classic and much-loved story from years gone by - Robin Hood, as illustrated by one of my favorite artists, Louis Rhead (1857 - 1926). An English-born artist, illustrator, and author who immigrated to America when he was twenty-four, Rhead\u2019s reputation as an illustrator is well deserved. In addition to his famous renderings of fish, he lavishly illustrated popular children's literature, such as Treasure Island, Robinson Caruso, Jonathan Swift, Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales, and of course Robin Hood. It is from his own book, \u201cBold Robin Hood and His Outlaw Band; Their Famous Exploits In Sherwood Forest\u201d that I have painstakingly curated these gorgeous pieces of art into an enjoyable collection for any fan of the illustrative arts.\nEach month will feature words of such grandiloquence, such magnificence, that you shall astound and confound your family, friends, and colleagues with your inventiveness as you strew them into your daily conversations. \nDaily Holidays\nEach day of the year features two or more festivities! Holidays both beloved and bizarre are displayed for your daily amusement, enlightenment, and occasional befuddlement. The novelty of having these delightful quotidian holidays to celebrate shall surely elicit frabjous, dare I say, corybantic jubilance! \nLunar Cycles Chart\nBehold this intricately detailed chart of the quotennial lunar cycles, certain to be most felicitous when planning your nocturnal intrigues. Perfect for those with a lupine leaning! \nHeliocentric Simulacrum\nThere is also a Heliocentric Simulacrum, which complements the lunar cycles chart.

COMIC\nThere are so many stories to tell about Heckna and the Revelia. This final stretch goal will allow us to team up with Gail Simone (Clean Room, Birds of Prey, Deadpool, Wonder Woman) to bring those stories to life!\nAvailable as PDF only, included in all tiers. Slated release, 2021.\nWelcome to The Revelia!\nHeckna! is 5e adventure story designed to take characters through levels 1 to 10. This book is both a setting and a campaign guide with plenty of replayability. Game Masters and players alike will delight in this whimsical, dark carnival setting.\nHeckna! Cover WIP (Art by Justin Chan @justinchans)\nThis is a book that combines dark fantasy and fun, campy escapades. It\u2019s designed for players ages 14 and up. However, it\u2019s very easy to adjust the tone and the atmosphere for your party. There\u2019s plenty here that will satisfy horror fans, and just as much that will entice fans of humor and whimsy.\nWelcome to the carnival, where we are always smiling\u2026\n*...actually I'm sure we're responsible! (Art by Julia Metzger @JuliaMetzgerArt)\nThe sounds of revelry drift through the dark, cold forest, drawing wayward travelers to a place where the senses are delightfully and bewilderingly overwhelmed. Peering out from the top of the conifers is the blood-red spire of The Revelia, where wonder and fun awaits!\nBut underneath the sparkling lights and gleaming facade is a sinister underbelly of chaos and terror. The magical Revelia is the work of Heckna, a creative mastermind masquerading as a jovial ringleader. Some, however, are aware of Heckna\u2019s ruse, including a hunter who will stop at nothing to dispatch Heckna \u2014 and destroy The Revelia \u2014 once and for all.\nTravelers may believe that they find The Revelia by chance, but in fact, Heckna goes to great lengths to lure only the best and brightest to his carnival in his search for greater, more spectacular challenges. Many have tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to escape from this carnival, but with the right brains, brawn, and alliances, even Heckna can be outmaneuvered.\nRun away with us! (Art by Corey Brickley @CoreyBrickley)\nWill characters see through the glitzy and glamorous charade, or fall prey to Heckna\u2019s relentless torment and become a permanent member of The Revelia?\nThe Revelia\nOut of the frying pan and into The Revelia! (Art by Julia Metzger @JuliaMetzgerArt)\nA Heckna! campaign takes inspiration from classic court jesters, Victorian-era circuses and sideshows, and campy flicks from the 1980s. Heckna\u2019s realm, called The Revelia, drifts in and out of different planes, and Heckna likes to collect \u201csouvenirs\u201d from every place he visits. While the campaign fits into any fantasy setting, you're sure to find other unique aspects of The Revelia that have been drawn from other planes, such as weird science, classic arcade games, and robotic automatons.\nRubes and Revellers\nI don't think we're in Ravenloft anymore... (Art by Justin Chan @justinchans)\nHumanoids trapped at The Revelia are known as rubes, and are the most common creatures there. However, but that identifier is generous, as many rubes eventually become clowns or monstrous hybrids in Heckna\u2019s hands. Rubes are doomed to live out their days at The Revelia, unless they find a way to escape.\nRevelers, on the other hand, are a part of The Revelia by choice. Whether they ran away and joined the carnival, or adopted Heckna as their patron, they revel in the outrageous, unlimited lifestyle that the ringleader and his Revelia offer, and help lull unsuspecting rubes into a false sense of security.\nThe Monsters\nMany a fiend and sinister foe lurk within The Revelia; it's up to you to discover what is a joke and what is out to eat you. Here are some of the monsters you can expect to find!\nShnozlings & Clown Thralls\nGot your nose! (Art by Jason Engle @J_A_E1)\nShnozlings are tiny blood-red aberrations that are a rube\u2019s worst nightmare. Released by Snout, these round red parasites latch onto unsuspecting humanoids and infect them with a nasty corruption that eventually turns them into clown thralls. A shnozling is soft and sponge-like to the touch, although its grip on a nose is quite painful. To an average carnival attendee, the shnozlings may look rather silly, but those at The Revelia know the a round red nose smells like certain doom.\n Children of the Candy Corn\nCAAAANNNNDDDYYYY!!! (Art by Camille Alquier @camillealquierillustration)\n\nChildren of the Candy Corn are childlike aberrations that often roam in packs of two or three. They favor the Food Court, lurking near supplies of sugar or sweets, and are obsessed with candy. Always on a sugar high, these hyper tykes zoom around The Revelia being loud and mischievous. However, if confronted, these creatures become less childlike and much more frightening, removing their masks to reveal their monstrous form underneath. When angered, there is very little about their appearance that resembles a child.\n\nBosses\nMwahaha! You thought that Heckna was the only baddie?! Heck na! (had to). At The Revelia there are multiple big bad encounters that you'll come across. Take Sophie here...\nWill you be her next pet... project? (Art by Daarken @DaarkenArt)\nSophie, Chandler of Flesh\nSophie\u2019s love for science and experimentation began at an early age. She quickly became obsessed with dissection and reassembling corpses to form new creatures that she could control and make her own. Initially, Sophie started with wax, which had similar properties to flesh but was easier to source without arousing suspicion. She used the wax to prototype her ideas, and then hunted down the best creatures to dissect and bring her ideas to life\u2014or at least undeath. Years later, she still follows this process, combining wax with flesh to animate gruesome \u201ccreations\u201d that she can control.\nWax is eternal. (Art by Jason Engle @J_A_E1)\nFor this reason, Heckna recruited Sophie to serve at The Revelia. With free rein to experiment to her heart\u2019s desire, she's become the creator of many creatures that your party can encounter, and is well-regarded and respected by the revelers. Though, this respect stems mostly from fear. Those who undergo her experiments often don\u2019t live through them, or their memories are wiped and they no longer remember their former selves.\n\n\nA Heckna Lives! campaign can be assembled manually or randomly using the Shuffled Stories Engine. Following the book in the order written forms a full campaign, or you can use the included deck of cards and the Shuffled Stories Engine to form a storyline.\n Introducing the Shuffled Stories Engine! \nWant help setting up a story for your party? Introducing the Shuffled Stories Engine.\nThe Shuffled Stories Engine helps GM's of all experience levels build out a full-blown Heckna! campaign using a standard deck of playing cards. The cards are split up into smaller 'area' decks based on their values, representing the three main areas of Heckna's world. Each card is tied to an encounter, and cards are drawn from each area deck and arranged into the campaign frame of your terrifying tale! Low on time? The SSE can help you build a one-shot just as easily. Want to bring the feeling of a rollercoaster to your game? In the McNally's Mischief variant, the players and GM play a variation of poker at the start of each session to determine what encounter comes next\u2014pure chaos! \nSo many stories to discover at The Revelia!\nOur latest playtest v0.4 contains the first chapters of a full-length campaign and the tools you\u2019ll need to get started playing in this setting.

Very much like an Escape Room in a handy format! The solution to each and every puzzle is based not on randomness, but only on logical decisions.\nThe Cluebox is an intriguing challenge. It's difficult to solve, satisfying to hold, and beautiful to display.\nThe facts about the game:\nSpecial edition in multi-color available only for Kickstarter campaign\nSize: 11*11*12 cm\nAge: 14+\nPlayers: 1-2\nPlay time: 60-90 minutes\nCan be reset and solved again by other players\nCan also be used as a sophisticated gift wrap (size of the gift space is 45mm*60mm*10mm)\nLanguage independent\nTHE STORY\nDavy Jones' Locker.\nLondon, 1720. Ian Kensington, captain of the British Engineering Forces, is responsible for the first successful recovery of a sunken ship. In the report to His Majesty King George I of England, Kensington mentions Davy Jones' locker for the first time.\nDespite it being a real artifact, he describes the locker in the context of a legend about the sea devil Davy Jones, who supposedly locks away the wandering souls of all sailors who lose their lives at the sea. It is told that on each sunken ship, he hides a replicate of the locker, promising to release all souls if someone manages to open the box.\n Since the first find, similar lockers were found in shipwrecks scattered around the world. Some of them are still kept in private collections, others in museums. However, nobody has been able to reveal their secret so far.\nWe are sure that you are the one, who will finally be able to open the locker and force Davy Jones to admit his defeat.\nTHE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION\nAccording to Davy Jones he decided to create a special version of the box and release it to the community of Kickstarter. His crafty and intrepid team of developers has spent the last eight months designing and testing this special version of the locker. The team explored a wide variety of interlocks and functionalities, and ultimately settled on a final version which was confirmed by Davy Jones as the most sophisticated version of his locker. \nWe will not hide that our team participated in the creation of the box, but even we don't have the details how to open it as the final mechanisms were personally crafted by the Sea Devil. In any case the Cluebox \u201eDavy Jones Locker\u201c is our most complex project to date\u2014 both from a design and manufacturing perspective. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil, consists of 72 individual parts assembled with care by hand.\nTEAM\nOur international team of game and puzzle enthusiasts, mainly based in Germany, established in 2015 company  and developed several innovative board game and puzzles focusing in escape games niche. Today we're very excited to present our first Kickstarter and will appreciate your support to bring our product to life. \nPirate music theme credit to Ross Bugden\nPackage design Federico Meloni/Chris Lattner\nMeet our team member locked in Davy Jones' cabinet and requested to announce start of the campaign.\nMEGABOX (Kickstarter special)\nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox in multi-color.  Box size is 21,5*21,5*22,5cm. This box is ideal for escape rooms and events with larger amount of people. \nIn your pledge for Megabox 2 boxes are included: 1x Megabox + 1x Standards size\n Complimentary artifact - Davy Jones' Sundial\nDear friends of Cluebox,\nwe have important news to share with you. We're really excited with number of people who decided to support us and we made a serious effort to match the level of expectations and get more mysterious artifacts from hands of Davy Jones.\nAnd today we succeed!  We achieved to get plans of his sundial, which is an important element in the process of solving Davy Jones' Locker: when solving the Locker, keep an eye on the time shown on the clock and don't ever cross the number 12. Otherwise the Locker will turn into ... actually you better don't know what is it, just trust us ;)\nEach one of our bekers will receive a wooden kit of sundial as a big thanks for your support.\nThe size of sundial is 6x6 cm.\n\nOther iDventure Puzzles\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat \nSchr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat is a thought experiment by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that illustrates the problem of quantum mechanics in every day objects. In this experiment, a cat and some poison are locked in a closed box.\nAccording to Quantum Mechanics after a while the cat will be both dead and alive. Only by looking at the object, in this case the cat, the status will be determined. \nUnfortunately, Schr\u00f6dinger completely forgot the cat because of his busy daily routine.\nWe are sure that the cat is still alive, and you must save it!\nBox size: \nSecret space size: 1,5*4,5*8cm\nPlay time: 45-60 min\n Cluebox - Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat - MEGABOX \nFor Kickstarter we will produce a special edition of Megabox.  Box size is 21,5*21,5*22,5cm. This box is ideal for escape rooms and events with larger amount of people.\nIn your pledge for Megabox 2 boxes are included: 1x Megabox + 1x Standards size\nCryptex (wooden kit)\nCryptex is a portable vault used to hide secret messages. We have produced it as wooden kit, giving you the opportunity to build it on your own, get insights on it's mechanics and of course hide secret message as a present or as part of the a game. \nSize: 10,5*6 cm\nOur Cryptex can be easily reset and the secret word can be set to any word up to 6 letters. \nSecret space size: 2*2*8 cm\nREWARDS\nTIMELINE\nShipping and Taxes \nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location. The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our bakers on Kickstarter.  \nFor the EU, UK, US and Canada, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, Canada, UK and EU. There maybe additional duties and/or fees charged by your country\u2019s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge, nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.\nShipping charges will be added after the Kickstarter ends - every backer will be responsible for paying these in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nApproximate shipping prices listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt iDventure, we have a lot of experience fulfilling large orders on strict timelines.

Davy Jones' Locker"}}, {"backer": "M. Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Once a functional fortress and the cradle of wizards, little now remains of the Scarlet Citadel... on the surface. However, the place is known among adventurers and lorekeepers, and well-trod stairs lead down into the depths.\nDeep below, dwarven mercenaries once bred their owlbears for war, the sorcerers of the White Forest practiced their forbidden arts, and strange cults from other realms settled into a place where nodes of power draw together. Their treasures and their remains are scattered across the halls and caverns. Those malevolent creatures that remain still spin their shadowy webs, enchant foul magics, and summon forth the dark gods.\nThis all-dungeon adventure for levels 1 to 10 presents adventuring in the most classic style of all, facing the foul monsters below the earth and seizing lost treasure. Sharpen your ax and ready your wand, and step forward for adventure in the Scarlet Citadel!\nThe 5th Edition of the world's first tabletop RPG is all about dungeons (and also dragons, though not in this project!). This is the first dungeon-centric adventure design that Kobold Press has tackled for 5th Edition, and the design effort is led by TSR and Wizards of the Coast veteran Steve Winter, working with notes and characters from Kobold Press publisher Wolfgang Baur's home game.\nThe result is a classic, old-school dungeon crawl that goes from a surface setting to a deep set of caverns far from the light of the sun, where alien things skitter and guttural chants murmur down chill and damp passageways lit only by magical spheres and phosphorescent fungi.\nThe Scarlet Citadel includes at least 6 levels of dungeon exploration with lavish maps, plus a town base, appendixes of additional monsters and characters, and a full suite of PDF and virtual tabletop options from Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nThe project will create 6 main items: \nA hardcover book in both regular and limited editions,\nA hand-tooled, rich leather edition,\nA map folio of poster-sized, table-ready battle maps to play on, \nA fully-optimized PDF,\nA digital edition for the Roll20 virtual tabletop (VTT), and\nA Fantasy Grounds edition for that VTT platform.\nThe limited edition will be printed once with a leatherette, foil-stamped cover, ribbon bookmark, special endpapers, and similar touches. The content is identical to the regular edition, but this deluxe, limited edition often becomes extremely sought after.\nThis project does also offer a handbound leather edition for collectors and bibliophiles. This is done entirely in the traditional style of bookbinding, with excellent leather (likely scarlet-colored) stamped with gold foil and embellished with corded spine, ribbon bookmarks, and other flourishes. This is limited to about a dozen copies and is not available after the Kickstarter. Because of the extra time needed to create it, this reward ships about a month after the other reward packages do.\nYou can get these items separately or in bundles, and the bundles offer a discount. In addition, the limited edition is available though the Kickstarter, not through later elements such as the survey or pledge manager. (Sometimes we have a few extra limited editions for sale in the Kobold Store\u2014that's never guaranteed!).\nThe rewards available during the Kickstarter are shown here. \n\nBecause of postal variations and yearly increases in shipping costs, the shipping for print rewards is calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter closes.\nThis project continues the Kobold Press goal of reducing shipping costs to international backers and shipping in a sustainable way by using friendly, bulk shipments to three main regions: Canada, Australia, and the EU. From there, shipments go out via Canada Post, Australia Post, and either Royal Mail or Deutsche Post. \nAs always with our projects, if we exceed our funding goal we will expand the adventure, the maps, and other elements of the project. The more people who support Scarlet Citadel, the better the rewards for everyone.\nOur first goal and the next few stretch goals are posted here. More goals will be unlocked once we reach these, and quite a few secrets remain in the depths...\nAt Kobold Press, a fantastic team of accomplished tabletop gaming professionals is working hard to pull this project together.\nSteve Winter, Lead Designer: Steve Winter got his start in the RPG industry by answering a help wanted ad in 1981. He\u2019s managed to make a living from RPGs ever since as editor, developer, managing editor, creative director, web producer, designer, and author on countless roleplaying games, adventures, boardgames, wargames, novels, magazines, and web articles. His most recent work includes Tomb of Annihilation, Tome of Beasts, Deep Magic, and Midgard Heroes Handbook.\nMisty Bourne, Lead Editor: Apex editor Misty Bourne is a professional word nerd with a ruthless red pen. An avid 5E player with more than twelve years of publishing experience, some of her more notable projects include: Mythic Odysseys of Theros (Wizards of the Coast), Underworld Lairs and Tome of Beasts 2 (Kobold Press), and the Epic Legacy series, Total Party Kill series, and Tyrants & Hellions (2CGaming). She edits Hit Point Press\u2019s \u201cBig Bads\u201d (2020 silver ENNIE winner) and is currently authoring the guidebook for HPP\u2019s Animated Tarot, slated for release in 2021.\nJon Pintar, Lead Cartographer: Jon Pintar is an illustrator and concept artist working mostly in tabletop games. Designing worlds is his passion, and his maps are published in dozens of products from publishers such as Kobold Press, Worldspinner, and Absolute Tabletop. He lives in Slovenia, on the sunny side of the Alps, and is never far from a medieval castle. You can find him on Twitter at @JonPintar.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 37 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 15 of them on Kickstarter (this is #16). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Scarlet Citadel, much of the adventure design and cartography is already done. Likewise, we already have the cover and a portion of the interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are in editing the material, creating additional maps generated by stretch goals, layout of the books, and managing the uncertain landscape for printing and shipping.\n\nOther risks include entirely new ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from COVID-related printer delays plus the recent tampering with the US Post Office. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if we spring a trap or two on the way back to the surface?

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Story\nI've written a short story, about 8,000 words long, in which a psychic assassin working for the government explains (and complains about) his job, its history, its secrets and techniques and risks. It's inspired in equal parts by Tim Powers, Scanners, The Men Who Stare at Goats and Delta Green. If you like creepy technothrillers with surreal edges, I think you might enjoy this one.\nIt most closely resembles my stories NECROCHROME, Specimens and Forgeries and Simulacra. (If you prefer, you can listen to Specimens as an MP3 podcast, instead.) Like them, my hope is to host the story at my fiction library under a Creative Commons license so it's available to everyone with internet access. \nAs with much of my recent work, I Am A Psychic Assassin for the US Army is concerned with government, its impact on individuals, its over-reach, and the effects this has on the people whom the government uses to pursue its agendas. It is also, of course, about weird psychic phenomena and the dangers of trying to make practical use of something you don't understand. \nSTRETCH GOALS!\nHoo boy, we're funding right along! In one of the updates, I promised that if we hit $1500, I'd record a podcast of the story for all backers, like this one for After the Cops. And we hit it!\nSo now, with five days left, I'm putting up the last stretch goal: Giving the podcast to everyone. (Like I did with After the Cops.) To change things up, instead of a financial goal, I'm doing one based on people power. \nIf this hits 200 backers, the podcast goes out to everyone.\nIf you haven't backed, even a dollar pledge gets you the podcast regardless--and it might, also, gift it to the whole population of the internet. \nIf you have backed--wow, thank you. I appreciate it. You're definitely going to get the story and the podcast. If you want to make it broader and make the podcast available to all and sundry, spread the word.\nThanks!\n-G.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRight now, the biggest risk I foresee is postal delays, but I hope I've built in enough time to cope with them.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Summary\nMantis Falls is a strategic and highly interactive 2-3 player hidden traitor game. As cautious companions, players must use cooperation, hand management, social deduction and deception to protect themselves, and each other, on a dark and perilous journey.\nOn the shadowy film-noir roads of a mob-ruled mountain town named Mantis Falls, you have witnessed something not meant for your eyes and must now move quickly to escape town alive. You are informed that another witness will join you, and you consider your greatest hope for survival will come if you can contend with the hazards of this night together. But with each damaging event and every fresh wound, your suspicions grow. Looking into your companion's eyes you wonder, perhaps too late, if this person is here to kill you.\nBy use of hidden role cards, Mantis Falls is a \u201csometimes cooperative\" strategy game. A game may have only witnesses, in which case players can win only if they all escape together. Or there could secretly be an assassin, carefully protecting the illusion of collaboration until the right moment to strike.\nUnlike semi-cooperative games with multi-tiered win objectives or accumulations of points, Mantis Falls presents a simplicity of purpose: survival. And this task presents challenge in equal and high measure for all players. When there are only witnesses, players will need to continually perform acts of sacrifice and generosity even as double-edged action cards and \"unseen\" events test the limits of their fragile alliance. Players charged with the role of assassin can survive only with deceit and cunning, always cautious of the powerful but fleeting ability of witnesses to call in a hit on those they no longer trust.\nMantis Falls combines combo-driven card-play and hand-building with player communication. On every turn, players discuss tactics, defend choices and bluff through carefully guarded secrets. Witnesses and assassins alike must walk the line between a willingness to help their companion and a readiness to kill, always reading each other as much as surveying the hazards of the road.\nWith a variable modular board and uncertain objectives, each walk through the roads of Mantis Falls is unique. Moreover, the level of interaction means the relationships and personalities of the players themselves have the power to meaningfully transform every game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our first scale-up to mass production and that inherently entails the risk of the unknown. Fortunately, we have the guidance of valuable mentors experienced in this industry, so we are optimistic in our ability to address the challenges that come our way.\n\nOur greatest concern right now is that the game may not reach everyone on our planned schedule.

Between them, those two earlier Kickstarter campaigns led to the creation of 30 different 14-page PDFs, all of which were delivered to the backers of those projects on schedule! That's 360 total pages of actual content packed with systemless fantasy RPG inspiration that gamemasters can turn to when looking for ideas to make their own!\n\nNow, with your support, we'll bring the third wave of the A Dozen . . . series to life. Starting with A Dozen Frightening Rumors, this latest Kickstarter campaign was designed around a single goal: To create more of the same! The series has proven popular with Kickstarter backers -- between the original campaign and later projects, over 3,000 gamers have downloaded the 17 first wave titles as a part of their rewards -- so I see no reason to change my approach to this series.\nNo new physical rewards. This project is all about the new PDFs. There are no new print books offered through this campaign. For those of you in the U.S. who have missed some of my earlier projects, the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes books and Dungeon Crafter's Sketch Book (square edition) are being offered. Please see below (and the rewards, at right) for more information.\nPrint Schedule: If the project closes successfully, then I will send out the surveys for those backers in the U.S. who have selected print rewards. The goal is to send the print rewards no later than September of 2020 (which will be before the new PDFs are ready).\nEach rumor is designed to fit on a single page (with artwork), so that you may print only the page that you need for your next game session. A Dozen Frightening Rumors comes in at 14 pages and includes -- as you may have guessed from the title -- twelve different rumors + a cover page and a page outlining the anatomy of a rumor (as well as tips on using the rumors in your game).\nThe content is systemless and designed for use with any fantasy roleplaying game. The gamemaster will need to create any statistics necessary to use the material during a game session. These PDFs exist as inspirational works that are intended to help fire the GM's imagination.\nSample pages from wave one titles.\nALL STRETCH GOALS NOW UNLOCKED! \nAs project stretch goals are unlocked, all reward levels -- including the $1 level -- will receive the unlocked PDFs at no extra charge. Tell your friends; more backers could mean more PDFs for all project supporters!\nNOTE: At project launch, none of the PDFs have been written. If the campaign closes successfully, then I'll start the serious task of writing A Dozen Frightening Rumors (as well as any unlocked stretch goal PDFs). I'll keep everyone informed through project updates as I work on writing the PDFs that are required to complete the campaign.\nThe first wave of modern A Dozen . . . series PDFs was created thanks to the success of the A Dozen Sinister Rumors Kickstarter campaign in October of 2019 (project page here). To get these PDFs as a bundle, please see the $16, $26, $44, and $66 rewards at right or, if you wish, visit DrivethruRPG to buy single PDFs.\nThe Kickstarter campaign for the second wave of A Dozen . . . series PDFs came to a close in December of 2019 and, by the time it closed, project support led to the creation of thirteen new PDFs. You can get a bundle of the thirteen PDFs in this campaign -- please see the $11, $26, $29, $44, and $66 rewards, at right -- or you may find individual titles at DrivethruRPG.\nDid you miss the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II Kickstarter campaigns?

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked in a real-life room escape game industry for over five years. During this period, we have made 20 different game designs throughout the country as a team. These games have been played by more than 20,000 people and have won many awards here in Turkey. We wanted to put into use our experience globally and we want to share the stories we have created with the world. The idea of Arca Ludum was born at this point. We wanted our work to be extraordinary. We have been researching and updating our games since the middle of 2018. Our biggest risk is to transfer all our energy and capital to Arca Ludum by canceling our activities on real-life room escape game companies.\n\nWe have worked hard to improve our team and add interactive elements to our games. We have repeatedly produced new prototypes to find the best materials to use in the games. We have worked in an organized way to avoid any disruption in various subjects such as scenario writing, puzzle design, visual design, progressive prototype production, blind-tests, planning of production, storage, logistics, customer services, and control of technical failure processes. We take care to choose the right partners.\n\nThe room escape enthusiasts know it well. The most important element for a perfect escape game is the puzzles. These puzzles should be both enjoyable and extraordinary. We have carefully selected our puzzles in all of our games from a large pool. Puzzles and gameplay are a whole. To ensure this integrity, we have updated each of our stories several times.\n\nConsidering all these factors, we believe that we will be successful in our games. We've spent quite a lot of effort to add re-playable mini-games in each game. Apart from all these, we have understood clearly that preparing the game completely is not enough for the global market. We talked to a lot of alternative logistic service providers about how to get our games to game enthusiasts. In order to keep both the cost of the game and the cost of shipment at the optimum level, we talked to many services in different regions of the world.\n\nWe agreed with an investor who would provide the necessary budget for materials, graphic designs, advertising expenses, and game development expenses. Thus, we have taken huge steps to create Arca Ludum, which will produce new and unique projects in the future, as a successful brand in this field.\n\nWe have no doubt that you will love the games immensely because we love creating these games. We're sure you'll notice this as you are experiencing our stories in the comfort of your homes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWhile the games are played, no component gets harmed. With the help of the setup guide, it will take at most ten minutes to repack the game to its replayable form. This way, you can replay the game, let your friends play, or even gift it to your loved ones.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur purpose in creating this project was to make our board games similar to real-life room escape games. It's not just a tabletop game. What we aim is you trying to escape from one or two rooms you locked yourself by solving the puzzles we designed. Therefore, we have developed a mechanism called an easy-to-lock system.\n \nThe easy-to-lock system inside the boxes can also be used with our different game scenarios in the future. You won't have to get these mechanisms for our new games again. You will also be able to use these mechanisms to play PnP games that we plan to publish more often.\nSustainable materials\nOur purpose in creating this project was to make our board games similar to real-life room escape games.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Sherlock's Mysteries seamlessly blends a narrative murder mystery experience with the puzzle and enigma solving that you would find in an escape room game. With more than 150 puzzles ranging from ciphers and codes to association and logic, there is something for everyone regardless of skill or experience level.  \n\nLucid Dreaming is perfect to play at home, at work, at school or on the go. The graphic heavy and visually stimulating puzzles are great for sharing the experience with a friend or loved one and, the handheld size makes it easy to bring anywhere you go.\n\nThe Sherlock's Mysteries Mobile App is available on all Apple & Android devices. Once you have downloaded the application you WILL NOT REQUIRE AN INTERNET CONNECTION which means you can play anytime without worrying about data or WiFi coverage. The app is riddled with Easter eggs, optical illusions, clues, videos, evidence files and mini brain teasers for true puzzle addicts. The app also handles all the multi-stage hints and solutions for each chapter so that you never get stuck. \n\n Lucid Dreaming is broken down into 10 individual chapters that are connected by an arching narrative that unravels as you progress through the game. This culminates in an incredible meta puzzle that will test your wits and push the limits of your abilities as a detective. Each chapter takes 1-2+ hours to complete but there is no time limit and you can jump in wherever you left off last time. The Deluxe & Collector's Edition Journals also contain a Prequel & Bonus Chapter for even more puzzling.\nThe Attache contains all 10 Chapters of Lucid Dreaming in a high quality and incredibly detailed suitcase that is filled to the brim with clues, locks, puzzles, tools, mystery items, boxes, letters and much more.  Simply assemble your team, open up the Attache, choose a chapter and begin the most detailed and immersive escape room style experience you will ever play from the comfort of your own home. The Attache also contains a refill kit so that you can pass on the experience once you've completed the game. The Prequel and Bonus Chapter game materials are also available in the Deluxe and Collector's Edition Reward Tiers. \n\nThe Attache takes Lucid Dreaming and kicks it up a notch by bringing the story to real life with physical puzzles that you must interact with in order to progress. Each and every item inside The Attache has been carefully curated and thoughtfully integrated into the game. Many objects are reused throughout the game in different ways, just as a detective refers back to prior evidence throughout an investigation. The puzzle experiences are focused on realistic and logical objectives that help your team unravel the mysteries as you solve them along the way. \n\nJust like in a real escape room game - The Attache will have you and your team discovering codes, symbols, numbers, letters and keys needed to open real locks and ciphers. By partnering directly with hardware manufacturers, Sherlock's Mysteries is able to include an incredible assortment of high quality mechanical puzzles at an affordable price. All of the locks can be reset and used again with the included refill kit in order to pass along the game to others, and they also make great keepsake items. \n\nEach chapter takes 1-2+ hours to complete but there is no time limit and multi-stage hints and solutions are available via the mobile app at any time. The app will also provide your group with a soundtrack and video series for each chapter. Although the game contains a meta puzzle that brings together all 10 chapters - you can play them in any order. That means that you can play with different friends, family or loved ones at any time regardless of where you are in the game. Sherlock's Mysteries was designed with escape room and tabletop game enthusiasts in mind. This means that the puzzles are intricately detailed and incredibly well integrated into the story line that unfolds as you progress. Since no outside knowledge is needed, The Attache will keep you engaged whether you've played 300 escape rooms or none at all.  For those with a keen eye and a hunger for puzzles, there are Easter eggs, mini games and plot developments that only the most astute observer can discover. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSherlock's Mysteries: Lucid Dreaming is an incredibly ambitious project that has taken over a year of development to bring to life. Without our experienced team of escape room designers, graphic artists, fabricators and writers, none of this would have been possible. \n\nAlthough The Journal in Book Format has already been written and is ready for mass production there are still challenges that face us in the months ahead. \n\nJournal Challenge #1: 3 Different Versions. The Journal is being produced in Standard, Deluxe & Collector's Edition Formats. As with any publishing there are certain volume requirements to meet in order to bring the cost down sufficiently for consumers. To ensure the cost and timeline requirements are met, we have set out our initial goal high enough to produce The Journals en masse and achieve economies of scale.\n\nJournal Challenge #2: Multilayered Graphics. To write an interactive puzzle adventure that caters to even the most sophisticated of puzzle connoisseurs, the novel must have incredible depth in the puzzle visualization. To ensure that the graphics are crisp, engaging & fair - we have made several rounds of prototyping across dozens of iterations so that the experience is perfect from start to finish. \n\nThe Attache is undoubtedly one of the most detailed and comprehensive tabletop escape games ever to be produced and as such there are numerous design and execution risks that we have sought to mitigate. Since our team is comprised of professional escape room designers we have a unique advantage to understanding and assembling supply chain management and logistics. By partnering directly with manufacturers we are able to provide incredible cost to value ratio for our backers and guarantee only the highest quality items are used. We are confident that each and every item in the game is of movie prop quality and The Attache is an art piece as much as it is a puzzle adventure. \n\nAttache Challenge #1: Material production and sourcing. Luckily for us, the team at Sherlock's Mysteries is comprised of escape room designers and fabricators that have a manufacturing warehouse in Vancouver, Canada dedicated to creating turnkey escape room games. By leasing a portion of that space we are able to benefit from the manufacturing and fulfillment center which has high tech equipment ranging from Laser Engravers to 3D Printers, Large Format printers & CNC Machines. This means that most of the in-game materials can be produced and fulfilled in-house, thus reducing our exposure to outside factors. By leveraging our existing relationships with other suppliers (for things like ciphers, locks and hardware) we are able to buy in bulk and achieve economies of scale that are essential to our price points viability. \n\nAttache Challenge #2: Game play - for years there have been tabletop escape room games available on the market but as enthusiasts ourselves we were often underwhelmed by their scope and detail. Most games featured generic storylines and paper based puzzles that had us adding codes or folding paper to unlock the next step. We wanted to bring the game to real life in a 3 dimensional way and elevate the playing experience away from paper based puzzles. To do so we carefully picked and assembled a vast array of tools, clues, locks and ciphers that brings a level of tangibility and intrigue only accomplished by real world objects. Adding physical items is great but in order to create a compelling experience those items must be used and reused in a thoughtful way. Each and every item inside The Attache is deeply integrated into the experience and no object has just one simple function. After thoroughly researching and play-testing the vast majority of games in this genre, we are confident that The Attache will propose a bespoke and unforgettable experience for players around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe Journal is comprised of heavy weight paper and extremely well bound by our made in America publisher. The Journal will require you to fold, cut and draw on pages so although it is not re-usable, it still must stand up to 20+ hours of continued use across days, weeks or even months of effort. \n\nThe Attache on the other hand is fully re-usable and comes with a refill kit so that the entire game can be replayed. Each of the game play pieces are made from high quality materials such as linen paper, oak wood, stainless steel, brass and aluminum. Even after multiple times playing through each chapter, many of the interior components will live on for decades and can be added to your keepsake and display cases forever.\nReusability and recyclability\nAlthough everything in The Journal and The Attache is 100% recyclable we would prefer that our backers pass on the game by selling or giving it away once they are done. To help with this we have provided 1 or more refill kits in each of The Attache reward tiers.\nSustainable materials\nThe Journal is made from 100% recycled paper.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nBy centralizing our manufacturing and fulfillment centers we are able to ensure that strict recycling and composting standards are met.\nSustainable Distribution\nIn an effort to reduce our carbon footprint we will be shipping pallets of stock to several distribution centers (in Vancouver, New York & France).

King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are the primary inspiration for the first Sentient attribute starter deck. The playstyle is aggressive and straight forward. This is an excellent deck for beginners.\nThe Beast Deck: This deck focuses on famous beasts, creatures, and behemoths from myth, and legend. Everything from the mighty Leviathan, to the ferocious Minotaur, live in this deck. The Beast attribute deck gets better the closer to defeat it gets. Like a cornered animal, your opponent must defeat you quickly, or they\u2019ll soon regret it.\nThe Horror Deck: This deck focuses on monsters, horrible creatures, or angry gods throughout history. The things that lurk in the heart of the Horror deck are terrible to behold. This deck utilizes the fear of the unknown. The Hero you play at the beginning of the turn, may not be the Hero on the field at the end of your turn.\nThe Divine Deck: This deck is made of gods, angels, demons, and prophets throughout human history. Divine intervention is almost always in your favor when you play these cards. The Divine attribute focuses on control. Specifically, how many cards you have in your hand, and your opponent has in theirs. Ten, five, two. These numbers will define the strength of your Heroes.\nThe Given Deck: This deck is made up of machines, creations, and engines scattered throughout humanity\u2019s past, and future. The Given attribute focuses on continual improvement. The Heroes you play at the end of the game will receive benefits from the Heroes you played at the beginning.\nThe Essence Deck: This deck is made up of events, actions, and unchanging elements of life. The creatures of the dark forest, the unmovable mountain, or the simple virus. It plays by a very specific set of rules, and your opponent will be playing by those rules as well.\nDinn will launch with two types of booster packs.\nA traditional booster pack: with over one-hundred cards.

Protesters fill the street, calling to de-fund and disarm uniformed police, transferring the money into mental health, addiction and other public safety or welfare programs. \nI'm a science fiction and sometime crime writer, so I asked myself what that transformation would look like from the perspective of the people in the middle of it. The answer I imagined is the meat of this story.\nWhat It's Like\nI've written about crime before. After the Cops is probably most like A Hole in the Darkness, which you can click on and read right now. Both focus on law enforcement as it's happening, with an emphasis on the difficulties and moral compromises made in the moment. It also bears some resemblance to NECROCHROME, which posits a radical change to homicide investigation. After the Cops is more realistic than NECROCHROME, however. There's little new technology on display in it. Its events could, realistically, be happening in 2022.\nAs mentioned, it's under 5,000 words, so you can read it in one sitting. It's the story of someone who signs up to be a post-cop community servant, navigating the changes and challenges of being unarmed and coping with a distrustful and fed-up public.\nWhat I'm Doing\nYou can read A Hole in the Darkness and NECROCHROME, and other crime stories like A Series of Small, Precise Cuts or These People Mean Nothing to Each Other through the fiction library on my web site, www.gregstolze.com. All these stories have been underwritten by fans like you, so that they can be free for everyone and, hopefully, create more fans. This is what I'll do with After the Cops when it funds. \nStretch Goals\n2020 has not been hugely fertile for my creativity, so I'm not sitting on a backlog of unpublished stories, but I do have a couple stretch goals in mind.\nAt $1000, I'll record the story as a podcast for backers. If you haven't heard my voice, slide on over to my Soundcloud where you can listen to me playing various games and decide if you want that voice in your ear for more than ten minutes. I can promise a decent recording. Some of the game recordings suffer from the limits of Discord and Skype as signal bearers, but this podcast would be recorded solidly before release.\nIf we manage to raise $1400, I'll not only record the podcast, I'll put that out under a CC license too, so that everyone can hear it -- not just backers. \nTangible Goodies\nAt different backer levels, you can get patches, linocut prints, or both.\nThe linocuts are all very different, combining different colors, textures and pigments in this abstracted \"what's next?\" graphic.\nHere's what the patch looks like!\nThe patches are in hand.

You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. The Pledge Manager tool is a 3rd party product that we use to manage orders outside of Kickstarter.\nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nAs always, AEG does not make any profit on shipping & handling fees. We charge our best estimate as to what costs we will actually incur for the fulfillment process.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in Canada, the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA.\nEU (plus UK, Norway and Switzerland), Canadian, Australian and New Zealand Backers:\nWe will ship your package with customs and VAT/GST prepaid. You should not have to pay any amount due to receive your order.\nUS Backers in States where AEG has a \u201cNexus\u201d:\nBy law AEG is required to collect and remit sales tax in any state where AEG has a warehouse, a business address, or where sales within that state exceed certain minimums. For this campaign, Backers in the following states will pay 8% sales tax:\nCalifornia, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas.\nSales tax rules in the US change rapidly and additional states may require us to collect and remit sales tax during the period when Backers are completing their orders and we will add those states as required.\nDeckhand Reward:\nUSA: $13\nCANADA: $27\nEUROPE: Germany $17; EU + UK, Norway & Switzerland $25\nOCEANA: Australia: $30; New Zealand: $48\nASIA:  $17 to China & Hong Kong; $44 to Japan, Singapore, South Korea, & Taiwan\n  Legendary Captain and All Gameplay Rewards:\nUSA: $23\nCANADA: $32\nEUROPE: Germany $19; EU + UK, Norway & Switzerland $26\nOCEANA: Australia: $35; New Zealand: $52\nASIA:  $22 to China & Hong Kong; $45 to Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan\nAll-In Reward:\nUSA: $25\nCANADA: $37\nEUROPE: Germany $20; EU + UK, Norway & Switzerland $27\nOCEANA: Australia: $40; New Zealand: $66\nASIA:  $25 to China & Hong Kong; $51 to Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan\n  Estimating additional shipping for multiple copies:\ntl;dr: It will be cheaper to order two or more copies of the base game as one order than as multiple orders but we cannot predetermine how much cheaper.\nOur pledge manager will allow you to add multiple copies of the game to your order and shipping for the whole package will be calculated at checkout. Shipping & handling for the order will be calculated at checkout. You will see a reduction in shipping per unit but it's impossible to give a single answer on what that will be - it's based on where the order is being shipped, what the total weight & size of the order is, etc. We won't try to figure out a break point where the shipping \"resets\" for a 2nd outer carton (or cartons); we'll just subsidize any marginal cost changes if the order is too big for one outer carton.\nEstimating additional shipping for Add-ons:\nGenerally speaking we are able to put Add-on components into the same master carton as the base Reward in your Pledge which makes them less expensive to ship than they would be if shipped individually. When you build your order in the Pledge Manager the system will generate a shipping & handling cost based on the weight, size, and taxes due for your order. Add-ons typically add a few dollars in shipping & handling cost, add-ons of whole games add about 50% of the base shipping cost.\nRestricted Delivery:\nDue to the increasing frequency of Kickstarter Rewards failing to clear customs or being lost or stolen during delivery AEG now ships only to the following countries:\n\n                                      United States, Canada, United Kingdom, European Union + Norway and Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China (including Hong Kong), Japan, Singapore, South Korea & Taiwan.\nAll other backers must arrange to have their reward received in one of those countries and freight-forwarded, at backer expense, to their final delivery address.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 10% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of your rewards. If you believe that your reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for refunds or re-shipments for packages held by customs or a government agency.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nOther than as noted elsewhere in these terms & conditions, if any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Peerless teachers, legendary for their mastery of the Arha martial disciplines, and responsible for the training of all Arha warriors. To become an Arha Sensei, one must embark on a training regimen of unparalleled severity. The final test given, before a pupil was allowed to become a master, was known formally as The First Dawn. The trial begins with the intense pain of ritual blinding, the monks then meditate all through the night, focusing on the All-Seeing Eye; those who witness the rising sun through spiritual vision go on to join the ranks of the revered Arha Sensei; those who fail, remain blind and are exiled from the temple.\nRunic Lycanthrope\nLycanthropy is a gift reserved for the most devoted of the Lifebound warriors. Humans who defend nature, despite extraordinary odds, are offered this rite by druids of the stone circle. If the warrior accepts, they will endure a month of nightmares, each a surreal puzzle, with an arcane rune of personal strength in its solution. On the night of the ritual, the warrior must etch each of the arcane runes into their flesh, binding lunar spirits with their mortal blood, transforming into a runic lycanthrope for the first time. \nMechana Initiate\nIt is said that the ancient Mechana language did not have a word for truth, only perspective. This may be the reason that the Mechana are known for their continuous innovation and unmatched drive. Mechana Initiates are individuals who excel in dynamic thinking and are sought out by Mechana Engineers to reimagine everything from weapons of war to the laws of the universe. After time as an Initiate, the individual may move on to new projects derived from their unique perspective, but the transition from Initiate to Engineer is simply a matter of public perception, as the Mechana themselves don\u2019t use these restricting terms to define themselves. \nWe saw the 10th-anniversary of Ascension as an opportunity to unify the style, and develop an identity and aesthetic that says, \u201cThis is Ascension evolved.\u201d \nWhen we look back at all the art we\u2019ve made over the last decade of Ascension, we saw a story spanning thousands of years. Many of our original pieces looked like they could have come from a fantasy storybook, with the players taking on the role of heroes in the adventure. \nWe decided to feature this element of our history with art that reminded us about the oceans of time we cross throughout the game. In Ascension, we\u2019re looking back at a long past filled with gods and magic. When you\u2019re playing Ascension you\u2019re playing through these epochs, running into legendary heroes, monsters, and constructs along the way.  \nTo illustrate this we commissioned art focused on a central figure,  using metallic textures, and a lot less rendering than modern styles to create the feeling of an illustrated storybook or medieval tapestry. All that, but with a little Ascension flare. \nThe goal was to develop an art style that told unforgettable stories and appears to have lasted for generations. It is a style inspired by stories like the Illiad, the Epic of Gilgamesh, and the best Arthurian lore.  Our 10th-anniversary art is intended to pay homage to our past while bringing us into a new age of Ascension. \nBelow are the estimated shipping costs by pledge level and region. Please note these are subject to change and do not include any additional taxes or fees. Shipping will be charged in our pledge manager after the campaign. We have tried to use local shipping depots wherever possible to make your shipping costs as affordable as we can. We do not make any profit off shipping costs, and in fact may subsidize shipping in some regions.\nYou may be charged taxes or customs fees based on your region. Backers in the United States that reside in CA and OH will be charged state sales tax and backers in all other states are responsible to report and pay the sales tax according to their local state sales tax law. We are absorbing VAT costs for backers in the UK and EU, so backers in those regions should not owe any additional customs fees.\nShow off your support for Ascension Tactics by using one of these avatars on your Kickstarter profile!\nStone Blade Entertainment is an industry-leading design studio for strategy games and has been a long time partner of Ultra PRO, a leading publisher of games and gaming accessories.

More moving parts means more potential problems. Here\u2019s a list of what needs to be accomplished:\n\n-Miniatures that need to be sculpted, test printed, and then manufactured.\n-Cards that need art, design, and printing.\n-Boards that need to be designed, mocked up, tested, and printed.\n-A rule set that needs to be fun, elegant, and teachable. \n-Scenarios that need stories, rules, and testing.\n-Packaging needs to be designed, built, tested and manufactured.\n-Customer service is key and needs to be handled effectively. \n-All this needs to come together into one very cool, very awesome package.\n\nBut here\u2019s the awesome part, we\u2019re nearly done with these steps. Preliminary art is done, sculpts have been printed, rules, scenarios and maps have been tested. From here, we\u2019ll be working on meeting our stretch goals and making sure everything comes together for our patrons.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nThe estimated delivery date for Ascension Tactics is, it's important to reiterate, an estimate.\n\nDifferent regions will likely receive the game on different dates, we\u2019ll try to get things out so people receive them in a small window, but some of that is out of our control.\n\nThe core version of Ascension Tactics is nearly complete. we\u2019re finishing up talks now with miniature manufacturers, and already have existing agreements with card and packaging companies, so we don\u2019t see there being a problem delivering on time. \n\nREFUND POLICY\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, fees included. After which, we have a policy of no questions asked for a refund, but will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe (as we will not be refunded by them after this 14 day period), Pledge Manager and also the other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. Once we have started to process and packed your order, when the first ship leaves China, refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, fees included. Refunds within the 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Any refunds requested after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in the USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Full Deck is an immersive, three-book escape puzzle collection, where you use a book of evidence, a serial killer's diary and a lone cop's sleep journal to piece together the  puzzles and mysteries contained within. \nEstimated total playing time: 10-12 hours!\nFor four long days in 2020, a serial killer terrorised a sleepy provincial town in England, and appeared to always be one step ahead of the Police. In order to fully close this case, the Police have now released three items, containing over 90 puzzles and mysteries, and are calling on you to help solve them...\n You can play Full Deck several ways:\nBacking BOOKSHELF, which includes all three books\nBacking ONLOOKER (digital) or CRIME BOARD (physical), which is a self-contained puzzle\nBookshelf \nThree distinct books make up the Full Deck set.\nThis  is a collection of three books, each set inside a crime narrative, where you have to piece together the clues and solve the 90 puzzles contained within.\nThe books consist of:  \nA full-colour textured paperback book\nMasterpiece - Released by the Police, this is a facsimile copy of the serial killer's diary. Read through the diary and see if you can uncover their motivation, plans and other nefarious ideas. The diary is written in broken prose, so you will need to have your most cryptic, riddling minds active to solve the challenges contained within.  \n54 images of crucial evidence to solve the case.\nEvidence - 54 specific items of interest to the Police, from ticket stubs to menu orders and receipts. This is a self-contained puzzle book, as each item also gives clues to a specific playing card value and suit. The items contribute heavily to the storyline, and will give valuable clues to solving the other puzzles.\nThe Evidence book also has answer grids. The Full Deck series uses a brand new answer validation system (BinCheck), so you will not need access to a computer to see if you are correct. This book will be fully printed in colour.\nIf you'd like to have have the actual pieces of evidence, please look at our Crime Board or Expert Reward. \nA full colour, glossy journal.\nRedacted - A facsimile of the journal kept by the investigating Police Officer during the event. The pages have been written in detail, but you will need your powers of deduction (as well as some cross-referencing) in order to work out the information which has been redacted by the Police, for fear of reprisals or lawsuits. This book will be fully printed in colour.   \n Want to play the standalone game, with 54 pieces of facsimile evidence? Dust off your cork board, get your pins ready, and take a look at our Crime Board Reward...\n Crime Board \n54-pieces of facsimile evidence, from tickets stubs to crucial ephemera.\nAlso available is Crime Board. This is a physical collection of all the items of evidence, complete in a genuine evidence bag. Now is your chance to recreate your own crime board, by using these tickets, leaflets, photographs and receipts to build either a timeline of the events, or connect them together as a standalone puzzle.\nCrime Board has a game built into it - each of the 54 items has a playing card suit and value hidden within it, so can be played either on it's own (find all the playing cards), or as part of the Full Deck game (for example, seeking out a name that visited a specific location from one of the pieces of evidence).\nSome of the Crime Board elements in action!\nPlease note that the items in Crime Board are the same as those in the Evidence book, but we believe these add an exciting element to the game, and are perfect for a group of detectives to work through together! Below are some ways backers could play Crime Board:\nThose with books might find the places items are mentioned at or hinted towards, and put them in those sections of the book.\nBlu-tack a deck of cards on the wall, and see if you can place the right item on the right playing card (good for sifting evidence).\n\"Borrow\" a rolling whiteboard from work and create a visual timeline.\nClear the table, and have friends over to sift and sort the clues, uncovering all the puzzles (remember, this is a standalone game, AND can be used with the books).\nReward Options \nFor those on a budget, we are offering a digital-only copy of Evidence. If you love the idea of being your own detective, we are offering Crime Board, which is a physical collection of the evidence, supplied in a genuine evidence bag. For booklovers, you can back to get either the three copies on their own (Bookshelf Pledge), or you can upgrade to the Expert pledge, which includes all three books AND the Crime Board reward. Lastly, we have an extremely limited number of naming rewards available. Please note that these prices are below eventual retail prices.\nBackground\nThis has been created by Stephen, one half of The Escapages, publishers of Escape Books. We have published eight books so far, the most recent one, Flatpak, being successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2019. Flatpak was an interactive puzzle escape book in the guise of a furniture catalogue, and the full-colour print contained over 120 puzzles. \n\"As a lifelong fan of crime fiction and drama, I have always been most interested in the little details; the crime board of evidence, the whiteboard timelines, the little baggies of clues, the serial killer's diary. I felt that there was an extraordinary opportunity to build a pacy narrative simply by using these materials alone. The result is this; an incredibly complex intertwining set of storylines, combined with photorealistic detail and some deliciously-challenging puzzles.\"\nSee Stephen talk about Escapages and the Full Deck project here (18 minute video).\nSolve the riddles within the diary to help crack the case.\nDetails\nHow will the puzzles work?\nThere are three distinct types of puzzle included in Full Deck, outlined below. They are are ordered by difficulty, starting with the easiest.\nEvidence - In this book are photographs of 54 key pieces of evidence from the Full Deck crime story. Contained within each item is a clue or hint toward an ordinary playing card suit and value - including two jokers.\nRedacted - This book is the sleep journal of the investigating Police Officer, which has been check through by the Crown Prosecution Service, and key elements of the story have been redacted. The puzzles within this book rely on you drawing information from the journal itself, and Masterpiece.\nMasterpiece - our killer wrote his plans and thoughts in prose, list, diagrams and poetry. You will have to dig through the book, sometimes linking information from Evidence and Redacted, in order to solve the riddles and puzzles contained within.\nThe journal will guide you, if you can only solve the redacted sections...\nSchedule\nTo avoid any disappointment, we have created a schedule with enough breathing space to allow for any unforeseen minor delays, as outlined below. We aim to complete different milestones ahead of this, but hope that this gives some idea of what we are working toward.\nAugust - October 2020 Completion of the text for Masterpiece and Redacted.\nOctober 2020 Generation of the BinCheck grids. First Play test round.\nNovember 2020 Typesetting of all three books.\nDecember 2020 Printing of proof copies.\nJanuary 2021 Professional copy editing and proofreading. Play testing.\nFebruary 2021 Revisions made. Shipping costs and addresses confirmed.\nMarch 2021 Worldwide dispatch.\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have built two complimentary products for Full Deck - the books, and the crime board set. Below are the stretch goals for them both:\nAs you can see, there are dedicated upgrades for both the books and the crime board. Please bear in mind that if you pledge at EXPERT level, you are contributing to scores for both! If someone backs just the books, that is added to the Bookshelf tally, and so on.\nAt the time of writing, we are already over halfway to our first Stretch Goal for both, so please read below to see how we can achieve this faster than you might expect.\nWe are trying something a little different for this campaign, and asking you to really help get the word out about this project on Social Media. To that end, we have built in a Sharing Stretch range of rewards too!\nAll you have to do is share the above link (bit.ly/BackFullDeck), and we will do the rest. Every validated click counts, and will earn more puzzles for the book set. Plus, if/when we reach 2,000 validated clicks, we will include a customised pin badge for all physical backers!\nIf you have a large fanbase online and would like a customised bit.ly link, please do get in touch via our messages, and we can provide one bespoke for you. Please get in touch for more details.\n\nShipping\nPlease note that shipping is not included in your pledge, and will instead by charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. There will be the option of standard or tracked shipping. Shipping is likely to be around \u00a36 domestically, and \u00a310 internationally, and will be calculated near to dispatch based on current rates and accurate weights.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is The Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge?\nThe Labyrinth is a unique multi-platform experience unlike any other - a combination of an escape room, puzzle hunt, mystery novel, and alternate reality game. You will receive a crate full of everything you need to participate in the challenge from the comfort of your home, including engaging physical hands-on puzzles, puzzle boxes, an online forum, models, photos, printed maps, tools, and ciphers. The goal of the challenge is to move through the rooms of a mythical labyrinth, solve the different clues in each room, and advance to the  center. Each puzzle leads into the next,  and to solve them all,  you will need to think outside of the box!\nOver 55 Puzzles To Solve for Hours of Entertainment\nThe Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge will include hands-on physical puzzles, paper puzzles, mechanical puzzles, ciphers, folding puzzles, logic puzzles, illusions, riddles, and pattern games. We are designing each puzzle ourselves specifically for The Labyrinth, and are placing an emphasis on immersive puzzles with physical objects and unique solutions.\nDECIPHER CLUES AND SOLVE PUZZLES\nTo complete the challenge, you must use clues to solve many smaller puzzles, which will lead to other clues in a larger interwoven narrative. Once you solve the smaller puzzles, you can  combine the solutions in order to unlock and solve the overarching meta-puzzles.\nSolving all of the puzzles in the Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge will provide at least 8-10 hours of puzzle-solving and clue-cracking for a group of 3-4 people. The challenge can be played individually or with a group, and the game includes a huge number of puzzles and associated content. We have designed puzzles that will be accessible to people who have never participated in a puzzle hunt or escape room, as well as puzzles that will challenge even the most experienced puzzle hunters and escape room addicts. Some puzzles will be easily and quickly solved, while others require a more in-depth examination. The complete Labyrinth challenge is designed to provide hours of entertainment and immersion into this unique experience, with a story that unfolds as the puzzles progress.\n The Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge Will Include 55+ Puzzles With: \n- At least 8 hands-on physical puzzles. More will be added as stretch goals are unlocked.\n- 2 Large-scale locked boxes with hidden compartments, and additional puzzles embedded within.\n- At least 4 hand-crafted puzzle boxes with multi-step solutions. \n- Multiple paper puzzles that can be examined, manipulated, and assembled, including ciphers, posters, maps, and folding puzzles.\n- The Labyrinth Solution Log Book - for recording notes, theories, and the puzzle solutions. Use the Solution Log Book to keep track of information for previous clues and solve the meta-puzzles.\n- Online content including a solution-checking forum, hint-system, and additional online story components.\n- 360 Degree Virtual Reality spaces for several of the clues,  as well as cardboard VR glasses to view them. Become immersed in the world of the Labyrinth and solve the clues hidden within its walls.\n The Idea\nThe idea behind The Labyrinth is to create a game of puzzles and riddles that anyone can participate in from anywhere in the world, and to encourage people to  use their imaginations and enjoy the experience of working to solve the clues in a unique treasure hunt.\nThere are many incredible existing large-scale treasure hunts, but many rely on all participants being in the same city. The goal of The Labyrinth is to give everyone who loves puzzles access to this kind of experience.\nTHE BACKSTORY:\nIn many of the sacred histories of the world's oldest empires, there are references to the legendary King Lars Porsena, who ruled the Etruscan Empire from the capital city of Clusium in 500 BC.\n Upon his death, Porsena ordered the construction of a tomb within a vast hidden labyrinth, a place to conceal the treasures of his empire.  Porsena tasked his most ingenious subjects with devising a series of challenges to fill every room along the path to the center, and decreed that  whoever could decipher these clues and reach the heart of the maze would claim the treasure. \nIn 89 BC, the Roman general Cornelius Sulla sacked Clusium, and razed the monumental structure marking the Labyrinth's entrance to the ground. All knowledge of the labyrinth was subsequently lost with those who perished.\nFor centuries, archaeologists and explorers have painstakingly searched for clues and information about the entrance, with no results.\n Until, in a recent excavation, an ancient talisman was uncovered deep within what was believed to be one of regal Etruscan tombs. Working with astronomers to decipher the symbols on the talisman, the leaders of the excavation produced a series of coordinates for a remote location. A scan of the area with the latest sonar technology has revealed a series of previously undiscovered caves, which seem to connect to a network of tunnels that stretch for miles underground ...\nNow, a team of treasure hunters has asked you to join them as they enter the Labyrinth and attempt to solve the series of enigmas that lead to the treasure room.\nIf you choose to enter, beware -- The Etruscan Empire devised the puzzles to provide a challenge for even the most clever solvers. They also created many additional defense measures to safeguard their treasures from outsiders, and an ancient force, embedded within the Labyrinth's very walls, continues to fortify this place against intrusion. The only way out of the maze is through its center, and if you are not careful, you could find yourself trapped within its endless myriad of rooms. Though the risks are great, an unimaginable treasure awaits you if you succeed.\nTo Play:\nStep 1: Receive the full Labyrinth crate, with all of the clues locked within.\nStep 2: Crack the codes, decipher the clues, and begin solving the puzzles.\n Step 3: Solve the physical hands-on puzzles, open additional locked boxes, and verify your solutions in the online forum. Discover the story of the Labyrinth as the clues unfold. \n\n\nStep 4: Write down each of the puzzle solutions. These will be used in the Labyrinth's meta-puzzles.\nPledge Levels\nWe are offering a variety of rewards for different pledge levels, and hope that there will be something for everyone in our range of reward tiers!\nThe Stretch Goals\nFrom additional puzzles to new VR spaces, we have a number of stretch goals planned for the campaign. More will be added as each level is unlocked.\nWe unlocked all of our original campaign Stretch Goals! For the last two days of the campaign, we are adding in one additional bonus stretch goal, a new artifact for backers, hidden within one of the puzzles.\nTimeline\n *Please note that this represents our conservative timeline, from the campaign through production and fulfillment, with built-in extra time for unexpected delays in manufacturing and shipping. We will of course try to send the rewards out sooner, and will continue to share project updates with backers.\nThe Budget Breakdown:\nFabricating the Rewards: 60%\nShipping and warehouse fees: 20%\nTaxes and duties: 10%\nKickstarter fees and payment processing fees: 10%\nShipping\nWe are partnering with fulfillment and distribution centers to lower our shipping costs, and to ensure that backers' funds are devoted to the development of the puzzles, and not to the shipping. Please note that the list below shows estimates for the shipping costs based on current prices, and shipping will be charged after the campaign concludes through a pledge manager. Depending on your address and the cost of postage during the fulfillment period, shipping cost may be adjusted by marginal amounts.\nCustoms Friendly Shipping to backers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China. Backers outside of these regions will be responsible for any taxes or duties that arise during shipping.\n Below is a Breakdown of Shipping Costs For Different Regions:\nUnited States - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: Free, All other Reward Tiers: $14\nCanada - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $5, All other Reward Tiers: $22\nUnited Kingdom and EU Group 1 (Sweden, Spain, Slovenia, Slovakia, Poland, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Italy, Ireland, Hungary, Germany, France, Czech Republic, Belgium, Austria) - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $5, All other Reward Tiers: $22\nEU Group 2 (Romania, Portugal, Malta, Latvia, Greece, Finland, Estonia, Denmark, Cyprus, Croatia, Bulgaria) - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $5, All other Reward Tiers: $26\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $5, All other Reward Tiers: $26\nEast Asia (Japan, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam) -Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $6, All other Reward Tiers: $36\nNorway and Switzerland -  Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $8, All other Reward Tiers: $30\nAustralia - Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $6, All other Reward Tiers: $24\nNew Zealand -  Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $8, All other Reward Tiers: $39\nAll Other Countries: Treasure Hunter in Training Puzzle: $15, All other Reward Tiers: $55+ **\n**All other countries disclaimer: We are willing to ship worldwide, but please note that countries not listed in the shipping chart above will be considered as \u201cship at your own risk.\u201d This means that we will not be liable for mishandled packages. Due to USPS restrictions, we will be unable to ship to the countries listed under \"International Mail Service Suspensions\" on the USPS Website: USPS Link \nWhy Pledge During the Campaign?\nBecause this game has many unique components that we are manufacturing ourselves, we don't plan on ever being able to give The Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge a commercial release. Our plan for the Labyrinth is to run this Kickstarter campaign (and only on Kickstarter, not on any other platform), and then ship the orders to our backers. This means that if you would like to be able to experience this game, pledging to the campaign is the best way to do so, as we will not be offering additional releases.\nThe Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge is a passion project, one that is two years in the making. Our goal is to create a unique, well-crafted, and immersive experience, and we promise to create a game that we and our backers can be proud of. Thank you so much to our backers for all of the support!\nA Note on the Types of Materials Used in the Standard, Deluxe, and Collector's Edition Tiers\nWe have received a few questions from backers concerning the difference between the materials used in the Standard Edition of the game and the upgraded components in the Deluxe and Collectors Editions, so we would like to take the opportunity to post a few samples of the materials used in the game.\nWe love the feel of wooden mechanical puzzles and puzzle boxes, and puzzles in the Standard version of the game will be made primarily out of Baltic birch and pine, both of which are a durable and high-quality materials that are the industry standard, and they will be sanded, stained, and sealed to provide a quality finish. Puzzles in the Deluxe version of the game will be made from varieties of hardwood that are considered to be more premium materials for woodworking (like maple, oak, and walnut), because of their richer grains and textures. These kinds of woods have a great feel to them, and they complement the look of the game as high-quality artifacts. Components that will be upgraded in the deluxe version of the game include all of the physical puzzles, including the puzzle boxes, larger locked boxes, and the mechanical puzzles (at least 15 puzzles that are integral to the Labyrinth, and potentially more as stretch goals are unlocked). Additionally, the paper puzzles in the deluxe version will be upgraded to art-quality prints on museum quality paper. In a nutshell, the standard version is more for backers who would like to play the game with well-crafted components, while the Deluxe and Collectible versions are more for backers seeking beautifully and meticulously crafted display-quality puzzles that are both part of the game and keepsakes in their own right. \nIn the photo, the piece on the left is a drawer from one of the puzzle boxes in the standard edition, made of the baltic birch plywood. It is a lighter material, but still very sturdy and durable.\nThe two wood pieces in the middle are red oak (which is placed so that it is covering a spoiler), a puzzle box made from rosewood, and the sample on the far right is walnut, which are all materials that we are using in the deluxe and collectors versions of the game. (In the standard version, puzzles in the lighter baltic birch are sometimes stained to look like a darker wood.) The Deluxe materials are heartier, and have a smoother feel. We are very proud of both versions, and are excited to fabricate these puzzles for our backers.\nFollow Us For More Information about the Labyrinth\nWe'll be posting campaign updates, sample puzzles, and special promotions throughout the Kickstarter, so head on our to the Labyrinth social media pages to stay up-to-date on all of the bonus content!\nInstagram: @labyrinthpuzzlechallenge\nFacebook: Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge\nEmail: ellusionadventuregames@gmail.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFabricating the Rewards and Testing the Puzzles:\nWe have already designed the paper puzzles, puzzle boxes, and mechanical puzzles, and will be manufacturing them in-house. For this reason, we do not anticipate major manufacturing delays, as we will have a hand in every aspect of the manufacturing and fabrication process. We have also built in additional time in the production schedule to account for delays in shipments of raw materials (like the wood needed to build the puzzles) and equipment failures (like needing to repair a laser cutter, printer, or CNC machine.) \nWe will also extensively playtest all puzzles to ensure that they are solvable, and also present the proper degree of challenge level. We have already tested the majority of puzzles during the development phase with a dedicated group of puzzle hunt and escape room enthusiasts, and will continue to do so should any design changes arise.\nAll puzzles and game materials shown in the campaign represent prototypes from our development and playtesting, and illustrate the standard of quality and quantity of puzzles within the Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge. Puzzle designs may change during the fabrication phase, but all designs will still represent this standard. We will strive to produce puzzles of the highest quality, and we will keep backers updated as the fabrication process progresses.\n\n\nRefunds\nAll pledges may be refunded up to 14 days after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign. We will be unable to refund the charges incurred by Pledge Manager, Kickstarter, or other charges for your payment (for example: PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 10-15% of the full payment. Partial Refunds may be issued after this period on a case-by-case basis in extreme instances if requested. After we have started the packaging and shipment process (3-months prior to the shipping date) we will no longer be able to process refunds of any kind.\nPlease also note that anyone who does not complete the pledge manager survey by the required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund. Additionally, not filling out the pledge manager survey may cause a delay in the shipping of their rewards.\n\nShipping\nOrganizing the shipping and fulfillment schedule for a puzzle hunt with multiple components is a complex undertaking, and we will be partnering with a fulfillment company to ensure that the shipping process runs as smoothly (and as cost-effectively) as possible. We want to ensure that pledge funds are devoted to the production of the game, and not to high shipping prices. Shipping will be charged following the conclusion of the campaign by our pledge manager. While shipping estimates are based on current shipping costs, changes in postage rates may result in adjustments to these amounts. We are offering customs-friendly shipping to the US, Canada, EU, UK, AU, NZ, and China. Backers outside of these countries may need to pay additional customs, duties, taxes or VAT charges.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe will maximize the usability of our puzzles by ensuring that they are well designed, and produced from durable materials.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe will be manufacturing the rewards ourselves, and will strive to incorporate environmentally-sustainable practices into the fabrication process.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Appreciated Supporter", "descp": "Support our mission to create a new kind of interactive multi-platform puzzle challenge!

Welcome to my Kickstarter Campaign for an exciting and innovative deck of playing cards called ENIGMAS. And I'm thrilled to tell you all about this project and the creative team behind it. \nMy name is David Kwong and I am both a New York Times crossword puzzle constructor and a magician. My entire life is about puzzles: from creating magic tricks (another type of puzzle!) to writing secret codes and ciphers.\nENIGMAS combines all of these exciting and intriguing worlds. Puzzles within puzzles within puzzles, within a luxury deck of custom playing cards. And all of this is themed on an estate shrouded in mystery called Riverbank ...\nIncluded within this fully functional, seemingly regular deck of playing cards are four very special cards, each with its own puzzle for you to solve. These puzzles are not too hard, I promise! They just require you to think slightly outside the box. Fun for all ages!\nSolving all four puzzles will unlock an incredible, multilayered, eight-step puzzle hunt expertly designed by Dave Shukan, master puzzle-maker. Combine answers from every puzzle you've solved along the way and you will reveal the final, meta-puzzle answer. A true puzzler\u2019s paradise! \nIncluded with ENIGMAS are Four Puzzle Cards\nUnlock a multi-layered Puzzle Hunt themed on the Fabyan estate.\nENIGMAS are themed on a fascinating historical place -- a mysterious estate outside of Chicago called Riverbank. Over one hundred years ago, the scientists at Riverbank worked on cryptography projects: the estate was filled with secret messages and codes. And exotic animals like alligators, peacocks, monkeys and bears roamed the property!  \nRiverbank Estate (c. 1915)\nIllustrator Billy French has masterfully captured all of these bizarre and beautiful elements into the ENIGMAS design. The card backs are adorned with historically accurate imagery from the Riverbank estate, like its windmill and lighthouse. Owls, representing wisdom and learning, are perched on the bookshelves, guarding its secrets. \nThe elegance of ENIGMAS begins with the tuck box. It was carefully and meticulously designed to be the perfect home for these beautiful playing cards. Enter through the gates, guarded by eagles to enter the exciting world of ENIGMAS. \nFrom the thick, Premium Rhino Grey Vellum paper stock to the Navy & Powder Blue Pantone Inks encased in a striking layer of clear foil, we've elevated these cards in every possible way -- a deck of pure luxury. Finally, each tuck is secured with the Riverbank name and it's iconic ram's head postage stamp-style deck seal.\nENIGMAS Tuck Box complete with premium vellum paper stock and high-gloss details\nWhile the ENIGMAS face cards may appear familiar, they are far from the standard found in most modern decks. To keep the ENIGMAS deck authentic with its historical past, The United States Playing Card Company has graciously provided us with historical artwork for the cards faces that date back to the early 1900s.   \nHistorical Early 1900's USPCC Squeezer Court Cards\nThe scientists at Riverbank championed \u201cKnowledge is Power\u201d where they were most known for their work on codes and ciphers.

Is there something going on with this bookshelf? You bet! Are there more codes elsewhere? You double bet! \nENIGMAS wouldn't be complete without a set of Jokers...or in this case, the Riverbank Peacocks!\nENIGMAS Set of Jokers\nENIGMAS Uncut Sheets - these are the playing cards pulled from the factory press before being cut into cards. A collectors dream!\nThe Limited Edition Red ENIGMAS puzzle hunt deck will only ever be printed once as a companion deck to the Original Blue ENIGMAS.  This means the only way to obtain this deck is by backing this Kickstarter with at least 1 Blue ENIGMAS deck.\nSimilar to that of the Original Blue, we will be using premium paper stocks, inks and foils however in the Limited Edition Reds, an extra layer of embossing will be added and a very special die-cutting on the back design.  These die-cut windows will showcase the playing card back design secured inside the tuck box.

When producing a deck of playing cards we work closely with the manufacturer, in this case with The United States Playing Card Company, overseeing every detail and confirming that the quality is up to our highest standards. We also check and recheck all the proofs, constantly searching for any flaws in color, contrast, border registration, and alignment of artwork. \n\nAdditionally, we carefully select the paper stocks and finishes of the playing cards, along with the Pantone inks and foils involved with the manufacturing of the tuck box. With current state of the world as a result of COVID-19 it is hard to determine if there will be any delays in the future preventing this deck to be manufactured however at this time, the USPCC is fully operational and we do not anticipate any major issues, delays or setbacks in the manufacturing process of the ENIGMAS playing cards.

It utilizes an array of fish markets, external markets, and player owned harbors where you can build a fishing fleet and sell fish at your own pricing.\nTOKYO TSUKIJI EXPANSION builds on the modular system of Tsukiji Market by adding incredible new markets that allow for things such as ship rentals, market crash consequences, variable swordfish auctions, and much more!\nTOKYO METRO is a one of a kind investment train game that blends seamlessly with a worker placement system and spatial strategy. You'll be able to invest in 12 train lines with stocks, speculate against others, invest in stations for income, move on an actual map of the Tokyo Metro system, and much more!\nOSAKA METRO EXPANSION takes advantage of the innovative mechanics in Tokyo Metro, but brings a brand new tighter map of the Osaka Metro and a whole new unique set of action cards. The game is a punchier, quicker take and brings the opportunity to use the new actions cards with the Tokyo map, and vice versa.\nTOKYO TSUKIJI MARKET\nWatch the how to play video above for an overview, or read the rulebook at jordandraper.com/rules.

You can even play it over video call during the pandemic.\n\"Mirror is a group session zine with a collection of exercises designed to provide a moment of personal and communal reflection. Our every day life is full of distractions, this zine explores how ritual and engagement can help us to think positively towards ourselves and each other. \"\nOf course it is! By pledging during this campaign you will not only receive a discount, but you'll help bring these beautiful expansions to life that myself and other play testers have spent a long time developing. The games are not just pretty, don't take my word for it, read on below!\n\"Tsukiji Market is the most interesting economic game in recent memory I\u2019ve played. The variability in the base game after dozens of plays has allowed me to see each game branch into interesting and unique strategies. The expansion markets make the game even more interesting and strategic. This expansion content may push this game into top 5 territory for me.\" -Joe Wiggins\nTSUKIJI MARKET FIRST IMPRESSIONS - MARK WATSON\n\"I expect this is going to end up on a regular rotation when I attend games nights; it hits the sweet spot of being straightforward enough I wouldn't hesitate to introduce it to a table of new boardgamers while having enough meat on it's bones that even the more seasoned players are likely to find something to chew on, and all in a fairly small footprint and sub-two hour playing time.\" - Mark Watson\n\n\"I can\u2019t think of a game that has provided me with more unique and enjoyable experiences in recent memory than Tokyo Tsukiji Market. Where you go in to the game with the intention of flooding the market with cheap Mackeral using your barge, or you want to corner a strategic edge over swordfish, or sell your salmon to yourself at the foreign market, every game provides a wildly different experience based on what markets are available. The expansion also provides a number of new and diverse strategies to explore, and I\u2019d highly recommend it to both new and experience economic gamers. TTM combines the economic elements of a shared economy from Container with the highly variable and asymmetric gameplay of Sidereal Confluence and the result is something special.\" -Andrew Plassard\n TOKYO TSUKIJI MARKET FIRST PLAY IMPRESSIONS - RYAN MCSWAIN\n\"Jordan Draper fit so much game into this tiny box. The graphic design and component quality are top notch, and the gameplay is fun with loads of replayability...The whole table felt really engaged throughout the game, and afterward they spoke about the process and outcome at great length. I get the idea this will hit the table again, along with the rest of the Tokyo series.\" -Ryan McSwain\nTOKYO METRO - CHRISTIAN K\n\"Tokyo Metro is a cool game that puts a ton of gameplay in a tiny charming box. It has an awesome innovative take on worker-placement, tons of player interaction and mixes euro-style mechanisms and economic-style scoring in strange and exotic ways.\" -Christian K\nSOUNDS LIKE TOKYO, JOE - TOKYO METRO REVIEW - JASON MOORE\n\"There is something about the work of Jordan Draper, the designer of Tokyo Metro, et al, that I find uniquely captivating. Every cog is the perfect size and shape, everything does its job just so. They\u2019re intricate, and they speak to an informed overview of the hobby, as well as a desire to recreate aspects of it in a unique way.\nThere is so much about this game that impresses me \u2013 and I really enjoy it. The wooden components are great; the money looks gorgeous. The rulebook is clear; the box remarkably compact \u2013 and the game that pulls itself out of it is a colossus.\" -Jason Moore\nWORKER PLACEMENT MEETS CUBE RAILS - TONY CHEN\n\"The game is definitely and deliciously a train game through and through. It\u2019s a cube rails with stock portfolio management. It\u2019s an economic game with cash flow management. It\u2019s a route planning game with profit stealing and sabotage. And it does it all through its central mechanism of worker placement.\nTokyo Metro is a beautiful marriage of economic games and worker placement. We highly recommend it if you like economic games, particularly ones focusing on cashflow over incentive management.\" -Tony Chen\nGOING UNDERGROUND - TOKYO METRO REVIEW - CRAIG TAYLOR\n\"Without a shadow of a doubt, Tokyo Metro is the most interesting game I played in December 2017, in a December where I played a disproportionately high number of new games. There\u2019s decent depth contained herein without outrageous amounts of complexity to enable it.\nThis game is exciting, but not in the conventional way of \u2018contains glossy components\u2019 or \u2018hyped from a super marketing drive\u2019. It excites me due to mechanical rigour, providing a platform for an exceptionally interactive experience. Furthermore, I can say, without reservation that it is not like anything else I\u2019ve seen before.\" -Craig Taylor\nTOKYO METRO REVIEW - EXTENSIVE RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM - MEEPLE MOUNTAIN\n\"There are so many exciting things to talk about in Tokyo Metro. In a lot of ways, the game reminds me of some of my favorite games.\nAll of the components fit in a box much smaller than most games with similar depth. The artwork and graphic design of the game fades into the background while you\u2019re playing but keeps me focused on the game...interesting and detailed enough but not intrusive enough to pull my focus from the gameplay. In order to make the overall aesthetic and small box work, the board and stock chart are made of cloth and I really like this change. The cloth boards work incredibly well and I hope more publishers opt to make that decision.\" -Meeple Mountain\nA FASCINATING GAME - TOKYO METRO - BLAKE MORRIS\n\"TOKYO METRO is part of a larger gaming concept which includes various types of games... I also strongly recommend the metal money (a double set if you can afford it!), which may not be available much longer. I can\u2019t think immediately of any other \u201ctrain\u201d game incorporating worker placement. The mechanism involving timed appearance of various action cards keeps the game from becoming stale and repetitive...I recommend it strongly to anyone who wants to play a meaty game without too much complexity.\" -Blake Morris\nTOKYO METRO REVIEW - THE BOARD GAME DETECTIVE\n\"Beautiful production. This seems to be a signature of Jordan Draper. I love the unique cloth map with it\u2019s vibrant colours and iconic design. The cards and wooden/resin pieces are all really lovely too. It\u2019s obvious there was a lot of attention to detail in this production\u2026The most portable heavy game I own! TOKYO METRO\u2018s unique combination of both aesthetic design and game design is worth a look.\" -The Board Game Detective\nAN ISLAYTHEDRAGON REVIEW - TOKYO METRO - ALEX SINGH\n\"I didn\u2019t know what to expect when I first played TOKYO METRO and even after having played it, I don\u2019t know if I could give you an elevator pitch for it. It\u2019s an odd duck in the train game world, but one that I find strangely enjoyable. Investing and symbiotic relationships are a surefire way to get my attention and TOKYO METRO executes it in such a delightfully strange way that I\u2019m sure to be exploring the metro for some time to come.\" -Alex Singh \nLike all of my projects, I ship to every country in the world! As we have shifted to friendly shipping in the EU, CA, AU/NZ, and the US, there will be a separate VAT charge based on your total pledge if you live in Canada or the EU. The most you will have to pay is +$5 for Canada, and +$10 in the EU. This charge will be calculated and charged after the campaign is over, likely through Backerkit. All other locations will have no added charges.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always unforeseen delays and costs in making a product, but I do my best to add in the overhead of both time and costs.

Part of this mission involves adding continuous new mixed game rules to the TOKYO SERIES as a whole, breathing new life into your existing games.\nSustainable materials\nAll paper production is sourced from 30% recycled paper.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPanda Manufacturing uses ethical business practices both in its environmental choices and culture. I looked hard to find a manufacturing partner that I believed in for both their material and employment ethics. They are BSCI certified and I keep up a constant conversation with them about ways we can both improve board game manufacturing to help the planet and the humans who inhabit it.\nSustainable Distribution\nThere will be a single sea freight trip, and then a single shipment of your game afterward. If electric freight shipping were available on the ocean, I would gladly pay extra for it, but until then we will continue with the best we options we have.

We're working hard to make sure that all components appear the same as shown in the prototype images. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, you may still see a slight difference (i.e. color saturation, paper texture.)\nAll the web components of the games are being hosted securely and all have backups, so you shouldn't worry about not being able to access them in the foreseeable future.\n\n\u2022 Art & Design\nWe're actively working on the creative part of Chapter One. To make sure there are no delays on the creative front, we've decided not to wait until the end of the campaign and we've already hired the illustrator & extra writing staff. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delays.\n\n\u2022 Shipping\nWe are planning to begin the shipping process immediately following the end of the campaign. We're doing our best to subsidize your shipping costs as much as we can, even if it means covering the whole fee for the package for Journey backers in USA & Canada and most of the shipping fee for the EU.\nDelivering hundreds of envelopes around the world is not an easy task, and we all understand there are many factors that could cause delays. This is why our biggest pledge for all 13 games offers most of the games to be shipped in one box. This way we majorly reduce the chances of one of your 13 envelopes to be lost, damaged, or delayed when sent as a letter mail.\nPlease note that if you're outside of US & Canada and you add the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped separately, the shipping will be considered to be \u201cat your own risk\u201d, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages.\nAny issues with delivery will be handled individually and in-house. We're prepared to send replacements when it makes sense.\n\n\u2022 Additional Fees & Customs\nOne of the reasons we're heavily subsidizing our shipping costs is because VAT, customs, or other local shipping fees are unfortunately not covered and processed on our end. We currently have only twenty EU & Asian backers, so we are prepared to serve you personally and case by case.\nTo be more accessible for International backers of all 13 games, we added the \"Almost Subscription\" add-on that offers all your 13 envelopes to be shipped as letter mail, not in a box. According to our research, letter mail is exempt from VAT in most countries, so we're hoping this option will help you save some $.\n\n\u2022 Refunds\nAs of launch, we haven't found any pledge managers for post-campaign processing we're happy with, so we'll be handling everything in-house.\nYou are welcome to manage your pledge during the campaign (we really hope that 40 days are enough for you to make a final decision and we will make sure to send an update 48/24h before the end of the campaign to remind you to manage your pledge.) Once the campaign ends, we will send out final surveys and we will start the shipping process immediately. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. \n\n\u2022 Unforeseen Events\nWhile we can't anticipate everything, we feel that we are prepared to deal with all the issues if and when they occur.

The Book of Dungeon Encounters is a 48-page 8.5\" x 11\" saddle-stitched book that is packed with 100 different dungeon encounter ideas. These are for use with almost any fantasy RPG, especially old-school RPGs that use square grids for combat, though imaginative gamemasters will no doubt find ways to adapt everything detailed within these pages to any system, including those that use hexes for combat maps.\nThe book is presented as a giant d100 table, giving the gamemaster 100 different encounter ideas that can either be randomly rolled or selected to construct a dungeon. 90 of the encounters are presented as descriptions only -- no maps -- and range from low-level fights against dungeon beasties all of the way to strange gateways that lead to other worlds.\nTen of the encounters include square grid maps that were created using the SkeletonKey Games 2e Adventure Tiles. (Please see below for more information.) \nRegardless of how you use the encounters in the book, all of them exist for two reasons:\nTo give the gamemaster the tools necessary to run a dungeon adventure with little to no prep time; just grab some stats from your favorite book of monsters and mix in the ideas in this book and you're ready for freeform dungeon crawls!\n Inspiration! Maybe an entry doesn't meet your exact needs, but each one will help drive your creativity and give you ideas. As always, change everything within the book to fit your tastes and needs!\nDigital mockup.\nFor those of you new to my work, I am Philip Reed. I have been working professionally in the game industry for over two decades and have completed hundreds of projects over the years (both on my own and with different publishers). \nThis time around, I have brought on co-authors so that we could get the voices and ideas of others mixed in with my own. By adding other authors to the book (please see below), the encounters are more varied than if I were to tackle all of them on my own.\nFor an look at my approach to crowdfunding efforts, please see these recent Kickstarter campaigns to learn more:\n Fantasy City Sites and Scenes - A 48-page book of city locations and encounter ideas.

Then you're looking for either the $1 (PDF) or $18 (print, U.S. only) reward levels. All of the other listed rewards are for those gamemasters who missed out on my earlier projects.\nScattered throughout the book you will find ten encounters that include mapped locations within a dungeon. Each and every one of these maps were created using the SkeletonKey Games 2e Adventure Tiles. For those of you who use miniatures and square grid maps in your sessions, you can purchase the necessary tiles from SkeletonKey Games to create these locations at miniatures scale. Click here to visit the SkeletonKey Games website.\nSome of the maps feature tiles created using the new Adventure Tiles: Darkharrow Crypt . . . that is now funding on Kickstarter!!! Check out and join the campaign today!\n(Tile artwork used with permission of SkeletonKey Games.)\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who is searching for more dungeon encounter ideas. \nDelayed Blast Gamemaster is a systemless fantasy RPG zine for use with most games. This gamemaster-targeted resource is packed with monsters, adventure hooks, and all sorts of random stuff. Please see the individual Kickstarter campaigns (issue one, issue two, and issue three) for sample pages and to learn more about the zine.\nA few of the entries in The Book of Dungeon Encounters reference monsters/treasures found in the Delayed Blast Gamemaster series. These zines are not necessary to use those encounters; a clever GM will simply devise their own ideas using the names as inspiration. \nYou can find the zine in PDF today at DrivethruRPG.com.\nThe Dungeon Crafter's Sketch Book is for the gamemaster who enjoys creating dungeons. (Kickstarter page here.) This 56-page book (60 including the cover, inside covers, and back cover) is filled with page after page of square grids: space for you to draw your dungeon ideas. Scattered throughout the book are several random tables to inspire you as you create your newest dungeon. Please see the $3 and $33 reward levels. \nDid you miss the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes and Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II Kickstarter campaigns? Now is your chance to get these two books in print (and in PDF)! Please see the $13 and $58 reward levels (at right).\nTo learn more about each project, please visit the Kickstarter pages.\nFantasy City Sites and Scenes\nFantasy City Sites and Scenes II\n\nThe Book of Unusual Potions is a 64-page saddle-stitched work that is 5.5\" (wide) by 8.5\" (tall) in size and includes potions, potion ingredients, and more. Presented in a systemless format, this book is for use with many fantasy roleplaying games and is as colorful in appearance as it is in the descriptions of the many potions described inside.\nPlease see the Kickstarter page for more information.\nAlso available in PDF at DrivethruRPG. \nOver the last few years, I have created four different decks of Outdoor Encounter Cards. Each deck includes 36 cards, and all of them share a common back so that gamemasters may shuffle the different decks together. \nSee the $73 reward level to grab all four of the decks along with The Book of Dungeon Encounters in print.\nFor more information on this series, please see the individual Kickstarter campaigns:\nOutdoor Encounter Cards\nOutdoor Encounter Cards 2\nOutdoor Encounter Cards 3\nOutdoor Encounter Cards 4\nDid you miss out on the Kickstarter campaign for A Dozen Sinister Rumors?

Both sets are included in all pledge levels and we are close to unlocking a third set. \nA close look at some of the Dwarven Tomb details.

That's over 100 tiles with stretch-goals (and counting)!\n\n\nWe are launching the campaign with a modest 16 tiles (64 and counting with stretch goals). Because we have set a realistic and easily achievable funding goal, we expect this set to grow very quickly. The idea here is to increase the value of the set for backers while keeping the buy-in extremely low. Ideally this set will more than double in size and we will be able to add additional sets under the Darkharrow Crypt banner.

Each high resolution tile uses a printer friendly white background to save your ink/toner. Spaces are one inch squares.\nVTT: Files included for virtual tabletop use have a dark earthy background in the negative space to enhance the subterranean look and feel. Spaces are 100 pixels square with each tile being 600 x 600 pixels.\nPrint-On-Demand: A coupon to order a printed version of each set is included with every pledge. These can be redeemed through DriveThruRPG.com and the printing cost along with shipping will need to be paid when the printed tiles are ordered. The printed tiles are double sided 6\" x 6\" squares which are printed on high quality coated stock. Printing costs will vary depending on how many tiles are in the final set after stretch-goals are unlocked.\nCurious about the POD quality?

Time to raise a glass and celebrate. We would like to give our gratitude to you; to our backers, contributors, artists and play-testers who are making Journal d'Indochine possible. THANK YOU!!\nImportant Links\nSons of the Singularity News and Blog Page - future Development Updates will be placed here\nSons of the Singularity Facebook Page\nContact Sons of the Singularity at sons.of.the.singularity AT gmail.com\nJournal d'Indochine Webpage\nPre-Order Store on Backerkit\n!\nThe first half of the 20th century was a time of chaos and political ferment in French Indochina. As foreign imperialists struggled to maintain their precarious grip on the region, the people of the land worked to overthrow their tormentors. Radical religious movements like the Cao Dai sprung up to spread the blessings of a strange and unfathomable God. H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o Buddhist militias supported the prophecy of the return of a king. Binh Xuyen gangsters schemed to gain territory for their criminal enterprises. All the while student revolutionaries preached new, secular philosophies that promised utopia for the downtrodden workers.\nWhile the world seethed with conflict and change, hidden entities from far off in time and space have taken root in the jungles, gained foot holds on the beaches and found supplicants in the cities of Indochine. Some of these entities offer the temptation of enlightenment and power to those who could unlock their eldritch secrets. While some of these entities simply desire some hors d'oeuvre after a long hibernation.\n\nJournal d'Indochine covers a region and time period that has rarely been covered in the rpg world. It is designed to help the Keeper and players quickly get up to speed on French Indochina\u2019s history, themes, and factions. Journal d\u2019Indochine will include vital information on the region, as well as numerous \u201cLore Sheet\u201d handouts.\nThe creators of Journal d\u2019Indochine have spent many years in Asia and have firsthand knowledge of the locations featured. We have also hired Vietnamese consultants, in an effort to maintain cultural and historical authenticity.\n\nJournal d'Indochine Book\nJournal d\u2019Indochine will be a 200+ page book containing the following:\n4 \u201cplay out of the box\u201d scenarios.\nEach scenario crafted for different play-styles, including campaign, sandbox, dungeon crawl, intrigue and betrayal mechanics.\nA collection of Narrative Frameworks and hooks for campaign play.\nFull of rich historical events and fascinating factions, including Binh Xuyen gangsters, Vichy French, OSS operatives, Japanese imperialists, Hoa Hao Buddhist militia, mythos cultists, and many more.\nTons of art, maps, journal entries and useful Keeper's Aids (templates) for a wide range of civil and military documents.\nPhotos from personal and familial archives, including never-before released photos from the Battle of Dien Bien Phu.\n  Legionnaires Field Manual\nAt the Leng stretch goal level, the Legionnaires Field Manual will be unlocked and available for Backers at the Legionnaire Capitaine / \u0110\u1ea1i \u00fay level and above. The book will contain the following:\nAt least 100+ pages in length\nAt least 2 new scenarios (S5 & S6)\nNew Player Factions, including the French Foreign Legion\nNew scenario hooks and new Lore Sheets \nAt least 10 new pre-gens\nBotanist\u2019s guide to Flora from the Plateau of Sung\nNew weapons and equipment list\nNew art\nScenarios\n(This section will be updated as development progresses)\nS1: The Fertile Red Lands of Cochinchina (1926)\nThe French-Indochina Rubber Corporation pursues its own interests through subjugating the local population and bending the jungles to its will. A local tribe having been almost wiped out by the invaders retreats into the jungle where they plot and plan revenge on the colonial invaders who have set roots down in their land. Little do the invaders know; they are not the only invaders that have also taken root in the Red Lands of Cochinchina\u2026\nThe Fertile Red Lands of Cochinchina is a \u201csandbox\u201d scenario where investigators can explore at their leisure\u2026 or at their panic\u2026\nS2: Black Sea Rising (1945, June)\nThe tides of war have turned against Japan. In a last-ditch attempt to win the war, Japanese Naval Intelligence and elite members of the Gen\u2019Yosha launch Operation Moon God Ascending, an attempt to barter with a Deep One colony in Ha Long Bay. Can anti-Japanese forces disrupt Operation Moon God Ascending before doom is unleashed on humanity?\nBlack Sea Rising is a faction related scenario good for \u201cone-off\u201d plays or OSS and Viet Minh Faction campaigns.\nS3: Expedition Lemont (1946)\nSince Lemont\u2019s last expedition at the turn of the 20th Century, men of dubious ambitions, lured by the possibility of fame and riches, have attempted to retrace the footsteps of the priest rumored to have gone looking for Yian-Ho, a mystical city of gold.\nDeputy High Commissioner Henry de Constance, who came in contact with the priest research into the mythos, convinced his superiors of the need to undertake another expedition to the Southern Wetlands. According to him, a new expedition would be a \u201csplendid anthropological undertaking.\u201d\nExpedition Lemont is meant to be played as a campaign. It is composed of four separate modules that will take the investigators from Saigon to the Holy See in Tay Ninh and beyond.\nS4: Battle of Dien Bien Phu (Name TBD)(1954)\nFrench Foreign Legion soldiers parachute into the valley of Dien Bien Phu, while Viet Minh commandoes move to penetrate and sabotage colonial French positions. During the climatic  battle that ended the first Indochina war, troops encounter another an invader lurking in the battlefield.\nS4 will be an intense \u201cdungeon crawl\u201d adventure, played from the perspective of soldiers of the French Foreign Legion or the Viet Minh player factions.\n(The following will be bundled with the Legionnaire Field Manual)\nS5: The Parchment of Tam (1945, March)\nInvestigators travel to Hu\u1ebf to find the mysterious \u201cMr. Long\u201d, a missing Viet Minh informant with strong ties to Emperor B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i and the Forbidden Purple City. Their search uncovers both ancient and modern secrets, and a plot that can turn the tide of the Pacific Theater of War. The journey may also cause the Investigators to go insane.\n\nDeep Ones at Ha Long Bay\nTwo Recruitment Posters (12x8) - $20\nThis is reproduction of a  French Foreign Legion poster which was found in a recently discovered bunker in Vietnam, near the Cambodian border.  \n\nThis is a Viet Minh poster, also recovered from a remote base (Circa 1952)\n\n\n\nCompleted. The base book will include four scenarios and a description of Indochine and the major factions.  At least four large pieces of artwork will be displayed in the book. \nCompleted.

This is especially useful for GMs who want to run Journal d'Indochine with more than one player group simultaneously, but within the same game world.\nCompleted, day 2. At this stretch goal level, we will create and include more Keeper Aids, such as various military and civil government templates, to allow Keepers to create an immersive setting.\nCompleted, day 3. At the Yian-Ho level, we commission conceptual art depicting a fantastical, mythical location.\nCompleted, day 6 Bonus Group #3: At this level, we will give bonus payments to editors and artists.\nCompleted, day 9.

Your pledge does not include the cost of shipping.\n Off-Set Print & Book Shipping\nIf the project reaches the R\u2019lyeh ($22,000) stretch goal, we will commission a traditional off-set print run at our printing vendor in the United States. This will produce a higher quality book. However, it will probably add two months to the delivery schedule.\nWe will collect the shipping fee for the book within our Pledge Manager.  The fees will be approximately as follows:\nDigital to POD Items\nCertain add-ons and unlockable scenarios are delivered as a digital product on DTRPG, with the option to buy a Print on Demand (POD) version at print cost.  These items include the 12x18 posters, additional scenarios, and the Legionnaire's Field Manual, but not the main book. If you received any of these as a reward or add-on, you will receive a coupon for the price of the PDF.  To print out the item, you will need to go to DTRPG and order the printed version, at cost, and pay for shipping on that site. \nWe estimate that POD printing costs for the posters and the Legionnaires\u2019 Field Manual, including additional scenarios, Player Factions, and other content, will be between $6 to $12 in total. \n Important: to save on shipping, order all the print-on-demand add-ons and rewards  at once.  This way, it will all be shipped together for one low fee.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "R&D stands for Research & Design\nGMs! How many times has this happened to you? \nYou send the Troubleshooter team on a mission filled with disinformation, death traps and Catch-22s, confident they will industriously slaughter themselves in a jiffy. Yet, mysteriously or even treasonously, by the time debriefing rolls around, they still have several clones left! (Sure, they failed the mission but that\u2019s expected.) Isn\u2019t there some way to make the game more baffling, convoluted and amusingly fatal for the Troubleshooters?\nWhat you need is Project Infinite Hole, a sourcebox full of tasty tidbits from Alpha Complex\u2019s most thought-provoking service group, Research & Design! And yes, it will provoke a lot more than just thoughts.\nWhat\u2019s Inside? Mayhem!\nProject Infinite Hole is the first service group supplement for the latest edition of Paranoia. Here, you will find three books that can make your players weep for joy, and occasionally, panicked fear.\n\n The R&D Happy Testing Catalogue: 64 lovingly crafted pages describing 40 experimental devices fresh from the R&D labs! Fluffy Safety Armour, Jaws of Death, iEye and more are sure to delight your players! Wait, that\u2019s not right. Oh, it will delight sadistic Paranoia GMs. That makes more sense.\n The Gamemasters R&D Service Book: 80 pages that explore this service group in detail, including how R&D works, how it does not work, new locations, new NPCs and the thrilling Troubleshooter In-field R&D Adjunct system (TIRDA) that lets players combine equipment cards to create what\u2019s sure to be a complete and utter cock-up. (That is not a dirty word! Get your mind out of the gutter, Troubleshooter!)\n The R&D Mission Book: 128 pages giving a busy GM two missions that start the first ever (we think) Paranoia campaign! You also get the Top 10 Best R&D Experiments (filled with three-act structured mission hooks) and advice on adding a trip to R&D into every Troubleshooter mission. Yes, players really will be thankful for that!\nYou also get the R&D Deck with 120 new cards: 18 R&D-themed Action Cards, 15 Armour and Defensive Devices, 5 Bot Modules, 25 Coretech Apps, 25 Surveillance Devices and 32 Weapons. (These include the 40 devices in the R&D Happy Testing Catalogue, but also a lot more!) All equipment is experimental, meaning there are different effects depending on whether the Troubleshooter was barely competent or suspiciously incompetent. (Remember, equipment failure is a choice and will be punished accordingly.) No longer will you say, \u2018Uh, you miss with laser pistol. Next!\u2019 Instead, you can say, \u2018Your Duct Tape Gun misses and hits an air duct, which is suddenly pulled down on top of you. Next!\u2019\nYou can download the draft of the first mission, Filling an Infinite Hole, right HERE!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nFor that matter, why an R&D box set? Back in older editions of Paranoia, a trip to R&D for some rather questionable gear was a standard part of Troubleshooter missions. After the briefing, Troubleshooters went to R&D whether they wanted to or not. (Oh, but they wanted to, at least more than they wanted to be terminated.) In the previous edition, this was expanded to become a Service where Troubleshooters did minor but stressful jobs for any of the eight service groups.\nWe grew up playing Paranoia, and have fond memories of all kinds of R&D devices going boom, ping! and sometimes POW BANG POP WHAM WHIZZ CLICK WHIRR, and then boom! To be honest, we missed that! So when we sat down to think of the next expansion for Paranoia, this immediately came to mind. And it would not leave, no matter what we ingested.\nBy launching a Kickstarter for the R&D sourcebox, we can provide unique offers (like designer notes and create-a-device) while offering all-new ways to torment players. (Err, their characters.) As with our Acute Paranoia Kickstarter, all of the sourcebox content (books and cards) has already been written, edited and made ready for citizens everywhere.\nIt also allows us to explore a first for Paranoia: An actual campaign. How is that possible when most Troubleshooter teams have the shelf life of raw soylent? We extended one plot over four different missions. You can keep characters between missions or create new ones, as players will remember what is going on. And yes, this is all centred on an R&D experiment named Project Infinite Hole.\nPledge Levels\nWe have put together a multitude of ways you can demonstrate your loyalty to The Computer, and eagerness to aid R&D with their critical mission to enhance and improve the already perfect Alpha Complex.\nThe R&D Testing Fun Pack!\nR&D is so much fun that we wanted to offer a big reward: The R&D Testing Fun Pack. (Is the testing fun? Are we testing fun? Is the pack full of tests and fun? Yes.) In this commemorative pack, those backing at Green or higher will receive:\n6 Green Pencils for Troubleshooters that say \u2018Fuel Rod (mini)\u2019.\n1 GM Pen that says \u2018Knowing Rules is Treason\u2019.\nSafety Poster Card with real (read: fake) R&D lab warnings such as \u2018Inhaling Particulates is Theft DO NOT BREATHE\u2019 and \u2018If Alarm Sounds, Push People Down and Run Away\u2019.\nPad of R&D Experimental Equipment Release Forms, ready to inflict on your players.\n25 \u2018Heroes of R&D\u2019 trading cards featuring the most important and/or dangerous people, locations and experiments that are part of this fine service group. Also containing rules for dropping them into missions.\nExclusive short mission, never to be found elsewhere: \u2018Smocks!\u2019. An experiment in armour technology goes missing while the Communists fight the Communists for control of the Communists. Guess who gets to fix both problems?\nAll in a special presentation pack!\nThese items are exclusive to the R&D Testing Fun Pack, and will never be available anywhere else!\nStretch Goals\nR&D is all about getting wonderful, cutting-edge devices to Troubleshooters so they can justify budget expenditures. (Also, fight traitors sometimes.) So why not offer our most loyal citizens some cutting-edge stretch goals? They are rather nifty...\n Anyone backing at the Red level or higher will get all unlocked stretch goals as PDFs! Praise Friend Computer!\nPackage Deals\nIn our Traveller Kickstarters, backers could purchase packages to fill out their collections. This proved such a hit that we are now offering Paranoia Package Deals! You can pick any or all of these, and simply add their cost to your pledge level - we will be in touch after the Kickstarter to finalise which packages you pledged for. We will even ship them out as soon as the Kickstarter is over and all your details have been collated (typically within a month of the Kickstarter completing) so there is no waiting!\n\u00a335 The Card Package: Keep your players\u2019 hands full with four card decks: More [REDACTED] Societies, Mutant Explosion, the RAM Deck, and Perfectly Safe Gear.\n\u00a350 The Mission Package: Run your Troubleshooters through completely safe and relaxing missions: Implausible Deniability, Yellow Clearance Black Box Blues, and Truth or Dare.\n\u00a370 The Box Package: Do you really like boxes? Do you also like Paranoia? Then get this package and receive both the Starter box set and the Acute Paranoia expansion box.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of our Kickstarter projects have succeeded and backers received their rewards. That said, we know there is always room for improvement and we continue to learn how to do this better. For example, we are adding more value to pledge levels by offering all stretch goals to anyone backing at Red level or higher. \n\nAs with our previous Paranoia Kickstarter, everything in the sourcebox (including the 120-card R&D Deck) has already been designed, written, and tested on live gamers. (Only a few gamers were hurt in the making of this sourcebox but, in our defence, they kept using their phones at the table.) This lowers the risk since you do not have to wait and hope somebody in the UK writes this thing. (Note: The first four stretch goals are complete, with art and layout complete, and ready for final proofing and printing. We are waiting to see what else gets unlocked before panicking and screaming at freelancers, \u2018THIS OTHER STUFF NEEDS TO BE DONE NAOW!\u2019) \n\nThe coronavirus continues to plague the world, but we have ensured its effects will be minimal as the majority of the actual development of Project Infinite Hole is already done, and we have several different printers alerted on different continents (China, Eastern Europe and North America) so we can select the best choice if and when the virus flares up once more.\n\nLead designer WJ MacGuffin is keeping a suspicious eye on things here on the Kickstarter page, and he will be answering your questions as fast as his old brain can handle. (He is still running Cerebral Coretech 10.15 Minx, so it might take a little while.)\n\nR&D stands for Rebar & Dust. \nR&D stands for Riots & Destruction.\nR&D stands for whatever you want.

As many of you know, we are always looking for new ways to share these passions with others. We\u2019ve created tabletop puzzle boxes, mobile escape games, outdoor escape rooms, and puzzle events and now we're creating a fun, detective and noir-inspired digital puzzle game! Thanks to Kickstarter\u2019s Lights On initiative we\u2019re able to raise money for The Code and Key and offer this amazing game as a reward!\nWe've been hard at work to bring the Silver Spoon Caper to life!\nYou know us - even a global pandemic can\u2019t keep us down! In the midst of being stuck at home, we're working hard on the future projects we have in the works - including a brand new puzzle box and another exciting outdoor escape room partnership with Bloomington Parks and Recreation this summer! But before we can close the social distance, we are creating a delightfully devious digital puzzle experience that combines visual challenges, detective work, fun visuals, and mind-bending logic puzzles in an enjoyable experience for one or more! \nWe've expanded the story of the original escape experience and added new characters!\nThe Silver Spoon Caper takes place in the 1920's prohibition era and draws on Noir detective vibes for the artwork and story. Players help Harriet Lane as she uncovers a murder in a speak easy, encounters puzzles related to the criminals' plans to steal from an unknown location, and brings the criminals to justice in the middle of the heist! This game blends challenging puzzles with detective work and allows you to time yourself as you complete the game. We made this game family-friendly while staying true to the context of the game by including only textual and symbolic references to alcohol and murder.\nHelp Harriet solve who committed a murder at the Silver Spoon Speakeasy!\nWe are particularly excited to be partnering with Studio Cypher, a local Bloomington, Indiana game development company, to adapt our successful large group team-building puzzle experience into a digital game. We\u2019re thrilled with the results and are finishing up production of this game to help us raise money to support The Code and Key\u2019s projects and staff while our physical location is closed.\nStudio Cypher has graciously allowed us to include their most recent project as a reward during this campaign to the $10 pledge tier and above. Diorama Detective is a  quirky Augmented Reality iOS detective game which allows you to recreate crime scenes and take pictures of evidence to solve the case! \nThe Team behind the Game:\nAlex does the spreadsheet stuff, Kate does the fun stuff, and Adam does the puzzle stuff!\nThe Code and Key Escape Rooms specializes in immersive puzzles and storytelling and works to build community through engaging puzzle experiences.\nStudio Cypher - Life Improving Games\nStudio Cypher is an independent game developer that refuses to be limited by location or format. They want to put amazing games everywhere! They bring their 15+ years of game design experience to the Silver Spoon Caper and we\u2019re delighted to know and work with such an amazing business.\nRajin Shankar - Artist Extraordinaire\nRajin Shankar is the amazing artist behind the characters and art in the Silver Spoon Caper. He is working on his own game, Pet Putt, in his spare time.\n\nThank you for helping us create amazing experiences and thank you for supporting us so that we can create puzzles, narratives, and experiences that challenge you to think creatively. We hope that what we\u2019ve done here will inspire you to create your own puzzles and stories!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIs this your first Kickstarter? Yes, this is the Code & Key Escape Room's first Kickstarter, but we're working closely with Studio Cypher who have worked with and completed two other Kickstarters successfully. \n\nWill you be able to complete this? We at the Code & Key are running this part-time while working from home and taking care of children but we've been able to carve out time in the evenings, when kids are taking naps, and on the weekends. We're pretty proud of what we've been able to do with the resources we have and we're excited to be collaborating with Studio Cypher and other amazing artists to be able to make this a reality. We are close to having a finished product and believe that we will be able to ship out our major reward - the Silver Spoon Caper game - on time. \n\nWill you be able to get rewards out on time? We're currently on track to finish the game in the weeks after the Kickstarter ends. Studio Cypher will be doing the digital distribution soon after the game is finished. Code & Key will be making the Thank You cards and will sign and ship them as quickly as we can, but depending on volume and how Covid-19 may impacts mail systems, that may be after the game releases digitally.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "The Silver Spoon Caper Digital Game", "descp": "Thanks for helping make this a reality!

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "After four years of producing our successful, episodic series at  Immersion Escape Rooms and creating multiple custom-designed group adventures, we are expanding our reach beyond Charlottesville, Virginia. We have developed a new interactive mystery that will immerse and puzzle players across the country from the comfort of their own homes.  We\u2019re tapping the passionate members of the Kickstarter community to support our efforts. Let's take The Messenger beyond a single prototype so that fans of immersive fiction and escape rooms can experience our tightly woven narrative from anywhere in the United States!\nIts contents are a mystery and it appears that anyone who receives the parcel must follow a strict set of rules, or suffer the consequences:\nThe parcel must remain in the current owner's possession.\nOne must never reveal any details concerning the parcel's delivery or its contents. \nWrapped Parcel\nHowever, the previous owner, Shaun Lyons, has broken the rules, targeting you as the parcel's next recipient. It's now up to you to decipher the information and find a way to break the cycle. The fate of your soul and those of others rests on your ability to solve the mystery. Tick Tock...  \nPLAY\n\nThe Messenger is a rich and immersive story told through a combination of mediums including handcrafted documents, video and audio files, artifacts, and online content. Upon receipt, you'll enter an intriguing world of fiction that blends actual events with engaging storytelling. Progress through the story by solving puzzles and making connections. With every solution, the story becomes more clear and you'll soon realize that you hold the key to unlocking a dark past that has been plaguing the souls of recipients who have been bound by the same fate for centuries. It's up to you to break the curse. \nWe are offering The Messenger as a complete experience, loaded with hours of content and gameplay. It does not require a subscription. Everything you need to solve the mystery and reveal the entire story is included. We are holding back some details to protect the integrity of the mystery, but here is a peek inside: \n The Document Collection:  Sift through letters, newspaper clippings, floorplans, and other aged documents.\n The Wooden Book: A uniquely crafted, wood-bound notebook filled with encrypted text, symbols, hidden meanings, and more. Decipher this tome by using the included materials, make connections, discover characters and plot points, and reveal what the parcel's past recipients have failed to uncover.\n Narrative Items: Physical items that will aid you in solving the mystery while learning more about the parcel's previous owners.\n Audio Cassette: An old recording from 1993.\n USB Drive With Shaun's Research: A collection of digital files including audio and video recordings, documents, and links to hidden websites. \n Sealed Envelope: Break the seal and find help with the mystery. \n File Access: Playing the audio cassette or retrieving content from the USB Drive is not required to fully participate in the experience. You will receive a link to Shaun's personal database, giving you online access to content on both the USB Drive and the Audio Cassette. \nIn addition to The Messenger rewards, we've also crafted some extras. These unique enhancements can be chosen as stand-alone items or added on to other rewards by adjusting your pledge amount to include the additional cost. \nThe Messenger Collector's Coin: This oversized, antique plated metal coin bears imagery from the mystery on the front and the Immersion seal on the back. This reward is included in The Messenger:  Collector's Edition. \nCollector's Coin Prototype Designs\nThe Wooden Journal: A 4\" x 6\" wood-bound 80-page journal that has all of the aesthetics of the Wooden Book included in The Messenger editions, but delivered with blank pages. A unique and creative place to keep your notes safe. \nThe Wooden Journal\nWhy are we doing this? That answer is simple, we're storytellers. Our goal is to engage audiences in unique ways and we've made it our passion to share our love of immersive fiction and escape rooms with the overwhelmingly supportive Charlottesville, Virginia community for the past four years. Opening up our creativity to a larger audience is a goal we\u2019ve aspired to reach from day one. We want everyone who enjoys what we do to experience the stories we've only just begun to tell. We hope that The Messenger is just the first of many. \nOnce our Kickstarter campaign successfully wraps we will immediately begin materials sourcing and production. We have made relationships with suppliers and will begin placing orders and receiving materials based on the quantities needed to fulfill our commitments to backers. \nWe estimate that we will begin pre-assembling parcels one month after our campaign ends. We will also finalize our digital and online content during this time period, including additional story elements and puzzles.\nThe following months will be dedicated to producing our unique Wooden Books and Journals. Depending on demand, we may elect to craft these in-house, however, we do have connections to several local artisans and custom book manufacturers who will be able to provide additional production support, if necessary.\nIn the closing month before we launch we will finalize and QC all of our parcels in preparation for shipping. We aim to have all parcels delivered to backers before the Holiday season.\nWe sincerely appreciate each and every person who has supported us throughout these past four years and we welcome new community members to join us on this journey. With your help, we will be able to reach our goal and bring this exciting project to fruition. It has been a pleasure sharing our story. Please drop us a line here or e-mail us directly at hello@immersionescaperooms.com. We are looking forward to hearing from you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe primary challenge we face will be with materials sourcing and delivery.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Help build an awesome book of twenty boss battles and climactic encounters for your D&D games.\nThe best 5e fantasy roleplaying games are often the most unpredictable. When the plans of the Gamemaster meet the actions of the characters, the incredible creative energy that results can spin encounters off in different directions, creating a largely spontaneous campaign story that keeps the GM and the players alike on the edge of their seats. But when it comes to the climactic boss battle encounters that cap off single adventures or entire campaigns, it\u2019s often much harder for GMs to work things out on the fly.\nThat\u2019s where this book comes in. \nFantastic Lairs cover art by Jack Kaiser\nScott Gray, James Introcaso, and Mike Shea have teamed up to lighten the load of shaping and developing your game\u2019s climactic encounters. Fantastic Lairs is a book of capstone lair encounters for your 5e fantasy RPG, designed to inspire and fit into your own campaign. Each fantastic lair includes evocative artwork, a beautiful full-color map, and a well-designed and playtested boss encounter for characters of various levels.\nCheck out the free sample, which includes two fantastic lairs you can use right now! We're also releasing virtual tabletop-ready maps for these two lairs so you can run them easily online.\nThe initial campaign goal for this book includes lairs for 1st- through 10th-level characters, each of which includes instructions for scaling it for different levels of play. After breaking through five stretch goals, we will now add lairs for 11th- through 20th-level play. The book will now include twenty lairs for all four tiers of play. \nFantastic Lairs is the joint brainchild of all three members of the design team, each of whom brings a wealth of creative skill and experience to the project. From over fifty initial concepts, the team narrowed down a selection of twenty ultimate boss lairs for development in this book.\nYour support for this project will fund the design, development, editing, artwork, and cartography that will make this book a reality. The more support we receive, the better the book will be. \nInternal view of Caves of the Cockatrice (Illustration by Allie Briggs)\nThe Lairs\nThanks to our backers' outstanding support we will have the following twenty lairs in this book.\nLair of the Cockatrice (1st Level). A shadow-infused cockatrice keeps a stone garden in a lair built around an ancient and corrupted fey gateway.\nCentipede Cultists (Tier 1). A band of centipede-worshipping cultists feed living sacrifices to their pets in a fallen temple of Asmodeus.\nNevermind (Tier 1). The Dead Roses, a band of cutthroats led by the murderous bandit captain Adilia Rose, hide out between jobs in a seedy tavern built from a titan's skull.\nLord Whiskers (Tier 1). A band of wererats led by the megalomaniacal Lord Whiskers gathers up all the city's silver to be destroyed in their trap-infested sewer lair.\nNature's Rage (Tier 1). A blood-drenched druid and a horde of beasts plot revenge against the despoilers of nature in the ruined zoo of a murdered noble.\nThe Fiery Belly of the Beast (Tier 2). The half-dragon Tharandra Everflame and her kobold minions steer a machine of war and fire through defenseless villages.\nThe Lamia Job (Tier 2). The characters must infiltrate a mysterious bank vault to reveal the murderous plots and corrupting illusions of a lamia mastermind.\nThe Blood Palace (Tier 2). In a lost ziggurat of blood, a sinister spirit naga and its enthralled gnolls need the adventurers' help \u2014 to feed their hidden hydra.\nSticky Toffee (Tier 2). The confections at Auntie Bea's Sweet Treats are more than they seem \u2014 as is the shop's night hag proprietor.\nThose Who Are About to Die (Tier 2). The characters face waves of brutal combatants and devastating hazards in this arena of blood, death, and fire.\nBumpy Ride (Tier 2). A mage uses his airship and an array of deadly incendiary devices to terrorize other wizards into subservience, and the characters must put an end to it.\nDeadtention (Tier 2). An oni poses as the kindly headmaster of an academy for young sorcerers, where he uses a dark ritual to sacrifice faculty members and increase his power.\nIthrix Blackblood (Tier 2). A young black dragon uses his acidic breath to keep a band of trolls under his sway in an ancient cyclopean ruin.\nThe Blue Dragon Spellthief (Tier 3). The characters pursue a blue dragon mage set on robbing an arcane vault filled with volatile magical artifacts.\nThe Blade Queen's Throne (Tier 3). The characters must retrieve a secret word required to save the world \u2014 but that word is protected by a powerful marilith for its demon lord master.\nTomb of the Dragonlords (Tier 3). In the desert tomb of an ancient dragon queen, a dragonborn mummy lord guards a magical jewel that might destroy the world.\nBlood Rain (Tier 3). A cloud giant vampire moves across the sky in a red cloud castle defended by monstrous thralls and vampire spawn, raining blood upon the land that raises ghouls in its wake.\nThe Lich's Sanctum (Tier 4). In an astral sanctum that defies natural physics, the characters battle an ancient lich responsible for the deaths of nine worlds.\nPut the Monster Back (Tier 4). The tarrasque breaks free of a secure facility designed to hold the worst monsters of creation, and will tear through the walls of reality, devouring entire worlds unless the characters stop it.\nBlood and Gold (Tier 4). In a shattered celestial temple, an ancient gold dragon is possessed by a demon prince encased in a spike buried in the dragon's chest, and threatens the mystical pillar that holds the multiverse together.\n (Many of these lair names are placeholders for now, and are likely to change.)\nSurprise-dra! (Illustration by Jack Kaiser)\nArt Book. Every backer will receive the digital version of the Fantastic Lairs Art Book, containing the art and maps for each lair, suitable for showing to your players. Those backing the print-option tier will also have the option to buy a physical art book at the cost of printing and shipping.\nReward Tiers\nWe have two simple reward tiers for this project: the $15 digital tier and the $20 physical tier. The physical tier will give you the ability to buy print-on-demand copies of the book and any print-based stretch goals at the cost of printing and shipping, fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.\nStretch Goals\nWe have already broken through ten stretch goals adding ten lairs, a monster appendix, and an art book for all backers. We have also unlocked a hardcover option for all print-on-demand backers. (Backers of the $20 print-on-demand option tier will be able to order either softcover or hardcover versions of the book at the cost of printing and shipping.) We have more stretch goals coming in the future.\nWe\u2019re also going to put together adventure outlines that we\u2019ll be releasing to all backers as a digital-download PDF supplement to Fantastic Lairs. Each of these adventure outlines will provide DMs with the narrative bare bones of a potential adventure arc \u2014 or even a full campaign \u2014 linking and leading into some of our own favorite fantastic lairs from the book. Each outline is like a summary that you can use as a starting point and narrative guideline to build a full adventure or campaign, highlighting potential plot points, cool backstories, great locations, exciting encounters, memorable NPCs and monsters, and more.\nThese outlines will be written by TK Johnson, LaTia Jacquise, Lysa Penrose, Jen Vaughn, Leon Barillaro, Willy Abeel, Casey Machado, Collette Quach, Rich Lescouflair, and Jess Ross.\nWe're also adding THREE final, special boss lairs based on suggestions given to us by backers. Voting in the backers-only poll is now live and will end at the same time as the Kickstarter!\nThe Physical Tier and Print-on-Demand\nAs we have in other projects, this project will deliver physical rewards as print-on-demand books from DriveThruRPG. You will be responsible for the costs of printing and shipping once the books are done. Both printing and shipping costs vary depending on the size of the book and any increases in costs from the printers, but they are usually very reasonable (roughly $11 for the softcover and $23 for the hardcover + shipping).\nDelivering books through a print-on-demand publisher helps us keep the costs down as much as possible. It's the most efficient way to get this physical book into your hands.\n(Dungeons & Dragons and D&D are registered trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe ten initial lairs are written and have been through initial edits.

This spectacular 600-page fantasy-horror adventure path can be played in any world but is specifically designed for the incredibly detailed Lost Lands Setting (which project lead Greg Vaughan spent nearly a decade perfecting with the classic adventures of Necromancer Games and Frog God Games). Your heroes must trek across the Kingdoms of Foere, Reme, the Vast, and beyond to uncover the clues of an ancient mystery, a lost prince, an expedition to the ends of the earth, and a silent apocalypse stealthily creeping to overwhelm the land, from the start of their careers up to 17th level! This spectacular saga from the powerful pens of Alistair J. Rigg, Jeff Swank, Matt Goodall, Steve Helt, Tom Knauss, Anthony Pryor, and Greg Vaughan includes a 48-page Player's Guide to introduce the history and lore of the region, compatible with all three game systems, and then follows it up with six additional adventures and their appendices full of new magic, monsters, equipment, player handouts, and more:\n Book 1: The Book in the Old House \u2013 by Alistair J. Rigg \u2013 Help a young knight rid his ancestral manor of its haunts and discover the beginnings of a deeper mystery going much further back in time.\n Book 2: The Ebon Soul \u2013 by Jeff Swank \u2013 Heroes face an ancient vampire\u2019s curse and must deal with the consequences and troubles of a forgotten empire\u2019s underworld that proves to be very much alive and well.\n Book 3: When Comes the Moon \u2013 by Matt Goodall \u2013 The mountain outpost of a religious order from a bygone era starts to look like the setting for a werewolf hunt, but memories of older times continue to have ramifications in the present day as the hunters become the hunted on the mountain peaks.\n Book 4: Legend of the Burning Star \u2013 by Steve Helt \u2013 Seek an ancient meteor crater holding riches in sky metals, but past expeditions seeking it came to naught\u2026until a never-before-seen journal surfaces and puts the players on that path once again.\n Book 5: Race for Shataakh-Uulm \u2013 by Tom Knauss \u2013 Heroes traverse a haunted and desolate land to claim the meteorite\u2019s riches before others jump their claim and discover the unspeakable fate of the original explorers.\n Book 6: Knight Fall in Old Curgantium \u2013 by Anthony Pryor \u2013 The quest comes full circle to the capital of the Hyperborean Empire, ruined in ancient holocaust yet whose menace threatens to arise once more and bring calamity to the empires that have arisen in its place as destiny turns to doom!\nThe above covers feature some of the fantastic interior artwork in each adventure, but we've also commissioned sensational new cover images from some of our favorite artists as our first set of stretch goals below! Within these pages you'll find savage adventuring action and tantalizing treasures for your favorite system, with each chapter steeped in the lore of the Lost Lands!\nAs if our versions for DnD 5E and the 1st Edition of the Pathfinder RPG were not enough, Aegis of Empires represents an especially exciting opportunity for fans of Pathfinder Second Edition, as this is the very first third-party PF2E project with this kind of epic size and scope, designed by the same company that partnered with Paizo, Inc. to create their massive upcoming Kingmaker Anniversary Edition Adventure Path, Companion Guide, Pathfinder RPG Bestiary, and the Kingmaker 5E Bestiary! \nChock full of amazing artwork and beautiful maps, this adventure saga brings home the towering cities of Foere and Reme, the sweeping vistas of the Kingdom of the Vast, and journeys through back alleys and sewers, soaring mountains and rolling plains, and of course the occasional creepy dungeon and mysterious monastery! \nThis is a classic fantasy saga blending elements of cosmic horror and deep lore in a rich and evocative setting. I can confidently say this compendium won\u2019t be shy sitting on your shelf next to the very best adventure path sags and mega-modules like Slumbering Tsar! We hope you\u2019re as excited to see this project come to fruition as we are, and we appreciate your support joining the project, sharing and commenting on social media, and spreading the word to make this book truly Legendary!  \nIn order to keep this Kickstarter simple, we are asking you to select one game system (5E, PFRPG, or PF2E) for your base pledge. We know that many of you play multiple systems, and we are delighted to offer that option as well, so you'll have the opportunity to add those extra systems to your original pledge in our Backerkit survey at the end of the campaign, where you can indicate which PDFs and print books you wish to add at a special discounted price on top of your base pledge.\nAdd $40 - Get an additional Aegis of Empires PDF for a different system (add twice if you want all three systems)\nAdd $80 - Add an extra print book of the Aegis of Empires (for any system). Each additional print copy after your base pledge is at the discounted $80 price.\nNOTE: If you do plan to add on extra copies in Backerkit later on, send us a message through Kickstarter when you pledge letting us know which extras you plan to get, so we can keep a running tally of how many people want each system! \nEvery copy of the Aegis of Empires Adventure Path Deluxe Compilation includes a chapter for the Player's Guide that introduces the lore and history of the campaign for players and GMs alike, but some GMs might want to get a separate copy of the 48-page Player's Guide to hand out to their players for reference during play without having to hand the giant 600-page adventure book around the table! \nAdd $10 - Get a print copy of the Aegis of Empires Player's Guide (including rules for all three game systems)\nAdd $5 - Get an additional PDF copy of the Aegis of Empires Player's Guide that can be gifted or personalized to someone else\nIn addition, the Aegis of Empires Adventure Path includes a healthy dose of horror themes in places. GMs who wish to play up that side of the campaign can grab a copy of the Gothic Campaign Compendium, packed with 256 pages of horror-themed character options, monsters, spells, magic items, books of forbidden lore, expanded rules for madness and mutation, and three horror adventures (including two by Aegis of Empires maestro Greg Vaughan)! \nAdd $20 - Get the Gothic Campaign Compendium (Pathfinder RPG) PDF\nAdd $40 - Get the Gothic Campaign Compendium (Pathfinder RPG) print book and PDF (only 50 copies remaining)\nWhile the compiled version is only available for Pathfinder RPG, all of the horror-themed supplements that were combined into the Gothic Campaign Compendium also are available for 5E, though as 10 individual PDFs rather than a single compendium, but we are making them available to you as special a PDF bundle!\nAdd $20 - Get the Gothic Campaign Compendium (5E) PDF Horror Bundle (10 PDFs)\nThe Aegis of Empires project is a straightforward one: no crazy bells and whistles, just a rock-solid, incredibly detailed, action-packed adventure saga by amazing authors that will challenge the courage and cleverness of even the most experienced players!  \nWe'll be talking with some of our favorite people throughout the course of the Kickstarter campaign, and we'll post links to their blogs, podcasts, and other links here as they go live! \nCheck out Legendary Games CEO Jason Nelson, Aegis of Empires Project Creator Greg Vaughan, and author of adventure #5, Race for Shataakh-Ulm, Tom Knauss on with the amazing Paco Jaen from GMS Magazine!\n Check out Jason and Greg on with Cameron from Comics, Clerics, and Controllers!\nhttps://comicsclericsandcontrollers.podbean.com/e/cerial-across-aegis-with-jason-and-greg/\n   And Jason and Greg tag-teaming with Dan Davenport at #randomworlds!\nhttps://gmshoe.wordpress.com/2020/06/02/qa-jason-eric-nelson-greg-vaughan-aegis-of-empires-adventure-path-for-5e-pathfinder-1e-and-2e/\nIs this an official \"Lost Lands\" product?\nIt is an officially licensed Lost Lands product, using all of the same people, places, deities, politics, and history from ancient Hyperborea to modern Foere, Reme, and beyond that make this such a rich and immersive place to set your game. If you want more details on this campaign setting, you can pick up the 518-page World of the Lost Lands book at DrivethruRPG, compatible with every game system! Those wanting a more in-depth look at the Grand Duchy of Reme and surrounding lands, which are featured in several of the early adventures in this saga, can pick up the 154-page Grand Duchy of Reme sourcebook at DrivethruRPG.\nCan I play this campaign in other worlds?\nAbsolutely! There is a great deal of world lore embedded into the Aegis of Empires Adventure Path, with historical and cultural information about the cities, nations, and wilderness regions used in the adventure path presented in the Player's Guide and the appendices of the adventures. You can place the adventure path within a self-contained region of your own home world, using the campaign background provided in those sections of this book, or adapt it to connect to existing people and places in your own campaign world.  \nDo you have any other Kickstarter projects that are not yet fulfilled?\nAll other Legendary Games Kickstarter projects have been completed, aside from waiting for print books to arrive and ship for Ultimate Kingdoms and the 5E version of Legendary Planet (PDFs already sent for both). \nHow much do I add for shipping?\nYou add nothing for shipping with your initial pledge. Shipping will be billed later through Backerkit for all print orders. \nWhy Backerkit?\nIn the past we've used our own spreadsheet system to organize rewards, pledges, and backer information, but for this project we're giving the Backerkit system a try to see how it compares in terms of speed and efficiency. All reward fulfillment requires Backerkit checkout, and you'll create a Backerkit account (if you don't already have one) when you select your reward. Making this account verifies your shipping address (and allows you to change it directly in the system without having to email us separately in case you move) and your pledge selection. We'll also send out a post-Kickstarter survey through Backerkit so you can select any additional items you'd like to add to your pledge, such as additional versions of the book for different rule systems. Please complete the Backerkit process ASAP so we can get you your rewards quickly!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLegendary Games is proud to announce that they have finally closed out several long-running Kickstarters.

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Art by Julianne Griepp\nFrom the creative mind behind Icarus: A Storytelling Game About How Great Civilizations Fall, comes Spenser Starke\u2019s next project Alice is Missing, a silent role-playing game about the disappearance of Alice Briarwood, a high school junior in the small town of Silent Falls. \nDeveloped by Hunters Entertainment and published & distributed by Renegade Game Studios, Alice Is Missing is a unique kind of roleplaying game in which players only communicate using their phones, sending text messages to each other as they unearth clues about what happened to Alice.\nThe game is played live and without verbal communication. Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren\u2019t in the same place together. \nHaunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative Alice is Missing puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another. Right at home with games like Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, and Firewatch, it\u2019s designed to feel as much like an event-style experience as it does a role-playing game.\nAlice Is Missing runs over a single session of 2-3 hours, with 3-5 players. In the first 45 minutes, players create their characters, their relationships to Alice, and their ties with each other. The next 90 minutes are spent uncovering secrets and unearthing clues in an attempt to discover where Alice is, and who is behind her disappearance.\nThough text messages seem to be the most common mode of communication in our modern era, they are rarely utilized as a storytelling medium.\nThe integration of texting into the gameplay unlocks a brand new way to play RPGs that is unlike anything you\u2019ve likely experienced before. It\u2019s personal, immersive, and perfect for remote play.\n\nPowered by simple but unique card mechanics that give everyone equal footing in telling the story, the game runs without a GM, or gamemaster, and instead empowers the players to create the story together.\nWhile in-game time is fluid and the text messages could take place over the course of a day or more, the actual gameplay lasts a total of 90 minutes and is accompanied by a beautifully cinematic, licensed music playlist (featuring artists such as Message To Bears, This Patch of Sky, Justin LaPointe, and Be Still The Earth) which acts as both a timer and a soundtrack for the game.\nYou\u2019ll start by choosing characters, drawing a motive for how that character acts, and assigning relationships to one another. Then, using the appropriate prompts on your character card, each player will record a secret voicemail to be played at the end of the game.\nYou\u2019ll then establish some important information about your town of Silent Falls by choosing suspects and locations you think could have played a part in Alice\u2019s disappearance. Lastly, you\u2019ll receive Clue Cards that will be used during the game to generate information about the mystery you\u2019re unraveling.\nOnce the timer starts and the game begins, you\u2019ll flip your Clue Card when the number on the timer hits the number on the Clue Card\u2019s back. This will often result in you drawing a card from the Suspect or Location deck and combining it with the prompt on the Clue Card to create the information your character uncovers.\nThis clue is then worked into the text conversation between the characters organically.\n\nThese clues will continue to be revealed throughout the game, building tension and heightening the stakes until the 10-minute card flips, and the game comes to its climactic end.\n Once the timer goes off at 90 minutes, players will have the opportunity to send one last text message before the secret voicemails play over the closing music track. Once the voicemails are finished and the current song ends, the game comes to a close. \nBy putting its lens on the relationships, tensions, and story arcs between the characters looking for Alice just as much as the search for Alice itself, the game challenges players to explore aspects of emotional intimacy and personal connection in a unique and accessible way.\nAlice Is Missing inherently deals with mature themes and potentially-difficult topics such as gender, sexuality, violence, and grief. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to bring on the incredibly talented Lauren McManamon (Girl Underground, Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG, Codex) as our editor to ensure these topics are approached in a thoughtful and responsible manner. \nWe\u2019ve also included important tools to help navigate these themes at the table (and off the table) to ensure everyone has both an exhilarating and positive experience.\nThough the game has been in development for the last year, in an unintentional way, it mirrors the reality we now face during this era of social distancing; the craving for connection despite the distance that may be between us.\nAlice is Missing provides a unique way to play without the traditional hang-ups that come with trying to structure a Virtual Table Top session. Since the only time you'll need to 'go to the table' is to grab a card. The meat of gameplay exists on your mobile devices.\n We\u2019ve put a great deal of work into ensuring Alice Is Missing will be available as a marketplace item on Roll20 not long after the campaign ends. With the lack of in-person gaming opportunities given the current social distancing orders in place around the world, we hope by making the game available in this format quickly, it will allow players to share a unique roleplaying experience together from the comfort and safety of their own home.\nThe Roll20 version of the game will not replace the use of players\u2019 phones for sending text messages back and forth during the game. It will instead serve as your shared table during online play, allowing everyone to interact with the cards that drive the narrative forward.\n For those of you who would rather not use Roll20, we are offering a PDF with a Print on Demand cards via DTRPG to use with your other messaging systems of choice. It\u2019s important to emphasize, however, that the cards need to be communally accessible individually via a cloud or other software to manage remote play in this way.\nWe plan to release the digital version of Alice is Missing in July 2020. We plan to release the physical version to our backers in November 2020, with the game being made available to stores soon after through a global publishing deal with Renegade Game Studios. We will use DriveThruRPG for all of our digital fulfillment.\n For this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item. YOUR PLEDGE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE COST OF SHIPPING. \nWe will be using a pledge manager to collect information from backers. \n We will be using Gamerati for all of our domestic and international fulfillment purposes.\nDomestic Shipping: For traditional USPS shipping, we expect to charge ~$8 USD per package through our warehouse for the physical pledge.\nInternational Shipping: We will be working with our fulfillment partner for available countries in order to ship via local shipping options. \nWe expect the cost of shipping for the physical package to be as follows: \nAustralia and New Zealand: ~$8 USD\nCanada and the European Union: ~$12 USD \nEurope (Non-EU): ~$19 USD\nRest of the world ~$25 USD\nNOTE: The final cost of shipping may differ from our estimations.\nNOTE: Roll20\u00ae is not responsible for the creation or timely delivery of this content.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have run multiple Kickstarter campaigns in the past, including Outbreak: Undead, Kids on Bikes, Overlight, Icarus, and The ABCs of RPG (D&D), and Altered Carbon: The Role Playing Game. \n\nThe manufacturing process is out of our hands and might cause unexpected delays for the physical rewards, as we have experienced in the past \u2014 especially during this current climate \u2014 but we will do everything in our power to ensure everything progresses as smoothly as possible.\n\nWhile we are opening shipping to the entire world, there is always the possibility of unforeseen complications with the delivery to some locations.\n\nFor our previous backers who are aware of our US warehouse issues we've had in the past (damaged goods), our new relationship with Gamerati ensures that this project will not suffer the same issues.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Access to Pledge manager", "descp": "Can't afford to get in on the Kickstarter right now?

We are excited to offer our new expansion for the game, Leaders & Legends!\nLeaders & Legends is an expansion for Hellenica: Story of Greece that adds unique leaders to the game allowing players to modify the characteristics of their city-state.\nEach leader confers a special bonus on the city-state that recruits them. For example, Heracles aids in fighting Mythological Creatures while Socrates makes your research more productive. Each leader is represented by a deck of cards that appear in a market that players review to recruit the leaders that they want. But, watch out, other players may be desiring the same leaders as you and leaders will not serve two city-states!\nNew to Hellenica? No problem! \nWe are offering the Limited Edition Core Game (jam packed with Stretch Goals from the previous campaign) on this campaign as well!\nLimited Edition Hellenica Core Game - A whopping 11.8lbs of gaming goodness!\nAn explosion of creativity and violence erupted in the Aegean Basin in 800 B.C. that defined ancient Greece. This combination of science, mythology, development, and war was led by powerful city-states like Athens, Sparta, Corinth, Troy, Byzantium, Corcyra, and Thebes. These states vied for control over their rivals and dominated the lesser states around them. In time, some of them became so well known that they are remembered even today.\nEverything inside of the Limited Edition Hellenica Core Game\nHellenica: Story of Greece is a 3.5X civilization game in which you harness the powers of one of seven beginning city-states to dominate the world around you. Your goal is to become the preeminent symbol of Greece for all posterity by completing a combination of secret and public goals. Will you be remembered as a warmonger or a peaceful philosopher? Great priest or apostate? Will you develop a devotion to the gods or focus on the advancement of your people? Can you guide your civilization during these turbulent times? Will your vision of Hellenic civilization be remembered for all time, or will you merely be a stepping stone for another\u2026?\nHellenica is MASSIVE! We cannot wait to show you more below, in our Pledge Levels and Videos!\nThank you for considering supporting us - every bit of support helps us keep spreading the word of our games and the world of Hellenica!\nThe Loyal Patron - This level will give you access to our updates and reserve you a spot in our Pledge Manager after the campaign, should you decide to upgrade your support later. Does not include Stretch Goals, unless upgraded in the Pledge Manager.\nFollow Along - and maybe join in later via our Pledge Manager!\nThe LEADERS - FOR PREVIOUS BACKERS ONLY!  (who already have the Themed AI).\n 1 Copy of the Hellenica: Leaders & Legends Expansion with its unlocked Stretch Goals - The Leaders & Legends Expansion will come with lots of goodies (except those 7 Themed Decks you already own) and likely some new goodies via Stretch Goals!\n**Please Note - Previous Backers may add on the Mythic Expansion (see Add-ons)\nDoes NOT include 7 Themed AI Decks - because you added it on last campaign!\nThe Legends - FOR PREVIOUS BACKERS ONLY (who would like to have the Themed AI).\n1 Copy of The DELUXE Hellenica: Leaders & Legends Expansion with its unlocked Stretch Goals - The Leaders & Legends Expansion will come with lots of goodies (including those 7 Themed AI decks you missed out on the first campaign) and likely some new goodies via Stretch Goals!\n **Please Note - Previous Backers may add on the Mythic Expansion (see Add-ons)\nEverything new for Hellenica - INCLUDING the 7 decks of Themed AI!\nDeluxe Aphrodite - For NEW Backers  (who are fine with tokens for Military Units).\n1 Copy of The LIMITED EDITION Hellenica Core Game AND 1 Copy of The DELUXE Leaders & Legends expansion with all STRETCH GOALS** - Thanks to our Previous Campaign, The Hellenica Core Game is CHOCKED FULL of Stretch Goal Goodness - all included in your pledge! This campaign will focus on New Stretch Goals for the Leaders and Legends Expansion. \n**Does not include Mythic Expansion miniatures or stretch goals. If you would like to add the Mythic Expansion minis, simply pledge to the Deluxe Zeus level instead!\nEverything for Hellenica EXCEPT the MYTHIC EXPANSION military Minis!\nDeluxe Zeus - For NEW Backers  (who want Mythic minis in addition to tokens).\n1 Copy of The LIMITED EDITION Hellenica Core Game, 1 Copy of DELUXE Leaders & Legends expansion,  AND 1 copy of the LIMITED EDITION Mythic Expansion plus ALL STRETCH GOALS (including new minis)  - Our hope is we will unlock several items for the Mythic Expansion AND Leaders & Legends via Stretch Goals.\nEverything we have made for Hellenica to date!\n*** Now And Later Versions of Zeus and Aphrodite will ship in two parts - Part 1, In July 2020 so you can have the core game NOW and Part 2 (Leaders & Legends) in September 2021 - AKA Later!\n===================================================================\n For Our Retail Partners Only\nFor Retail Stores Only - This level will reserve you 2 copies of the Deluxe Hellenica: Leaders & Legends expansion AND gain you access to our pledge manager where you can purchase copies of the Base Game of Hellenica and the Leaders & Legends Expansion directly from us with all Stretch Goals and retail perks (similar to all our previous campaigns) as supplies are available/last. A Tax ID is required for this level.\nThank you for the support - Will include access to the Pledge Manager and any remaining stock!\nPLEASE NOTE - This is NOT a discounted pledge or a 2 copy pledge - it is a package for our retail partners to help promote the game with us. You will need to provide a Tax ID in the Pledge Manager to access this reward. Pledges to this level will be converted to a Legends Pledge should no ID be available.\n We struggled with the \"do we offer any add-ons\" question. Mostly because we included the items we were going to offer in the Leaders & Legends box - so we decided to list every add-on or expansion we have made for Hellenica to date in this section - and how you can get it.\nOver 240 Minis are inside the Mythic Expansion!\nMythic Expansion - The Military Units and Mythic Creature miniatures for Hellenica! - If you would like to add the Mythic Expansion to your $35 or $75 pledge level, simply add $85 to your pledge - If you are new to Hellenica just pledge Zeus if you want it included with your core game and expansion (already built in). You will be able to assign this in the Pledge Manager after. \n*Please Note - reprints of the Mythic Expansion are subject to a minimum of 100 pledges - if we do not have enough demand to reprint we will simply refund your $85 after the campaign. We do not expect this to be an issue - and will do an update when we hit 100 backers of the Mythic Expansion add on.\n Neoprene Playmat - Another Cool idea from the Backers. We are finally able to offer this as a $40 add-on. If you would like one, simply add $40 to your pledge and you will be able to select the mat in our pledge manager after the campaign (please note there will be a shipping cost to deliver the map in the PM and that cost is still TBD).\nWe anticipate the map to be between 10 and 25% larger than the original map (it will only be one sided - historical. We have 100 backers! This is for sure being made!\nSTRETCH GOAL - if we get 200 people to add it on, we will upgrade all of the mats to stitched edges! (we will count mats added on in the Pledge Manager!)\nThemed AI and Extra Dice are already included in Leaders & Legends\nThemed AI - In our Original Campaign we offered 7 decks of themed AI as a $49 add on - these will now be a part of Leaders & Legends - an add on you do not need to buy - simply back Leaders & Legends to get them :) - why did we offer 2 versions of Leaders & Legends in the rewards section? For folks from our first campaign who already have the Themed AI (or those who don't but already have the core game). \nExtra Dice - A Cool Idea from our original campaign backers - so cool in fact, we added them to Leaders & Legends - another add on you do not need to buy - simply back Leaders & Legends to get them :)\nThicker Card Stock and Linen Finish - To ensure Leaders & Legends integrates well with the Hellenica Core Game, we are starting the campaign off with both included!\nThe Limited Edition Hellenica Core Game, and Mythic Expansions are already packed with extras from our first campaign, so the Stretch Goals on this campaign will be focused on the Leaders & Legends expansion. Our intent is to improve the quality and add even more content via Stretch Goals.  Help us spread the word and expand the game!\n 20k - UNLOCKED \nThanks to your support, Leaders and Legends can become a reality!                                     ***Because we funded in the first 6hrs, we have unlocked our first 3 new Stretch Goals - Linen Finish, Thicker Cards and Thicker Tokens!!!\n+ 3 bonus Stretch Goals unlocked!

You all are the best and literally helped keep us working in 2020. Thank you all so much for the support!\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Since the Debut of Hellenica, we have had alot of great videos pop up. Below are some of our favorite ones. We did not do a video for the expansion, but we may do some playthroughs and such in the coming weeks. \nDice Tower - Mark and Randy discuss Hellenica!\nBoard to Death Review - Hellenica!\nHeavy Cardboard 4p and 1 Ai Playthrough\nGaming Trend - An in depth preview of their Plays\nBoardgame corner playthrough video with Mark and Sean\nMark and I had a blast playing the game on Caffeine - if you have not done so, check out Marks channel there, it is chalked full of awesomeness!\nPLEASE NOTE:  The Limited edition of Leaders & Legends will likely not go into traditional distribution (much like the Core Game and Mythic Expansions last time) - consider pledging today to ensure you don't miss it!\nShipping will be collected after the campaign via our Pledge Manager and include a sizable subsidy from Mr. B. Games to help keep your costs lower than they would be otherwise - Hellenica is a big, heavy game! (think Gloomhaven Big/Heavy).\nEstimates Below are for Leaders & Legends Only. Aphrodite and Zeus pledges will cost more and will be calculated in the Pledge Manager later based on your location from one of our 4 shipping hubs (listed in bold below).\nUSA - We expect the cost to be around $14-$19 and the prices will vary for Aphrodite and Zeus depending on your location - last campaign these ran around $20 - $28 (Exact shipping will be calculated later in the Pledge Manager)\nEU/UK - WE WILL BE EU FRIENDLY!  we estimate $19-$28 for the expansion (shipped from our EU Hub) - though Brexit may effect UK rates - and the prices will vary for Aphrodite and Zeus depending on your location - last campaign these ran around $28-$35 (Exact shipping will be calculated later in the Pledge Manager)\nCanada is looking around $19-$28 for the expansion (shipped from our Canada hub) and the prices will vary for Aphrodite and Zeus depending on your location - last campaign these ran around $28-$35 (Exact shipping will be calculated later in the Pledge Manager)\nChina/Oceania is looking around $20-$28 for the expansion (shipped from our China hub) and the prices will vary for Aphrodite and Zeus depending on your location - last campaign these ran around $28-$35 (Exact shipping will be calculated later in the Pledge Manager) AUS and NZ prices will be slightly higher\nWorldwide prices varying from $35 - $75 depending on your location (most of those fall in the $39 - $49 range but some destinations are outside our control).  The prices will vary for Aphrodite and Zeus depending on your location (calculated later in the Pledge Manager)\nPLEASE NOTE - All Shipping prices are estimates at this time, as we use kickstarter to determine what exactly to put inside! Final prices will be set in our Pledge Manager after the campaign and when we are closer to shipping.\nCountries Excluded: We are no longer able to ship to Brazil, Russia, Mexico, South Africa, South America or the Middle East due to high postage prices, and lost parcels. If you live in one of these areas, we recommend you use a USA address and have the game forwarded to you via a relative/friend or postage forwarding company.\nWe continue to work with different fulfillment centers all over the world to ensure better and more affordable delivery each campaign but none will guarantee delivery to these countries. We use 3rd party fulfillment houses and cannot control the speed of delivery to some areas but will always use the best options available. Damages may occur during transit - you should always try to work with your local carrier if possible and contact our customer service if you have any issues (mrbgames.cs(atsymbol)gmail)\nOur goal is to use Pledge Manager for this campaign. We will send links and info in an update as well as to the emails you provide when backing this campaign. There are many advantages to using a Pledge Manager, such as late add ons, the ability to change your address as much as you like until we lock them (usually a few weeks before delivery) and a more accurate cost for you, the backer, on delivery costs. We also plan to ship in 3 waves. The first will be to those who fill out their pledge managers by our announced cut off date. Wave 2 will follow shortly after, with a final Wave after that. Those who do not fill in their surveys by the wave 1 cutoff are subject to vat and shipping fees outside the usa if we do not have quantities remaining in our EU facility to fill orders (IE they are sent from China or the USA instead).\nPLEASE NOTE THESE ARE JUST ESTIMATES - final shipping costs will be in the PM.\nClick HERE to check out an early Draft of the rulebook for Leaders & Legends!\nNo project could be possible without a team of folks to help us. Hellenica is no exception. Below are just some of the folks who are making this project possible:\nDesigner - Scott DeMers - Scott has been involved with gaming for as long as he can remember going all the way back to his brothers tricking him into losing his Marshall in his first game of Stratego. Outside of board gaming, Scott has a lengthy background in the software industry where he has worked in visualization, data, artificial intelligence, NLP, and video gaming, having founded and started his own video game company. His experience with AI was one of his key reasons for including solo play in Hellenica out of the box. Scott would like to thank the many playtesters who helped fine tune this game starting with the original crew in Wisconsin all the way to the Prototopia gang in Denver.\nProject Lead and Developer - Sean Brown - Sean has worked in the game industry for almost 15 years, many of them for  Mr. B. Games and Eagle Games as a salesmen, co-designer, graphic artist, marketing director, developer, and warehouse manager (many at the same time) since 2006. He has worked on Alien Uprising, Spurs, Realm of Heroes, Zothren Invasion, Posthuman, Days of Ire, Madness at Midnight, WarQuest, Liars Dice, Prospectus, Helionox, and Clockwork Kingdom as a designer, developer and/or graphic artist for Mr. B. Games as well as the following titles via graphic art, development or co-design work while at Eagle Games: Age of Steam, Age of Empires III, Attack Deluxe, Baltimore and Ohio, Brass, Defenders of the Realm and all of its expansions, Defenders Battlefields, Empires Builder Expansion, I'm the Boss TCG, Incan Gold, New England Railways, Pirate Dice, Railways of the World and all of its expansions, Roll through the Ages, Through the Ages, Tumblin Dice, and Wizards Brew.\nSales and Production - Mr. B. Games - Mr. B is a small publishing company started by Sean Brown in 2005 to publish his own game designs, that has grown to include 3 studios and worldwide distribution.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nIf you need us, please contact us via our customer service CS email NOT via KS messaging or comments (which can be missed).  \nOUR CS EMAIL IS ---     mrbgames.cs(at symbol)gmail.com\nBy pledging to this campaign you agree to the following terms and conditions:\nIf for any reason, you find that after the Kickstarter has ended, you need to cancel, we will work with you to best make that happen. Email our CS for help (mrbgames.cs(at symbol)gmail). If you cancel within 30 days of the end of the Kickstarter, we are able to do a complete refund via the Kickstarter payments system (including KS fees!) After 30 days and up until the month before we ship the rewards, we are able to do a 90% refund (less Kickstarter and CC processing fees) via paypal. For a refund request after shipping addresses have locked (aprox. 4 weeks before shipping), we ask you email us at mrbgames.cs (at) gmail.com and we will try to work with you for a partial refund if possible, but you will be responsible for return shipping. If for any reason you feel you have a missing item or damaged item, please email us at mrbgames.cs (at) gmail.com with photos of damage, your backer number, backer name, and complete address and we will work to replace the missing or damaged items ASAP. Do not post in the comments, or other forums as we may miss them or be delayed in replying. We will make sure we have replacement parts for at least 1 year from the time we ship. Requests after 1 year will be subject to availability (though historically we have had extra parts for 2-3 years).\nThe following Terms are accepted by you, the backer when you pledge, so we can ensure smooth delivery for all. Pledging to one of our Kickstarter projects is NOT a pre-order - it is a very welcomed show of support to a small company helping us produce a new product. Your data is always safe as we use a 3rd party service to secure it and contact you about projects - you may opt out of this contact at the bottom of each email (we send these about 3x a year - during the launch of a KS campaign usually). Surveys not filled in after 3 months of final delivery (from the \"Last Call\" update) or missing reward requests after 3 months of your game shipment will be treated as a no reward pledge. Please help us get you your rewards by emailing our CS with any issues you may have in a timely manner and filling in your survey in a timely manner. Watch for updates on all shipping statuses. All our major communications will be via Updates. Our Privacy Policy is posted on our website and by pledging to one of our campaigns you agree to its terms and conditions which are compliant around the world for a USA based company mailing pledge rewards to its backers.\nIf your reward goes missing due to a bad address, pledging from a country we listed as unshippable/restricted, or failure to pick up the reward on your end, contact our CS and we can arrange a replacement but will need to collect shipping again. If this is an error on our end we will reship at no cost to you.\nMissing reward requests should be sent to our CS no later than 30 days after your shipping wave update, as tracking numbers become difficult to track after 30 days. Help us help deliver for you :) Please provide pictures of damages if your reward arrives damaged and try your local carrier first - then our CS to help if you cannot get a resolution from the carrier re: damage.\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look and materials of the project and hence the rewards, are subject to change and may differ from what is presented while the Kickstarter campaign was active.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 comics and their related promos. Estimates for 2 comics will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is The Emerald Flame? \nHours of puzzles with an interwoven narrative packed into a beautifully illustrated tabletop game. \nLike a blend of escape rooms, board games, and interactive fiction, The Emerald Flame tells an exciting story over three distinct episodes, each packed with puzzles of varying difficulty designed to challenge and engage players of all experience levels.\nCommissioned by the Koschei Historical Society, you will take on the role of a historical expert and embark on a quest to piece together a recipe for a transformative elixir by deciphering messages, interpreting alchemical diagrams, and manipulating mysterious artifacts. \nPlay cooperatively as a group or go on a solo adventure! Each of the 3 chapters takes about 2-3 hours to solve, totaling 6-9 hours of gameplay. \nPostCurious, the company behind the \u201cinsidiously clever\u201d puzzle adventure The Tale of Ord, invites you to be part of the story and uncover what many have sought for centuries: what hides in the glow of The Emerald Flame.   \nThe Emerald Flame requires no setup, and no complicated rules. You will need an internet-connected device for the use of a web browser, but there is no outside knowledge or research required.   \nExplore the objects, solve puzzles, and submit your solutions into an online chat to get responses in real time. If you get stuck on a puzzle, don\u2019t worry! You\u2019ll have a detailed online hinting system at your disposal should you need a nudge in the right direction.\n CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE RULES DOC \nThe base game will include a refill kit that will allow for one additional play-through by another group. UPDATE: Because we have hit a stretch goal, Kickstarter backers at the Junior Alchemist and up level will receive a 2nd refill kit. More on the refill kit below.   \nIt would mean so much to us if you would help us reach our funding goal by pledging for a copy of the game! We do also understand that everyone\u2019s circumstances are different in these uncertain times. As long as supplies last, Patron and Apprentice backers will be able to upgrade their pledge at a later date when things are hopefully more certain.    \nUPDATE: The enamel pin poll is open in update #8. Because we reached our $150k stretch goal, the winner of the poll will be included for Junior Alchemist backers, and BOTH pins will be included in the Apprentice Pack! \nJoin us for puzzles throughout the campaign! \nThe story of The Emerald Flame revolves around working with the Koschei Historical Society to analyze a legendary alchemist\u2019s work\u2026 but The Koschei Society first needs your help to find that work! You are being invited to join the investigation at its earliest stages and help them follow a series of clues that will hopefully lead to the location of the alchemist\u2019s hiding spot.   \nWe expect to find 5 artifacts, one of which will be posted on the Koschei Society forum every Wednesday evening, before being shared publicly on Thursdays in our campaign updates and on social media. You can join the forum to see the puzzles early and/or to solve them with others as a group!\nTo join the forum, find the two words hidden somewhere on this Kickstarter page. One will complete this link www.koscheisociety.org/__________ (10 letters) and the other will give you a 5-letter password (enter in lowercase) to access the page. Regardless of whether or not you join the forum, any backer who submits all 5 correct answers before the end of the campaign will be entered to win a special art prize! You can submit your answers at www.koscheisociety.org/submit.\nIf you're having trouble figuring out the password, take a look at the banner below and see if a tilt in perspective helps. :)   \nNow that we have hit our funding goal, we\u2019ve got lots of great stretch goals for The Emerald Flame, including upgraded components and additional items! You can help us reach them by sharing the project on social media - the more people we can get it out to, the more we can unlock all sorts of goodies! \n Share the project and follow at the links below! \nPostCurious Website\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nBoard Game Geek\nAlways another puzzle! With The Emerald Flame in your hands you can discover 3 secret messages hiding in the box artwork.\nAbout the refill kit: Now that we have hit our first stretch goal, the refill kit will include one set of replacements for the non-reusable components, should you want to repackage and pass the game on to someone else. PDFs will be also be provided for the paper components in case extras are needed or if you are playing with a friend remotely. One of our next stretch goals is an additional copy of the refill kit, which would mean a total of 3 possible play-throughs of the game.    \nRest assured we did our best to find the most reliable and affordable shipping options we could, and are also subsidizing shipping to all regions by $3 USD. Please note that the chart below shows shipping estimates, and shipping will be charged after the campaign using a pledge manager. Depending on your location and postage prices at the time of fulfillment, it may be necessary to adjust the shipping cost by a small amount.   \n**Rest of the world disclaimer: We are willing to ship worldwide, but please note that countries not listed in the shipping chart above will be considered \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be held responsible for mishandled packages. COVID-19 guidelines have also forced the USPS to temporarily suspend shipping to certain countries around the world. We do not know when these restrictions will be lifted, and it\u2019s very possible this won\u2019t be relevant by the time rewards are shipped out, but for the time being we will not be able to ship to the countries on this list.\nTo streamline the process as much as possible and offer more affordable shipping to international backers, we plan to warehouse in the US and UK, partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Oceania, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Please note that while we are offering customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, Australia, New Zealand, & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. \nPlay The Emerald Flame in your language: The majority of puzzles in The Emerald Flame do not depend on language and the few that do require only a very basic understanding of English. To make The Emerald Flame more accessible to a global audience, we currently plan to translate all the text in the game to make playing in Spanish, German, and French as easy as possible. Players will be able to download a free PDF and read all the clues and letters in their chosen language while using the physical components to solve the puzzles. For other language requests feel free to reach out to us and if there is significant demand we will look into the possibility.\nJuega a The Emerald Flame (La llama esmeralda) en tu propio idioma: La resoluci\u00f3n de la mayor\u00eda de los acertijos de Emerald Flame no depende del idioma, y los pocos en los que es necesario basta con unas nociones b\u00e1sicas de ingl\u00e9s.

Los jugadores podr\u00e1n descargarse gratuitamente un archivo PDF, y as\u00ed leer todas las pistas y cartas en el idioma que prefieran, al tiempo que utilizan todos los componentes f\u00edsicos para resolver el puzle.\nSpielen Sie die Emerald Flame (Die smaragdgr\u00fcne Flamme) in Ihrer Sprache: Die meisten R\u00e4tsel in die Emerald Flame h\u00e4ngen nicht von der Sprache ab und die wenigen, die nur ein sehr grundlegendes Verst\u00e4ndnis der englischen Sprache erfordern. Um die Emerald Flame einem globalen Publikum zug\u00e4nglicher zu machen, \u00fcbersetzen wir den gesamten Text des Spiels, um das Spielen auf Deutsch so einfach wie m\u00f6glich zu gestalten. Die Spieler k\u00f6nnen ein kostenloses PDF herunterladen und alle Hinweise und Buchstaben in der von ihnen gew\u00e4hlten Sprache lesen, w\u00e4hrend sie die physischen Komponenten verwenden, um die R\u00e4tsel zu l\u00f6sen.\nJouez \u00e0The Emerald Flame (La Flamme d\u2019\u00c9meraude) dans votre langue : La plupart des \u00e9nigmes pr\u00e9sentes dans The Emerald Flame ne sont associ\u00e9es \u00e0 aucune langue et les quelques \u00e9nigmes qui le sont ne requi\u00e8rent que des connaissances de base de l\u2019anglais. Ceci dit, afin de rendre The Emerald Flame accessible au plus grand nombre et afin de vous offrir une exp\u00e9rience de jeu plus personnelle, nous avons d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de traduire tous les textes en fran\u00e7ais. Vous pourrez donc t\u00e9l\u00e9charger un fichier PDF gratuit contenant toutes les lettres et tous les indices du jeu traduits dans votre langue, tout en utilisant le mat\u00e9riel original pour r\u00e9soudre les secrets et les myst\u00e8res qui vous attendent.\nAfter two years of development, we could not be more excited to get the game into everyone\u2019s hands as soon as possible. If everything goes according to plan we should be able to deliver MUCH SOONER than what is shown on this schedule, but due to the complexity of manufacturing this game and the current global circumstances, we are being overly cautious with our promised ship dates in case we encounter any unexpected delays.\nDesign and development - May 2018 - March 2020\nKickstarter campaign - May - June 2020\nKickstarter funds deposited, format files for printing - July 2020\nSampling and production - August 2020 - May 2021\nDelivery of The Emerald Flame & standard reward tiers - Aug 2021\nDelivery of Collector\u2019s Edition reward tiers - Sept 2021\nPlease note that due to the personalized nature of the Collector\u2019s Edition, delivery for these tiers will come shortly after the standard version. We hope you\u2019ll understand these will require a little extra time to get the special attention they deserve. \nWe want to be as transparent as possible with our funding. Although there have been many costs incurred throughout the development of the project, our funding goal includes only what we need to make the game and deliver it to you.

After working in the escape room industry, she was inspired to create her first game, The Tale of Ord, by her love of nature, mythology, and the journey of discovery that can be created through puzzles and gamified storytelling. The Emerald Flame follows this inspiration, and after nearly two years of development and meticulous crafting, Rita can\u2019t be more excited to finally bring it to Kickstarter and share it with the world. \nPLAY\n\nRita holds a BFA in Furniture Design from the Rhode Island School of Design and loves talking to other creators about making things.

These will be done immediately after the Kickstarter campaign ends while we wait for the funds so there should be no delays on the creative front. If we reach certain stretch goals, there may be some additional artwork to produce, but we don\u2019t foresee this causing any delay as it can be completed during the sampling phase.\n\nManufacturing \n\nThis will be PostCurious\u2019 first time working with a manufacturer, which comes with its own challenges. The Emerald Flame is a complex game to produce, so sampling with the factory may take some time. The production copy will be fully inspected by us to make sure everything looks and works the way it should. Please note that due to material availability and manufacturing processes, some components may appear different than shown in the prototype images. As with any project that has complex custom components, there is also a risk of changes or delays, which is why we\u2019ve factored in extra time for manufacturing. We want to make sure the game is perfect for all our backers, and will always keep you updated in case of any changes.\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\n\nDelivering hundreds of games around the world is not an easy task, and there are many potential factors that could cause delays. We\u2019ll be partnering with Quartermaster Logistics for backers in the Americas, Australia, and Asia, and GamesQuest for backers in the UK and Europe. Both companies are experts in the field and we have full confidence in their ability to troubleshoot whatever obstacles may arise. Please note that while we guarantee customs friendly shipping to USA, Canada, UK, EU, AU, NZ & China backers, we cannot be responsible for VAT or customs charges incurred outside of these regions. Please also note that shipping will be charged after the campaign, and the numbers shown in the shipping chart are estimates only.\n\nCountries not listed in the chart of the \u201cshipping\u201d section above on this page are considered to be \u201cship at your own risk\u201d areas, meaning we cannot be responsible for mishandled packages in those regions. It is unclear how Brexit will affect shipping into the EU, but we\u2019ve been assured by GamesQuest that there are contingency plans in place should the outcome create obstacles in fulfillment. We do not expect this to affect anyone\u2019s rewards, but we will keep you posted if any changes occur. \n\nUnforeseen Events\n\nThroughout this process there is always a large number of variables at play, and many factors that could cause delays or changes. This could include severe weather, a global pandemic, or other unexpected circumstances. It is impossible to predict the outcome of such events or how they might affect the production of this project, but we will do everything we reasonably can to make sure the rewards are produced and delivered as promised. We are 100% committed to our backers and will always be sure to notify you with any changes that might affect this project\u2019s content, timeline, shipping, or otherwise. \n\nRefunds \n\nRefund requests received within 14 days of the end of the Kickstarter will be honored in full. Refunds requested after two weeks have passed will be subject to a 15-20% cancellation fee due to Kickstarter fees and administrative expenses. Once your order has been processed for shipping, we will no longer be able to offer refunds. Please note that anyone who does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund, and may encounter delays in receiving their rewards. \n\nBy pledging to this project you are indicating that you understand and give consent to the risks, challenges, and pledge terms laid out above.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Watchful Eye", "descp": "Just curious?

Jump in fast and tell your friends because this project only lasts a short time!\nCoin Count Update\nWith the increasing number of metal Campaign Coins that we're giving away, here's a table to help you determine what you're getting with the total funding amount of $30,000: \nI'll try to keep this updated through the project's end, each time we pass a $1K threshold.\nWhat is Island Siege?\n Number of Players: 1-4\n Play Time: 12 minutes per player\n Ages: 14+\nIsland Siege is a card game of colonization in the West Indies. Players build forts using stones from their supply, then move colonists to forts to populate them. Colonists in turn construct buildings and ships, which then house the colonists. Buildings provide players with special abilities, while ships are sent to lay siege to the opponent\u2019s forts.\nThe goal is for players to get all of their colonists into play on their forts, buildings and ships. Be careful, though, whenever a fort is destroyed by an opponent\u2019s fleet all of the colonists on that fort and its buildings are returned to the player's imperial board to start again! Alternately, players may win by earning 20 gold from constructing buildings and ships. Winning requires a keen balance of building and laying an Island Siege!\nYou can download the not-quite-finished rules here. You can get solo rules here, and Captains expansion rules from here!\nIf you're more the video-watching sort, here's an Island Siege preview that includes how to play Island Siege, by the Board Game Mechanic.\nHere's what players have said about the first edition of Island Siege.\nPurge Review of Island Siege 1st Edition\nTop Two-Player Game - The Board Game Captain!\nLynn, Ales and The Board Game Captain ran through their top ten 2-player games, and the Captain called Island Siege his favorite! (That's a fancy title page!) The Island Siege part starts at around 31:30.\n Customer Reviews\n The anniversary edition of Island Siege contains\n Engraved dice - No more stickers! The Anniversary Edition will contain engraved resin dice. Also, one of the dice will be a different color to indicate it is only used when enough colonists have been moved off of the imperial board.\n Two sets of  Kickstarter-exclusive metal Campaign Coins (26 total)! These metal coins will only be part of the Kickstarter experience. The retail version of the game will include cardboard punch board coins. EDIT: Stretch goals have unlocked extra coins, and more coins get unlocked each time we cross a $1K funding boundary!\n Components and rules for up to four players! The original two-player game included red and yellow colonists. The Anniversary Edition also includes green and blue colonists as well as additional coins, cubes and other components necessary for four players.\n Deluxe two-layer player imperial boards. The new imperial boards includes an island with a quarry to store accumulated stones and a port to dock your ship. The boards will be printed on a thick cardboard. Indentations keep pieces from shifting.\n Ramparts and Coquina expansions from original. The original Island Siege Kickstarter featured two expansions that weren't available in the retail version of the game. Ramparts adds 24 new forts, buildings and ships, while Coquina introduces soft pink coquina stones and cards that make forts much harder to eliminate.\n Solo rules and components. Dan has created new rules for playing Island Siege against the Ghost Captain!\n Stretch goals! Including 20 extra Captains cards and rules, 2 extra boards and rules for the Monuments expansion, and even more deluxe Campaign Coins!\nCoquina, Ramparts and the Ghost Captain\nThree expansions are included with the base pledge. These aren't stretch goals - they are included in the base pledge!\nCoquina\nThe Coquina expansion is included in the base Island Siege game pledge level. There are six new cards - 3 forts, 2 buildings and a ship card. It also contains 5 new stones - all of them pink to represent the soft coquina stones that compressed and gave way around cannonballs shot from ships instead of shattering. Since there are not  pink dice faces in Island Siege, these stones can only be removed by a second wave attack.  \nRamparts\nThe Ramparts expansion from the original print run is also included with the base Island Siege game pledge. Ramparts includes 24 additional forts, buildings and ships.\nGhost Captain Solo Rules\nThe Ghost Captain rules allow for the game to be played solo. Can you best the Ghost Captain?!\nTo add any of these items, just increase the pledge amount by the cost of the item(s) you wish to add. If you are not pledging for the base game, then you can use the Add-Ons Only pledge level to pledge just the add-on amount. \nShipping is one flat rate to your location. Add as many items as you want and the shipping rate won't change!\nExtra Island Siege Games: $29\nTo add extra copies of Island Siege, just add another $29 to your pledge. \nCoin Set (13 coins): $10\nThe base pledge will come with two sets of these super-high quality coins (26 coins in total) but if you want more then just add them to your pledge! Edit: More coins are being unlocked with stretch goals through the end of the project!\nDice:  $10\nDo you already have the Island Siege first edition but want to upgrade the dice? Or maybe you're getting the game but want to have a set of dice for each player!\nThese are the same dice as will ship in the base version of the game - etched, with a different color symbol on each face. The three base attack dice will be one color, while the bonus dice (used when the first level of the imperial board is clear) is darker, as a reminder that not all of the dice should be rolled by default.\nAPE works with companies around the world to do game fulfillment.\nYou will be notified of the shipping to your area when you select a pledge. \nNote: Adding items to your pledge does not change the shipping rate. You will be charged the same shipping rate for ordering a copy of the base game as you would for ordering two copies, or six copies, add-ons, etc.!\nWe put Island Siege on Tabletopia so that you can play online and still practice social distancing.\n Design: Dan Manfredini\n Art: Jared Blando\n Cover Art: Jim Maxwell\n Layout: Daniel Solis and Kevin Hill\n Publisher: Kevin Brusky and APE Games\nDan Manfredini, Designer\nDan Manfredini is a game designer from Round Rock, Texas.

It revolves around the disappearance of 20-year-old Xam Vanderbeek, a popular and successful DJ, and the son of the U.S. Ambassador to The Netherlands. You can experience this game together with friends, family, or colleagues from the comfort of your home.\nThe disappearance of Xam Vanderbeek will take you on a mysterious journey into the world of online crime investigation.

The Disappearance of Xam Vanderbeek is a completely digital experience that will be built entirely in-house by our own team. Eliminating third parties gives us complete control over our end product, and as this will be a digital-only experience, we\u2019re skipping the hassle of dealing with factories, patents, expensive shipping options, etc.\n\nThe biggest challenge we are facing now is the impact of the Corona-virus.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber.

Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid.

The game relies mostly on visuals, rather than words, although some riddles and puzzles will have a few words in English only.\nNew technological trends have heralded great changes in the world around us and have opened up new possibilities for investigation techniques and video games. We embrace these developments to create a truly immersive adventure unlike any you\u2019ve seen before.\nWe have fully incorporated VR technology and AR technology into the game. Enigma Box \"Arcanum\" uses an array of technology:\nWe only know how to develop one kind of game: THE BEST\nIt seems like an eternity to us but not so long ago (November 2017), we released The Enigma Box, an original and successful game that was a watershed in the market. The game combined the latest technology with research plots, mysteries and adventures, in a style similar to the pure concept of escape room.\nAlthough the results of this first initiative were magnificent, we didn\u2019t settle, because for us the only thing valuable is excellence. So we asked (a lot) and listened (much more) to our backers, fans and other people who tried The Enigma Box, who told us about their experiences, their proposals for improvement of the shape and background, and in short, any other matters that could help us continue to grow as a company and offer the best products possible. We had the opportunity to meet some of these individuals in person in Essen (at Spiel), and many others got in touch through various communication channels, but the conclusions were the same: great gaming satisfaction and hundreds of ideas to grow and improve. Thanks to the feedback, we have perfected our processes of design, production, logistics and even the gaming experience itself. We lack the words to thank our followers for everything they have shared with us.\nOur games have been tested, not only by our backers, but also by multiple fans of Team Building activities and Escape Rooms where our unique gaming system was used. More than 700 companies have passed through our experiences, and we have helped more than 1,100 teams to communicate, have fun and grow together. Among others, these companies include Coca-Cola, Leroy, GE, DKV, DHL, Mars, Oracle, Microsoft, Telefonica and Ikea.\nThe whole team has worked intensely and uninterruptedly to create this great product, innovative and entertaining, offering people an opportunity to experience the new and undiscovered; awakening their intuitions and developing new skills such as reflection and dexterity; increasing their understanding of the world and improving their general knowledge; and helping them dream of new opportunities in an infinite world of possibilities.\nWe are a team of professional experts in graphic adventures, challenges and logical game design, with more than 20 years of experience and international recognition in products based on new technologies. This combination of people, multidisciplinary experience and training together with market knowledge places The Enigma Box vol.1 \u00ae in an unbeatable position to become The Next Big Thing in entertainment systems. Exclusive on Kickstarter!\nWe have designed all the documents, pieces of art and riddles. We have also developed 3D and augmented reality technology for fully interactable virtual reality objects. We have closed a deal with different manufacturers and providers outlining the start of production with moulds and templates. We plan to make first deliveries to our customers in Oct 2020 (Estimated).\nAs you can see from the videos and images, we have a box: \u201cEnigma Box\u201d vol.1 \u00ae, which is fully functional. We have designed all the documents, pieces of art and riddles. Production of the box is not a problem, in addition to the money accumulated from Kickstarter, we can count on access to various venture capital funds to allow us to create an even higher quality experience.\nThe box will be limited to this campaign and we plan to offer additional purchases in the next months at a 20% premium on the initial campaign offer. This guarantees that the adventure and the objects of the box remain exclusive for a long period of time. \nWe only have to produce and create the number of units which this launch will gather. We plan to make first deliveries to our customer in Oct 2020.\n We would like to present to you our new adventure, Enigma Box (vol. 1), which brings back the experiences, games, and enigmas from our previous campaign \u201cThe Enigma Box\u201d but in a new format that is compact and affordable.\nWhy have we made these changes? We wanted to share the Enigma Box gaming experience with as many people as possible, so we reduced the game\u2019s price and duration (there are now only 5 complete scenarios) while maintaining the original version\u2019s intensity, excitement, technological features and mysteries.\nCorrections and Improvements\nWe have learned from experience and have made several improvements based on feedback from our backers: \nImproved the texts, translations and explanations.\nCorrected errors throughout the game and improved the riddles\n\n\nUntil today, The Rhomb \u00ae membership was carefully curated for specific functions and objectives. Our members come from different countries, cultures, and backgrounds, including universities, exclusive clubs, or investigation centers. We always rely on the latest technology and advances in historical research to discover events that were left unresolved and unexplained.\nThis project was launched with the support of teams from London and Madrid. We have been receiving help and guidance from expert historians, as well as explorers, high-caliber designers, engineers, technologists, and scientists. We have relied on international investment companies to back the project and guarantee its success.\nAt The Rhomb \u00ae, we have a passion for a job well done. We take pride in our finished products and aspire to the highest standards of quality, having attended meticulously to the smallest details. Each piece is a carefully designed and crafted component of the box and is presented as a work of art. All parts of the Enigma Box come together to create a masterpiece, an object that should be displayed in a museum, which is precisely what we did with The Enigma Box \u00ae.\nWe are experts in adventures, challenges, and designing logic games. Our team has years of experience in graphic arts and includes international leaders in designing new technology. We depend on respected historians who have unveiled new tests, documents, and amazing discoveries that have not yet been made public. This combination of people and resources makes Enigma Box (vol. 1) \u00ae a unique experience available exclusively via Kickstarter. We believe this will be the next big thing in entertainment and our goal is to make this project one of the most amazing campaigns ever launched on this platform.\n Will you help us create this challenge?\nWill you be a part of history? ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already carried out a Kickstarter campaign in the past that we delivered successfully, and that experience helped us understand better the whole process of product creation, manufacturing and shipping logistics. We were aware of all possible risks while creating a new product, so you can be sure that our project has been undertaken by professionals who did their best to keep it free from mistakes.\nWe have extensive experience in launching games, Escape Rooms, puzzles and also in the management of new technologies. There is a risk that we will have to implement some modifications during manufacturing, and this might happen mainly due to the following reasons:\n\n\u25cf Creativity: When using some original documents and historical elements from the public domain, it may occur that for copyright reasons we have to change some creativity.\n\n\u25cf Sizes, formats and qualities: We already have found several suppliers of the materials, as seen in the prototypes. We have agreed on sizes and qualities, but there is a risk that during the mass production process some formats might need to be slightly modified due to the manufacturing process.\nWe will do our best to keep everything under control and to make sure that the final product will not be significantly affected.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Our experience tells us that we will need around 3-4 months to finalize the production. We believe we will be able to deliver on time for Christmas 2020, but we can't commit 100% as we rely on more than seven different providers so some delays may occur. It will also depend on the pace of production as well as the freight companies. But we'll do everything we can to deliver on time.\n\n\nIMPORTANT: Intellectual property and copyright\n\nIn the research, design, development and production of Enigma Box (vol.1), we have made use of different elements, images and historical documents. We have maintained maximum rigor, ensuring that all elements are in the public domain. We have acquired the rights to certain images and visuals, as well as ensured that the copyrights of the elements used have expired.\n\n\nChallenges\n\nThe hardest part is done, however, as plans and materials are ready for mass production. Our products have a variety of materials and objects and should any not be available when production begins, be it due to lack of stock or discontinuation, it will be replaced with a similar item.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you acknowledge that the final look and contents of the pledges may change and differ from what is presented at the start of the campaign. We have estimated the delivery for Oct 2020 but please understand this is only an estimate. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nWe are prepared with our production as much as possible, however we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all. We will be unable to refund the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Pledge Manager or other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment.\n\nWe will be unable to refund you the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Pledge Manager or other charges for your payment (PayPal, VISA, credit card...). This represents approximately 15% of the full payment.\n\nThis project is being funded in EUROS and any refunds will be also processed in EUROS.\n\nTerms and Conditions\n\nWe\u2019ve been consulting our manufacturer and shipping company about reducing the box's weight to keep the shipping costs down. In order to make sure that these costs are as low as possible we will be charging shipping after the campaign ends. Backers will gain access to our Pledge Manager by email roughly one-two months after this campaigns completion.\n\n\nUnfortunately, due to customs regulations, we are not able to ship to Afghanistan, Ukraine or Kazakhstan. You agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret that we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.

We highly recommend you also read the Saberhagen Empire of the East series, available as a modern compilation or in the original three individual volumes, titled The Broken Lands, The Black Mountains, and Ardneh\u2019s World (or Changeling Earth). \nTake up your sword, gather your spells, and stand with Ardneh\u2019s armies against John Ominor and his forces of darkness!\nPhysical format. This book is offered in PDF form, as well as hardcover print format. Final page count is estimated at 80-90 pages.\nDo I need to own the DCC rules? Yes. This is a sourcebook for DCC RPG. You can buy the DCC RPG core rulebook at the Goodman Games online store.\nDo I need to read Fred Saberhgagen's Empire of the East novels? You don't have to, but we strongly recommend it. They are great books and will expand your gaming experience considerably!\nInside the DCC Sourcebook\nDCC: The Empire of the East has been in development for years. Adapted by lead designer Jason Vey, the sourcebook takes you to the Empire of the East and gives you just enough information to create your own adventures there - while also leaving you room to design your own campaigns.\nAs with all DCC products from Goodman Games, the book is lavishly illustrated.\nChapter one covers adapting the existing character classes. \nChapter two covers magic, including new rules for spell enervation which can be substituted for corruption to capture the aesthetic of Empire of the East. Eighteen new spells are presented, including several related to the summoning or control of demons, djinnis and elementals as discussed in Fred Saberhagen's novels. There are two new patron AIs presented, capturing the role of Ardneh and Orcus from the original novels.\nSome readers may be asking, why is Empire of the East presented as compatible with DCC instead of Mutant Crawl Classics? This hardcover can be used easily in either system, but due to the high presence of magic we're presenting it as a DCC \"base.\" \nChapter three presents monsters. There are seven creatures, as well as new rules for demons, djinns and elementals.\nChapter four presents personalities of the Changeling Earth. These 16 NPCs from the stories can be used as allies or enemies in your campaign.\nChapter five is science, technology and magic. Those of you who have read the novels know that \"the Elephant\" plays a mighty part in the plot. We do not burden you with detailed stats for the super-science of the Changeling Earth but instead give general guidelines for inserting these items into your game.\nChapter seven presents two new adventures set in the Changeling Earth: Invaders, a level 0-1 adventure by Jason Vey, and The Demon Key, a level 0-1 adventure by Harley Stroh. \nThe Empire of the East Novels\nIn the distant future, society has crumbled. Dark forces now rule the land, keeping all humans under their oppressive thumbs.\nIn the darkness of the shadows and whispered on the winds, there is talk of a rebellion. In the swamps, a small band has formed. Determined to regain their freedom, the rebellion, heavily outnumbered, plans to overthrow an army of thousands . . . with the help of one incredible weapon.\nIt is only a legend, a story left over from the Old World before magic and the wizards came to the land. A weapon of technology. It is the mystical Elephant, and whoever masters it holds the key to freedom, or defeat.\nOne young man, determined to avenge the death of his family, sets out to join the rebellion and find Elephant. What he discovers will change everything.\nThe Empire of the East novels are still in print decades after their original publication. You can find vintage editions online. The author's estate has recently released updated e-book editions, which are available in Kindle format on Amazon. You can find them here:\nEmpire of the East Book I: The Broken Lands\nEmpire of the East Book II: The Black Mountains\nEmpire of the East Book III: Ardneh's World \nWhat is DCC RPG?\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game is a modern RPG that reflects D&D\u2019s origin-point concepts with decades-later rules editions. From the company that was publishing old-school modules before the OSR ever existed, DCC RPG is not an old-school clone, but a re-imagining of what D&D could have been, utilizing the game\u2019s primary sources of inspiration. To quote from the back cover:\nYou\u2019re no hero.\nYou're an adventurer: a reaver, a cutpurse, a heathen-slayer, a tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets. You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of fantasy with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure as 1974 intended you to, with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery. Fast play, cryptic secrets, and a mysterious past await you: turn the page\u2026\nYou can learn more from this prior Kickstarter for the game's 4th printing. You can buy the 7th printing here.\n What is MCC RPG?\nTriumph & Technology Won by Mutants & Magic!\nYou\u2019re no zero.\nYou\u2019re a wasteland wanderer: a mutant, a seeker, a robot-killer, a stoic shaman guarding forgotten ancient sciences. You seek triumph and technology, winning it with mutations and magic, soaked in the radiation and quantum fields of the mutated, the savage, the semi-sentient, and the artificially intelligent. There are treasures to be won in the taboo lands and ruins, and you shall have them.\nReturn to the glory days of science fiction gaming with the Mutant Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. Adventure like it\u2019s 1978 again, with modern rules grounded in the origins of post-apocalyptic role-playing. Fast play, a mysterious future, and 100% compatibility with the DCC RPG system await you \u2014 just activate your artifact\u2026\nMutant Crawl Classics is a stand-alone post-apocalyptic RPG compatible with DCC RPG. It is a good complement to the Empire of the East sourcebook. You can buy the MCC RPG core rulebook here.\nWhat? No Stretch Goals?\nNo stretch goals.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative fantasy adventure viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura.\nThe game offers players the chance to lead a small group of Heroes, each with their own rank, occupation and background. Despite all these differences, these survivors will have to cooperate if they want to survive the cold, hunger and hostile threats, but they will also have to unveil the mysteries surrounding the disappearance of the colony founded by their lost King to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name.\nHEL: The Last Saga is a highly narrative campaign game, with paragraphs to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.\nClick on the image to know more about the HEL-in\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this add-on\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\nClick on the picture to know more about this Add-On\n\n\n NARRATIVE ALL THE WAY\nTell. Listen. Choose or test. Everywhere. Anytime. The game engine is based on the discovery or the triggering of events that lead to narrative chapters. These events can be hidden on the game board, placed on the turn track or on any other game component. The story  unfolds as you resolve these chapters by making choices, performing tests or simply listening.\nUNIQUE HEROES\nPlay strong characters. Each Clan member has their own story, strengths and weaknesses. You will learn about them as you play them, by acquiring new individual Hero cards in a non linear way. Some of these cards will be the result of choices you made during the adventure.\nSCENARIO BASED \nConquer a mysterious land, found a colony and resolve mysteries. Scouting missions, search or rescue parties, raids, escape, defence, investigation, or intrigue. Whether it's located on the modular and expandable wilderness game board or in the colony camp, each scenario provides a new challenge to overcome in order to gain access to the next scenario.\nPREDATORS & PREY \nFace hidden threats, which are controlled by a predation-based AI system. Use your perception and your pets to detect these threats before you face them, as an ambush can be fatal. Your enemies are vicious enough to target the most vulnerable or the highest ranking members of your group.\nWORSHIP SYSTEM\nBeg your gods to help you. Use your willpower, offerings, and the fervour of your companions to obtain permanent modifiers that will benefit all who share your faith.\nSURVIVAL... \nExploit scarce resources to survive and keep your clan together. Hunt for food. Collect that precious wood that will be a source of heat and an essential material for your constructions. But above all, maintain high morale to avoid sinking into defeat.\n...HORROR\nNight will eventually fall. For months. Second half of the campaign will take place into darkness. But only for Heroes who survive long enough to see the sunset. Forget every little knowledge or petty victory acquired. New rules. New threats. New objectives.\n\nThe USA, European Union, Canada, Australia, and UK will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping is not charged as part of this Kickstarter campaign but is instead done so on the pledge manager after the campaign ends. The shipping price you will pay is based on the weight of your pledge and the country to which it is to be shipped.\nThe above is a list of rough estimates for shipping. These estimates are based on the costs for our previous campaigns and an estimated final weight of the Core pledge at 5kg. Keep in mind that adding optional buys or additional pledge levels will raise the weight of your pledge and may also then raise the final shipping price.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGeneral\n\nThis is our ninth Kickstarter and we\u2019ve learned a lot from our previous eight. Producing thousands of products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date.\n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1 and Reichbusters: Projekt Vril have been delivered. Super Fantasy Brawl is being printed and ongoing for a delivery by the summer, Solomon Kane, a big scope project, is at the printer and will be delivered in two waves this year. Time of Legends: Joan of Arc season 1.5 is on track and the first elements will be soon sent to production. Enchanters: East Quest development is finished and is going to production now and Steamwatchers is on track and will go to production this summer.\nFor all our games, we communicate with our backers with regular updates at least once a week, plus our posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and our videos on YouTube.\n\nPlease note that the components, component counts, quality and rules, are all work in progress and subject to change.\n\nDelivery\n\nOur experience in our previous KS has shown us that there can be variances in terms of timing and remaining in schedule when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\nAt the same time there are also the unpredictable factors; recently it was the Coronavirus outbreak, but there can be others such as weather conditions, strikes and others.\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is June 2021, but please bear in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nShipping\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\nIf you do not finalise your pledge and pay for shipping by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nIf you confirm your pledge by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside of countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes or APO addresses.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nKSE\n\nAs KSE, or Kickstarter Exclusives, are marked the products that will not be available to retail. Mythic Games retains the right to continue to sell those in the Pledge Manager, the Mythic Games website, as well as conventions.\n\nRefunds\n\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy.\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date.\nIf you apply for a refund more than 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available.\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Railroad Ink Challenge is a quick playing roll and write game for 1 to 4 players from the creators of the critically acclaimed Railroad Ink. Grab a board and a dry-erase marker and get ready to reach networking nirvana! Roll the dice and draw the routes to connect the exits around your board. Expand your network with railways, highways and stations to collect points, but you will be penalised for any open connections, so plan carefully!\nA game of Railroad Ink Challenge is played over 7 rounds. The goal is to connect as many Exits to each other as possible by drawing Routes that can create Networks. The more Exits you connect to the same Network, the more points it will be worth. Bonus points can be earned for your Longest Railway, your Longest Highway, and by drawing on the Central Spaces of your Board.\nRoll the dice!\nDraw the routes!\nConnect the exits!\nFurther bonus points can be obtained by achieving the all-new Goals, but beware: the players who achieve them faster get greater rewards, so you\u2019ll have to keep an eye on what your opponents are doing and try to complete the Goals before they do. A different set of Goals will be available each time, so no game will be the same.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! Draw unprecedented, mind-bending route configurations thanks to the new dice! Connect special structures to your network to trigger new effects: factories allow you to duplicate a die, villages give bonus points if they are close to a station, universities unlock extra special routes... use these effects wisely and you\u2019ll score big!\nThere are even new expansions! Create placid forest landscapes in the Lush Green Edition, or use oases to protect your cacti from the arid desert climate in the Shining Yellow Edition! Each expansion also comes with its own goals to fulfill before your opponents, for an even greater challenge.\nThe new core rules included in Railroad Ink Challenge are not compatible with the classic Railroad Ink components: the boards and the basic Route dice are different, so you can't seamlessly mix the two versions. You need the new boards and Route dice to play with the new core rules.\nHowever, the expansions are 100% compatible back and forth between the classic Railroad Ink and the new Railroad Ink Challenge:\nyou can play Railroad Ink Challenge by using any of the old expansions (River dice, Lake dice, Lava dice, or Meteor dice) with the new boards and Route dice \nyou can play the classic Railroad Ink by using any of the new expansions (Forest dice, Desert dice, or any other that will be introduced during this campaign) with the old boards and Route dice \nStretch goals are a staple of Kickstarter campaigns, and they are usually tied to reaching a certain funding level. We\u2019ve been gradually moving away from this concept during our previous campaigns, and we want to continue this trend.\nTo unlock stretch goals for Railroad Ink Challenge, you will have to join \"Challenges\" by playing a special games of Railroad Ink Challenge and submitting your score: depending on the amount of submissions we will receive, and the scores achieved by the community, you will unlock Points, unlocking more stretch goals! The currently open challenge is Challenge #11 (click here for more details).

This should make the production process quick and straightforward. However, when you produce anything in China, unexpected events may always lead to delays with production, shipping or customs. We already took several steps that will help us minimize any of these, though.\n\nTo reduce shipping problems, we will use fulfillment companies, which is the best option when you have a large number of orders to ship in a short period of time.\n\nFinally, we will always be transparent and openly communicating with backers. We will be updating you on a regular basis and we will be present during the whole process to answer any questions and read every comment.\n\nThe estimated delivery date of Railroad Ink Challenge is December 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate.

Darkball rewards accuracy, reaction times, as well as creativity. As the pieces are rearranged, the ball can travel in any direction, and down any path with no limits to the number of players or ways it can be played. \n\n\n\nPaintbrush\nby Carol Mertz and Mary McKenzie\nPaintbrush is a deeply strategic game with pieces act as both brush and canvas. Players take turns rearranging the dynamic pieces to spread their color onto as many blank canvasses as they can.

It's an intense game of strategy and prediction, as each player secretly inputs orders into the AI-powered Blinks game pieces, then watches as skirmishes play out in real time.\n\n\n\nPirates & Lasers\nby Theo Johnson, Ian Cummins, Priscilla McGann, and Michael Cooper \nPirates & Lasers is a strategic struggle between ghost pirates and incompetent laser-wielding tourists.

Blinks is a product of curiosity, exploration and excitement from the design, tech, and gaming communities. From workshops at Maker Faires to game jams with Playcrafting, IndieCade, and the NYU Game Center, lots of people have been brought together by Blinks.\nKickstarter Video by Tom Caswell\nAnd More...\nNick Bentley, Luis Rodriguez, Diana Peterson, Lingyi Rose, Justin Lamb, Nick Soni, Winston Struye, Shiyun Liu, Justin Ha, Kris Atanasoski, Junege Hong, Armin Minassian, David Khananov, Pedro Benitez, Andrew Saldivar, Xiao Yang Feng, Bill Cowles, Sophie Lefebvre, Celia Pearce, Em Lazer-Walker\n While at the MIT Media Lab in the Playful Systems group, I was researching emergent behavior, complex systems, and cooperation. I was simulating natural systems such as swarm behavior like a flock of birds, ant colonies, or fireflies and forest fires. I designed little hexagonal tiles that could think for themselves, respond to touch, and communicate with each other.\nMy fellow lab mates asked if they could design games for the platform. I agreed to a short game jam session and in under 3 hours, we had designed the first game for Blinks, Fracture. It went on to be a finalist at IndieCade. This is how it all began.\nWe couldn't be more excited to have you join the Blinks Community!\n-Jonathan + the Move38 team\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them. \nPledges managed and fulfilled with the helpful tools of Backerkit.\n Honored to be one of the \"Best New Products on the Planet\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've run 4 successful Kickstarter campaigns and delivered above and beyond on each and every one. Our last campaign for Blinks was by far the most ambitious, with everything built from the ground up, and I can proudly say, the hardest part is behind us. We have the world's best toy manufacturer producing our parts and a supply chain that has been through thick and thin. We've built to tolerances that simply put, look beautiful and feel great. And most importantly, we are adding slack so that we can scale quickly. It probably means more to hear from one of our previous backers so feel free to read the hundreds of comments on our previous campaigns, here is one I think captures it nicely:\n\n\"Got mine in California and you guys knocked it out of the park with this product!! From package to product to overall experience, this is truly one of those rare cases where a maker can out-Apple Apple by giving more attention to detail than any large company can.\"\n\n\"Thank you Jonathan & Move38 Team for this piece of great product. Thanks to you I will still believe that Kickstarter projects can be achievable. You all made a really good job!!!\" \n\nIn short, this product is already designed and tested and now it only gets cooler because the new games are new software, and while I would typically not be caught dead saying \"software is easy,\" I will say, I think at this point, it is much easier than the hills we've climbed to bring a new and unusual game system into the world.\n\nFrom a small group of incredibly dedicated people, working with some of the most talented people I've ever met, we achieve a lot, do it with transparency and would love to have you join us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nBlinks have been designed to be cherished as beautiful design objects to be held in the hand. They come with a protective carrying case or \"Sushi Roll\" that keeps you from losing your Blinks in addition to keeping them in great condition. The games are designed to last until the end of time, just like traditional board games before them, but far sturdier than paper or cardboard.\nReusability and recyclability\nBeyond the bullet-proof materials that create the durable enclosure for Blinks, they are open-source and reprogrammable. Blinks can be used to play the games they know and games that haven't even been invented yet. Tired of Blinks being Blinks?

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome back to the city, adventurers! Fantasy City Sites and Scenes II is a 48-page (plus cover, inside covers, and back cover) 8.5\" x 11\" book for gamemasters who are in need of inspiration. The book details sixteen different city locations and offers up a selection of encounter ideas, all of which can be used on their own or added to the content described in the original Fantasy City Sites and Scenes book. (See the original Kickstarter campaign to learn more about the first book. Update on the first book: all PDF and print rewards are complete! The print rewards finished shipping to backers on May 19, 2020.)\nDo you already own my other fantasy RPG supplements that were created thanks to the support of Kickstarter backers? Then you're looking for either the $1 (PDF) or $18 (print, U.S. only) reward levels. All of the other listed rewards are for those gamemasters who missed out on my earlier projects. \n City Sites. The sixteen locations described in the book (each a two-page spread) presents new buildings that may be dropped into your campaign . . . and along with it, the characters and events detailed alongside the building. You won't find a dry collection of statistics and facts in this book. Each entry was written to spark the gamemaster's imagination and provide GMs with just enough to take the idea and make it their own! \n City Scenes. Pages 36 through 48 (plus the inside back cover of the printed book!) are packed with new day and night encounters. These encounters do not duplicate any found in the original Fantasy City Sites and Scenes book, meaning that this section greatly expands the gamemaster's number of choices when it comes time to randomly select a city encounter.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nOver 1,700 supporters came together to make the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes campaign a success! (Kickstarter page here.) Did you miss out on the original book project? Now's your chance to score both the original and the second volume at the same time! See the rewards, at right, for more information and to join in!\n\nThe Dungeon Crafter's Sketch Book is for the gamemaster who enjoys creating dungeons. (Kickstarter page here.) This 56-page book (60 including the cover, inside covers, and back cover) is filled with page after page of grids (hex or square, see the reward descriptions), space for you to draw your dungeon ideas. Scattered throughout the book are several random tables to inspire you as you create your newest dungeon. There are a limited number of print copies available; please see the reward listing for more information.\nDid you miss out on the Kickstarter campaign for A Dozen Sinister Rumors? Now's your chance to grab these 17 different PDFs and expand you collection of GM tools!\nIf you wish to buy single PDFs, and not all 17 of these titles, you can find each one at DrivethruRPG.\n***\nProbably the most common question that comes in every few weeks is: \"How can I get your books dedicated to the Star Wars newspaper ads of the seventies and eighties?\" The books are tough to find, so I am offering a handful of copies in this campaign for those who missed out on these books.\nSample pages from one of the three books. Each is 96 pages, 8.25\" square, and hardcover.\nI do not run an online store, so that means I rarely offer these books for sale. Still, there have been enough requests this month alone that I felt it was time to list these as a reward in this latest Kickstarter campaign. These are great gifts for fans of the Kenner Star Wars action figures of the seventies and eighties.\n\n\n***\nThe bulk of the artwork in this book is used under license from Shutterstock.com, created by Asanee Srikijvilaikul, Larry Jacobsen, koya979, NextMarsMedia, Oliver Denkar, Petrafler, Runa0410, Ryzhkov Sergey.

The book is complete, and all that remains is funding and the project review stage where project supporters are encouraged to crowdsource spotting and correcting the typos that are surely somewhere inside the work.\n\nHowever, things can go wrong. As an individual, I do not have access to a company to assist with packing and shipping rewards (a friend helps!), and I have no control over life.

All solutions in a section combine to solve the final puzzle in that section. No two puzzles are the same. Each will require a different combination of language, numeric, pattern recognition and observational skills. You can read, write, fold, cut, explore and manipulate the book however you wish to solve the puzzles.   \nThe Story\nThey made the arrest on Wednesday. Everyone thought that would be the end of it, but on Thursday you receive a delivery. \nYou didn't pay any attention to it when you picked it up with the rest of the mail, placing the pile on the dining room table while you made your morning coffee. As usual, you had pressed snooze one too many times to fit in a proper breakfast. \nYou sit at the table to drink your coffee while watching the news headlines. Idly sifting through the mail you notice something other than bills. An envelope, made of high quality paper, with your name and address handwritten. The contents feel thick, certainly not a couple of sheets of paper. You open the envelope to reveal a book, a note is attached:\n\"I need your help but you must prove you are up to the task. This book contains a series of tests to see if you have what it takes.\"\nYou grab the envelope searching frantically for clues of the books origin. No return name or address, only a strange symbol. You know this symbol, you know this is serious, you must take immediate action.\nCautiously you open the book to reveal your first test and begin your journey into the unknown.      \nHow to play\nAt the start of each section you will be provided with essential tools and information for the tasks ahead. Each two-page spread is a puzzle to solve. Record your answers as you go where it says Solution. It is important to keep an eye out for other useful clues along the way. The puzzle at the end of each section will combine all the previous section\u2019s clues into one final task. \nTechnical Details\nBook - Paperback\nPuzzles - 60\nDimensions - 9\" x 6\"\nThe Campaign\nThis Kickstarter is the first offering of the book. All puzzles have been written up into a draft book which is currently being worked through by a group of testers. Once testing is complete the book will require final formatting/editing before being published and sent out to backers.\nFAQ\nIs Agent 8462: Initiation a real book?\nYes, Agent 8462: Initiation is a real, physical book.\nWhat language is the book written in?\nEnglish\nWhat do I need to play?\nYou will need a copy of the book, a pencil and scissors may also come in handy.\nCan I skip ahead?\nTo a certain extent, yes. For example, in the first section there are 10 puzzles. Puzzles 1-9 can be completed in any order but all the answers to puzzles 1-9 are essential to solve the final puzzle in that section, puzzle 10.\nWhere can I go for help if I'm stuck on a puzzle?\nThere will be hints in the back of the book (written back to front and upside down to avoid reading unwanted hints) as well as a forum on Agent 8462 containing hints from the author, game testers and other players to give you a nudge in the right direction.\nDo I need to buy anything else to play?\nIf you already own a pen and a pair of scissors then a copy of Agent 8462: Initiation is all your need. \nThe Creator\nA puzzle enthusiast based in North West England who has spent the last year designing and redesigning potential puzzles to fit the theme and style of the upcoming book - Agent 8462: Initiation.

I have funded the first set of puzzle images but now need your help and support to make this book a reality. \n\nI estimate it will take another 3 months before the book is completed. This includes time for quality illustrations to be produced (nobody wants a book of my bad drawings) and time for a second proof read and play-test by my pre-selected group of testers. After testing is complete and feedback is received, any required changes will be made. Then on to printing and shipping. \n\nThis is the only project I am working on at the moment and so it will have my undivided attention.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Art by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag is the internationally lauded artist and author of Tales From the Loop and Things From the Flood, narrative art books published by Free League that stunned the world with a vision of an alternate Scandinavia in the 1980s and \u201890s, where technology invaded tranquil landscapes to form an entirely new universe of the eerie and the nostalgic.\nIn 2017, we published a tabletop roleplaying game based on Tales From the Loop, which was a smash hit and went on to win five Gold ENnie Awards, including Best Game and Product of the Year. A tv series adaptation of Tales From the Loop was launched just a few days  ago on Amazon Prime Video.\nNow, you can take another step into the amazing world of the Loop. In Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame, 1-5 players take the roles of teenagers who investigate the mysteries originating from the Loop, a huge underground science facility with strange effects on the suburban landscapes around it \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner!\nTales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame is designed by Martin Takaichi and includes high-quality miniatures by Paolo Parente's Dust Studio.\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nArt by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nIn 1954, the government ordered the construction of the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator. The facility was completed in 1969, located deep below the pastoral suburban countryside, outside of the big city. The local population called this marvel of technology the Loop. Over the years since it was built, strange phenomena have started to appear in the area - mysterious creatures stalking the land, machines malfunctioning in inexplicable ways.\nIn the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there\u2019s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don\u2019t have to plan it all out from the start.\nAt least four scenarios will be included in the base game (more can be unlocked as stretch goals), and each scenario takes approximately 90-150 minutes to complete.\nFull Setup of Prototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nAll the components of the core game are listed below. More components can be added if stretch goals are unlocked:\nMiniature produced by Dust Studios based on Simon St\u00e5lenhag's design\nThe Loop isn\u2019t the only technological achievement in the \u201880s that never was. Advanced AI, robotics and magnetrine development are highly advanced as well. Riksenergi, the governmental agency tasked with running The Loop, employs different machines to automate a large number of functions on the islands. While some have drivers or handlers, most are running on their internal AI code.\nIn Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, these machines are represented by beautiful miniatures sculpted by Yannick Hennebo based on St\u00e5lenhag's original designs and manufactured by Dust Studios. They are molded in high-quality PVC plastic and are between 25 and 40mm tall. You can buy extra minis as addons, check the Addons section below.\nIn the STANDARD EDITION, the miniatures are delivered unpainted. In the DELUXE EDITION, the miniatures are delivered PRE-PAINTED by Dust Studio.\nMiniature prototypes by Dust Studio - not final product\nADDON MINIATURE SCENARIO PACKS\nIn addition to the machine minis included in the core set, you can add models of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur and the \"Visitor\" robot, along with scenarios to use them with, Addons to your order - check the Addons section below. Each pack includes a model and 20-30 Scenario Cards. The Gorgosaurus and the Visitor are available unpainted or pre-painted by Dust Studio.\nBelow is a video demonstration showing what a turn can look like in the game, by lead designer Martin Takaichi. It doesn\u2019t go into detail about every rule (there\u2019s the downloadable rulebook for that, see below) but gives you a good sense about how the game flows and general gameplay.\nTo let you to try out Tales from the Loop \u2013 The Board Game for yourself, we\u2019ve decided to provide a Print & Play kit for download. It doesn\u2019t contain everything that will be in the final game, but four characters and one scenario is enough to play the game with three other friends! If you just want to read the beta rules the rulebook is available for download.\nDo keep in mind that this is in only a prototype in Alpha state \u2013 things can and will change from the P&P version to the final version. In fact, that\u2019s another reason we wanted to do this, to get feedback from you so we can make the game the best it can be. Use this survey to provide feedback and report on errors.\nLINK TO THE PRINT AND PLAY FILES\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nIn addition, backer Timothy Clark has made two excellent videos that go through how to set up the Alpha and pretty much all the rules for the game in a clear and engaging way. If the Alpha rules PDF put you off, or you simply prefer to learn by example, do check out these two videos:\nAs we have passed our base funding goal, we will be able to expand the games with stretch goals.

His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian and American landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world. Tales from the Loop was ranked one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias\u201d by The Guardian, along with such works as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nMartin Takaichi has been a board game enthusiast since first discovering Drakborgen (aka DungeonQuest) in 1985. Over the years he made a slow transition from not only playing games but first modifying them and then designing them as well. The first published game where he was part of the design team was Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nThe design team beyond Simon and Martin consists of project manager Tomas H\u00e4renstam (lead designer of Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game and roleplaying games ALIEN, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), map artist Reine Rosenberg, graphic designer Christian Granath, co-designer Nils Karl\u00e9n, and last but not least Paolo Parente and his Dust Studio who produce the miniatures as well as all physical components of the game.  Dust is an acclaimed manufacturer of quality miniatures since 2005, producing their own Dust 1947 line as well as miniatures for board game companies like CMON, Monolith and Mythic Games.\nFree League Publishing is a Swedish publisher dedicated to speculative fiction. We have published a range of award-winning and critically acclaimed tabletop roleplaying games, board games and art books set in strange and wondrous worlds.\nOur game range include the recently launched official ALIEN RPG, the Tales from the Loop RPG (winner of five ENnie Awards 2017, including Best Game), sandbox retro fantasy Forbidden Lands (winner of four ENnie Awards 2019), postapocalyptic Mutant: Year Zero (Silver ENnie for Best Rules 2015), space opera Coriolis - The Third Horizon (Judge's Spotlight Award 2017), dark fantasy Symbaroum, and Crusader Kings \u2013 The Board Game.\nWe have also published the art books Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood  by Simon St\u00e5lenhag, as well as the illustrated edition of the Lovecraft classic The Call of Cthulhu by French artist Fran\u00e7ois Baranger.\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen you pledge on Kickstarter you put your trust in a project before it is completed and you contribute, with this trust, to making Tales From the Loop - The Board Game a reality.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Series One from The Magic Puzzle Company is a set of three new 1,000-piece jigsaw puzzles with original art and a magical surprise at the end.\nWe set out to create the most entertaining jigsaw puzzle you\u2019ve ever done by combining the traditional jigsaw puzzle experience with ideas from the worlds of tabletop games and magic.\nWe commissioned incredible, original art from independent artists, designed from the very beginning to be used in a jigsaw puzzle\nWe designed a surprise ending using techniques from optical illusions and magic that adds an extra experience to the end of the puzzle\nEach puzzle has over 50 easter eggs to find as you solve (and they come with a guide to help)\nEach puzzle is 28\" x 21\", and has 1000 pieces. That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

We're still astonished by all their enduring, wonderfull support and for making our lives so much easier!\nTerms and conditions\nThe following terms and conditions apply when you pledge to one of our games.\nREFUND POLICY The Kickstarter terms allow you to get a full refund if the request is received within 14 days from the end of the campaign. Any request made after this period will be at the discretion of Black Box Adventures and will be a maximum of 90% of the pledge cost (due to Kickstarter and card fees already paid by Black Box Adventures).\nRETURNING PRODUCTS If you fail to accept your package when it is delivered we will not issue a refund for the cost of the pledge (and shipping).\nDAMAGED PRODUCTS  We guarantee that the packages you receive from us will be complete and include all the items in perfect condition. If not, we will replace any missing or damaged items. Replacements for minor cosmetic damage to external boxes will be decided on a case by case basis.\nSURVEY RESPONSE  We will use a pledge manager. You will be required to fill a survey on that platform. We will send out several mails and updates notifying you of the deadline to fill the survey. If you do not fill out the survey by this deadline after notifications have been sent, we may not be able to fulfill your pledge.\nREASONABLE CHANGES TO PRODUCT  Due to ongoing testing and developing and potential improvements suggested by the factory, the final product may be different from the prototype shown on this page. By pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final game may be different from that presented in this Kickstarter campaign. Having said this, Black Box Adventures will make every effort to keep the final game as close to the Kickstarter project as possible and only make changes to improve the game. If major changes have to be made, Black Box Adventures wil inform the backers about the changes and the reasons for such changes.\nOTHER LANGUAGE EDITIONS  The Spanish and French translation will be handled by 2 Tomatoes. The Dutch translation will be handled by Black Box Adventures. For specific questions or problems concerning the translation copies (also after the campaign) you can contact the responsible company. The other language editions will be available in all countries during the Kickstarter. \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project and we're partnering up with a few other experienced companies. However, we rely on our suppliers just as you rely on us, and hope for a relationship of mutual understanding.\n\nWe've worked with different manufacturers in the past and don't work any more with those not living up to our expectations. That's why we choose a new manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \nSome events may be out of our reach. One such event is COVID-19. To take such events into account we've talked with the manufacturer and gave ourselves some more time to deliver the game. We would love to tell you your game will arrive earlier, instead of the other way around...\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. After production is complete, we'll be shipping the game worldwide through several fulfillment centers, ensuring that we have \"Friendly Shipping\" (no import taxes) to the US, EU, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We'll also be subsidizing a portion of the shipping cost for all pledges to keep your costs down. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfillment process. For more information see terms & conditions above.\n\nThe EU has recently implemented stricter tax regulations on online sales in general and crowdfunding in particular. We thus are obliged to collect and pay VAT on the value of the total of the pledge and shipping amount. VAT varies between 17% and 25% with most countries at 20% and above. The total amount is calculated on the amount paid for the game and the shipping. We have taken these costs into account so you will not need to worry about them. It is important to note that VAT is a sales tax that is separate from import taxes or duties. We will cover import duties in the USA, Europe, Canada, Australia and New Zealand so you do not have to worry about those. Other regions might incur import duties.\n\nAdventures in Neverland has been developed over 5 years, with numerous play-testers and groups in different countries. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter (and COVID-19) to test the final content and to blind test the rulebook.\n \nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece, drooling with flavor by itself. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers. Together Adventures in Neverland will be a unique game, dedicated to J.M.

Now replace the central character with you. That\u2019s The Detective Society.\nThe Detective Society delivers a package to your door each month, filled to the brim with incredible puzzles and an exciting, intricate plot. You can play by yourself, with your partner or with a team of your friends or colleagues.\nOur six-package game creates a deep, immersive, narrative-driven world for you to explore, all from the comfort of your own home. \nEverything you need to complete each package will be included inside: you\u2019ll need to solve fiendish puzzles, decipher cryptic codes and use your powers of deduction to figure out how to solve the case.\nBut you don\u2019t just interact with the physical items in the package - a complex digital world will sprawl out in front of you, requiring you to investigate the lives of the characters and interact with them via SMS, email and online messenger services.\nThink of it as a TV show meets an escape room meets the internet.\nEach package is a stand-alone mystery which contributes to the overall plot, so if you want to try before you buy then pledge for the first package of the series and we're certain you'll be back for the next five as soon as you've finished investigating.\n Receive a package to your door! Our packages are delivered straight to you, filled with incredible puzzles and a deep, immersive world.\n Team up or play alone! You can play by yourself, with your partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues. Each of the packages should last around 90 minutes.\n Interact with the world! Contact the characters by email or message, stalk their social media accounts and scour the internet to help solve the puzzles.\n Become immersed in the story! Put yourself into the shoes of the detective to find out what really happened to Claire Makova.\n Continue your journey! Each package follows on from the previous one, presenting you with new challenges and exciting plot twists.\nWe created a short demo version of the game so you can get a feel for the kind of thing that we design. \nThe demo is a completely different case to the Disappearance of Claire Makova, so don't worry - no spoilers. Also, the demo was designed to take 20-25 minutes, as opposed to the actual packages, each of which should take between 90 - 120 minutes to complete.\nWe sent the demo over to a few gaming channels to have a play with. You can see Gaming Rules's experience here:\n And you can see slickerdrips trying out the demo here:\nImmersive Real-World Puzzles\nAll of the puzzles that we design are rooted in reality; you won\u2019t get any abstract puzzles here! For example, you might need to use technology from your every-day life to solve the case. You may need to text somebody to get the password you\u2019ve \u2018forgotten\u2019, or explore websites to discover email addresses, or even message somebody over their social media to gain access to a secret. Nothing is off limits.\nIf you're a sucker for old school however, then there\u2019s no need to worry. Solving the case also relies on a variety of object-based puzzles. Piecing together information found in newspaper clippings, maps and photos will also play a vital role.\nOur core belief is that the answers to all our puzzles should be firmly rooted in the reality of the world. Can\u2019t think of a solution? Imagine what a real-life detective would do in your situation and you\u2019ll figure out what to do next.\nPadlocks and Decoders\nPadlocks, ciphers and codes are all key to solving the case. For example, if somebody has secured a folder containing vital information - you\u2019ll have that folder in front of you, padlocked and available for you to try and open! Or, if you\u2019ve intercepted a coded message with no instructions on how to decode it, then you must work out how it's been encrypted and decipher it to reveal what's hidden.\nMultimedia Content\nThe puzzles will be given added depth and complexity by our use of multimedia content, which will also add to the realism of the world. For example, you might receive a voicemail from a character in distress, or a video message from a contact with vital information, or you might even find yourself watching CCTV as the police raid a building that you\u2019ve identified as the location of a suspect.\nBy utilising video and audio content, we will make you feel like you have a real connection with the characters, thereby raising the stakes.\nTelling a good story is at the heart of what we do. It\u2019s our belief that puzzles are much more fun if they\u2019re embedded in an engaging narrative. The story of our first season is full of twists and turns, complex characters and high drama moments - and you and your detective skills are placed right at the heart of the action.\n Season One: The Disappearance of Claire Makova \nThe first season focuses on the case of the daughter of a diplomat, Claire Makova, who suddenly disappears. The Detective Society have been hired to find her, but the deeper you delve into Claire\u2019s disappearance, the more secrets you uncover.\nBy using your puzzle solving and investigative skills, you will begin to pick apart the mysterious events that led to Claire going missing. Only you can solve, The Disappearance of Claire Makova. \nNew Destinations\nWe have been inundated with requests to ship to other countries. We want to ship to regions other than the UK, EU and USA, but want to be upfront about the risks of customs charges.\nWith that in mind, we are happy to announce that we are now also shipping to Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Switzerland. \nYou can see full shipping details on our website: https://thedetectivesociety.com/shipping-information/\nAll shipping to the United Kingdom is included, as that's where the packages are produced and shipped from.\nWe will also be shipping to the EU and the USA. Backers from these countries will pay no import taxes. We have reduced the normal international shipping costs to take into account that shipping is included for UK backers.\nThe shipping cost is charged in addition to your pledge. To see the shipping cost applied, select your reward and then your country and then shipping price is automatically added to the pledge.\nYour shipping address will be collected after the Kickstarter ends and we\u2019re close to the delivery date. \nThe season is made up of six episodes and you will receive one a month. We'll ship each of the episodes to all players simultaneously. This will help avoid any spoilers, whilst also giving all players the chance, if they wish, to experience each episode at the same as every other player, making it an exciting live event.\nHow will this work with your Kickstarter pledge?\nIf you pledge for \u201cFirst Package\u201d then you will receive your first box at the same time as everybody else, when The Disappearance of Claire Makova season goes live (eta July 2020). You can then choose to buy the rest of the season, either via a one-off payment or by buying the packages individually when they are released.\nIf you pledge for \u201cAll Six Packages\u201d then you are purchasing the whole of the live season - you will receive one episode every month and bonus content in between each of the packages. The story of Claire Makova will run alongside your life for the entire six months!\nWho can play the game?\nThe game can be played solo, with a partner, or with a group of friends or colleagues and is recommended for players aged over 14 years, due to the peril the characters find themselves faced with. \nWhat language is the game in?\nThe game will initially be available in English with translations into Spanish, French and German should we reach our translation stretch goal. Our aim is to translate it into more languages after release, so if you want it available in your language, get in touch and we\u2019ll put you on our priority list! \nWe have grand ambitions for the future of The Detective Society.\nFirstly, as we have reached our third stretch goal, we will be able to produce a second season, with the first package of Season Two being available once Season One finishes.\nThen we endeavour to continue designing and building new, exciting packages and storylines, delivering them to the homes of thousands of people every month.\nEach new season would be full of exciting and thrilling plotlines where you, playing from home, are at the centre of the action. Our intention is that each season will expand in scale and ambition, melding immersive experiences that can be played at home, with full, high-quality digital content.\nFor six months at a time, your life could be filled with a new immersive case, enhancing your day-to-day existence with a fulfilling and exciting experience.\nThe game is designed by Joe Mills and Tristan Rogers and the company side of the business is managed by Dan Wiseman.\nJoe has been instrumental in the success of some of the best escape games that London has to offer. His journey began with Time Run, which was voted the 'third best escape game in the world' in 2019; Sherlock: The Game Is Now - the official BBC TV series tie-in and most recently he has created and launched one of Design My Night's top picks for a night out in London: the immersive puzzle-based cocktail experience, The Case of the Poisoned Chalice. He has been working in the escape game industry for 6 years and is excited to now be delivering his puzzles to a new mass audience.\nTristan is a game designer, actor and award-winning writer. He's worked in some of London's top theatres and has written on numerous programmes for BBC Radio. He\u2019s worked with Joe designing puzzles at various escape games, most recently penning the plot for The Case of The Poisoned Chalice.\nDan is our managing director and brings his vast business and marketing experience to the team. For over 10 years he has been building and operating successful businesses, including a digital marketing agency. He is connected to the Detective Society through a mutual love of all things gaming-related, evidenced by his constant stream of RPG game ideas. Dan made his first RPG when he was just 13 years old. We\u2019re delighted to have him with us to build the business and get our project delivered successfully!\n\nWhy we started\nWe are all big fans of immersive theatre, true crime and escape games. What we decided to do, as a company, was to pioneer a new type of entertainment, which meshes all three together. More than a play-along TV series, we wanted to create a gaming series that puts YOU in the shoes of the TV detective.\nWe're excited to be able to share this with you. We hope you decide to become part of The Detective Society.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are of course various risks and challenges involved - problems with design, procurement and shipping can all occur. We have minimised these risks as best we can: the six packages are fully written, with the first package already having been successfully play-tested. As a team we have successfully produced a variety of games, and Dan has, over the last decade, overseen a large number of product launches, with e-commerce being his specialty. Our budgets are thorough, and we have built in significant contingency to deal with those issues we cannot foresee.\n\nThere is of course the elephant in the room that is Covid-19. As you might have seen in our video, lockdown here in London is causing us to work from home.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the Weird West of Deadlands, the original horror western roleplaying game for the Savage Worlds core rules!\n In this award-winning, best-selling setting, gunfighters, braves, hucksters, martial artists, shamans, mad scientists, the blessed, and more square off against far more than desperate bandits. An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen?

Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games.

Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time). Customers of Savage Retailers may request complimentary PDFs of books purchased by emailing site.admin@peginc.com.\nAny Questions?

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "I love the end of the night. When someone is about to go home, and I say \"How about a game of X before you leave?\" They smile and sit down. They can't resist because they know:\nThe game is fast (like 10 minutes to play)\nIt's quick to teach (like get started in 30 seconds)\nThere will be tension and exciting moments\nIt ends the night on a satisfying note of getting in one more quality game\nThis game series exists because I want there to be more games like that. We've focused on easy to teach before, but these are SUPER easy to teach.\nBut there is enough strategy that after the game your mind will wander back to a couple of key turns, and you'll wonder if you should have played just a little bit differently.\nAnd they have those turns...\nThat turn in GPS where the spinner lands on the spot that helps you but not your opponents. \nThat turn in Sequoia where you have to decide if it is worth fighting for the best spot or better to grab multiple spots where there is less competition. \nThat turn in Mountain Goats when you bump the leader off the mountain right before they win. \nAnd Holy Toledo, these games are just $15 each. \nThese games were designed for adult gamers, but they are playable with the whole family, including kids as young as 5 with some coaching.  They're also great options when your non-gamer friends ask to play a game, and you want something that you can teach and start playing quickly.\nIn Mountain Goats you work to move your goats to the top of 6 different mountains where they can score points as long as they stay there. You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.\nIt's a game about timing. You need to not just get to the top of the mountain, but get there when no one else is in position to knock you off.\nIt's a game about keeping your eye on your opponents. Maximizing your score, but also making sure you don't let anyone else score too much.\nThere is the fun chance to knock each other off the mountain. But it doesn't feel too mean because you can only knock back goats that are in a scoring position, and it isn't a huge setback. It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Mountain Goats. \n\n\nIn Sequoia you are trying to grow the tallest trees in 11 different forests. After your 10 turns, if you have the tallest tree, then you get the victory points from that forest. Second place gets a small consolation prize.\nEach turn, you get to grow two of your trees. Which trees you choose will determine if you win or lose. Do you keep fighting in a forest with competition, or start growing your tree somewhere else? You'll have to wrestle with the dice to grow the tree you want.\nSequoia is a game of choosing your battles.\nThe dice will always give you choices, but they will be hard choices.\nTies in each forest are decided by extra tie-breaker rounds that can lead to epic finishes.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Sequoia.\n\nYou're launching GPS satellites into space. They need to orbit the earth in the correct order. But your launch windows are limited. You can only launch satellites where the spinner points each turn. It is your job to pick the best satellite for each launch to get your birds in order before your opponents.\nGPS is a game about how fun it is to spin that spinner. And it is a very satisfying spin.\nIt is a game about rooting for the rocket to land on your number.\nGPS is a game about putting yourself in a position where the spinner is most likely to help you.\n Read a draft version of the full rulebook for GPS.\nYou won't be paying for any extra air in your boxes. The games set up big, but they store small. There will always be room to shove one of these into your game bag.\nIt is a little bit shorter and a little bit wider than a box that holds two decks of cards side by side. It is also about twice as thick so the lid will stay in place much better.\n1. For the purpose of shipping, the 3 small games pack (GPS + Sequoia + Mountain Goats) will count as just one game.\n2. DO NOT manually increase your pledge amount to cover the shipping cost. It will make both our lives much more complicated when it is time to complete the pledge manager.\n3. If you want to pledge for additional games we publish, just manually increase the amount you are pledging. $15 for GPS, Mountain Goats, or Sequoia. $39 for the small games three pack. $34 for On Tour Europe and USA, QE, Bites, or Loot of Lima.\n4. Shipping prices will be the same during the pledge manager and you will be able to add more games then at the \"additional game\" shipping price.  \n5. The price of GPS, Mountain Goats, and Sequoia will probably be higher in the pledge manager. We want to offer Kickstarter backers the best possible price.\n6. Instead of offering a discount for buying a full case of games, we have steeply discounted the shipping rates for buying additional games. This way you can order the exact number of games your group needs.\n7. This campaign is Canadian, EU, UK, and USA, and Australian friendly.\n8. There are two main reasons the Canadian and European shipping costs more than US shipping. Since we ship fewer games to these fulfillment centers, it costs us more per game to get them there. And, we have to pay taxes when we bring the games into these regions so that you don't have to pay any taxes when they are delivered to you.\nEmail help@boardgametables.com if you want to carry one of these games in your Friendly Local Game Store, if you want to offer them through distribution, or if you would like to localize them for your country.\nChad is the owner of BoardGameTables.com and the designer of Sequoia.  Here are some games he loves that aren't getting talked about enough: Blockers, Capital Lux, Factory Funner, The King is Dead, Nations, Greed, Prospectus, Haggis, and Startups.\nKaty has to answer all your support emails and messages. So please be nice to her. With a wide range of gaming tastes she can be found playing Lisboa one night and a Harry Potter RPG the next. But it gets a little weird when she role-plays as a wizard during the game of Lisboa.\nAnca is the co-artist and graphic designer for On Tour, QE, Bites, and Loot of Lima. She has a poster featured in the Board Game Geek Artist series. Her husband and baby girl are always involved in the projects, from mandatory play testing and prototyping, to artistic suggestions. \nDaniel Profiri is the co-artist for this series. Whenever he's not illustrating board games, he's drawing photorealistic portraits and working on interior design projects. \nStefan Risthaus is the designer of Mountain Goats. He lives in Northern Germany and likes playing and developing games with history as a theme, but also quick fillers and family games. His wife also designs games and is the first and most important play testing person for his games.\nHartmut Kommerell is the designer of GPS. He has forgotten a lot of the math theory he once studied, but still uses the skills to design games and to puzzle around at work. With a 6-headed family, he can always test games with players of any age.\nEstimated delivery January 2021. Our normal math would project a November delivery. We added a couple of extra months because there is a lot of uncertainty right now, and shipping in November/December can add extra delays as everyone else is trying to get stuff in by Christmas.\nAs with all our Kickstarters, we will fully refund your pledge at any time before we ship the game to you. For any reason. No limits. No restrictions.\nRight now some people have some understandable concerns about the health of the economy and small businesses. It is our policy and will continue to be our policy to always keep enough cash on hand to fulfill (produce and ship) all outstanding Kickstarter commitments and preorders.\nThis is a short campaign, so don't delay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything feels a little riskier than it did a month ago.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, we're board game designers James Ernest and Mike Selinker. In 2010, we published Lords of Vegas, a high energy casino-building game. It cemented itself as one of the best games we've ever made, and a favorite of such series as Tabletop, Shut Up & Sit Down, and The Dice Tower. Our 2014 hard-to-find expansion Up! enabled more strategic casino-building and added pieces for more players. But since then, we haven't been able to bring anything new to the game's legions of fans.\nUntil today, that is. Last month, we regained the rights to Lords of Vegas. After five years in the hopper, we're publishing the long-awaited expansion Underworld, filled with mobsters and shady dealers. We're bringing out a 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle, a lush mobster briefcase stocked with poker chips, a felt-lined tray, player piece upgrades, and gambling dice. We're making a 15th anniversary edition of our book Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. And you can get the previously released versions of the base set and Up! here. We want to reward our fans for supporting our game all these years.\nIf you've never heard of the game, you might want to know... \nThe base set, Up!, and a theory of what the Underworld box might look like.\n\nLords of Vegas is a city-building eurogame in which players are casino moguls turning the desert of Nevada into something even nastier. The game starts in 1940, when Las Vegas is merely cheap motels and one-room poker houses. Of course, you bulldoze them. Over the next few decades, you construct glittering meccas of gambling and debauchery. You can build, remodel, reorganize, and sprawl your casinos along the Strip. Should you come up a few million short in your plans for world domination, take those dollars to a competitor's casino and roll the dice on a gambling spree. Here's what it looks like in play.\nThe game comes with a beautiful board of the Vegas Strip, illustrated by the masterful Franz Vohwinkel. It has 48 casino tiles, 55 cards, 40 player markers, and loads of paper money\u2014and, oh yeah, 48 dice. Yes, we made a eurogame with 48 dice. \nHere's Mike to explain how it works.\nAnd here's Quinns of Shut Up & Sit Down walking you through it.\nWith the strongly recommended expansion Up!, your casinos build skyward, gaining you  more wealth and power. This expands the game to 2-6 players using the base set and Up! The expansion has 48 riser tiles for elevating your casinos, 20 player markers, even more money, and 24 more dice, bringing the total to a spine-rattling 72 dice. If you have a copy of the base set but have never gotten your hands on Up!, please take this opportunity to do so. You'll never play the game the same way again.  \nThe Underworld expansion is a brand new set of characters, events, and properties to enhance your game with that seedy-side-of-Vegas feeling. See below for that. \nHere are some nice people saying nice things about Lords of Vegas:\n\"Lords of Vegas is the perfect simulation of the reality of gambling in Vegas, only sometimes you win.\"\u2014Wil Wheaton, Tabletop \n\"Lords of Vegas is the economic warfare game that we find ourselves recommending the most. The reason that no one should play Monopoly. Ever.\"\u2014Shut Up & Sit Down \n\"I have not seen this level of intensity. It goes back and forth fighting over these (casinos). One of the best games of the year.\"\u2014Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower (both Vasel's and Eric Summerer's top 10 of 2010)  \n\"Buy the game. Now. Do it! I'm the Lord of Vegas.\"\u2014Storm of Paul & Storm, alongside the luminaries Matt Lees, Emma Larkins, Peter Adkison, Matt Forbeck,  Aubrey Cello, Patrick Hillier, and Ignacy Trzewiczek\nCover design for the Underworld box, illustrated by Fastner & Larson.\n\nUnderworld is the Lords of Vegas expansion we've been wanting to make for a decade. Ever since the game came out, people have said, \"This is great, but where's the seedy underbelly of Vegas?\" We've got it for you in Underworld. Faster than you can say \"Those are Terry Benedict's casinos!\" you'll be deep in the muck with mobsters, thieves, grifters, and, worst of all, accountants. Here's Mike with the lowdown.\nThis expansion comes with a new Underworld board by Franz. It depicts downtown Las Vegas, the current site of the Fremont Street Experience, north of the main board's Vegas Strip. This is a work in progress. \nUnderworld board by Franz Vohwinkel. Image not final.\nUnderworld contains 52 cards, all lovingly illustrated by the talented Nate Taylor. Here's how they work. At the start of every turn, you flip out a new Underworld card onto the Underworld board. You then gain a new action called Acquire, which allows you to spend money to buy a single Underworld card. Some give you points in different ways, while others give you money over time. Others provide powers that you can use to alter your gameplay. One card might make sprawling easier, while another gives you more opportunities to gamble every turn. Eventually, who and what you have in your Underworld cards can drastically change your board position by the game's end.\nPlaytest versions shown. Images not final.\nRight now, if you own Lords of Vegas, you can help us perfect this expansion. We've created a print and play with rules and cards, which you can download by going to this page and clicking on the button marked Lords of Vegas Underworld Print and Play. Once you've played with it, go to our feedback form and tell us what you think!\nEach copy of Underworld comes with two promo cards: Time Share and The Big Score. (See below for how to get our charity promo card, Vegas Shutdown.)\nUnderworld is the expansion we've wanted to make for over half a decade. With your help, we can finally introduce the mob to Lords of Vegas.\nThe Boss Bundle is inside your very own mobster briefcase. Image not final.\nFor diehard Lords of Vegas fans, the 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle is the option you want. It's a mobster briefcase box with places to hold the components from the base game, Up!, and Underworld. Check it out. \nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box. Image not final.\n\nWhen you pull this game off your shelf, we want you to feel like a casino magnate. The briefcase box is 320 mm x 320 mm (fits nicely into a Kallax shelf) but feels weighty and substantial. There's a leather-like exterior, a felt interior, and a removable felt-lined tray with snug spaces for each player's components. It's the box we always wanted Lords of Vegas to be in.\nPrototype of the Boss Bundle briefcase box interior, with the felt-lined tray pulled out. Image not final.\nThe tray is dark wood with a felt-lined interior. There are separate compartments for the casino tiles, Up! risers, property and Underworld cards, and poker chips. The scoring markers, dice, and parking lot markers fit into the recess between the tray and the briefcase wall. The rulebook, base set board, and Underworld board set into the top.\nPrototype of the poker chips. Image and quantities of each denomination are not final.\nFans have asked for poker chips for years. The Boss Bundle'spoker chipsare still in design, but these are some initial concepts. We plan to include 20 each of $1 million, $2 million, $5 million, $10 million, and $25 million chips. The chips we like are high-density plastic with a metal chip inside making them 11.5 grams similar to a clay chip, but more durable. (Poker chips are also available as an add-on for $55 a set.)\nPrototypes and designs for the bags, gambling dice, player pawns, and cars in the player upgrade kit. Nothing here is final.\nThe Boss Bundle also comes with a player upgrade kit. We'll include 60 wooden cars (of a different shape for each player) to use in place of the markers for parking lots. We are including a deluxe version of the scoring tokens, possibly airplanes so you can vroom around on the scoring track like it's a runway at McCarran Airport. The player pack will come with six velvet drawstring bags, one for each player. It will also contain a pair of larger casino gambling dice. (The player upgrade kit is also available as an add-on for $45 a set.)\nDigital prototype of the Vegas Playmat. Image not final.\nThe Boss Bundle will also come with a Vegas playmat. This is a 24x28\" neoprene playmat which features both the base set board (The Strip) and the Underworld board (Downtown Vegas). The playmat comes with the Boss Bundle, but is too big to fit in the briefcase box. (The Vegas playmat is also available as an add-on for $40.)\nSince all people who get the Boss Bundle should have all three boxes, we've added to the bundle a unified rulebook that incorporates the rules of base, Up!, and Underworld.  (The unified rulebook is also available as an add-on for $5.)\nThe 10th Anniversary Boss Bundle comes with a copy of the base set, Up!, Underworld, and Dealer's Choice. Or, if you already own the base set and Up!, you can get it without those at the Boss Bundle (New Stuff Only) level. You can also buy most of these items as add-ons. See below for details on how that works.\nIf you want something really unique, check The Big Score Bundle with You In It. That gets you illustrated into one of our promo cards like The Big Score. You or someone you really like will become a Lords of Vegas denizen forever. We'll send you 10 of your promo card so you can leave your calling card when you next rob the Strip blind. \nThe Dealer's Choice cover from 2005. Phil's drawing a new one for the 15th anniversary edition.\nIn 2005, we joined with our buddy Phil Foglio, whom you might know from the Hugo Award-winning graphic novel series Girl Genius, to write and illustrate the definitive book on dealer's choice poker. We called it Dealer's Choice: The Complete Handbook of Saturday Night Poker. After it went out of print, we were often begged for copies. So we decided to get the rights to that book back too. We're excited to offer a brand new 15th anniversary edition of Dealer's Choice, complete with a new cover. This new edition will be a staple at every poker night you attend.\nThe Dealer's Choice softcover contains the rules to 200 poker games, including old favorites like Omaha and Chicago, and bizarre new constructions like Demolition Man, Black Jack Shellacque, Frankenstein, and Night Baseball of the Living Dead. Plus we've added a bunch of additional games courtesy of our columns in Bluff Magazine. The book also features valuable tips for how to host a poker night, how to design your own games, and how to talk like a poker player. Every copy of the book comes with a PDF and an ebook. It's cool. \n Here's a handy table of what's included in each reward level.   \nWe also have a $1 level for those who just want access to our PledgeManager after the campaign. We know times are tough, so if you are stressing right now about finances, you can just pledge a dollar and we'll let you upgrade later. \nYou can also buy many of the elements of the Boss Bundle as add-ons, using the prices in this chart.\n\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. Including add-ons in your order will increase shipping costs. See below for our current shipping estimates, based on shipping out of our fulfillment sites of Florida, England, and Australia. (And yes, those \"Rest of World\" numbers are horrible. If you're from those places, we're really sorry about that,) \nAgain, these are estimates. You'll be charged exactly what it costs us to get it to your location, wherever that is. \nWe are game designers. James founded Cheapass Games and the head crustacean at Crab Fragment Labs. His games include Kill Doctor Lucky, Tak: A Beautiful Game, Button Men, Pairs, and Unexploded Cow. Mike is the lead developer and/or designer of Betrayal at House on the Hill, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Risk Godstorm, and Thornwatch, as well as the author of The Maze of Games, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Puzzlecraft. Mike and James co-founded Lone Shark Games, and together designed Pirates of the Spanish Main, Unspeakable Words, Fightball, Gloria Mundi, 12 Days, and many other games, and recently collaborated together with the Brothers Chaps on Trogdor!! The Board Game.\nLone Shark Games is a Seattle board game and puzzle company that has made such Kickstarter-fueled games and books as The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and Puzzlecraft. We also are responsible for the design of Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk and the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game. You can get all our stuff at our webstore.\nWe're joined by some great artists on Lords of Vegas. Franz Vohwinkel does our boards; he's known for his work on Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, Dominion, and boardgames like Ra and Princes of Florence. Steve Fastner and Rich Larson did the covers for our base set and Up!, and are famous for their comic and pinup art. Nate Taylor is illustrating the Underworld cards; you may know him from his collaborations with Pat Rothfuss, especially The Princess and Mr. Whiffle. \nThis is a strange time to be asking for money for a game. Here's some things we know.\n1. It's the 10th anniversary of this game, and that only comes around once.\n2. We don't know when things will get better. The economy could rev back up quickly, or things could get worse. We just can't know.\n3. We can't print the game without help.\nSo, encouraged by lots of fans on BoardGameGeek, we decided to go ahead with the campaign. Still, most of our opportunities to promote the campaign\u2014conventions, magazines, Twitch play around a table\u2014are not available to us right now. We could use your help. Please share this post as much as you can with people who like games. You can also put this badge on your Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or Kickstarter icon.\nWe also want to give back to the Las Vegas community, which was open when we shot our videos. So we're making a promo card called Vegas Shutdown (named in honor of our other favorite Vegas board game, Henry Stern's Vegas Showdown). Since it's a charity thing, and Kickstarter doesn't do charity campaigns, you can't buy it here. But if you pledge for a physical reward in this campaign, you'll have the first opportunity to get copies of the promo card for an additional $5 each in our PledgeManager. Every charity promo card purchased will help Three Square Food Bank take care of workers affected by the shutdown of the casino industry. Here's the card.\nThat's our reasons for doing this now. Once you're done taking care of your needs for yourself, your family, and your community, if you decide you like the game and would like to contribute, we'd really appreciate it. Thanks, and we hope to see you playing Lords of Vegas around a game table soon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNeedless to say, we're concerned about the coronavirus pandemic's effect on the production and shipping of this campaign. \n\nWe're acquiring inventory of the last printing of the base set and Up! from Asmodee. We're making new editions of Underworld and Dealer's Choice for this project, and we don't anticipate any manufacturing problems with those. Underworld is being printed by the same printer who printed the base set and Up! They're in the United States, which costs more but avoids problems with tariffs and shipping from China. We expect that our factory and warehouses will be open by the time these need to go to those steps, but of course we cannot know for sure. We are committed to getting the games to our backers whatever difficulties arise in the next few months.\n\nThe 10th Anniversary boss boxes are considerably more complex. We've set the shipping date on those for Christmas, but our experience with these types of projects on Thornwatch, Tak, and Apocrypha leads us to be careful about specific dates, given some instability in the supply channel now. We are planning to ship these editions separately from the games themselves, so if you pledge for a Boss Bundle, you'll get your games and books at the same time everyone else does. We'll keep you in the know as the Boss Bundle is developed. Thanks in advance.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nOur games are long-lasting and use no consumable materials other than shrink-wrap.\nSustainable materials\nOur printer uses recycled packaging for its corrugate cardboard (the primary component in board games).

They inhabit the forests, live under the fields, dwell in the ruins of our burned-out fortresses. They kidnap the lone wanderer, harry our caravans, and when they are bold, they attack our towns.\nThis land is wild, untamable, and in it we struggle to survive. We who thought we could conquer it, subjugate it\u2014we are guests here, our days numbered.  \nNew to Torchbearer? Read Thor's primer here. Download our introductory chapter here. And our work-in-progress character sheet here. \nA Second Edition: One Book Becomes Three\nWe have been hard at work on a new edition of Torchbearer for over three years now. Based on the feedback we received from you and from our own campaigns and demos since we launched in 2013, we wanted to make a couple of tweaks to the game. Well, those \"couple of tweaks\" rapidly spiraled into a massive revision. Check it out:\nNew format and layout! The game is now a two-book set: The Dungeoneer\u2019s Handbook and The Scholar\u2019s Guide \nClarified, revised, refined and expanded rules from seven years of playtesting and feedback\nThe Dungeoneer's Handbook\n275 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper!\nRevised character creation which includes tighter Nature question results\nRevised leveling costs\n10 levels for all classes (up from 5), including revised benefits for levels 1-5\nNew class: Theurge, a mad seer possessed by the immortals\nNew arcane spell memorization system, The Memory Palace\nNew divine magic system, The Immortal Burden\nNew invocations and spells with revised, clarified format\nA Scholar's Guide to Dangers Various and Sundry\n332 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew easy-to-process difficulty factors format throughout\nRevised skill format\u2014much easier to parse\nRevised and clarified reward system\nIconic monsters all in a revised, cleaner format \nNew loot tables\u2014with more treasure!\nNew camp and town events (they're so good!)\nNew demo adventure: Revised and updated Dread Crypt of Skogenby! \nThe Lore Master\u2019s Manual\nWe came up with so many new rules and ideas around the game that they wouldn't fit in two books. So we're offering a third book full of optional material for the game. It includes:\n200 pages, digest-sized (5.5\" x 8.5\")! Hardcover, linen wrap, swanky end papers, nice paper! \nNew class: the thief, go from a knife-wielding cutthroat to the shadowy power that rules this town\nNew class:  the shaman, fueled by the Immortals of Beasts, channeling their wild power\nNew stock: the Troll Changeling; they're part troll, part human and all trouble\nNew conflicts: Banish, Abjure, Bind and Battle\nNew settlements like Borderland Fortress, Shire and Walled Town\nLots and lots of gear in a comprehensive list\nRules for making base camps\u2014good for tackling those megadungeons. \nEconomic rules so you can crash the economy of your town\nTravel rules\nSimple guidance on town adventures\nMore spells and invocations\nMore monsters!\nWild new rules for spiritual quests \nAnd more!     \nBooks are not enough to express the full majesty of Torchbearer.  We have revised and refined our action card deck as well as the equipment and light cards. The game master screen has been updated to include the revised edition information. And we're adding metal coins, custom wooden dice and a wooden card holder on top of all of that. \nBut these items are not merely gorgeous swag to adorn your gaming shelf, we have designed each of these items to be a useful, efficient part of the Torchbearer experience at the table:\nAction cards facilitate conflicts, making them move more smoothly.\nEquipment, condition and light cards offer easy reading of your current load out for you and for the rest of the table.\nUse the coins as a prop for loot or use them to track light during an expedition or hit points during a conflict.\nThe dice are marked to clearly represent the 4+ target number of Torchbearer, but we've also included pips so you can use them to roll for armor and on tables! Dragons for scoundrels, axes for successes and the sun for a 6. \nAnd the card holder ties it all together. You can drop your action and equipment cards into the slots on the left.

You find it, it\u2019s yours to spend, sell or keep.\nA Roleplaying Game of Desperate Adventure\nTorchbearer is a roleplaying game of desperate adventure. The expeditions you undertake are taxing on your body, your mind and your very nature. To survive, you must carefully manage your food, water and light resources. To excel, you must fight for what you believe in. To prosper, you must fill your bags with loot and treasure.\nThis triumvirate of competing needs creates a delicious tension unique to Torchbearer. Players are asked to weigh these forces in every decision they make. Some may seem easy or frivolous to start, but the deeper you become enmeshed in an adventure, the heavier and more costly each decision becomes. \nVarg, Karolina and Beren by Jordan Worley\nThe system is based on our award-winning Mouse Guard roleplaying game system. Using the same core rules, character builds and conflict system, we have created a grimmer, harsher world. One that can stand the test of time, providing you with years of adventures.  \nSystem Preview\nEager to dive right in and create an adventurer?

Arik is a massively talented artist living in Brooklyn. He's done some of our favorite covers for some of our favorite bands: Earth, High on Fire and SLEEP. When we heard he was available we hunted him down in the wilds of Brooklyn and made the most dignified pitch we could muster.   \nFortunately for us, Arik has a soft spot for nerds with dark, weird dreams. He signed on not only to do the cover but a number of interiors as well. We're honored to have him as a part of our adventuring band.

We have been making roleplaying games since 2002. \nWe have created/designed/published: The Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Mouse Guard, FreeMarket, Torchbearer, Inheritance and Miseries & Misfortunes. \nWe strive to make baroque games contained in beautiful books.   \nThe Burning Wheel Gold Revised Edition\nAnd we have won numerous awards for our games: Origins awards, Golden Geeks, Indie RPG awards, even a thing called an Outie that Ken Hite gave us back in 2003.\nOur Beliefs\n We love roleplaying games. If you ask us, you\u2019ll hear us go on and on about how and why we love them.\n We make games we want to play and we play them as much as we can before releasing them. Corollary to that, we play by the rules we design, and design our rules to be used. A game cannot be experienced through reading it, and though our games often come in the form of books, they are meant to be played, not read. \n Each of our games is an attempt to say something new about the art of roleplaying games and game design in general. Each of our games is an iteration of the last, built on the experience of players at the table in an attempt to advance the state of the art in a small way.\n We speak through our work. Our thoughts, concerns and questions about the world around us are expressed in our work. Rather than editorializing or explaining, we prefer to let the work speak for itself. If you disagree with ideas presented in our games, it is our hope that you design a game to express your own concerns.\n We love our fans. We thrive on hearing about how you play, and talking with you about our games and games in general. That said, and this is a hard thing to say, we make games for us, not you. We hope our games will challenge and fascinate you, not cater to or coddle you.\n We are unconcerned with popularity or convention and will sacrifice a great deal in service of a compelling idea. Though it\u2019s painful to admit, we accept that our games will likely never be popular with a broad audience.\nYou can read more about our Beliefs and Instincts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWelcome friend\n\nWe begin today another adventure with Burning Wheel Headquarters. We have been creating and publishing games since 2002 and we love to surprise and delight our fans. Let us run through some risks and challenges both for us and you on this project.\n\nWe have never failed to deliver on a project, but we are launching into an extremely uncertain world now. We wouldn't launch unless we had every item buttoned up\u2014and we do\u2014but still, anything can happen.\n\nWe always under-promise and over-deliver. That is a challenge for us. Whatever you see on this page, we want to deliver it to you in an even more magnificent form. We don't know exactly what that will be, but as I said, we aim to surprise and delight.\n\nSomething always goes wrong. Always. For past projects it has been shipping cock-ups, misprints and Luke & Thor feuding over design for four years. For this project who knows what will go wrong? Something will, but we will handle it. We always do.\n\nThis is our biggest project to date with the most gaming material combined with the most moving parts. We feel like we're ready to begin the long process of getting this game to you. That said, we have no idea what we're doing, but we have excellent partners and 20 years of experience in delivering really good games.\n\nShipping is complicated, slow and expensive. It just is. We've done our best to find the fastest, safest and cheapest solutions for you (pick two). If shipping is too expensive for you, we respect your economical opinion, but there is no way we can satisfy your needs in this matter. \n\nAnd lastly, we present to you the biggest challenge of this project: We seek allied adventurers and other brave souls to join our band and assist us on this great quest. If you can carry a pack, heft a spear or bear a torch as part of our adventuring band, then we welcome you on our quest. We are in dire need of such friends. \n\nBe courageous: Join us and help hold aloft a burning beacon to drive back the weird darkness of this world. \n\nAgents of chaos need not apply, any who do shall be cast into the abyss.\n\nOnward,\n\u2014Luke, Thor & BWHQ\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nOur books are built to last years of wear and tear at the table and in your backpacks.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Kiitos - Outwit with Cleverness\nKiitos is an English language card game of word completion for 2 -4 players. Kiitos is the Finnish word for thank-you. When you force someone to finish your word, you say \"Kiitos\" to them.\nKiitos is a strategy word game. Combining a mixture of luck and skill, it plays fast, but can spark deep thinking.  It is unlike any other word game, with a novel mechanism.  \nIt has the feel of a classic game. It can feel a little bit like a trick-taker. Each word can evolve unexpectedly, and it can feel like a succession of wordy puzzles, where you can try to bamboozle your opponents with cleverness. \nIt's a perfect couples game, and is ideal for playing with your word game-loving mum or at lunchtime with your work mates.  \nIt can be an intense 2 player game, a bit more relaxed at 3, and almost a party game at 4 players.    \nHow to Play Video\nStella and Tarrant from Meeple University have made a how to play video for Kiitos.  \n  For the rulebook and to see what is in the box scroll down past the reviews. \nReviews\n'Sesquipedalian Steph' from 3 Minute Board Games loves the longer words.\n'Kiitos is definitely one for the word nerds, who are looking for a bit more interaction, and opportunities to mess with your opponents, than Bananagrams or Scrabble affords you. The recommended age range is 12+, but you could absolutely soften the rules for precocious word-babies. 10 year old me would have loved it. It's small, portable, quick to set up, easy to teach and a complete bastard to master.' Steph, 3 Minute Boardgames.\n---\nBefore Steph's video, Jarrod from 3 Minute Board Games gave a quick preview of Kiitos within a longer video.\n \"Oh my Lord.  It is one of the most legitimately fun games Steph and I, and my friends, have played in ages. It is one of those games where I played it, and afterwards, I was like, why isn't this in every bloody toy store? This should be sold alongside Uno. It's just really fun, really addictive. ... Keep an eye on this one. Wow!\" - Jarrod, 3 Minute Board Games   \n ---\nDaddy Louie from the Circle of Nerds gives us his review:\n\"So what do I think of this game? I think it is great. It's great family fun. It's good for anyone that enjoys word style games, like I said, Scrabble, Boggle, things like that. I think this changes those mechanics enough to make it fun and exciting for both experienced and new gamers. The age group that it targets is just perfect for me and my family, because that is right around the age of my children. So we enjoyed this and I think that you'll enjoy it as well.\"  Louie Martinez, Circle of Nerds \n  ---\nMichael from Expand Your Game - has a written review.\n\"This is the most unique word game I have played recently as 'Kiitos' has  a unique trick-taking mechanic that also adds bluffing elements. It creates a hot potato feeling as you don't want to finish another player's word but do want to force players into finishing your words. This is a great unique and compact word game that I would recommend to anyone that grew up on Scrabble or classic trick-taking games.\" -Michael at Expand Your Game \n ---\nJordan Plays Blue also gives Kiitos a whirl:\n\"... I enjoy the puzzle that is trying to finish words, spell words, get them to be put together properly. I think Kiitos does that really well. It is an interesting twist on having to spell words kind of collaboratively, but still only scoring if you're the one that finishes the word. I especially like the variant where you can add to the beginning or ends of words. I think that adds a lot of opportunities, especially at the beginning of words, to maybe add prefixes to words, things like that. I think that works really well\" -Jordan from Jordan Plays Blue\n ---\nThe Dice Men Cometh podcast - Episode 302 (from about 28 minutes) - talk about Kiitos. \n'The game is fun and quick and its one of those games that you can kind of play until it stops being fun. You can play it for a couple of rounds or you can play it for hours if you've got the right wordsmiths around you.' - Dice Man Garth\n'Good job Matty T. It is exceptional for a small little boxed game' - Garth again.\n ---\nRowdy with a Chance of Meeples podcast/youtube channel have some entertaining banter about Kiitos.\n'Very,very clever. There's a lot of depth in this game. I was very impressed ...\nPeople who are clever with wordplay are really going to like this game ...\nThis was really good. This was really,really fun.' - Sean from Rowdy with a Chance of Meeples\nQuotes from Board Game Geek\n\"Kiitos is exactly what I want in a word game - quick, fun and addictive. My wife and I have really enjoyed playing this one.\" - Shem Phillips, designer of Raiders of the North Sea and co-designer of Viscounts of the West Kingdom\n\"Excellent game with hidden strategies.  If you have the ability to work out what cards your opponent holds you can beat someone who knows more words than  you :-) Plurals, ING words, knowing odd spellings, or just plain creative thinking can dig you out of holes. And in what other game are plays like \"Improbabilty\" and \"Californium\" both common and fun?  There is joy in changing \"ASTIC\" from 'plastic' to  'Masticate'.\" - BGG user Peppermallow\n\"Awesome game! Cunning and extremely playable. Great for travel too!\" - BGG user funkypsiko   \nUnique new game mechanics\nMost other word games boil down to anagramming 7 or 8 letters; Kiitos is different. It is about making words with the letters in your own hand, and the letters that may or may not be in your opponents' hands. The rules are simple, but the emergent strategies are surprisingly deep.\nThe idea for Kiitos came to me as flipping the traditional spoken word game of Ghost on its head. In Ghost players alternate saying a letter trying not to be the player who says a whole finished word. In Kiitos, there is a concept of owning the target word, you do want to finish your target word, but the available letters are limited to what cards are in all of the players' hands. Then you want your target words to finish, but you don't want your opponents' target words to finish.    \nKiitos works in British English, American English, New Zealand English, Australian English, Singaporean English, Canadian English etc. or a mixture of all of them.\nThe Project\nKiitos has been designed and extensively play-tested (it's been my go-to lunchtime game at work for over a year). The graphic design to the manufacturer's templates has been completed. This Kickstarter is to see the first print run into production. It is going to look great on the shelves of gameshops and bookshops next to the other word games. \nEach copy of Kiitos will come in a magnetic latch box and comprise the rulebook, 72 letter cards, 8 challenge cards, 3 double-sided rule cards, 4 seasoning cards (for variant play) and a wooden \"lock token\".\nThe cards will be 57x87mm (2.25 x 3.42 inches) 300gsm cards. They'll have a plastic coating to extend their life.\nThe game will be manufactured by Whatz in Shanghai, China. The cost will be kept low to come under the VAT and GST limits for various countries, including the UK and Ireland. Manufacturing and shipping will occur approximately two to three months after the end of the campaign. \n The Letter Cards\nThe distribution of the 72 letter cards will be on the inside cover of the magnetic latched box. The distribution of the letters roughly equals how often they're used in English words, except there is no letter Q. The game plays better without a Q.\n The Double-sided Rule Cards\nThere are three double-sided rule cards. Each has a basic green side, and an alternate orange side. The game starts with the cards on their basic sides. When you successfully have your target word completed you must flip one of them. It can't be the same as the last one flipped which is what the lock token is for. \nMinimum 4 letter word / Minimum 5 letter word: Flip this one to control the momentum of the game. 4 letter words in combination with some intelligent guesses at what might be in your opponent's hands can lead to a series of your words being completed.\nPositive Pile x1 / Positive Pile x2 : This is for end of round scoring. The letters from completed words end up in your positive pile. You want to try to make them worth more. If you flip this too early it can be flipped back on you. This can lead to stand-up endings and the winner being decided by the last word chosen and the last letter flipped.\nKiitos / Super-Kiitos: This is the core of the game. Do you build the words from left to right, or build the word by adding letters to the front and back? The strategies for each are completely different. It can be easier to take control of momentum with the Kiitos side up. Can you stop the Positive Pile x2 card from being flipped back? \n Challenge Cards\nChallenges are where Kiitos really shines. To challenge a word an opponent picks up a challenge card, and then the word gets looked up in a dictionary or in a word checking app. The loser of the challenge put the challenge card into their negative pile.\nIt is not cheating if you can get a false word past your opponents.  Sometimes you might let non-words through, because you can continue it with the next letter. Sometimes you grasp at straws thinking a word you may have made up just might be a real word, and you can get lucky. Kiitos edge-tests the dictionary like no other game. The decisions around challenging can be challenging in themselves.\n Seasoning Cards  \nThe seasoning cards add variant play. They change the strategies significantly and will exercise your noggin. Use zero, one or more of them.\nSeconds : May play a second letter when not setting the target word. So you can play a second letter, but should you? Sometimes, yes, sometimes, no. A whole new skill for you to try not to get wrong.\nCompletos : Can finish a word when setting target word. Normally you can't, but now you can. \nSqueeze In : When changing the target word you may place your letter between the other letters. This went better in playtesting than a full anagramming one and had less analysis paralysis, but added some interesting decisions.\nFlip: Flip a letter from the deck to start a new word.

We did not imagine this book as an allegory for what the world is currently experiencing. But, as with Poe\u2019s infamous \u2018Red Death\u2019, you often don\u2019t see what is coming at you until it is too late, and now, these visceral writings of Edgar Allan Poe are speaking to us and to our world as we are living it today.\nNow, more than ever, is the time\u2014the time to unite, the time to support one another, to support artists, and to read. In our darkest hours, we turn to art to ignite our imagination, to feed us with ideas and inspirations, to distract and entertain us, to bring us together around shared stories that give us hope and make us human.\nWithout further ado, my dear ladies and gentlemen, we invite you back to Thornwillow to meet our next book:\nEDGAR ALLAN POE TALES, MYSTERIES & CONTRIVANCES\nEdgar Allan Poe\nFew authors have left a legacy as enduring and influential as Poe\u2019s. The first author to make his living as a professional writer, he not only composed some of the most famous and haunting short stories of all time, but single-handedly invented the genre of detective fiction, and was one of the earliest authors to explore the bounds of science fiction. In the span of his short life, he produced a groundbreaking body of work that has defined the genres of horror and mystery for the last two hundred years. And yet, he lived a life almost as dark and dreary as any of his tales, coping with alcoholism, gambling, poverty, and eventually mysterious death. \nEdgar Allan Poe in 1849 four months before his death.\nAn iconic writer for this tumultuous time.\nWe have grouped our collection of Poe\u2019s most iconic writings into three categories, containing his infamous tales, groundbreaking mysteries, and contemptuous contrivances. \nOur edition contains the following Tales, Mysteries & Contrivances... \nThe Tales:\nMetzengerstein\nMS. Found in a Bottle\nBerenice\nThe Man That Was Used Up\nThe Fall of the House of Usher\nThe Man of the Crowd\nThe Masque of the Red Death\nThe Pit and the Pendulum\nThe Tell-Tale Heart\nThe Cask of Amontillado\nThe Dupin Mysteries:\nThe Murders in the Rue Morgue\nThe Purloined Letter\n  The Contrivances:\nHow to Write a Blackwood Article\nA Philosophy of Composition\n ...and features a world class historian to navigate you through the twists and turns of Poe\u2019s tales and life... meet Jill Lepore.\nWorld renowned scholar Jill Lepore guides us through Poe's stories and life.\nHere to guide us through the dark passages of Poe\u2019s most twisted tales (and his equally twisted life) is acclaimed Harvard historian and two-time Pulitzer Prize finalist, Jill Lepore. With wit as incisive as Poe\u2019s pendulum, she brings her expertise to bear on a man famous for concocting riddles, mysteries... and outright lies.\n ... and putting on paper the ink he usually reserves for human skin... meet John Reardon. \nThe edition is dramatically illustrated with bone-chilling original artwork by Brooklyn tattooist John Reardon, whose signature style presents a vivid and haunting representation of Poe\u2019s sinister worlds.  \nTattoo artist John Reardon at work.\nReardon is recognized  as one of the most talented tattoo artists working today. For more than two years he has been developing more than 28 original works of art for this edition. With this collaboration, we will put on paper the ink he usually reserves for human flesh.\nOriginal artwork accompanies each of the Tales, Mysteries & Contrivances\nThe leather binding at the highest tier will be hand tattooed by Reardon himself directly on the book. AND at several of the highest tier subscriptions, you can opt to visit his studio where he will tattoo YOU. But more on that later. \nWe are dedicated to teaching and perpetuating the arts and crafts of the written word.\nFor more than 30 years, Thornwillow has been committed to making books that enhance the relationship between the reader and the written word. Thornwillow books are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the White House, and the Vatican. \nSome of the tools that will that will be used to bind your book.\nIn this digital age, we are committed to teaching and perpetuating the related arts and crafts of the written word. We still make our books by hand, letterpress printing every page on heavy archival stock and binding each copy with the finest materials and utmost care.\nHow our books are made\nAll of the design, printing, and binding are done at Thornwillow in our workshops in Newburgh, New York. We are perhaps the only fine press publisher in the world to unite these related arts and crafts of the written word under one roof, and we are committed to teaching and perpetuating them for readers today and for years to come.\nOur Heidelberg cylinder letterpress on which the book will be printed.\nWe start with a beautiful layout.  The text is set using classical ratios of type to page, giving each book luxurious margins and elegant proportions.\nOnce the book is laid out, the text is printed letterpress on our Heidelberg Cylinder Press. The type is literally pressed into the heavy archival stock, so that you can feel the letters as you run your fingers across the page. This is an ancient art\u2014the same process by which Johannes Gutenberg printed his books 500 years ago.\nEach book is then folded into eight page signatures, collated and sewn together.\nThe books are then bound by hand by our master craftsmen, who create the highest quality bindings in the world.\nAs a testament to the care and attention that goes into the crafting of every Thornwillow volume, your unique copy of Poe\u2019s Tales will be individually numbered and signed.  And, in recognition of your patronage and your participation in  the global arts and crafts movement we are endeavoring to ignite, your name will be recorded on the Subscribers List accompanying every volume.\nWe cannot do it without you. We need your support to bring this edition to life and to immortalize the work of one of the world\u2019s greatest authors. Without your help, however, our project will remain locked away in a tomb of unrealized ideas and lost inspirations..\nNow more than ever we need your help to keep the lights on. \nIn supporting this project, you are not just making the publication possible and adding a beautiful and important book to your shelf\u2014 you are supporting a community of writers, artists, and artisans\u2014 designers, printers, and binders\u2014 you are uniting a global community of book makers and book readers who share a love of books and celebrate the written word.

(NOTE: Often certain versions of the edition are fully subscribed during the Kickstarter launch, particularly the full leather tiers. Also the number available on the campaign in some instances is less than edition size because we have held some copies back for steady collectors). When an edition is down to just a few remaining copies, the prices tend to be much higher than they were at the beginning. This rewards patrons like you who supported our work early. \nPublisher Luke Ives Pontifell in the Thornwillow stacks.\nEdgar Allan Poe is an iconic writer for all time and this landmark Thornwillow edition is the one to own.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A note on Coronavirus: After much debate and consultation with our suppliers, partners and supporters about whether or not to launch this game right now, we have decided to proceed with this Kickstarter for the reasons discussed under Risks and Challenges.\nVeilwraith is a fantasy card game set after the end of the world featuring deck building elements for 1 player. It can can also be played multiplayer with up to 4 Veilwraiths, where each player must have their own copy of the game.\nPlayers: 1 (up to 4 with extra copies)           Time: 30-40 minutes                       Ages: 12+ \nAlthough set in the same universe as the Kilforth games, Veilwraith is an entirely new game with completely new mechanics! Why not let the dulcet tones of Ricky Royal talk you through the gameplay...\nFrom the award-winning team behind Shadows of Kilforth and Gloom of Kilforth: A Fantasy Quest Game - the sell-out game from Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Top Ten Games of the Year - and 1066, Tears to Many Mothers - the beautiful historical card game, nominated for a Golden Geek Award and an Origins Award and winner of a 2018 Best Art Award - Veilwraith is a new and unique adventure experience in a shattered and broken world.\nVANA: In the seared lands or \u2018Vana\u2019 that has been left behind after the end of all things, fragmented memories of trapped souls continue to try to break through the shattered Veil. \nThe blackened Vana lands\nDEJA: Some spirits remain because of an intractable bond with the life they left behind, and some remain because of strong magicks, or curses, or the tragedy of their fate \u2013 these souls are the Deja. Their very presence threatens to drain your soul unless you can help them find peace.\nThe cursed Deja\nANIMA: Other more malicious entities patrol the Vana too, clinging to a shadowy vestige of wraithlike half life. They are the twisted Anima \u2013 creatures and spirits driven by madness and evil: demons, monsters, damned souls, and puppets of the Overlord Himself.\nThe dreaded Anima\nKEYS: As a Veilwraith you are a remnant of what once was \u2013 an unearthly being sent back through the Veil by an impossible twist of fate. You must traverse the corrupted Vana, searching for and weaving together a series of disparate memories called Keys that can restore light, colour, and life to this broken, blackened world.\nThe Keys of the World\nMEMORIES: But you are not helpless. Gifted with unusual talents you can avail yourself of powerful memories from the stories that came before; memories which are all that remain to lend hope to this ravaged land.\nLet's keep this nice and simple and make sure we don't miss out on any juicy content. We're going all in on component quality as always, and we have all of the content ironed out already, so let's not hold anything back and just get this completed and uniquely gorgeous game into your hands!\nAs with all of our games Veilwraith is Solo Friendly, indeed it is a solitaire game. Unlike other games you don't have to manage multiple heroes, you play as a single Veilwraith against the world - or what is left of it. Multiplayer games are also possible too, allowing multiple Veilwraiths to adventure together, providing each player uses their own separate copy of the game (and expansion, if the expansion is used).\nThe relentless Archfiend\nAs many of you know, no one does art in games quite like Hall or Nothing Productions: there are over 100 unique and gorgeous images in Veilwraith, and even more in the Absolution expansion. The starkly beautiful black and white style is unlike anything we've done before - it seeks to immerse you in the colourlessness of the Veilwraith's desperate world.\nTo this end, we have an international team of mega artists working tirelessly to bring the broken world of Veilwraith to life, led by Mikhail Greuli and Jose del Nido.\nExperience the haunting beauty of the end of the world\nFrom award winning game designer Tristan Hall\nUniquely illustrated, broken world - hundreds of beautiful, unique images\nLevel up your deck of Memories over a gripping campaign\nAddictive card play with many actions and options to choose from each turn\nDiscover the shattered beauty of the Vana lands\nBring peace to the Deja \u2013 troubled souls, trapped beyond the Veil\nVanquish malicious Anima \u2013 twisted wraiths and cursed spirits\nMyriad encounters and Foes (bosses) provide unlimited replayability\n1 Player, 30-40 mins (more players can join in with their own copy of the game)\n120+ high quality tarot-sized cards\nVeilwraith is played over a series of games or \u2018Vignettes\u2019 which together make up a Campaign. Each Vignette the player, as the Veilwraith, must collect 5 Keys, and defeat all of that Vignette\u2019s Foes, all whilst evading the watchful eye of the Archfiend. Once they have collected all 5 Keys and defeated all the Vignette\u2019s Foes, only then can they try to reach the Portal in time to escape back beyond the Veil and win the game.\nEach game of Veilwraith is played over a number of rounds. Each round, Threats emerge from the Threat deck for the Veilwraith to try to defeat. On their turn the Veilwraith can...\nPlay Memory cards to improve their situation,\nCombine Memories to significantly boost their available actions,\nTilt an action to make it more powerful,\nTry to defeat a Threat, and\nUse special Key abilities\n... all in an attempt to find all 5 Keys and escape as quickly as possible to win. Each round consists of the following five Phases in which the Veilwraith does the following:\n Threat \u2013 adds a Threat card to their Threat area,\n Draw \u2013 draws a Memory card to their hand,\n Play \u2013 takes their turn, playing cards and powering up actions to tackle Threats,\n Spirit \u2013 loses Spirit, based on the Threats now in play,\n Cleanup \u2013 checks for victory, otherwise they get ready for the next round.\nThe base game has absolutely everything you need to play the game, but the Veilwraith: Absolution expansion box adds an insane amount of content to the base game too! In Veilwraith you can play a full 5 scenario (or 'Vignette') campaign, but the expansion adds a further 15 Vignettes in your campaign, with all new Threats and Boss Foes to vex you in your quest to restore life and light to the world. The extra 15 Vignettes follow on from the 5 basic game Vignettes, and come with their associated new Foes and Threats consisting of 138 gorgeous new cards:\n15 Vignettes\n69 Foes\n54 Threats\nThe large (946mm x 446mm or ~37.2 x 17.5 inches) neoprene roll-out playmat is a stunning monochrome art print and will be in the classic Hall or Nothing playmat style on lovely, thick material, with nice, stitched edges for extra longevity. Each playmat accommodates a single player, so additional players should use their own playmats. Note that playmats are not required for play. This beautiful landscape is from the mind of the insanely talented Mikhail Greuli:  \nAnd now, as a celebration for all of us and as a massive thank you to you guys for obliterating the \u00a3100K milestone the already magnificent playmats will now be double-sided! That's right - they will have a full gorgeous alternative art print on the reverse side, just like we did with the beautiful Shadows of Kilforth playmats...\nPlaymat reverse art (mock-up)\nVeiled Wraith is a family-friendly alternative art pack. It is not included with the Hall In pledge as it is a separate add-on: it contains no new gameplay content, only alternative art where some of the characters are less revealing, and those who are happy with the original art should not feel it is a necessary expansion. But for those who might prefer more modest/family-friendly artwork, Veiled Wraith contains ~30 alternative art cards from the base game and Absolution expansion (including duplicates where necessary). We will offer it for \u00a310 (it will be \u00a315 RRP) during these final hours of the Kickstarter and for at least another month in the pledge manager too.\nIf you'd like to add Veiled Wraith to your pledge, simply click Manage Your Pledge at the top right of the Kickstarter page, and increase your pledge amount by \u00a310.\nHere is the current version of the rulebook - please feed back to us with your comments and questions and let us know about any typos!\nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ShXQ7bIMrms-kYH8j6j1qGeT1tjVRi9C?usp=sharing\nVeilwraith Rulebook v 1.0 WIP\n Teaser Video \nHow to set up the game\nGame designer Tristan Hall gives an overview of the set up of the game:  \nGameplay\nA full play-through of the second Vignette with the legendary Ricky Royal:\nA full play-through of the first Vignette with game designer Tristan Hall: \n Multiplayer Mode with two copies of the game:\nVeilwraith on Tabletopia:\nYou can play Veilwraith yourself right now, on Tabletopia here: https://tabletopia.com/games/veilwraith\nPlay it yourself now, on Tabletopia\nFallen Seraph\nMad Watcher\nDiablo\nOni\nArchfiend\nFor rules questions, advice from the experts, photos, session reports, sneak previews and more, make sure you follow us on social, and join our official chat group here:\nfacebook.com/gamesofkilforth\ntwitter.com/ninjadorg\ninstagram/hallornothinggames\nyoutube.com/tristanhallrocks\nhallornothingproductions.co.uk\nsoundcloud.com/boardchitless\nAt Hall or Nothing Productions Ltd we are dedicated to delivering world-class, thematic games where quality cannot be compromised.

Thanks to the amazing backers who successfully funded \"Gloom of Kilforth\", \"1066, Tears to Many Mothers\", \"Lifeform\", the \"Gloom of Kilforth + expansions reprint\", \"Shadows of Kilforth\", and \"1565, St. Elmo's Pay\" we have learnt a huge amount about the development process, design and file submission for the printers, and we will be working again in close partnership with our factories and fulfilment agencies to ensure the smoothest delivery of your games whilst keep you, the backers, updated at all times with monthly reports after the campaign.\n\nProduction of the cards and game boxes will take a couple of months. The art is complete already, so it will hopefully take no longer than 6 months to finish printing, but experience tells us to factor in delays outside of our control.\n\nThe final hurdle will be overseas shipping and customs, and any delays which might be caused by this process will unfortunately be outside our control. But fulfilment of all of our previous games has been completed successfully, and as with all of our campaigns: if this project funds, you will get your games.\n\nA note on Coronavirus.\n\nAfter much debate and consultation with our suppliers, partners and supporters about whether or not to launch this game right now, we have decided to proceed with this Kickstarter for these reasons:\n\n* We have been extremely fortunate at Hall or Nothing to foster a friendly community of supportive and witty gamers - the opportunity to continue spending time with these lovely people and work together to deliver a creative project is a most welcome distraction from ongoing events. \n* We've had many requests from backers awaiting the launch of Veilwraith who we do not want to let down. At a time when we are all feeling the effects of isolation this is an opportunity for interested parties to come together and spend time doing something fun. \n* As many of us in the global community are confined to our homes we are all flocking to the internet even more than usual to engage in activities to pass the time - we want to provide a place of normalcy and 'business as usual' in the knowledge that once these horrible times are over things will return to normal. \n* Our manufacturers and fulfilment teams have strongly vouched for their ability to sustain production and shipping needs - and given that the game is ready to go there is nothing to suggest that delivery of our games would be impeded should this project be successful.\n* We don't purport to be anything more than a business continuing to do business, but we do believe that coming together for a shared creative goal can make us all feel good, and also result in something cool for us to play in the coming months when tabletop games will perhaps see more action in people's homes than ever before. \n* In an effort to combat FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) we have done away with stretch goals and Kickstarter exclusives entirely for this campaign. Also, we will do everything we can to make the game available to late backers who lack the funds or confidence to support the game at this moment. \n* Given the state of the world right now, we understand that uncertainty is rife in the global community, and if you have any reservations at all about supporting this, or any other Kickstarter - as always - please pledge responsibly! You might even consider a \u00a31 pledge simply to join in with the community and chat for the duration (and we will be happy to refund you after the campaign should you wish).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nAlmost all of the product is made from paper and cardboard, which can be therefore be recycled.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a330 or more", "title": "Veilwraith", "descp": "1 copy of Veilwraith RRP \u00a335\nINCLUDES:\nVeilwraith base game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["164 backers", "Limited (836 left of 1000)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "Veilwraith: Absolution", "descp": "1 copy of Veilwraith + Absolution expansion (RRP \u00a365)\nINCLUDES:\nVeilwraith base game\nVeilwraith: Absolution expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["658 backers", "Limited (342 left of 1000)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a355 or more", "title": "Veilwraith + Playmat", "descp": "1 copy of Veilwraith + playmat (RRP \u00a365)\nINCLUDES:\nVeilwraith base game\nVeilwraith playmat", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Limited (980 left of 1000)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a380 or more", "title": "Veilwraith: Hall In", "descp": "1 copy of Veilwraith + Absolution expansion + playmat (RRP \u00a395)\nINCLUDES:\nVeilwraith base game\nVeilwraith: Absolution expansion\nVeilwraith playmat", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["736 backers", "Limited (264 left of 1000)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Veilwraith Shipping Update - End Of May 2021", "update_content": "Hi guys, I hope you're well, here's the current lowdown on shipping as of today...\nUK and RoW: fulfilment is nearing completion - all of the games should be on their way before the end of the month and many of you have already received them.\nEU: as per the last update, I've been informed that we're currently still on track for parcels to start ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Veilwraith EU parcels are delayed until June!", "update_content": "Hi guys,\nToday I updated everyone's backer status to 'Ready for Shipping' on Gamefound.

These mercenaries and peddlers of rodent disposal now stand on the precipice of fame and glory, all they have to do is their job, right?\nOBJECTIVE\nThe Ratcatchers objective: To rid the city of as many rats as possible on their way to gathering as much Magical Cheese as possible.\nWIN - The RATCATCHER is victorious if you achieve any one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Ratcatcher collects 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher slays the Nemesis Rat\nLOSE - The Ratcatcher is defeated if the Rats achieve one of the following criteria;\n\u2022 The Rats consume 10 Magic Cheese or The Ratcatcher is reduced to 0 wounds\n\nThe Ratcatcher (Player) Turn: \nDuring your Ratcatchers turn, they\u2019re seeking to vanquish rats & gather Magical Cheese. This can be done using the various skills and actions listed on the Character Board.   \nMagic Cheese Tokens\nUnlock/Upgrade:\nOnce the Ratcatcher can successfully gather some Magical Cheese then the fun of upgrading and customising your Ratcatcher can begin.  \nBy assigning a Magic Cheese you may unlock a chosen ability. Once active place the maximum number of the relevant tokens on the Character Board.\n The Rats (AI) Turn: \nDependent on the type of Rat, the rats will either seek out the Magical Cheese or attack the Ratcatcher. White rats as the most numerous, and though simple in appearance their strength becomes apparent when they swarm towards pieces of cheese. Brown rats are vicious and ill tempered, set on attacking any who come close these rodents must be disposed of carefully. Black rats, are the breeders and with them comes even more rats. Each time a black rat is placed, additional rats are immediately placed. In addition to that each spawn phase Black rats count as a Spawn Point for even more rats! \nPeculiar Rats: \nThe Magic Cheese can have wonderful and miraculous effects, this effect is not limited to humanity only. The rats are eating the cheese and it has had some peculiar effects on them.\nThe Peculiar rats imbue the power of the magic cheese forming a nasty mini boss style adversary that will complicate the Ratcatcher's quest but also offers a variety of tempting rewards should the Ratcatcher be bold enough to catch one. \nNemesis Rats:\nNemesis Rats are true horrors of their species. The Magical Cheese has twisted their mind and body, into something spawned from the most terrible of nightmares. As catalysts of the Rat infection, destroying them is the of the utmost importance and seems the only logical path to freeing the kingdom.\nEach Nemesis on top of having their own unique abilities, also has a varied Rat tracker. As the Rats collect Magic Cheese, this tracker will gain momentum, modifying the common rats, spawning Peculair rats and triggering the spawning of the Nemesis Rat. This makes each variant Nemesis a unique challenge.  \nExpanding the Township:  \nTownship Cards - Tarot Sized Cards\nThe sprawling streets of Brie are the battle zone of The Ratcatcher. Filled with twists and turns it will require a keen eye to find the cheese & tactical choices to stay a head of the rat horde.  \nIf there are fewer than two Magic Cheese tokens in the city, then a mandatory Explore Action is undertaken. This will expand the city using additional township cards. Each new Township card will also add more cheese, opportunities to refill/recuperate & of course, more rats. \n\n WHY PLEDGE NOW:\nAs with most projects using crowdfunding, The Ratcatcher solo adventure board game will not possible to publish without the financial commitment of backers.

At his time I am open to establishing French & German fan based rulebooks at this stage. These will be community based rulebooks.

By backing at any level you will qualify for Free/subsided shipping should you choose to upgrade your pledge during the pledge manager.\n Stretch Goals: All Stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign will be included FREE of charge in every copy of The Ratcatcher. Also where applicable, stretch goals will also be added to the Print and Play pledge level.  \n Multiple copies of the game: There are two options for the purchase of multiple copies, either by pledging at any level a backer will have access to the post campaign Pledge Manager (Gamefound.com), this will allow the backer to add additional copies of the game, shipping will be calculated & charged as a bundle (so you should save a bit of money). Alternatively if you have a few fellow gamers there is the Horde pledge, which will give you a discount as well as discount shipping. Just because it's a solo game dosen't mean we can be social ;) \nFAQ - Shipping:\n What is Subsidised shipping?: This is me covering a portion of the total shipping costs. Platypus Industries will pay $10 AUD of the total shipping cost. This is a little thank you for supporting us during the Kickstarter campaign. \n Shipping black zones: Sadly as much as it pains us to to say.

A group of naturalists, gathered to hear the victim speak, provide an abundance of witnesses and potential suspects. The Royal Society is in an uproar and Scotland Yard is at a loss. Only the great consulting detective\u2013Sherlock Holmes\u2013can unravel this mystery.\nBackers will become the first daring investigators to venture back to Victorian London and attempt to bring the killer to justice!

Part board game, part puzzle, part role-playing game, Murders By Mail is a new type of murder mystery game. Play alone or with friends\u2013great for couples and families looking for a non-TV-based activity! All you need to play is a mailbox and a cellphone.\nGameplay is simple:\nA box will arrive in the mail containing your case file. This includes a description of the crime, introductions to your investigators, plus maps, photographs, clues, and other important pieces of reference.

Each investigator has special talents, so choose wisely! When you\u2019re ready, use your phone to send each investigator to their target.\n  In a few days, a letter will arrive from your team describing what each of them have learned. New information, clues and suspects will be revealed, but remember... the killer is watching, and will do anything to avoid being caught.\n  Return to the case file, review your notes, and send the team back out to new destinations.

All of the other listed rewards are for those gamemasters who missed out on my earlier projects.\nDigital mockup.\nWhile working on writing the remaining PDFs to fulfill the A Dozen Troubling Rumors Kickstarter campaign (see the project page), I ran into a mental wall and spent a weekend staring at a blank page. No matter how hard I tried, my brain was locked and I found myself unable to write. The stresses of today's challenges had, obviously, dug deep into my mind and was blocking my ability to create.\nSample page spread.\nWhenever I have found myself suffering from writer's block before, I have discovered that shifting gears and working on something new is often the best way to get the creative muscles running again. So that is what I did, adjusting my focus to a collection of city sites that I thought would be both fun to create and a valuable addition to every gamemaster's toolkit.\nSample page spread, city sites.\nWithin a matter of hours, the outline for Fantasy City Sites and Scenes was locked down, and my fingers were jamming at the keyboard, quickly creating characters, places, and situations that were each designed to drop into a fantasy campaign. At times, I stitched together links between the newly-formed places and characters, doing all that I could to make the book a package that would instantly inspire gamemasters and add depth to any fantasy city.\nSample page spread, city sites.\nCity sites. Each of the sixteen locations detailed in the book is presented on a two-page spread (for a total of 32 pages worth of locations) and includes a few assorted details the gamemaster can use to add flavor to the site, as well as assorted other bits of info that vary from location to location to give the site a little personality. Hooks that may lead to adventure are sprinkled throughout this section of the book.\nSample page spread, city scenes.\nCity scenes. In addition to the city sites, the book also includes twelve pages of encounter ideas. Divided into two sections -- daytime scenes and nighttime scenes -- this section of the book is for those gamemasters who are looking to throw challenges at the party as they walk the city streets.\nDigital mockup.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nFor those who missed out on the Dungeon Challenge Cards (details here), I am making those cards available as a part of this project. The Dungeon Challenge Cards final product is a 36-card deck, packed inside a custom tuck box. I am down to the last of the decks and currently do not have plans to reprint these cards.

If you answered yes to any or all of these questions, you're in the right place! Good Puppers is a cute game about gathering a yard full of dogs who all share the most important pupper goal: burying a nice stash of bones. A game takes about 30 minutes, can have 2-4 players (Age 8+), and is very easy to learn!\n\nWhat's inside? 100 cards, featuring beautiful watercolor art of the finest puppers we could imagine. That's all you need to play! (Okay, fine, there's a rulebook too.)\nAs a bonus to our backers, we'll be adding a sheet with stickers to every Kickstarter copy. Do you want to put cute pup stickers on everything? Yes. \nWe're starting with 1 cute pup sticker, and additional stickers will unlock as stretch goals!\nHow's it work?\nSimple! Every round you will choose a pup from your hand, place it into your Yard and do whatever it says to do. Then, you'll choose a new pup from the Dog Park (a face-up line of pup cards) to draw into your hand. Whoever played the highest numbered pup  gets first pick! \nAs your Yard accumulates these excellent dogs, they group by breed. The more matching pups you collect, the stronger their abilities become! The main objective of the game is for your pups to bury as many bones as they can in your Yard. Each bone starts out worth 1 point.   \nEach group of pups has their own stash of bones. Some effects will let you upgrade (rotate) bone cards, so that they're worth more points! You'll have to cleverly plan your pupper plays to both bury lots of bones, and rotate them to increase your score.   \nAt the end of the game, each breed has its own bonus rule, which will give you one last chance to upgrade buried bones. Once that's done, simply add up the value of all your bones, and see who wins! (Spoiler: everyone wins, because you got to play with cute pups.) \nRules / Print & Play:\nThe full game rules and a free demo print-and-play are available as PDFs, if you'd like to learn more about the game! \nRules PDF (7MB)\nPrint & Play PDF (7MB)\nAll Kickstarter copies of the game come with the stretch goal stickers included. We ran a test-print of three of our finest pups for canvas (Wall-Worthy Pups Reward), and here's what they look like on our wall:  \nWith everything that's going on in the world right now, we know times are tough for lots of folks. If you are want pups and/or to support us and our artists but can't afford full price, you can back at this special half-price level with reduced shipping ($2), no questions asked. You'll still get the game + stickers, because we want to get cute pups on every table we can this summer. Cute doggos make the world better, and we're happy to be part of that! \nYou can also support the campaign by backing for $1 and completing your pledge during the BackerKit pre-order phase this summer.  \n Every good woof deserves a good stretch (goal)! Our funding goal for the campaign is $10,000. If we reach that, we'll print the game, and include a fancy pup sticker in every Kickstarter copy. But what if more people like dogs? Well, then we'd have no choice but to add even more stickers! To that purpose, we have prepared a chart:\n\nArtists\nBehind the beautiful watercolor art of our pretty pups are Cari Corene and Amanda Coronado.\nCari is most interesting on Instagram and Etsy at: instagram.com/storyofthedoor and storyofthedoor.etsy.com\nYou can also find Amanda on Instagram and Etsy, at: instagram.com/cinnamoron and devilsbakery.etsy.com\nShipping Costs\nBecause of the quick nature of this campaign, and of the uncertain global situation, we're targeting this Kickstarter campaign only at the US and Canada. When we open the BackerKit for surveys and pre-orders, we hope to be able to include other regions! \nOne game: $3 US, $9 Canada\nMultiple items: $6 US, $15 Canada\nDue to shipping uncertainties, the Support Pup and Wall-Worthy Pup levels are only available in the US.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're keeping this project very simple to avoid pitfalls. One card game, with all its art already created and ready for print, and some stickers (we still have to draw some of those!).

When he\u2019s not gaming, Michael enjoys spending time at his home in the mountains, as well as kayaking and hiking with his family.\nAlan is a software engineer during his day job, that translates into a fascination with game mechanics and the algorithms that power his favorite board games.

Sean Molley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Welcome to the latest Kickstarter campaign for The Fantasy Trip (official website)! TFT is Steve Jackson's classic fantasy roleplaying game, revived thanks to the support of Kickstarter backers! Now, with your support, we will add two more books to the growing library of titles for The Fantasy Trip and open up new doors for gamemasters and solo adventurers! \nRead on to learn more about the two new books -- The Book of Unlife and Red Crypt -- and then select a reward level (detailed at right) to join the project.\nTo start playing The Fantasy Trip right now, please download the free Melee PDF from our online store: Warehouse 23. These rules will give you a taste of the much larger, deeper system that is found In the Labyrinth.\nThey are neither alive nor dead. They inhabit the world in between. But all too often the living are their prey.\nThe Book of Unlife includes 44 creatures for The Fantasy Trip (visit the official website), a guide to the general powers and vulnerabilities of the unliving, and a complete adventure setting, The Haunting of Holner House.\nUnlife is a broad term covering a wide variety of entities which are not \u201cliving beings\u201d in the traditional sense of the word. They may have once been alive, like Ghosts. They may be true \u201cundead,\u201d like Nosferatu. They may be animated forms, like Zombies and Golems. They may be entities of pure spiritual energy, like Poltergeists, or immortal beings from the unearthly realms, like Banshees. Whatever they are, they are not alive in the way life is usually understood.\nThe first part of this book, The Types of Unlife, is a guide to many of the known kinds of unlife. The second part, The Characteristics of Unlife, covers the unusual abilities that unlife beings may have, as well as techniques that can be used against hostile unlife creatures. The third part is an adventure setting that will bring the party up against several formidable unliving foes, as well as some living ones!\nThe Book of Unlife is a 64-page 8.5\" x 11\" book, written by Howard Kistler.\nYou study the face on the wanted poster. 30-ish, with ash-blond hair and a hook-shaped scar under his right eye. Jack Smoke.\nSmoke is a Redcap, part of a secret society plotting to overthrow the established order of wizards, priests, and guilds. Like many Redcaps, Smoke trusts gadgets or potions over magic. You heard he was once a priest who earned his nickname burning heretics. Then Smoke discovered his cult\u2019s \u201cmiracles\u201d were mere spells cast to delude the congregation. He lost his faith and turned against all wizardry as well, embracing the Redcap cause. What he didn\u2019t lose was his fanaticism.\nRecently, Smoke detonated a gas bomb at a town fair. It poisoned the wizard he targeted \u2013 and several children.\n\u201cUnfortunate collateral damage,\u201d said the Redcap communiqu\u00e9 that claimed credit for the assassination.\nYou intend to bring Jack Smoke to justice . . . and claim the 1,000 silvers the baron offers for his head!\nRed Crypt is a programmed adventure for a single character. It is designed for The Fantasy Trip: In The Labyrinth (available in both hardcover and print-on-demand softcover). If you instead have both Melee and Wizard, you can still play, with a few simplifications.\nThis adventure establishes locations, gives you decisions to make, and tells you the outcomes of those decisions. You will need six-sided dice, a straightedge, and scratch paper, along with counters and megahex tiles.\nSince Red Crypt uses only one player character, it can be played two ways:\n Solitaire: One lone player creates or selects an existing adventurer character. That character may acquire friends during the adventure, creating a party, but they are all run by the same person. When combat occurs, the book gives instructions regarding the foes in each location; the player sets up figures on a tactical map and plays out the battles, running both sides.\n Two-Player: One player creates a character (or uses an existing one) and plays through the scenario. When foes are encountered, the other player controls them and tries to defeat the adventurer. The second player can also act as Game Master (GM); they read the paragraphs and resolve rules disputes or actions not covered by these instructions.\nRed Crypt is a 24-page 8.5\" x 11\" book, written by David Pulver.\nPlease keep in mind that selecting add-ons will impact your total shipping costs. See the FAQ for more information. \n\nMore add-ons in BackerKit! In addition to the above items, we will offer several other games, supplements, and accessories during the BackerKit stage. We do not yet have the final add-ons list; we'll have all inventory counted and set limits on items in the BackerKit survey.\nInternational Note:  If you are outside of the United States and wish to order direct from Steve Jackson Games, please see our online store: www.warehouse23.com.\nNO REWARD NOTE: You must select a reward level to choose add-ons. As a policy, we do not make add-ons available to the No Reward pledges; in our experience, that leads to challenges and difficulties that cause troubles for all involved.\nNOTE: Street addresses only.\nAfter the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager. There, you will tell us your Warehouse 23 email address, provide your physical address, and pay for shipping (if you are receiving physical rewards). See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.\nINTERNATIONAL DELIVERY NOTE: There are no physical rewards offer to international backers. If the project closes successfully, we will offer both titles through Amazon's print-on-demand service, which will make it cheaper for you to purchase the print books (shipping will cost a lot less). \nWe continue to search for reliable, economical solutions to international Kickstarter delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSteve Jackson Games is an established game publisher with a successful track record and we have enough Kickstarter experience to deal with issues should they arise.
