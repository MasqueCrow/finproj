[{"backer": "Patrick Davidson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Stretch Goal #1\nWe're funded! If we can hit $7.5k by the deadline, here is what will happen:\nAll $10 backers get issues #1 AND #2.\nAll $15 backer get issues #1 AND #2, AND get named/listed in the eventual published series as Assistant Producers, either in an issue or the first trade. (Unless you don't want to.)\n10 more Cameo character ($150) rewards are opened up.\nWHO\nMy name is Larime Taylor, and I'm a disabled comics creator. I published A VOICE IN THE DARK at Image/Top Cow back in 2012 to critical acclaim, having written, drawn, toned and lettered the entire comic myself by mouth on a monthly schedule without missing deadlines. It started life as a Kickstarter and helped me get a polished package for publishers, which played a major role in the book getting picked up. I couldn't have done it without you.\n\n           When I first got into comics, I wanted to tell the kinds of stories I always liked. It took me a while to realize that most of those stories had no disabled characters, in large part because the ones I grew up on never did. I want to change that with KEEP STARING. \nI'm co-writing it, but not doing the art for it - I'm not the right artist, and I'm too close to it. I found a great artist, Jenny Odio from Costa Rica,  and we're developing it together along with my partner and co-writer Sylv, who is also disabled. It's about a teenage girl in high school with my disability and specific deformities. A lot of the story is based on things Sylv and I went through as disabled kids.\nWHAT\nI describe it as a 'kids-on-bikes' story like IT and STRANGER THINGS, if the kids were all disabled and several are POC and LGBT. It's going to be a YA book in the way that THE GOONIES, THE SANDLOT and LOST BOYS were YA - the kids cuss, they aren't all sweetness and sunshine, and real dangers are faced. But in the end, hope wins. We hope to make it an ongoing comic book series at a major publisher, and this Kickstarter is to help us put together a finished first issue and a pitch package for submitting to publishers. \nFor a number of reasons, the rewards will all be digital - there will be no printed copy or reward. Between COVID, USPS chaos and the fact that we're disabled and packaging and shipping is an extra cost we'd have pay others to do, it's just not the right fit. You'll be getting a finished digital copy of #1, which contains 25 pages of story and is lettered with a dyslexia-friendly font. There will be bonus material, such as the character designs and pitch materials we'll be sending to publishers, and we are providing accessible formats for the visually impaired. An enlarged and guided version will be available for those with some degree of vision, and a prose-style transcript of the comic that describes the art and action along with the dialogue will be available in text reader and braille formats. \nWHY\nComics needs better representation and accessibility. The story isn't just about the disabled, it's made by and for the disabled. Yes, $10 is pricey for a single digital comic book issue, but you're helping us in a number of ways: \nCreating a first issue and pitch package\nAllowing us to provide disabled-accessible versions so we can show publishers it can be done\nMaking content that most people see as too risky to try\nComics don't pay fast, and rarely pay well, so this lets us set aside the day-jobs while we work on material, make it accessible, and shop it around. Comics can also be a tough market, and a book about disabled kids is not exactly a guaranteed monthly seller. We're asking you to help us take on some of that risk and show that there's an audience.\nAt such a low goal, we have Stretch Goals planned, and each will unlock another full issue of the book, up to the first four issues. That means your $10 digital #1 pledge could potentially get you issues #1-#4, which turns it into quite a value. Without printing and shipping costs we can boost the content much more affordably.\nWHEN\nWe hope to have issue #1 and the pitch package completed by Halloween of 2020. Upon successful funding,the development blog will go live in a matter of days and you'll be able to start reading. If we hit stretch goals, we hope to have additional issues completed every other month - December 2020, February 2021 and April 2021. The development blog will continue throughout.\nThe Comic\nAt its core, KEEP STARING is about life as a disabled kid and growing up as someone different. It's nestled within a more familiar genre story framework, following the story of a group of young adults in a small, wealthy California town. Our intrepid group stumbles upon dark conspiracies and ancient evils that have tormented the area for centuries, and in true kids-on-bikes fashion, only they can stop it all. \nThe first storyarc (issues #1-#4) sees the gang unravel the mystery of a local cult that's slowly taking over the town, drawing from sources like INVASION OF THE BODYSNATCHERS by way of eldritch cosmic horror. If a publisher is found, the cult storyline will continue and be resolved in the second storyarc (#5-#8). Further stories are planned as well. \nThe Kids\nMaria Guadalupe de la Paz (14)- Lupe, as she's known, is the main/POV character and narrator of the story. She was born with Arthrogryposis, which is the same birth defect Larime has, and has just moved in with her Uncle Edgar in Los Silencios, California, where he lives on the family avocado farm. \nJulian Isaacs (15) - Jules was born with albinism and claims to have Tourettes, but his friends suspect he just says that to excuse his frequent loud and inappropriate outbursts. He's the instigator of the group, often landing them in trouble.\nMarquis Bresden (15) - Marquis is on the spectrum, an autistic kid with terrible eyesight and keen hearing and memory. He's a voracious reader and natural strategist.\nGrace Merriweather (14) - Grace was born premature with an autoimmune disorder that leaves her allergic to many things. A close call in 3rd grade left her with Bilateral Vocal Chord Paralysis as well, and she's been homeschooled ever since by her highly protective parents. She's the game master for the gang, running their weekly RPG sessions, and is highly creative.\nEthan Underwood (14) - Ethan has severe ADHD and Amblyopia. He can be excitable and hard to focus, but is unflinchingly loyal and relentlessly brave. \n\nPages from Issue #1\nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy limiting this to digital rewards, we hope to have cut out most of the risks and challenges I faced with A VOICE IN THE DARK - namely having to package and ship rewards as a disabled person reliant on an unreliable care provider.

That's when she starts seeing an invisible creature, called SITHRAH, who has been following her around. It's not long until she runs into a young man named Dino who is running from his own ghosts. Together they set out to find her missing father wherever the evidence leads. \nBook 4 will focus on their journey across The Deep to try to find Light City.\nThis series will be 6 books long.\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read SITHRAH for free at Webtoons.com.\n       SITHRAH 4: The Deep - will be 176 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into the first three books. The retail price will be $24.95.\nSITHRAH 3: The Symbol (188 pages)\nSITHRAH 2: Propositions (160 pages)\nSITHRAH 1: Kingdom of the Air (96 pages)\nNovember at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers. ;)\nOkay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...\nSITHRAH 4 will be ready to go to the printer about a month after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 2 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill DOMESTIC orders again and I will have an international distributor fulfilling the single book orders for INTERNATIONAL orders and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 2500 copies of SITHRAH 4 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n2000 to 2500 copies = $12,000\nShipping of my last campaign was about $10,000\nFees and Taxes +$3,000 (low estimate)\nLeftover Production Costs $2000\nFUNDING GOAL = $27,000\nWell, I was finally able to reduce the International shipping this time. :)\nInternational shipping is unfortunately very expensive, but I have managed to reduce the cost quite a bit since the last Kickstarter. I've partnered with a EU distributor to help reduce the international costs and so I'm happy to say we are now EU Friendly!\nI will add a shipping chart for Add-Ons as soon as I figure out how to do it best. Check back before the campaign is over to see how to add individual items to your pledge.\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 ART CONTEST!!! Submit your art during the month of March to get a chance at getting it published in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 4. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters to be printed in the book... FOREVER! Try to keep the art from having any spoilers of the next books or they won't be able to be included in the contest. If you make it into the book, you will be credited with your art. These are the winners that were printed in Sithrah 1:\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the end of March 2018. Please send all submissions to CoffeeTableComics@gmail.com for consideration. The following month, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and we can all vote for our favorites. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH the best graphic novel series it can be!\nI can't express in words just how much your support means to me and my family.

I have people in place to help me with shipping again. Not to mention I am working full-time on comics now instead of just after I get home from work. I have gone above and beyond to deliver on all my past campaigns even to the point of getting freelance jobs to help finish paying for stretch goals that the campaign didn't fully fund.\n\nThere is always a chance that something could go horribly wrong and delays could happen but I have given myself a few extra months of buffer time if anything goes down.

I have depression and I have written a long post about it in the about you section. I wrote Replicator because I was unable to relate to a lot of the mainstream superheroes with their \"do the right thing and everything will be ok\" mantra.\nI found as a teenager with depression that kind of thought process alienated me. It made me feel more isolated and that there must be something wrong with me because I would do the right thing and things wouldn't be ok.\nThis is not something you want a teenager going through. Life isn't like that, and pretending it's all sunshine and rainbows is counterproductive.\nI related more to the \"evil\" villains as they often had a compelling reason why they had to do what they had to do and a lot of them were mentally unstable. If I had known there were others like me then maybe I wouldn't have felt so alone.\nI also got frustrated that one of the superhero's biggest concerns was juggling their superhero life with their secret identity. People deal with much bigger issues.\nIn Replicator I want bullets to kill people, I want people that have unique powers and use them effectively I don't want to have superheroes to come back to life after being killed with no repercussions and I don't want to have stereotypical good guys and bad guys, I want you to decide who is good and bad and who is just doing what needs to be done.\n Who will love Replicator? \nFans of sci-fi comics \nFans of post-apocalyptic comics\nPeople that love futuristic technology and Mechs\nPeople that love superpowers \nFans of top quality art. \nPeople that can't relate to mainstream superhero's and want better powers and more original storylines.\n  REPLICATOR #2 - Page 11!\nWhat the critics are saying.\nComics anonymous\n https://comicsanonymous2015.wordpress.com/2017/05/31/a-comic-a-day-in-may-day-21-replicator-1/\nGrim in places as it needs to be an edge of your seat elsewhere, this first issue is the type of debut that shows the potential of both its creative team and the title itself and with it all ending on a cliffhanger it sets things up so that you are desperate to know when we\u2019ll see more. 9/10  \nRogues Portal-\nhttp://www.roguesportal.com/replicator-1-review/\nMy prediction is this series has the ability to be the next Saga in terms of success. Being sci-fi related has the chance to hold it back slightly but give it time to garner a cult following and give it the right marketing campaign and anything is possible.

It's one thing I wont compromise on. Being successful on Kickstarter allows me to work with some incredible artists from all over the world- England, Scotland, USA, Bosnia and Herzegovina Philippines and Australia and that's not including the artists that have done character and concept sketches.\nOne thing of Note the people that work on the covers are the same people that work on the internals. I'm not bringing in some superstar to wow you and then reduce the quality inside. The Covers are incredible and so are the internals.\nYou can check out more of the art teams work below if you wish.\nArmin Ozdic.https://arminozdic.deviantart.com/gallery/\nRoss.

When it comes to shipping all you are paying for is for is the cost of sending it from the post office to your house. You are not paying for bags, boards, packaging materials or my time. \nShipping can get expensive and I want to make it as cheap as physically possible. I buy things in bulk and make my own packaging to cut down on costs.\nI love packaging it's a weird thing to say but there is something about getting a package in the mail that is special.\nAll physical rewards are bagged and boarded and encased in cardboard and sealed with tape.\nBelow is an example of how it arrives I learned this method while working at Raygun comics in England to ensure that the comics arrive at the destination with the comics undamaged.\nNot Pretty- But Effective.\nThe edges are sealed with tape so no water can get inside and to ensure the gaps are firmly sealed closed.\nBelow is one of the wax sealed folders that comes with the rewards of $50 or above. You can also add it as an add-on to any physical level for $5.\nI decided to use manilla folders because it looks better and is thicker than the envelopes I had access to.\n  Sealed Folder with close up.\n    The available prints from the top left - Red Death, Green Cover, Ka-boom Monster and the River of Corpses-Printed on 300gsm.\n    The available Sketch Cards (A5) from the top left - Martin Griffiths, Michael Lee-Graham, Elena Vitagliano, Michael Lee-Graham Lee Sullivan Josh Suarez.\nThe Printed Comic, Prints and Sketch Cards.\n                                                     Draw me in- affectionately known as Harpoon Gary\n Incoming New Reward! Custom ONE OF A KIND Funko Pops. Get the Funko Pop Killer Himself \"Monster Ryker\"\n These are one of kind, Hand sculpted, Hand painted by me- Robert Arnold. Below we have Monster Ryker after he has dispatched Marty Mcfly. Ryker is sporting his tattered suit and tie which have been damaged by all the fights he has been in, along with his black monster arm. Finished off with some hauntingly beautiful green eyes.  \nTo Purchase a Monster Ryker simply add 130aud to any pledge level( this includes shipping to anywhere in the world) or select the reward level over on the right-hand side. There are a limited number of these available.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving done this once before and with a larger page count I'm confident in saying the only real risks are delays. If you back this project you will get your reward.\n\nWith the first issue there were delays and because of that, I upgraded everyone's pledge to the next tier from what they backed at my own cost.\n\nIt's important to me that people get their reward and feel that they got value for it.\nI'd just say now you have experience dealing with a larger project you are confident that there will be no delays, but if anything does happen you will keep in constant contact with backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "REPLICATOR #1 Big Barebones PDF", "descp": "Want to read the giant 32-page digital edition of REPLICATOR #1?

He\u2019ll have to wait for his barley pop, though, when the local community college is attacked by C.L.O.T., the militant wing of the National Blood Clot Association. Together with his best buddy Jorge and the brilliant graduate student Katie, it\u2019s up to Mitch to save the students from science gone wrong.\n FOR. JUST. ONE. DOLLAR.\nUnless you're looking for a physical copy of the book. In that case we've got something extra special for you in the form of an XXL print edition!\nAt a hefty 7.5 x 11 format (estimated), the print version of MITCH HAMMER is almost as big as the man himself. Not only will you be able to see the glorious artwork in super size, but you can use the comic to swat away any invasive mutant caterpillars that might be creepy crawling your way at this very moment.\nWith this two-track approach - offering the pdf at the low low price of $1, while giving physical comics lovers the chance to order an XXL analogue version - we hope to get MITCH HAMMER into as many meaty hands as possible. And every penny raised will go towards producing issue #2. The future of blue-collar comics has never looked brighter!\n\nFIRST DAY BACKERS, THIS IS FOR YOU!\nIn order to celebrate the launch, everybody who backs at the $5 level and above in the first 24 hours will receive 4 free comics:\nBARNSTORMERS #1 by Kenny Porter and Renny Castellani\nANCIENT NOISE #1 by David Crispino and Tony Gregori\nDUNGEON FUN #1 by Neil Slorance and Colin Bell\nDOCTOR CROWE #1 by Corey Fryia, Matt Horak, Tony Gregori, and Karim Whalen\nBack on day 1 and I'll deliver these PDFs into your inbox on day 2.

Shaw, aka Ironbark, makes my script look good with his bold letters.

Someone has sent them after Jason Dube\u2019s Shadowhunters and now there's gonna be one hell of a brawl as their club in Downtown Sacramento is turned into a Supernatural Mosh pit by Damage Inc. bounty hunters looking to fill a contract.\n What is in it?\nA quality glossy full color Floppy for part 1 of the Shadow Damage story arc filled with violence, humor and damn good artwork.\n      My Name is JAAAAMES BURTON!\nI am an Award winning Artist/Writer who draws inspiration from a lifetime of Role Playing Games, being raised in the crazy life of my Biker father, and growing up in some chaotic places. Some of that gave me a lot of things to love, a lot of  challenges to deal with, and the strength to survive. \nAs a professional illustrator I have knocked out multiple storyboard projects for independent film, illustrated for The News and Review magazines, Penciled and inked two issues of Vampire of the Lost Highway, I have done multiple covers for Knights of the Dinner Table, covers for Psychosis and I am best known for my artwork on the award winning book Inheritance, that I co created to the tune of 106 beautiful labor intensive pages in four issues.\nWhy am I doing this?\nIn 2007, just four or so weeks after my first child was born, I collapsed at work. When I woke up I was told that  that I was dying of Level four lymphoma. It was caused and I kid you not, by working so much a virus damaged my weakened DNA. \nAfter surviving, we lost my mom, my dad, our home, and my career. It reinforced that I needed to build a legacy for my children beyond just my paycheck. It had to be something to show them that chasing the dream of who you want to be takes hard work, and is built on choices. Telling kids they can dream is a good beginning, but showing them you can bust your ass and  pull it off? That's the best gift I can give them.\nThe reasons I want to build a legacy\nDamage inc. is how I am now building that legacy. Every issue helps me emotionally heal, and every issue is an ode to the people who helped me get through one of the toughest experiences I have ever faced. \nI have spent a life time working on other peoples dreams and now it's time to build mine. Damage inc. style, which means at some point I may jump through a second story window unloading two hand guns at my pursuers.\nWhy Kickstarter?  \nKickstarter is the best way for me to build independently. It is the opportunity to find and speak to people who are building their own projects and allow that creative spirit to fuel my project.\nI have sold books printed POD at cons and met amazing people along the way, but its time to grow.\nI built the budget so that 100% of this is going to the cost of printing, and creating the rewards. With left over copies of the new issues for the Cons! \nWhere are the funds going?\nAs all of the work on this issue was done by yours truly. 100% of the funds are going to printing, reward creation cost, and shipping. \nThere should also be left over issues for trips to Conventions.\nWhat is The Plan?\nMy plan is to use an amazing POD printer for my Kickstarter only work, and offset for the rest once a certain funding point is reached. This should speed up the orders. Being in Logistics as my day Job I am all to familiar with the ports and the hectic way shipping from over seas can cost Fans and Creators their sanity. \nThe first goal is what I need to get this done, but if we can get to the first Stretch Goal of $2800 things change. Then we do Offset printing through Kracken Print and I add rewards!\nThe custom items we have ordered before and have a great turn around. I am confident in the vendors ability to deliver.\nThe Kickstarter will run 06/12/16 to  07/05/16\nAs soon as Kickstarter exchanges the money the print orders will go off to the printers and begin before July is over. The domestic printer has about a month or so turn around time plus shipping so by October all of the books should be in California and ready for me to get my shipping on. I am estimating that everything will be shipped by October/November.\nThere are some great people helping me with the Patches for the Vests and Hoodies their turn around time varies but it should fall into the same time span as the Book shipping. \n    Here are a few pages from the issue, as members of Damage Inc. try to get into the backdoor of a club. \nOkay \"force\" their way in would have been more accurate. Maybe badly force...\n                                                                                           Thank you all so much.\nI grew up looking for heroes, I found them inside stories. Comics, TV, movies all became my way of aspiring to be more then what I was. As an adult I realized after surviving cancer that I had been empty for over a decade and it was because I had turned away from all of it in a quest to build a career. That emptiness gnawed away at me, and my family and I went through some drastic changes after losing my career, health and nest egg. That emptiness continued until the first time Damage Inc. showed up at my doorstep, printed. That day changed me, within a week I sat alone at my first con preying to sell my first book until a 7 foot pirate came and changed my life. He bought my first book with five gold coins, and all of the sudden I was worth someone's gold.\nI want to share that.\nClick here to download the PDF of the first issue of DAMAGE Inc. as a thank you for taking a look at this Kickstarter!\nTo each and every backer: My most sincere gratitude, thank you!\nSo please back the next arc of Damage Inc. it will support me bringing the comedic action supernatural bounty hunting idiots I believe in out to the world.\n    So far we have reached more than 40 backers and are at over 80%  \nSo we have also released:  \nPDF #1 Oxymoron from ComixTribe  \nPDF #1 Shadowhunters from Scattered comics!\nPDF #1 Shaman's Destiny from Big Tree Comics\n4 new Cera Vlog videos!  lost my hero.\nOne more PDF is coming, Im finalizing this at the moment!!!  \nNow I am genuinely excited, this feeling is... GLORIOUS!!!! but were not done yet. For the next milestone of 90% I'm going to add a miniprint. This is a fathers day thing.\nin 2010 my dad, the immortal Pitbull Jim fell for the last time. After a lifetime of being the larger than life unstoppable him the price was paid. \nI lost my hero...\nKira Burton and my father were estranged in some way because s at the time. It would be years before she confronted how she felt. Without realizing it I kickstarted her emotions by adding this image to her poem. The result was a needed breakdown.\nI sold ten of these in the 11x17 size, but because were running this on Fathersday I am going to do a mini print run and add it to the Mini print bundle and any bundle that also gets the prints.\nSo this is my Cera print 8*10 miniprint.\nThere is even more I am working out details on so that I can give my awesome backers as much as possible!\nFor ever ten backers I will ad more Cera Videos!!! My sister Kira is pretty awesome. She put something together doing some video as Cera from Damage Inc. The videos are a vlog of sorts showing Cera dealing with the mental trauma of draining Smudge in issue 1. Our family has mental health issues. There are people close to us fighting those battles and she is brave enough to mix that into them. \n   Draining a traumatized and imprisoned entity can have an effect on one. Some of them are heart breaking, and others are funny as hell. For every ten backers I will release another video. We have Ten. Give it up for my Punk Rock Poet Sister.\nPLAY\n\n   Ok, it is finally time to unleash the Stretchiness. So I thereby declare its time to do some DAMAGE to our stretch goals!\nPLAY\n\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks- \n\nWell the artwork is 100% done for the book. The risks are all based on when the printers handle their business, and me getting things shipped. My day job is in logistics and I manage whole warehouses. So this shouldn't be a problem. However being in logistics as long as I have been I won't lie weird things happen. The good part is I have seen most of them before so I have a plan a and plan b all ready.\n\nDamage Inc.

This Kickstarter project is so I can print my \"Art of Tom Bancroft, Vol. 1\" book and ship it to you.  \nThe Book\nSpecs are: 8.5\"x 12\", 52 pages, hardcover, with glossy, full color pages.\nThis is a simple project, but one I've been wanting to do for some time now.  It will feature mostly full page art illustrations by me and colored by industry professionals Jeremiah Skipper (most of them), but also by Joe Spadaford, me, Chuck Vollmer and Jesse Heagy. With some sketches sprinkled in there also.  Most of the content are fan drawings, commissions, or \"for fun\" drawings I've done over the last couple years.  A few might by favorites of mine from a little farther back than that.  I want this to feel like the \"ultimate\" Tom Bancroft art book.  If you've enjoyed my artwork on Instagram (tombancroft1), DeviantArt, or other places over the years, I think you'll like this book.\nMy background is character design and traditional animation- mostly with Disney Feature Animation.  I worked on many of the classic Disney films of the 90s (Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Aladdin, Tarzan, Mulan, and Brother Bear to name a few) but also worked on Veggietales, ABCMouse.com, and other properties for Marvel, DC, Archie comics and more.  In my 30 year career I've also illustrated many children's books, created comic books and worked on video games too.  You've seen little pieces of me all over the place and probably didn't know it.  Additionally, I've written two perennial art instruction books: \"Creating Characters with Personality\" and \"Character Mentor\" that are the #1 best selling books on the subject of Character Design and are used as text books at art schools around the world.  Much of those artistic influences will be in this book in some way. \nMy goal is to keep this Kickstarter simple: It's about creating this book.  The artwork for the book is finished, the graphic design/page layout is already in process and the printer in China is Global PSD, whom I've worked with before on my Opposite Forces\" graphic novel.  They do excellent work.  I do have some REWARD tiers for artwork that is either already in the book or might be if we reach a later Milestone goal, so that artwork is already completed, so you should have nothing to fear concerning this project not getting finished or being delayed.  \nWHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?  That's easy- about 70-75% goes to paying to get the books printed.  Another 15% goes to shipping supplies for the books (along with additional shipping costs in the Reward tiers themselves).  Lastly, about 8-10% is allocated for Kickstarter fees and about 3% for my graphic designer.  There is NOTHING in this for me besides a few left over books (I hope!) that I can sell at a later date.  IF we go beyond the asking amount, I hope to get some of my work/expenses/time paid for, but I do not expect it.  (My wife would like that though.)  I also hope to put some more of that back into the books by adding Milestone Goals (more pages!) as we go.  \nLet's do this!  \nThank you for considering backing and supporting this Kickstarter!  I need you to help me make this book project a reality.  -Tom Bancroft\nJust some of the artwork that will be INSIDE the book\nJUST ADDED (May 6) :  BY POPULAR REQUEST-  ADD- ONS!\n  EDIT: STRETCH GOALS BEING ADDED!

It's not long until she runs into a young man named Dino who is running from his own ghosts. Will they find the crash site? Will her father be there?\nThis series will be 6 books long when complete. Each book will have a different color cloth binding.\n            How Do Add-Ons Work? (DOMESTIC ONLY PLEASE)\nI'll be using BackerKit to handle Add-Ons (surveys, shipping and more) Once you're a backer you can add to your order (DOMESTIC ONLY) like this:\nAdd up the total of your Add-Ons\nClick the blue \"Manage\" button in the upper right corner.\nAdd the total of your Add-Ons to your pledge amount.\nYou don't need to change the tier you've selected.\nThat's it! After the campaign closes I'll send you a survey through BackerKit and you will be able to easily select all the Add-Ons you wanted.\n          (If you are International and REALLY want to add something to your order, please message me and we can work out the shipping costs)\nI'll be adding more Add-Ons to this section as the campaign grows so please check back for more soon!\nSithrah has been a big experiment with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader. Here are a bunch of double page spreads from book 2.\nMost of my inspiration comes from the comic artists of the 90's when I refined my drawing style. Later I became influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling and have been trying to make comics that have a similar depth and feeling.\nFeel free to read through my archive at Webtoons.com where I post weekly updates. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nSITHRAH 2 will be 160 full color pages in a hardcover book with a cloth binding. 1000 copies will have a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $24.95.\nSITHRAH 2: Propositions (160 pages)\nSITHRAH 1: Kingdom of the Air (96 pages)\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans and won some awards and achievements including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner \n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT) \n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list\nNovember at the latest! In other words, JUST IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS! This will make a great Christmas present for kids and adults. :) So make sure to stock up and add lots and lots of copies as stocking stuffers.\nOkay, let me backup and explain how this will happen...\nSITHRAH 2 will be ready to go to the printer shortly after this Kickstarter ends. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping. This means I'll probably be getting the books around September or October. I have helpers who will help me fulfill all the orders again and so we will try to get everything shipped within a month. (depending on how big this campaign gets)\nI put November as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario but I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by September and I will start shipping them out soon after that.\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish SITHRAH and reMIND. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough, a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print my first book. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of what's important to a publisher. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing now. Thanks to Kickstarter and you guys for helping me I'll keep doing this as long as I can. :)\nMy business plan is to continue printing high quality first-printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see them on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. I plan to print 3500 copies of SITHRAH 2 in China which will reduce my costs big time.\n3500 copies = $14,000\nPlus Shipping, Fees and Taxes +$10,000 (low estimate)\nFUNDING GOAL = $24,000\nBetter yet, if we can blow past this goal then I will be able to unlock other books that are waiting to be printed. :)\nAll domestic orders will get free shipping. \nInternational orders will be charged $20 for shipping 1 book. Canada and Mexico will be charged $13 for 1 book. Multiple book tiers will be charged International shipping according to weight. I know it adds up. Sorry, there's nothing much I can do to lower the shipping costs though.\nAdd Ons are domestic only please. But if you really REALLY REALLY want to add on something to your international order then please message me and we can work out the details of how much you should pledge. :)\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book. And so\u2026 ART CONTEST!!! I'm going to ask for art submissions while this campaign is live to give you a chance to get your art featured in the gallery of Sithrah: Book 2. Send me your amazing artistic version of the Sithrah characters to be printed in the book... FOREVER! I will credit you in the book too. These are the winners that were printed in Sithrah 1:\nThe page dimensions are 6.75 inches (wide) x 10.5 inches (tall). Please make sure all art is 300dpi when scanned. The deadline for submission is the closing of this campaign (May 31st at 5PM MST). Please send all submissions to J@CoffeeTableComics.com for consideration. Once this campaign is over, I will display all the entries for everyone to see and vote on their favorite. Then I'll pick the final winner(s) for the book. :)\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH 2 the best graphic novel series it can be!\n(Now I need to run around my house to shake off this nervous feeling of running another Kickstarter. Breath. Breath. It will be okay. Okay, I'm better now.)\nI can't express in words just how much your support means to me and my family. Thank you again and again.\n- Jason", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my 4th Kickstarter campaign and although I have successfully delivered all the rewards in my last campaigns I am even more prepared and confident that it will be a super smooth campaign. \n\nFor instance, before I would have 80% of my book finished, but this time I have it 100% finished and even 100% of additional books finished that might end up being stretch goals. I have people in place to help me with shipping again. Not to mention I am working full-time on comics now instead of just after I get home from work. I have gone above and beyond to deliver on all my past campaigns even to the point of getting freelance jobs to help finish paying for stretch goals that the campaign didn't fully fund. \n\nThere is always a chance that something could go horribly wrong and delays could happen but I have given myself a few extra months of buffer time if anything goes down.

What if someone was looking back?\n\"The Canals of Earth\" is the story of how Mars sees Earth, running from Martian prehistory to its space age. We begin in Martian prehistory, when Martians looked to the skies and imagined Earth as a goddess. We see some of the Martian mythology about Earth, tied to the invention of writing. We then see Martian science-fiction, in which they imagined aliens in their own image.\nWant to see what alien science fiction looks like? Then \"The Canals of Earth\" is for you!\nWe also see Martian telescopes, and explore the various explanations Martians proposed for what they were seeing. (The story's title, \"The Canals of Earth,\" comes from how we did this to Mars, hypothesizing Martian canals.) Then we witness the Martian space age -- probes that delivered the first views of Earth, and finally the first manned Martian mission to Earth.\nWith 23 color pages of story, this is an insanely fun sci-fi comic, as well as an excavation of our own, Earthbound history of science fiction. It's a trip back to an earlier, wondrous time, when we could imagine all the planets were populated -- now filtered through the mirror of Martian imagination.\nThe Creators\nThe issue is written by Julian Darius, who holds a Ph.D. in English and is a prominent comics scholar who founded Sequart Organization.\nThe issue is illustrated by Mansjur Daman, an Indonesian comics legend known for his dynamic artwork.\nThe issue is colored by Diego Rodriguez, whose beautiful colors have graced such titles as Ballistic.\nThe cover (an homage to the classic 1902 silent movie A Trip to the Moon) is by David A. Frizell, who's done work for Sequart Organization and did the cover to Martian Comics #3.\nBackground\n\"The Canals of Earth\" is a 23-page full-color self-contained comic book. You can enjoy it without any prior knowledge. But it's also Martian Comics #5, and its story is set in the same universe as that series.\nMartian Comics debuted in July 2014, after three years of development and a Kickstarter campaign that helped us complete issue #1. The response to the series has been overwhelming, with readers telling us this was exactly the kind of fun but thoughtful sci-fi comic they'd been waiting for. After getting through issue #2 on our own, we turned to Kickstarter to help complete issue #3 -- a 52-page spectacular featuring seven separate stories! Issue #4 is complete and will be out in May, and it's another oversize issue, running 39 pages of story.\nIssue #5 -- \"The Canals of Earth!\" -- is offers a break from our ongoing story and stands on its own. It's currently being colored and lettered. We've targeted a July release for the public, although we may be able to have it to donors sooner!\nRewards\nOur rewards start at just $3, which gets you a digital copy of the issue. (All our digital offerings are DRM-free.)\nBeginning at $20, you can get the comic book in print, produced exclusively for this Kickstarter. Every copy will be signed and numbered by Julian Darius. Plus, you'll get a digital version of the new issue and all past issues -- which itself is an $18 value!\nWe're also offering two exclusive postcard prints! At $29, you can get one of David A. Frizell's cover to \"The Canals of Earth\" / Martian Comics #5. At $30, you can get one of Darick Robertson's iconic cover to Martian Comics #1. And at $32, you can get both! These all come with the exclusive print edition, plus everything else at earlier levels.\nWe're also offering digital subscriptions. Martian Lit plans to publish two additional issues of Martian Comics (#6-7), plus the inaugural issues of three new series in 2016! If you subscribe, we'll message you with links to the next three or six issues (after Martian Comics #5) that we publish! This way, you can be sure not to miss anything. And if you act fast, you can get an early-bird deal on these!\nWe've also partnered with Sequart Organization to sweeten the deal and get you even more value. So beginning at $15, each reward includes your choice of one of the following Julian Darius books or movies in digital (PDF or MOV) format:\nnon-fiction books from Sequart analyzing comics and movies: (1) Classics on Infinite Earths: The Justice League and DC Crossover Canon, (2) When Manga Came to America: Super-Hero Revisionism in Mai, the Psychic Girl, (3) Voyage in Noise: Warren Ellis and the Demise of Civilization (co-written with Kevin Thurman), (4) The Weirdest Sci-Fi Comic Ever Made: Understanding Jack Kirby's 2001: A Space Odyssey, (5) Revisionism, Radical Experimentation, and Dystopia in Keith Giffen's Legion of Super-Heroes, (6) And the Universe So Big: Understanding Batman: The Killing Joke, and (7) Improving the Foundations: Batman Begins from Comics to Screen.\ndocumentary films from Sequart, which Julian Darius produced: (1) Diagram for Delinquents (directed by Robert A. Emmons, Jr.), (2) Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts (directed by Patrick Meaney), and (3) Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods (directed by Patrick Meaney).\nfiction from Martian Lit: (1) Watching People Burn (a screenplay), (2) Nira/Sussa (a novel), (3) The Slave Factory (a novella), and (4) Shedding Skin (short stories).\nAnd at $75, we'll give you ALL of the above books and movies -- a $60 value! That's like getting the Martian Comics issues, the subscription, the bonus materials, the exclusive print issue, and the exclusive postcard prints for $15!\nThese are just the basic rewards. We've got others too! Check 'em out!\nStretch Goals\nAt $3000, we'll add seven original layout pages to the back of the issue (in both print and digital versions)! These beautiful pages by artist Mansjur Daman changed during production and weren't used in the finished issue, but we want to show them to you!\nAt $5000, everyone who pledged $3 or more will get a digital copy of Martian Comics #6! It's 20 color pages of new story, in which we study the Kennedy administration -- and JFK's assassination -- from the perspective of the Martians. (If he hit this stretch goal, all subscriptions will be adjusted so Martian Comics #6 is free!)\nWe can't do this without you, and we thank you for your support!\nStay in touch with us on Twitter with @MartianLit and @MartianComics, on Facebook with Martian Lit and Martian Comics, and on Google+.

Choose 1 of 2 sets of 4 stickers.\nPurpose of the Campaign:\nThis campaign is to raise funds for the first printing of my original comic book series, Atlas:ORIGINS, compiled into a 194 page trade paperback! This book will include ALL 6 issues in the Atlas:ORIGINS series, ALL 6 Atlas Training Journal entries, a Cover Gallery, PLUS, never before seen sketches and concepts for the next chapter in the Atlas story.\nWhat is the Atlas:ORIGINS series about?\nA New Hero for a New Age. \nWhat if I told you the universe is nothing more than a hologram? What if all matter is actually nothing but empty space? What if your beliefs created your reality?\nWell...I would say, it's all TRUE, but don't take my word for it.\nI've spent many years searching for the answers to life's biggest questions. I can tell you from experience, there is a lot more going on than meets the eye. Atlas is about revealing the hidden secrets of our universe, told through a classic superhero story. \nIn Atlas:ORIGNS we follow the life of Peter Kline who, after a traumatic attack, experiences a total emotional breakdown and blames himself for the death of his family. After many months of self deprecation, Peter find himself drawn to a mysterious temple in the Atlas Mountains of Northern Africa where he meets a cosmic master of light known as Gaya. \nOver the course of a year Gaya and others teach Peter all the secrets of the universe to transform him into the reality bending superhero, Atlas!\nIn this series you will watch Atlas take on many challenges, both mental and physical, as well as confront the eternal evil known as Khaos! Like Gaya, Khoas is a cosmic master of shadow that can possess anyone filled with enough negative energy. His power grows with more and more people giving into his influence. Atlas must discover his ultimate plan for the people of Earth before his power grows beyond control. \nI've written this story to address some of the most profound issues of our time and use it as a tool to reveal some solutions to these problems as well.\nWhat makes this story different?\nI would hope you see, Atlas is not just a typical superhero comic. It's more of a teaching aid for a new generation of human beings to have more information to form their global perspective. For if we are discouraged from asking the most challenging questions, we will never know real truth.\nAnd in the interest of truth, I decided a typical comic book story wasn't enough to convey all that I wanted to reveal. So I decided to create an Atlas Training Journal to go more into detail about everything including, Sacred Geometry, Ancient Knowledge, Meditation, Quantum Physics, Astrology, Numerology, Lucid Dreams, Astra Projection, Electric Universe Theory, Parallel Dimensions, Life & Death, Time & Space, Channelling, Akashic Records, Alien Cultures, and much more!\nThe journals chronicle Peter's time in the temple training to become the hero. It explains how he develops his powers and how profound knowledge can change anyone. Each day will take you further into what it takes to become a superhero, but prove that he could actually fall out of our own sky one day.\nProject Rewards\nScroll down to check out all the great rewards packages I've created to help give back to all of my great supporters, like you!

Williams\" - Creator at Large - 3/24/16\nWHO WE ARE:\nComicker LLC was founded in 2014 by Saori Adams & Sean E. Williams when we surveyed the comics scene and realized we wanted to make the most creator-friendly comics publisher possible.  What did this mean?  It meant a flexible schedule, because most creators have day jobs or other work-for-hire comics series they're working on.  It meant good terms for creators, because we're creators ourselves and we look out for our own.  It meant a variety of platforms, because you have to go to where the readers already are.  And it meant digital-first, because we were doing it ourselves, and we were paying for everything out of pocket.\nWe launched on February 26th, 2015 with our Comicker Digital imprint, putting out comics online, on comiXology, and on DriveThruComics.  By the end of the year, we'd partnered with The Horizon Factory and launched our free Comicker Digital iOS app (the launch of which was covered by Comicosity), and added Kindle to our distribution line-up.  We also have a free weekly newsletter!\nBy being truly creator-friendly, we saw the results immediately in the form of diversity.  A year after launching, we now have ten series in production, and are looking at submissions regularly.  We don't have a house style.  Half our creators are women or persons of color.  Almost all of our series have women and/or persons of color as protagonists.  If you're looking for something new, refreshing, and unique, we've got a series for you.\nNow, we're looking to make the next big step: bringing the Comicker Digital series to print, under our Comicker Press imprint. \nAnd in case you were wondering, we're all Kickstarter users. Click on through to see the profiles of Comicker LLC co-founder Sean E. Williams, co-founder Saori Adams, and LOST ANGELS's David Accampo and Chris Anderson. Between us, we've backed over 70 projects! Add in Sean E. Williams's micro-campaign \"The Treachery of Kitties\" and David Accampo's \"Sparrow & Crowe\" we're full-on Kickstarter veterans.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWhile Comicker Digital is covering its own costs currently, it's not making enough to fund Comicker Press just yet.  That's why we're bringing these books to print via Kickstarter: to get them made as quickly as possible.  As many creators know, you make as much (if not more) money selling your books at conventions as you do in royalties.  This campaign is timed so that the books will go to the printer as soon as the campaign ends, allowing us to get them to you and the creators in time for this convention season.  Barring any unforeseen shipping delays (such as the Port of Long Beach strike last year), we'll have the books in hand in June - in time for Denver Comic Con.  \nWith this Kickstarter, we're building a solid financial foundation for Comicker Press to bring future books to print as well!\nCOST BREAKDOWN:\nThe funds for this campaign break down as such:\nPrinting and Shipping Costs: 68.2%\nCreator Royalties: 11.2%\nKickstarter and Financial Fees: 10%\nContingency: 7.4%\nAdditional Kickstarter Rewards: 3.2%\nAs a creator-owned publisher, we focus on doing what's right by the creators we work with. That's why all the creators are receiving the same royalties for every sale via this Kickstarter as they would if these books were sold through traditional retailers. And all profits on the add-ons below are being split 50/50 as well.\nADD-ONS:\nHow do you add an Add-On?

After more than four years and many hours of hard work and dollars spent on art, advertising and people-fuel, the only thing left is to make final edits to the text, format the pages for press, and get these things printed and shipped.\nWhen all is said and done, Handicape will be printed in a 7\"x10\" hardbound book with full color pages and some extra content. Right now, it looks like it will be about 90 pages, but I'll have a final number once the final edit is done, and the extra content has been finalized.\nThe Creators\nChad. That's me. I've been writing, producing and publishing comics and graphic novels for about five years now through my independent publisher Red Tempest Media. You should check those out.\nHandicape is the first full graphic novel that I've written, and I'm super pumped to see it finally come out.\nThe illustration is by the hand of the talented Dante Ginevra (see more of his art below, with some preview pages of Handicape.). I've had the opportunity to work with Dante over the last few years on Handicape as well as some smaller comic projects, and it's been a great experience the whole way.\nThe Cover Image\nThe Backstory\nSeveral years ago, I was taking a summer van ride with a friend to see the latest superhero movie. I was driving and my friend, in a wheelchair, rode passenger side. As the conversation wandered through topics of movies and heroes, an image and a single word came to mind. The image was one of a guy in a wheelchair with a superhero\u2019s cape. The word: Handicape.\nIt was more than a year later, after finishing work on The Lost City, Chico X and other Red Tempest comics, and that image and word kept coming to mind. Handicape. But what sort of hero would he be?\nOver the years, I continued working on Handicape: drawing the logo and some concept sketches, and piecing together the story. Then, in late 2012, those pieces fell into place. A superhero in a wheelchair, whose power was controlling anything with electricity\u2014specifically, he would be a computer hacker.\nThe Story\n(Note: The best way to see what Handicape is all about is to read it for free online at www.handicapehero.com. Woohoo!)\nIn 2005, three high school friends (Ethan, Simon and Andrew) are ready to embrace the new adventures of life after school.\nBut only weeks before graduation, a string of mysterious events turns their plans to dust. Andrew gets expelled for breaking-and-entering (but he's sure there's a conspiracy against him). Simon gets news that he's suddenly being sent to private tutoring in England. And Ethan is left alone.\nHigh School Friends\n2011. Six years later, the mysterious events from high school come around in an unexpected way to bring the three back together. Small town corruption may not be as small as it seems. They could hardly know they are in the middle of a struggle for power that has been going on for over five-hundred years.\nOnce friends and now almost strangers, a test of mind and body and ultimately, trust, will be the best chance of restoring their friendship.\nThe Rewards\nCheck out the reward tiers that include:\nThe Hardback Handicape Graphic Novel\nHandicape Digital Download\nHandicape T-Shirt\nHandicape Poster\nHandicape Video Game*\nStickers\nMagnets\nAnd more...\nHandicape Rewards\n *The Handicape Video Game is a mini-game for Mac or PC.

Go to www.skyheartcomic.com to stay up to date on the project!\nI'm Jake Parker, and I'm making SkyHeart Book I: The Star Seed. \nSkyHeart is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you liked Miyazaki's Nausicaa, Star Wars, Tokien's The Hobbit, and Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of SkyHeart. \nSkyHeart will be a 7.5 x 10 inch 100+ page book that comes in both soft and hard cover editions. \nThe book is being written and drawn by me and is scheduled to be finished in May of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016.\nFor years I've been developing this project on the side, but it was so big, and so involved that it scared me! I felt I wasn't ready to create this book. \nAfter years working in animation as a concept artist (Horton Hears a Who, Rio, Epic) and comics (Flight, Missile Mouse, Rocket Raccoon) my skills as an artist and storyteller got better. I feel like I'm finally at a level now where I can take on a project like this and do it justice.\nSo...I'm going for it!\nThe Idea for SkyHeart was planted in my imagination over 15 years ago while on a road trip though the Arizona desert. I imagined the desert floor vanishing, leaving only an abyss of clouds with the rock formations suspended above them in the air.\nFrom that seed of an idea grew an entire world of characters and their struggles, with mythologies, cities, and technology fleshing out the rest of this universe.\nI love classic tales of adventure, of good versus evil, and struggles with real consequences. Which is why I look to films like Star Wars, Nausicaa, Castle in the Sky, and Indiana Jones, and books like the Hobbit for inspiration. Just because a story is all-ages, doesn't mean I can't enjoy it as much as my kids do!\nSkyHeart takes place on Airth, a world literally torn apart by a pre-historic war between the gods who created it. That war left the planet divided into 4 realms:\nThe Stratos, a chain of islands high in the sky where the Sylph people live.\nThe Rimland, a massive ring of continents and giant islands where most of the inhabitants of Airth live. Wake, our main protagonist, lives here.\nThe Abyss, a stretch of atmosphere filled with incredible cloud formations and tiny floating islands. Limberg and Grimm are from here. \nThe Core, an ocean covered rocky sphere filled with colossal caves. The Tengru, monsters and beasts, and the Dark Lord live down here.\nIn that great ancient war, the beings of Light were able to defeat the Shadows and banish them to the core, but not without a great cost. Losing most of their godly energy, they left Airth to search the universe for more power. Their children stayed to protect what was left of Airth from the evil trapped in the core. \nThousands of years later these pre-historic events have become myth, and the inhabitants of Airth are consumed with their own wars for power. \nHowever, deep in the core, the Shadows have not forgotten, and have begun sending their agents to the surface to harvest the people of their life force. Once enough of this power has been taken the Shadows will rise again to destroy the rest of Airth and start a new world.\nWake and his crew set off to find the Star Seed with the hopes of both saving Wake's mother, and the world of Airth. That is, if they can beat Malsang and his sinister tengru to it's secret location. \nHow Do Add Ons Work?\nI'll be using Backer Kit to handle rewards and add-ons.

I've got a great youtube video here that outlines where all this money is going and how I arrived at this number. Basically, half the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped. \nHere's a breakdown of where the funds are going:\nPrinting: $12,000 This covers getting the books printed and shipped to my house. (15.4%)\nProduction: $42,000 This covers my time writing and drawing the book, paying a colorist, editor, and building the book and getting it ready for print. (53.8%)\nFees: $8000 This covers Backer Kit, Kickstarter and Amazon fees. (9%)\nShipping: $16,000 This covers packing up the books and shipping charges. I will be shipping the books PRIORITY MAIL to US backers to ensure the safe delivery of each package. International orders will all be sent FIRST CLASS. Orders will be packed in a bubble wrap sleeve, then put into heavy duty cardboard case. I talk all about how I ship things in this video. (23.4%)\nThis book will be produced in the spring and summer of 2016 and will be delivered to backers in September of that same year.

I was stuck there 9 years ago, and I'd lost hope. Then I scraped and dug my way out of it, and I am proof that change is possible.\nThis book will help you make any change:\nExercise\nEating healthy\nGetting out of debt\nOvercoming procrastination\nLosing weight\nDealing with frustrations & stress\nImproving relationships\nSimplifying & decluttering\nMeditating and being mindful\nDealing with major life changes\nAnd much more\nThis book starts about being about habit change, but it's much more ... it's about how to live, and how to master the process of change. It's about dealing with major life changes, and small frustrating ones too.\nIn the process of creating a small change in your life, by following the steps in this book ... you'll start to develop core Zen skills I've learned from my studies, to find peace, contentment, and the ability to adjust to situations as they change.\nIn practicing these skills, you begin to truly understand them. And in understanding these skills, you'll start to overcome your struggles.\nThis is a volume of condensed learning about the process of change, and the nature of our minds. And a how-to on how to change your habits and overcome procrastination.\nMy Story\nIt started with my struggle with change \u2014 in 2005, I was an overweight, sedentary, broke, deeply-in-debt, junk-food-eating smoker surrounded by clutter and no time for my wife or kids. I was stuck, desperate, overwhelmed, with no idea how to get out.\nBut then I learned the principles of change, by doing a ton of research, studying those who were successful at change, and making some small changes. One at a time. Through these experiments, I learned things that help with any change.\nOver the next few years, I changed everything ... one step at a time:\nQuit smoking\nStarted running, ran several marathons & a 50-mile ultramarathon\nStarted eating healthier, eventually became vegan\nLost 60 lbs.\nSimplified and got rid of clutter\nGot out of debt\nStarted a successful blog, quit my day job\nOvercame procrastination, wrote numerous books\nFound time for my health, family, writing, reading\nAnd much more\nSince then I've helped tens of thousands of struggling people change their lives through habit change. I've learned what works, and what doesn't, and honed my habit method.\nThe Heart of Any Problem\nGoing deeper than the mechanics of habit change, this book will teach you how to get at the heart of any problem you face in life. Any struggle you're facing: procrastination, unhappiness with ourselves, anger with others, stress and worry, dealing with loss or illness.\nWhat is the heart of any struggle? It's attachment to our ideals. Attachment to comfort and the way we'd like things, attachment to how we think people should act, how we should act, how things should go.\nWe all face this problem, and we can't avoid having ideals. These ideals can be useful, but when we become too tightly attached to them, we create problems for ourselves: frustration, irritation, anger, disappointment, stress, worry.\nThis stops us from making habit changes, and makes dealing with other people and major changes in our lives much more difficult.\nBy getting to the heart of your struggles, you will find the way to overcome them.\nChange yourself, change the world\nWhen you back this project, it's not just to get a copy of my book. I'd like you to be a part of a movement, and backing this says that you think this is a worthy movement.\nWhat movement? My hope is that this book will help you change your life \u2014 to help you change habits, become more focused, procrastinate less, and find peace.\nAnd if you can change yourself, you've changed a small part of the world.\nBy changing ourselves, we become the example of change for others around us.\nWe become inspiration for further change, and that spreads into the world.\nMy deepest wish is for you to use this book and create change in yourself, and everyone around you.\nIf this happens, we've succeeded.\nTestimonials\nAs I wrote this book, I tested it out on a small group of alpha testers who implemented it and gave me feedback. I called them the Change Labs group, and they were instrumental in shaping this book.\n\"Leo has distilled a ton of actionable wisdom into the Zen Habits book and I couldn't recommend it enough. Change Labs, a program to alpha test the tools and processes in the book, was one of the most memorable things I've done this year and I can't wait to read it!\" \n-Alyson Madrigan\n---\n\"The Change Labs concept has brought fundamental changes to my life. I struggled with severe procrastination in my illustration work which I can say I have overcome during this year. Working both on the fundamentals (underlying fears) both on habits (making 20 min drawing an everyday priority) have lifted me to a different level. I have just finished a 240 page children's story book in a quality and time frame I never dreamed I was able to. This was a great proof for me.\n\"I also love the simplicity of his concepts. No bullshit, just pure inspiration and actions.\"\n- Cecilia Simonyi\n---\n\"Working with Leo challenged some deeply rooted beliefs about how to lead a fulfilling life. \n\"It was like having a eureka moment; a paradigm shift occurred.\n\"You come out with new ways of thinking and a new arsenal of tools to deal with difficulties.\"\n- Kavi Thancanamootoo\n---\n\"Learning new habits with Leo was the best thing that happened to me in a very long time.

If you guys can help me get to a higher funding figure, this will allow me to:\nPrint a 2nd, less-limited edition to sell on Amazon and elsewhere\nGet paid (a little more) for some of my own time\nSee that this is a viable model for publishing future books\nShow the world that this topic is important\nSo don't stop helping this project if we hit the minimum!\nBONUS: If we get to higher than the goal, I promise to start making videos to send out to all backers \u2014 videos about my writing routine, my workouts, how I cook my healthy meals, parenting, etc. And one of my beautiful wife and kids.

They'll last about an hour, and I'll schedule them in December & January, so you can pick whatever date/time works best for your schedule. These webinars are more intimate than the webinar above.\n3-month coaching & private event: At the $1,500 level, I'm taking on 15 people in a small-group coaching program that will last from January through March, and end in a private event in San Francisco. The coaching will be on habits and dealing with life changes and other struggles \u2014 basically, what I cover in the book \u2014 and you can ask me questions and work with the other people in the program, getting accountability and support. The event will be with me, and will last an entire weekend in April, and will include seminars and group activities and guest speakers and tea and food and maybe some meditation. It'll be fun! You'll need to pay your own way to get there, and your own accommodations. Read more about the coaching program & event.\nSpeak at your event: At the top level, I'll give a talk at your conference or private event. I almost never give talks, so this is a pretty exclusive bonus. I'll speak for up to an hour, on a topic we agree upon, and can be available for Q&A after or whatever else you like (within reason).

When I was six we moved to Camp Lejeune, the friends that greeted me were Captain America and Iron Man. Their friendship only cost 40 cents.  When we moved to Okinawa, Japan, the first friends to greet me were Superman and Batman. I met up with them in World's Finest number 273 that I bought for $1 at the U.S.O.\nNot only did my love for comics grow, but comics instilled in me a love of drawing and of storytelling. Making comics with other another military brat in high school is what developed skills needed to work as a professional illustrator. When I joined the Marines, my drawing skills were put to use for, among other things, creating the unit logos for the units I served in.\nAfter I got out of the Marines, friends kept asking me to make logos for their units, and here it is nearly 20 years after I finished with my active duty service, I'm still doing it. Since the first unit logo I did in 1992, I've worked on over 2000 unit logos for platoons, companies, battalions and squadrons all across the world.\nAll this exposure to veterans of all sorts has given me a unique vantage point and is getting written into the DNA of Space Corps. While Space Corps is a work of science fiction, it contains more than a little truth, written with the utmost respect for those who serve.\nWe need your help!\nSo we've made the comic and we've even printed a few on demand. On demand printing is expensive on a per issue basis, so we need to do a large print run to bring the unit cost down. That's where we need your help. With your support on Kickstarter we can finally do a print run large enough to bring Space Corps into the world of print in a big way.\n...and for that, we will be grateful.  To show our appreciation we're coming up with some cool rewards. We want the people that support us now to get the coolest rewards we can think of. Keep reading to see what we have in mind.\nRewards\nLook on the right for a complete list of rewards (including getting written into a Space Corps comic), but here are some highlights:\n Follow me on Twitter to see the sketch covers as they are completed:\nGannonB\nI really try to bring it on these. I want them all to be special. I'm only guaranteeing that I'll do nine for the Kickstarter, so if you want to get one, don't hesitate!\nI don't part with original pages easily, but if I'm going to, I want the pages to go to those who are helping us now when we need it most.\n If the art from #0 doesn't fit into your budget, but you want something unique, I'll be doing up to 100 original mini-sketches along with two printed books at the $25 tier. You pick the character, and I draw it.\nMore on Making Comics\nSpace Corps is an ongoing webcomic that we anticipate we'll be working on for years to come. There are so many stories we want to tell. You can check it out at:\nSpaceCorpsComic.com\nIn addition to Space Corps, I like to do parody comics with friends, short story comics, and even a little fan fiction comics. The art isn't polished in the way Space Corps is, but it's fun. The Star Wars parody and the Batman parody, in particular, crack me up.\nZombieLadComic.com\nIf you like our comics, and want to do some comics yourself, I'd recommend joining the Comics Experience workshop. Bryan, Joey and I are all members and I'm the art moderator of the community.  If you like Space Corps, the community here deserves a lot of the credit:\nComics Experience\nTHANK YOU!\nThis means a lot to us. We love bringing these stories into the world, and if you help us, then you will be a part of the team making this happen. Bringing art into the world is no small thing. For your help we will be forever grateful.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done everything we can to minimize the risk.

The original graphic novel is published online at wormworldsaga.com. In 2012 the German publisher Tokyopop started to publish a German book edition of The Wormworld Saga and collected the first three chapters in a glorious hardcover book.\nThe current German edition of the first Wormworld Saga book\nThe German book already had a second edition and this January a French version of the book was published by the well-established Belgian publisher Dupuis. There really is no reason why we shouldn't find a publishing partner for an English edition of this book in the United States. Especially if you take into account that 70% of the visitors of the Wormworld Saga website are located in countries where English is the native language and 50% are actually living in the U.S. Frankly, of all languages, an English edition should have been the very first one to be published. \nHowever, it turns out that it's not that easy to bring a European graphic novel to the North American market and since the traditional publishing world didn't give this book a chance we've decided to have this crowdfunding campaign. \nPLAN B - because everyone should have one!\nThis project is based on the page layout that Tokyopop created for the German edition and should this campaign succeed, the printing of the English edition will also be supervised by Tokyopop in Germany. It's interesting to note that publishers normally don't print foreign language editions. Printing the books isn't even the problem. Distributing them is. Publishers typically don't have strong connections to distributors in foreign countries and since bringing the printed books into the bookstores is the critical part in selling books the traditional way, most publishers only do business in their home country and license their books to foreign publishers if they want to bring it to foreign markets.\nHowever, in this case we don't have to worry about distribution because we will do our business directly with you, the reader. Through this kickstarter campaign we will find out if there is a demand for an English book edition of The Wormworld Saga and should this be the case, it will be our pleasure to meet it without any middlemen.\nOUR GOAL - which we can't reach without you!\nOur goal is to produce a moderate print run of an English edition of the first Wormworld Saga book. Our funding goal covers the printing costs, postage and kickstarter fees. It's simple as that. To thank you for your support we have a nice set of rewards.\nREWARDS - because you deserve them!\nThe central reward of this campaign is the book. We'd love to see it in as many hands as possible and therefore we've tried to make it extra affordable. Since this book is going to be produced in Germany we expect to ship practically all books via international mail. Therefore we have incorporated a flat shipping fee into the price of $25 for the book. No matter where you are located in the world, you don't have to worry about additional shipping fees AT ALL. \nThe book is 5.91\u2033 x 9.25\u2033 (15 x 23,5cm), hardcover with varnished logo, 128 pages, and contains the first three chapters of The Wormworld Saga, a sketchbook section, a fan art gallery*, and a 'Making Of'-article about the history of the project. All books in this campaign are signed and stamped with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp.\n* We will actually try to get ALL NEW fan art from international artists for this edition. If you are an artist and want to contribute to the fan art gallery, keep an eye out for our call for submissions!\nYou can also get a small sketch and a personal dedication in your book. Since the blank first page is covered with the stamp and the signature, these will go on the last page of the book.\nIf you want to make your book extra special, you can get these three prints from my favorite panel artwork of each chapter in the book. The prints are 5.91\" x 7.87\" (15 x 20cm) on strong 230g/m\u00b2 paper with rounded corners and they are signed and stamped with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp.\nBecause these are very popular Wormworld Saga items we're offering an exclusive edition of the large collector's prints of The Journey Begins, Welcome To The Wormworld, and Trapped! . The prints are 27,6\" x 19,7\" (70 x 50cm) on strong 230g/m\u00b2 paper, signed, dated, and come with a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp. You can get a personal dedication on it, too.\nThe three collector's prints are also available as a bundle in THE PRINT MANIAC tier at $500. This reward will also come with three signed posters:\nThe three posters \"Captain Orion\", \"Fireflowers\" and \"The Course of Things\"\nAnd if you're willing to invest an additional $100 you can add some nice merchandize to the package. The MERCH MANIAC tier at $600 comes with all the prints, a wooden sword replica, a plush, and a button set. Here's a video:\nAs my illustration workflow is 100% digital these days, I practically don't draw on paper anymore. But you know, it's like riding a bike and whenever there is an occasion for it, I enjoy doing pencil drawings for my most dedicated fans. The pencil drawings are 5.91\" x 7.87\" (15x20cm) with rounded edges on heavy drawing paper. The drawing incorporates a kickstarter exclusive blue Wormseal stamp, is signed and dated and you can get a personal dedication on it. These are rare items. Really, you don't often have the chance to get one of these!\nCUSTOM REWARDS - because you know exactly what you want!\nIf none of the listed rewards exactly fits your needs - maybe you want a specific number of books, or just a very specific mix of the available items - you can choose the reward tier THE INDIVIDUALIST at $25 and combine your own custom reward. Take any combination of items that you find in the chart below and calculate the total sum of your custom reward. Then edit the amount of your pledge to fit this sum and you're ready to go. When the campaign ends, we will send around a survey in which we will ask you of which items your custom reward consists and that's it. Please note that kickstarter limits the number of items that we can send out in bulk. So, please don't choose more than 10 pieces of a specific item. Your total number of items can be more than 10 pieces though.\nAll Custom rewards - even those that don't include books - come with at least one set of all available freebies. If your custom reward contains more than one book each of the books will come with all available Freebies. \nFor custom rewards it's hard to optimize shipping fees. The shipping costs are incorporated into the pricing of the individual items but the more items you combine the more likely it is that we can save shipping costs if we send out everything in one big package. In cases where we can save a substancial amount of shipping costs we will compensate this with additional items that we will put into your package.\nDo you have an idea for a completely new item that you'd like to have but don't find in this list? Write it in the comments and if your idea isn't too crazy it's very likely that I will add it to the list.\nFREEBIES - because everyone loves them!\nWe appreciate any contribution to this campaign, be it ever so small. Therefore every backer will receive a PDF containing the Jonas, Raya and Loki papertoys. You will have to print out the PDF and assemble them yourself though. Fortunately this is a lot of fun!\nPHYSICAL FREEBIES - because what's in your hand matters!\nThe following items will be given away as freebies to all backers that receive a physical reward ($25 and above). You know how it works: should we reach beyond our funding goal, the list of freebies is likely to expand as we hopefully hit many different stretch goals.\nFor the beginning we'll put this cool metallic Wormseal sticker into all packages. It's 3.15\" (8cm) in diameter and looks especially cool on dark surfaces. I personally love to put these on black Moleskine notebooks. It looks awesome!\nA set of three postcards with the covers of the chapters that are featured in the book. These postcards are strictly limited to this campaign and will never be produced again. The idea is, to have all future books equipped with chapter postcards so that you can gather a nice collection of them!\nThis giant magnetic button is 3.1 inches (7,9cm) in diameter and sticks to any magnetic metal surface. It simply looks awesome anywhere you put it.\nThe \"Trusted Blade\" bookmark is the ideal companion to the book. Every bookmark will be signed with a silver marker.\nThis dust jacket is perfect for all Deluxe Editions because that way you don't have to let go of the nice cover artwork if you upgrade to the Deluxe Edition. And for the standard hardcover books it also doesn't hurt to get them some extra protection.\nThe special thing here is that the mockup above shows the first map of the Wormworld which now is over 7 years old. I really don't like to officially use this map any longer and that's why the map we are talking about here will be a brand new map that I will illustrate completely from scratch.\nBONUS ITEMS - because ... Bonus!\nEvery backer (down to the $1 rewards) will receive the Wallpaper Set:\nI will create a collection of info and images about Captain Orion and you'll receive it in form of The Captain Orion Files PDF (for all $10 rewards and above). The PDF will include all major Captain Orion artworks, editorial text and a lot of sketches and studies of this character. It will also include a Captain Orion comic splashpage that was created as a demo for a videotraining. This page will be translated in English (it currently is lettered in German):\nThe Upgraded Map (for all $25 rewards and above) will be printed on both sides and on the back there will be a list of all backers. I will sign the map with a silver marker and this special version of the map will be limited to this campaign:\nLOCKED FREEBIES - let's free them!\nAll freebies have been unlocked! You're AWESOME!\nTHANK YOU! - which can't be said often enough!\nNo, really! Thank you for your interest in our kickstarter campaign and we hope for your support!\nGreetings, \nDaniel Lieske", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production and printing of the books will be done by Tokyopop.

There are good reasons why there hasn't been a new kickstarter campaign yet and I'd now like to address these in all appropriate detail.  \nIn November 2015, actually right at the time when I was packing the Volume 2 books at the office of my publisher, I've received an email from a major US book publisher who wanted to publish the English book edition of the Wormworld Saga. Of course everyone was happy about this inquiry because this has always been the goal - finding a proper publisher for the English Wormworld Saga books. Negotiations started and everything looked just fine. As soon as I've received the first version of the contract, the editor who had initiated the negotiations, quit his job.

My first book was called reMIND which took seven years to complete. Now I have been working on a brand new story called SITHRAH.\nWhat is SITHRAH?\nSITHRAH is an all-age sci-fi about a seven year old girl who ends up alone when her plane crashes in a unfamiliar land. Trying to locate her missing father, she starts seeing an invisible creature that has been following her. This book will be the first in a series of 5 or 6 books depending on how long it takes me to tell the story. :)\nI was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I will continue to post new pages online until the full story is complete.\nAs you can see I'm experimenting with the comic format by mixing subtle prose with the comic panels. My hope is to blur the lines between comics, children's books, and novels without making it jarring for the reader.\nBook Specs.\nSITHRAH will be 96 full color pages in a hardcover book. 1000 copies will include a signed and numbered bookplate. The interior pages will be printed on thick, high quality paper printed with the same care and attention to detail that I put into reMIND Volume 1 and 2. The retail price will be $19.95.\nJust so you know some history of my books: The first printing of my first book, reMIND, was printed in spring of 2011 with 2500 copies that sold out in about 6 months. It got much praise from fans on Amazon and has won some awards and achievements during and after the production including:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\n2012 Selected for Arkansas State Reading list.\nPublication Date\nSITHRAH will be ready to go to the printer in October 2014 if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after that.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish reMIND and SITHRAH. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible. Then in 2012 I launched a second campaign for reMIND 2 and it raised a whopping $107,500! Although it was a crazy big campaign delivering so many books, it all worked out. Better yet, I now have a distributor for my books which was one of the biggest problems to overcome with self-publishing.\nThe funny thing is now that I have beautiful books published I am approached by big publishers like I had dreamed about. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. With SITHRAH I have decided that my goal is to print 4000 copies for the first printing. This will further reduce the printing costs and give me more stock so I don't sell out in 6 months like I did with reMIND. Wait, what am I saying. I'd love to sell out in 6 months! :)\nAnyway, so my printer quote is $11,500 for 4000 hardcover copies. In my last campaign I had crazy shipping costs, taxes and unexpected fees and so I'm trying to add some of these fees to the campaign funding goal. If I can raise over $17,000 I will be in a great spot to cover most of the expense of Sithrah Book 1. As usual, I'm always adding my own money to the mix and I will do the same with this one to make sure the book turns out amazing.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nThanks for your support in making SITHRAH the best graphic novel set it can be!\nTHANK YOU ONE MILLION TIMES!\n- Jason\nArt Submission:\nJust like my past publications, I want to include some guest art in the back of the printed book.

CARL PREDICTS CROWDFUNDING\nUPDATE #2: NEW REWARD TIERS, GET ANIMATED, 50K!\nUPDATE #1: HELP MAKE CARL'S DREAM A REALITY!\n*****\nORIGINAL STORY:\nIn 1985, the animated series known as Robotech hit the airwaves in the United States and became an overnight sensation. Combining fast-paced giant robot action with some genuinely mature drama, it was a breath of fresh air for many children who had gotten tired of the usual cartoons on TV at the time. For many fans, it was their first exposure to Japanese anime, and is often credited with starting the anime industry in the US. It spawned over twenty novels, hundreds of comics, video games and dozens of home video releases all over the world.\nCarl Macek, the producer of Robotech, was recently working with Harmony Gold on Robotech: Academy. This new series set in the Robotech universe follows several new cadets in their adventures around the universe. We are reaching out to our fans to make this a reality!\n Robotech Academy occurs concurrently with the unfinished Sentinels storyline of the Robotech saga. By this time, the Earth has been ravaged by decades of interplanetary war. \nThe Robotech Expeditionary Force, commanded by Admiral Rick Hunter aboard the SDF-3, has departed for the homeward of the Robotech Masters, to draw the battle away from Earth. \nThe officers of the Expeditionary Force have placed their greatest treasures, their children, in the Robotech Academy. Based on a moon in orbit around Mars, the academy was created as a safe haven for these young cadets. \nHowever, as the Academy also functions as a research center for advanced Robotechnology, it becomes an inviting target. The story focuses on a fresh class of young characters, including child prodigy Wally, and the swashbuckling teen pilot Lindsay, who is an old rival and associate of Jack Baker. \nTheir lives are turned upside down when the Academy is attacked by alien fanatics who call themselves the Children of Zor, trying to reclaim the lost secrets of Robotechnology, which they believe to be rightfully theirs.  Unbeknownst to the new class, this treasure trove of Robotechnology just happens to be hidden right under everybody's noses throughout the Academy, in places such as the campus museum. \nIn an unexpected maneuver that saves the lives of the young student body, an experimental spacefold drive is activated, which suddenly transports the cadets away from the battle. \nHowever, they end up in an uncharted, distant region of the galaxy, and their supply of \"protoculture\" which is used to power the spacefold drive, is extremely limited. \nValuable clues to lead them out of their predicament have been left behind by none other than the originator of Robotechnology itself, Zor. They discover the path that Zor's ship once had taken before it eventually crashed on Planet Earth. This next generation of heroes must rise to the challenge, facing mysterious aliens and making difficult choices as they rely on their wits. They have to scavenge prototype mecha hidden across the campus and journey past a series of alien worlds to find their way back home, or at least rendezvous with the Robotech Expeditionary Force.\nAnd you'll also see familiar faces from the Robotech leadership, such as Rolf Emerson, Anatole Leonard, Doctor Lang, and... \nThe Robotech Academy Kickstarter will allow us to gauge how much of a new Robotech series we could actually produce based on Carl's original premise. We are setting our initial goal at $500,000 which will allow us to create an entire 24 minute pilot episode. This will help us cover character design, mecha design, 3D modeling, 3D animation, 2D animation, screenwriting, sound engineering, music composition, casting, voice acting and recording. This will also afford us a foundation on which to build future episodes.\nThanks to new technological advances, we're able to get our fans involved in ways Carl had only dreamed about before. Back in the 90's Carl Macek mused that the internet could be used to raise funds for new shows. Now with Kickstarter we're able to offer rewards such as attending a premiere of Robotech Academy, attending recording sessions with the actors, and even having your likeness animated and appear in the final footage! For anyone who wanted to be an anime character, now's your chance!\n UPDATE: WE HAVE ADD-ONS!\nWe're looking forward to working on Robotech Academy with contributions from you, our fans!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any production, we are assuming the usual risks with a Kickstarter project like this.

Pier will be doing 15 sketches and we will be collecting some here and there from our crew including Amanda Conner and Jimmy. Some will be of scenes and characters in the book, some will be really really random, but fun! \n$50 Grand level: In the non digital pledges, we will be giving everyone a print of the AMANDA CONNER special limited cover.

Read on\u2026\nWrap around cover by Pier Brito\nPREMISE: After a rogue meteor impacts our moon, forcing it off its regular orbit, the oceans rise dramatically, consuming most of the planet\u2019s surface. The United States is under water, with the exception of its last major metropolis: Denver, Colorado. This is not the horrible post-apocalypse world we are used to. It is a showcase of mankind\u2019s greatest achievements and ability to survive, but as always, there needs to be control and regulation in a city that can only house and feed a specific number of citizens. There are those outside this great city who would do just about anything to get in. That is where our main character MAX FLYNN comes in.\nMax is one of many armed Coast Border Guards [CBG] who protects and processes everything coming into and leaving DENVER. He lives with his new wife, Betty, and his teenage daughter from a previous marriage, Trinity. On the job, Max has command of his two partners, Jimmy DePaul and Jane Nelson. Their job is to route everything and everyone that enters the city from the waterways, inclusive of new citizens seeking refuge in DENVER. In this futuristic world, masses of people are wandering the earth\u2019s waterways in hopes of gaining admission to some of the few cities left, and DENVER is no different. They keep a constant population count by monitoring every time a citizen of DENVER dies; an open space is available for either a birth or granting an outsider citizenship in DENVER. This person would have to be sponsored by an active resident.\nUnfortunately there are those who would do just about anything to gain entry into DENVER. The burden of stopping this falls upon Max and the CBG. Our story is about a group that goes to such extremes, and Max is forced to go against everything he has ever learned and been trained for.\nDENVER is a story about extortion, betrayal, and the lengths a person will go to, to protect the ones they love. DENVER was born out of a love for adult sci-fi stories, drawing its inspiration from films like BLADE RUNNER, SOYLENT GREEN, and ROAD WARRIOR, and a lifetime of reading HEAVY METAL MAGAZINE\u2014as well as being brought up having hope in mankind.\n             THE SOUNDTRACK : \nThe soundtrack. Yes, we have added an actual soundtrack to complete the experience of the graphic novel, written and composed by Hans Karl. A sample runs with the video above and this soundtrack was written based on the Denver graphic novel.\nTo listen to a track from the Denver soundtrack, go to: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdEpiQGfd7w\n Hans Karl is a film and multimedia composer. His music can be heard in documentaries, animated shorts, indie film, commercial jingles and various other creative media projects. In addition to his scoring work, he has also released several albums in various music genres. Currently, he has been creating a collection of original music library tracks. He resides in Los Angeles.

Anything cool (that the world could most likely live without) is right up our alley!\nWe\u2019re reaching out to the Kickstarter community to help back our first Patent Pending Barware item, \"Se\u00f1or Shaker.\" What is Se\u00f1or Shaker? Well, it's a Margarita Shaker... with a Mustache!\nI came up with the concept while having dinner with my close friend Jon Hudson. We were enjoying Mexican Food and Margaritas, just kicking around ideas and brainstorming a bit. When I looked back at the bar, I noticed a cocktail shaker and it hit me like a Cadillac Margarita! Why not take your everyday average shaker and add a creative twist to it. What started out as a quick (and very crude) sketch on my iPad, has since turned into the most original cocktail shaker on the market. \nWe set forth to develop a product that would not just sit in your cabinet, collecting dust, but one that could be proudly displayed. \nAfterall, why use a boring, everyday average cocktail shaker, when you can spice things up with Se\u00f1or Shaker!\nWhere We Are Today \nWe have spent the past ten months designing, refining, and producing a prototype of our Se\u00f1or Shaker. We now have the final Patent Pending design, a prototype that works great and a manufacturer for the product ready to go. We are looking to the Kickstarter community to take us to the next step and bring Se\u00f1or Shaker to your door!\nDesigns\nA rough illustration on my iPad is where this product started. 3 Margaritas in and this is what you get!\nFrom concept, we flushed out the design and provided turnarounds to the factory.\nWe simplified the design and the factory provided us with an exploded view of the product.\nI felt that the first pass was too short and stocky. I wanted our shaker to be more slender and easier for the consumer to hold, and more importantly use. We increased the overall height and the amount of ounces that it could hold.\nFrom the control art, our factory went on to produce a 3D Model, which would later be used for tooling.\nOur Prototypes\nWhile my factory was working on the 3D in China, I wanted to ensure that the size/shape was correct. I had my friend Dan Brodzik at Floating Eye Studios, output a model on their 3D printer.\nThe 3D model shown above was then sent to China so that our factory could have a better point of reference for what we were looking to manufacture.\nHere is an image of our second prototype. Overall I was very impressed with the factories craftsmanship, however there were still a few minor tweaks that I wanted to make to the head and mustache.\nHere is an image of our shaker without the Sombrero Cap.\nAn image of our pre-production sample.\nOur Logo\nHere's an image of our final logo. I wanted something clean and simple, that also tied in the product without making it appear too cheesy.\nOur Fun and Distinctive Packaging\nAt the end of the day, we worked with our friends at McCown Design Agency to create a more distinct package. One that was festive, unique and that compliments our high-end product.\n Se\u00f1or Shaker Sell Sheets\nWhere You Come In\nWe are looking for $10,000 to fund the final tooling for our Se\u00f1or Shaker manufacturing and to provide capital for our initial order. In return for your support you will receive a first run, Se\u00f1or Shaker or one of our other fantastic rewards. We really appreciate your support! - Brandon ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve taken a lot of steps to ensure a successful launch of Se\u00f1or Shaker.

We are confident that if problems do arise, we can work through them quickly.\n\nWe are scheduled to tool start in mid December and start production after the Chinese New Year.

As the days pass, Ellie alarmingly slips in and out of a catatonic state for short periods of time, each time explaining that the angels are getting closer. Are the angels real? Is Ellie suffering a mental breakdown or are we about to make first contact with an alien intelligence? \nThe inspiration for FORAGER was born out of frustration with mainstream science fiction movies where nearly all alien life in the universe wants to conquer or eat us. There is very little optimism, hope or joy. So FORAGER draws its inspiration films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, ET and Starman. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking on a project like this and our FOUR past Kickstarter projects, QUEEN CRAB, RETROVIRUS , SEX &VIOLENCE: VOL. 1 and WEAPON OF GOD has been super rewarding for many reasons.

With FORAGER we are going for an all ages audience that is interested in quality adventure and science fiction on an emotional level. By throwing some cool set ups and ideas into the mix, we think you will be able to read FORAGER over and over again and keep as part of your permanent collection.\n\nKnowing that our audience supports our insanity really gives us a ton of freedom to let loose on projects like this. Our goal is to make them even more special by offering exclusive art, prints, and downloads we know our fans love! \n\nThe amount needed is to cover the art, coloring, lettering, design, book printing, shipping, and special printing needs for the exclusive prints.

For eighteen years she resisted those urges and fought to be someone better than her base instincts would allow. In a moment of weakness and anger, however, she let go and took a life. That hazy Seattle summer day still haunts her, and as she begins college far away from home, she's afraid that she will kill again. \n\nShe's right to be afraid. \n\nInstead of leaving that fateful day behind her and starting a new life as a college freshman, Zoey's about to be tested and face temptation in ways far greater than she could ever imagine. The prestigious women's college that she's attending on a full academic scholarship is in Cutter's Circle, California, and Cutter's Circle has a dirty little secret: it has the highest population of serial killers in the country. The town is up to its proverbial severed head in murderers. \nIn the aftermath of the events of issue #3, Zoey is finding her struggle with her urges even more difficult. Complicated by living with three total strangers as roommates, she's on track to kill for the second time. And what of the other killers in town? One in particular will soon cross her path in a way she least expects.\n\nCreator Larime Taylor grew up on the deadpan humor of eighties cult classic Heathers, the quirky absurdism of Edward Scissorhands, and far too many bad slasher flicks. Mixing tongue-in-cheek black comedy with gritty drama and suspense, his resulting creation proudly wears its influences on its sleeve. He writes, draws, tones, and letters the book himself.\nThe first new issue (#4 of the whole series, but first of this 5-issue arc) should be done and delivered as a PDF by the end of July. The fifth part (#8) would be done by the end of November. The collected PDF trade with all the bonus content would follow in December.\nI work at the rate of 1-2 FINISHED pages a day - #3, which was 20 pages, was done in 15 days. I'm fast. There SHOULD be no problem in meeting these deadlines.\nTHE PITCH\nThe video, an excerpt from a documentary I'm in called THE INDEPENDENTS,  sums up the story and who I am much better than I can, here, typing with a stick in my mouth! I'm a disabled cartoonist trying to get off of assistance and out of poverty by using the only real skills I have - my art and my storytelling.\nThis is to fund the second storyarc (5 issues, 21 pages each) and, hopefully, beyond. When I mention Kickstarter in the video, that refers to my first 3-issue storyarc, originally called DARK ZOEY. It's finished and all 3 issues are ready to read, as is the collected trade, but only in digital form. I'm now in the final stages of getting the trades printed and shipped to the backers. If you're new to the series, you'll want to choose a NEWCOMER Reward, which includes the PDFs of the first storyarc..\nDue to shipping costs (which FAR outweigh printing), I'm only shooting for digital for THIS Kickstarter, unless I'm very successful.\nPlease help spread the word, even if you can't pledge - Tumblr and Twitter help boost the signal!\nPlease note that all NEWCOMER rewards are $5 more because they contain issues #1-#3 - the focus of the previous Kickstarter - and therefore have more content. If you're new to the series, you'll want to know what's going on!\nSPECIAL GUEST ARTISTS\nYou can see the first three already over in the rewards section - Terry Moore of STRANGERS IN PARADISE and most recently RACHEL RISING, Jimmie Robinson of BOMB QUEEN and FIVE WEAPONS,  Blair Shedd of DOCTOR WHO and THE RAPTOR, and Amanda Conner of POWER GIRL. They're each contributing an original sketch of Zoey, which will also be included as bonus content in the trade. Chandra Free of GOD MACHINE has agreed to contribute a sketch of Ash.\nTim Bradstreet is doing a cover that will only be on the trade.\nThe trade will also contain backup stories written by B Clay Moore of HAWAIIAN DICK and BAD KARMA, Michael Moreci of HOAX HUNTERS, Vince Hernandez of CHARISMAGIC and EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT ASSASSINS, and former Milestone and DC editor Joe Illidge.\nThere are more being lined up, and I'll be adding new Rewards as I confirm them. I'm really excited, and I think you will be, too!\nCARICATURES \nI draw digitally now for the most part as it gives me much more freedom that my disability denies me when I use pen or pencil on paper. That said, I know some of you really prefer the original work on paper, one-of-a-kind, and so I'm willing to do that as well. It just takes longer and is more physically demanding, so it costs more. Here is a sample of my caricature work (digital, originals on paper will be more 'raw'):\nCaricature of Gail Simone\n'ORIGINAL' PAGES\nAs I work digitally, I don't have 'original' pages of comic art to sell.

It brings together the world\u2019s best cartoonists to talk about the art form they love, and what happens to it as newspapers die. Over 90 interviews were conducted, including the first-ever audio interview with Bill Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes), as well as Jim Davis (Garfield), Cathy Guisewite (Cathy), Mort Walker (Beetle Bailey), Mike & Jerry (Penny Arcade), Matt Inman (The Oatmeal), Jeff Keane (The Family Circus), Ryan North (Dinosaur Comics), Lynn Johnston (FBOFW), Zach Weiner (SMBC), Scott Kurtz (PvP), Scott McCloud (Understanding Comics), Richard Thompson (Cul de Sac), Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content), Stephan Pastis (Pearls Before Swine), Bill Amend (Foxtrot), Kate Beaton (Hark! A Vagrant) and more. STRIPPED sits down with these creators to talk about how cartooning works, why it's so loved, and how they're navigating this dicey period between print and digital options...when neither path works perfectly.\nEven more than comics, this movie\u2019s about pursuing art in an age when the business of art is changing constantly.\nBut enough words!

In a nutshell, this project is a printing project to compile all four COLOR issues of my comic series from the early 2000s, plus all the covers, pinups (many in color for the first time), and never before seen sketches all under one \"roof\" or trade paperback.  In ADDITION, I am going to include a rare two page story drawn by me (in color for the first time), a separate development/sketcbook section for a TV VERSION pitch I've created (redesigning the characters, making them younger and in high school), as well as a mini flip book in the corner of never before seen animation I created of Marty and Alexis (in COLOR!).  JAM PACKED, right?  I know, I'm excited to hold it too!\nSOME HISTORY of Opposite Forces:  I wrote and drew this series over about 4 or 5 years in the early 2000s.  It was a real labor of love for me.  My buddy and I started a comic company to self-publish our own creations called Funnypages Press.  This first story arc (issues 1-4, reproduced in this Kickstarter) was originally printed in BLACK AND WHITE with a press run of only a couple thousand.  They are very rare to find (though I have a few left that I am offering in one of the incentive tiers to the right).  Around 2005 or so, ALIAS Publishing (now long gone) offered to reprint issues 1-4 in COLOR for the first time.  I created all new covers for that run and we had a talented artist (Cedric Hohnstadt) INK issues 3 and 4  (which I had drawn much more roughly), along with the covers.  Joshua Ray did an excellent job coloring all four issues and the covers.  So, between the two print runs, there were two versions of the interior art (black and white/ color) and 8 different covers created for the combined runs.  AND, all \"celebrity\" pinups and covers that I had made for the black and white (Funnypages Press) version were NOT reproduced for the COLOR (Alias) version.  SO- this is why I wanted to finally compile the BEST of all the versions, have some of the pinups colored for the first time, AND add extra content like the sketchbook sections to create THIS AWESOME TRADE PAPERBACK!  It's the ULTIMATE OPPOSITE FORCES BOOK!  \nWhat will the money be used for?  Well, largely, the printing of the book, the art prints, paying some colorists, a graphic artist to put the book together and color the animation drawings, my 15 year old daughter wants something for helping to ship stuff and help shoot my video, Amazon and Kickstarter fees (that's up to 10% right there), and Shipping (this could be about 20-25% of the costs too).  IF we go over the goal, I do plan on ADDING A FEW \"REACH\" GOALS.  Maybe Hardcover?  Maybe adding more pages to the sketchbook sections?  Maybe both or more?  We'll see.  \nPS- Send me a note if you have any ideas of other incentives that you'd like to see.  I may add some as we go!\nNOTE: I HAVE CHANGED MY MIND and have added a PDF version of the book to the $35 and up levels.  Since this Kickstarter is IN PROGRESS, I don't feel it is right to add a lower level tier with JUST the PDF version of the book.  It would be unfair to those that have already purchased the book.  If you have backed at the $20 level and still ALSO want the PDF version, then I suggest you UPGRADE to that level.  I hope this helps those that enjoy both digital and book form versions of this book.  \nALSO, this new PDF version of the book will ALSO go to EVERYONE that is ABOVE the $35 tier.  I can not change the wording of the tiers once the Kickstarter has begun, so this is the best way I know how to get that word out.   \"Always be backing!\"\n_____________________________________________________________\nAnd here's some images of what you are getting in some of the INCENTIVES on the right:\nHERE'S THE BOOK COVER:\nA couple sample interior pages from the 80+ page story:\nIssue 1, page 13\nIssue 1, page 14\nThe book will include tons of alternate covers, pinups, and sketchbook pages too!\nThere's even a never before seen animation I created of Marty and Alexis running toward the camera.  It is being colored and put in the corner of the sketchbook section as a flip book!  Here is an example of one of the frames from the Alexis level!  (The Marty and Alexis original animation artwork from this animation is a part of some of the incentives on the right!)\nOne drawing from the Alexis level of the run cycle (NOTE: the original artwork is NOT in color)\n__________________________________________________________________\nAND for some of the incentive tiers there are EXTRAS like:\nPage samples of the Tom Bancroft SUPERHEROES PDF Sketchbook\nHere is the original artwork for the $250 tiers- The Marty Fan and The Alexis Fan:\nNOTE: These are two SEPARATE tiers.

They are high quality and have printed many Kickstarter projects along with great \"art of\" books for many well-known comic artists. Obviously, there can be challenges to working with any company abroad, so some shipping delays can always happen. My shipment deadline in each backing tier is just a guess of when I might get the comic back from the printer (usually 3 months) and get all of them together and shipped out to you. Assume 4 months, I guess. My 15 year old daughter will be working with me (so she can raise a little money for overly sexy swim suits for summer- dang it!) to help ship and fulfill all the incentives. That can always be problematic but I have 4 daughters so working with ONE sounds easy. Shouldn't be a problem we can't handle by bringing MOM in to get things done. I will do my best to get quality packing materials to ship all the incentives. I live in fear of the postal service, so that should help us all here. Also, my time is limited because of many work commitments, but I am planning on making this as much of a priority as possible to accomplish all the shipping, emails, and art commissions to everyone's full pleasure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "If you liked Opposite Forces- try my Art of Tom Bancroft book!", "update_content": "Help me Help my buddies bring COMIC STRIPS BACK FROM THE ABYSS!

We have to print posters, buy ads, pay festival submission fees, translate the voiceover and do subtitles. Let's bring \"Rocks\" to as wide an audience as possible! Thank you!\nTHE STORY\n\"Rocks In My Pockets\" is a story of mystery and redemption. The film is based on true events involving the women of my family (including myself) and their surrender to madness, with names changed to protect innocent bystanders. The film is packed with visual metaphors, surreal images and my twisted sense of humor. If you love animation, art, women, strange daring stories, Latvian accents, history, nature and adventure, this is a film for you! \nFollow us on Facebook!\nMiranda amid Midsummer flowers.\nTHE PERSONAL\nI am making this film because I find the fragility of our minds fascinating. Life is strange, unpredictable and I see the humor in it all. Yes, I almost broke down, but I came back to tell my story. I hope you'll laugh with me.\nTHE ART OF IT\nEach of the 129,600 frames in \"Rocks In My Pockets\" has been hand crafted. First I made paper mache sets - rooms, forests, city streets. Then we lit and shot them with a digital camera either as still pictures or as stop motion sequences creating a 3D effect. Then on paper I hand animated the 2D characters walking, talking and interacting with the stop motion sets. After the animation was done, each drawing was scanned and colored in Photoshop. Then the sequence was imported into After Effects for compositing and output. The final edit is being done in Final Cut Pro. \"Rocks In My Pockets\" is 90 minutes long, it has 20 episodes comprised of 669 scenes. There are 28 stop motion paper mache sets and approximately 23,000 drawings.\nAnna falls in love with Indulis.\nTHE MAKE OR BREAK POINT\nThe \"Rocks In My Pockets\" animation is finished. We see the light at the end of the tunnel! Still, only 2/3 of the film is colored. We have 7,500 more drawings to go. Our small, but very dedicated team is working hard on that. The film promises to have a beautiful, unique look. But a fully colored film without music and sound effects is not a complete cinematic experience. We need to raise $42,800, the bare minimum to finish coloring, editing, and to add the music and sound. \nWater Spirit dances with Linda near her big house.\nHOW YOUR MONEY WILL HELP\n- it will help the coloring team continue the work without interruption and delay\n- it will afford a talented composer to focus solely on this project for 6 weeks to write an original score\n- it will allow the composer to hire a small orchestra (4 - 8 musicians) to record the music with acoustic instruments\n- it will rent a sound studio to record the music\n- it will allow a talented sound designer to work exclusively on the \"Rocks In My Pockets\" sound design for more than 12 weeks. Each of the characters' moves or steps has to be accentuated with a specific sound. The sound designer will have to do a lot of foley work. In the end all of the sound effects, the music and the voiceover will have to be mixed so you get the best of each\n- it will allow us to do the final edit in a professional studio\nYour support will give color, music and sound to \"Rocks In My Pockets\". You will be part of this creative process.\nThank you!\nIndulis receives funding for his turpentine enterprise\nOTHER WAYS OF HELPING\nYou can spread the word of the \"Rocks In My Pockets\" Kickstarter campaign to your family, friends, as well as to your Facebook community!\nIf you know of any mental health organizations or groups that we should contact regarding this campaign, please let us know!\nIf you know people who love animation and art, tell them about \"Rocks In My Pockets\"!\nIf you know a person who has an interest in mental health or simply likes unusual stories, please tell them about \"Rocks In My Pockets\"!\nTell your Latvian friends about the film!\nTweet about the \"Rocks In My Pockets\" Kickstarter campaign!

In 2010 \"Rocks In My Pockets\" received grants from NYSCA and The Jerome Foundation. Women Make Movies became the \"Rocks In My Pockets\" fiscal sponsor, which meant the project's donors received tax deductions. We did a few fundraising events and an IndieGoGo campaign. In the fall of 2011 we stopped fundraising and focused solely on the film. Making an animated feature is a laborious and time consuming process. One cannot imagine having people working for free on a project for 2 years.\nThe \"Rocks In My Pockets\" team is very small - 4 people including myself. We work every day for 9 - 12 hours. By December 2012 it became clear that even with running the production very frugally, by the end of February 2013 we'd run out of money and have to stop production to raise additional funds. But the film is almost done! The coloring and compositing teamwork is running seamlessly right now. To stop this well-run process indefinitely risks shelving the project for who knows how long? We want to make the film available to the broader public sooner rather than later because mental health is a big national conversation right now and we would like \"Rocks In My Pockets\" to be part of it.\nWithout funding there will be no sound nor music. It can take up to four months on a feature film for a sound designer to select and edit sound effects, then mix the sound effects, music and voiceover together. The work has to be compensated or the film will have no sound.\nSince the film has a special handmade, Eastern European look to it we chose to work with a composer whose musical style would perfectly match the visuals. The composer needs to rent recording space and hire a small orchestra. It all requires funds. \nI wish it was less, but $42,800 is the bare minimum to finish the film.

As I started films I would scribble scene notes, lines of dialogue, plot ideas and characters upon theatre napkins and film schedules.\nI am writing, drawing, lettering and publishing ICHIDO myself. I have detailed outlines for 8 books (the first story arc), finished scripts for BOOKS ONE and TWO and  am currently drawing the pages of BOOK ONE.  I have collaborated  with the amazing artists Reza Ilyasa to help design the look of the Army of the First Son and ReJean Dubois for costume and character visualizations.\nHere's the first map of ICHIDO.  As the story progresses so will the map.\nI love world building and inventive campaigns, games, comics and film settings.  I recently pledged to the Monte Cook Numenera Campaign for that reason. With ICHIDO I am attempting to create a fun sandbox to play in for a while and a place where I could draw ancient castles, high tech robots, hideous monsters, monks, ninjas, samurais and Japanese royalty.  ICHIDO is the comic I have always wanted to read and since no one else has made it I thought I would give it my best shot.\nICHIDO THE STORY\nIn the far future a young Monk chose love over duty, betraying his ancient order and unleashing an evil Sorcerer from the distant past.\nDuring the last dance of her wedding, the Princess of Nihon was the first to die.  The Shogun lost his mind as his daughter passed away and the Empire of Nihon erupted in civil war.  His sons now feud over an empty throne.\nMaintaining control over the west, the FIRST SON wields an army of post-human biomechs from Forge-City Hiroshima. Amongst the ashes of the Tokyo Wastes the SECOND SON dominates the east with forsaken black magic.  Although officially declared slain during the Nara Incident, the body of the THIRD SON was never recovered and his mon still appear on the armor of rebel fighters.\nTen years have passed and in a moment of rage the monks mental defenses abandon him and he draws the attention of the Sons of Nihon.\nOur story begins in New Edo.  On this day where do your loyalties lie?\nby tomas overbai page one panel one\nICHIDO THE CHARACTERS\nTHE NARRATOR\nDiscarded on the steps of a Grey Brotherhood temple days after her birth, the young narrator's arms were removed before she had her first meal.

Nine years have passed since he seized control of the Western Empire.

With the introduction of exo-terrestrian genetics at a sub-cellular level the solid core matrix is reorganized and replaced on a continuous schedule making the 6th generation Sentinel very resilient to permanent damage.\nOBI-SHIN class ASSASSIN\nby Reza Ilyasa\nLone operatives and Infiltration experts, the OBI-SHIN, \"assassin of ninjas\" are manufactured to target rebel ninja and contain the latest anti-ninjitsu protocols.  The void assassin model is constructed around an experimental dimensional drive that allows travel along the 10 core dimensions and near dual existence within prime reality. A 2nd Gen OBI-SHIN is officially credited with the THIRD SONS assassination during the Nara Incident.\nGEISHA class ATTENDANT\nby Reza Ilyasa\nThe Geisha class attendant serve as personal assistants to the FIRST SON. Handling all logistical and administrative tasks including the FIRST SON'S biological requirements, the Geisha class attendant can be found deep within both Forge-City Hiroshima and the Imperial Palace \"Heaven's Fortress\".\nHand of the First Son\nby Reza Ilyasa\nThe Hand of the First Son are tax collectors and religion re-education specialists.

From his tower in the ruins of Tokyo Island the SECOND SON invokes blasphemous pacts with demonic oni Warlords and summons unspeakable horrors from beyond the Void to carry out his diabolic schemes.

Throughout 2013 I will continue to promote ICHIDO at cons and for the first time at San Diego Comic Con International in the Small Press Area and WonderCon Anaheim in the Artist Alley.  I would love to make it over to the east coast for some shows but just can't afford it. I crashed on my Seattle, Bay Area and LA friend's couches throughout the 2012 season.  I couldn't have done the west coast without my awesome friends, thanks Earl, Kim, JD and Searnold.\nIf you want to speak with me in person and see any ICHIDO stuff without the dependence of an electronic screen I will be at Sac-Con December 9th and giving a final kickstarter push at Sac-Anime January 4th, 5th & 6th. Project ends January 7th.   \nmy table at Stan Lee's Comikaze at the Los Angeles Convention Center\nFor more information and to see more of my artwork please visit my website\nWHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS GO\nSince I don't have to pay anyone for writing, drawing or lettering ICHIDO all the monies raised are going towards printing BOOK ONE, art prints, T-shirts, shipping, taxes, fees, ninja membership dues, time travel permit and if pledged the 3 biomech commissions and any biomech print add-ons for Reza.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy biggest challenge is the sequential art and overcoming my obsessive compulsive tendencies.

Continuing to learn the storytelling language of sequential art by improving my artistic skillset, knowledge base and by finishing pages. I have spent too long \"planning\" ICHIDO for fear it will suck.

They meet their end as decided by random by a whale-bone Australian mariner's teetotum. I've dubbed it \"The Pequod\" after the ill-fated ship from Moby Dick. One spin, one marked for death character.\n\nEach issue begins with the funeral for the last fallen member, and an introduction of a new character along with where Darkwater Security Services will be sending B-Squad. During the mission, the characters will deal with the task at hand while also coping with the fall of one of their companions as decided by the fateful roll of the Pequod (read more in the Update Section), and wraps up with B-Squad trying to complete their mission. \nThe Pequod\nFor the next issue, I will select a character from a group of 36 B-Squad Reservists and they'll replace the dead character from the previous issue and take over the \"Rookie\" nickname.\nBACK B-SQUAD!\nUncolored Page One Preview \nPenciled & Inked by Lauren Monardo\nVideo Interview with Empire's Comics Vault\nAfter burying their former squaddie, the surviving members of B-Squad are sent to investigate the poaching of a mystical and mischievous creature called the \"Mogwui\" that is being researched for cures to fight cancer in children by a strange doctor. Ultimately, B-Squad confronts these poachers, learning in the process that the facility & doctor are not exactly working toward noble ends.\nFuture Issues\nB-Squad's future endeavors after Issue #1.\nFuture issues will send B-Squad on equally dangerous and ridiculous missions.\nThey'll be shrunk down to infiltrate the enormous Tapigami Tape City to recover artists kidnapped by Tapigami founder Danny Scheible. \nThey'll journey to the sea floor in a race against a notable film director to recover the Prime Minister's nuclear retaliation letter locked within a sunken British submarine.\n\nThey'll pay a visit to a mad-scientist who has an island off the coast of Costa Rica where he is rumored to have genetically spliced dinosaurs and wiener dogs.\nNOTE: There will be a series of videos available to backers to watch and learn more about each character!\nIn the first issue, as with every issue, B-Squad revolves around the dynamic around six characters. Every issue, one character is killed at random, and then replaced in the following issue by a B-Squad Reservist (a pool of 36 characters I've created)\nBarbara \"Babs\" Munroe - a severely wounded action heroine that was part of a foxy team of hit-women that worked for a mysterious winemaker.\nSullivan \"Sully\" Caliber - a top Canadian private detective that ran into problems with internet chat rooms & MSNBC.\nJean-Paul Bombadiere - a ruthless and cunning French hitman that took out his frustrations with his failed oceanography career on his victims.\nBradley \"Brodee\" Schafer - a world champion skim-boarder turned dare-deviling adrenaline junkie.\nHadley \"The Rookie\" Hamlin - a top of his class Navy SEAL discharged over his acute colorblindness.\nMakato \"MacGoogle\" Wagyu - a communications and computer specialist who's focused entirely on his new iPear and uses it in the same way MacGyver might use duct tape and a paper clip.\nThere are a total of 42 characters in B-Squad. The above six is the first team and the other 36 will be peppered in as characters get offed. \nHere is a small sampling of some of the \"Other 36\":\nA Grizzled Harlem Globetrotter with small hands \nA Mute Eskimo \nA brash drug smuggler that loves to hide drugs. \nA cat lady who has trained her cats to be trained killers. \nA peace-loving blacksmith that will not craft anything for violent purposes.\nFormer Knight at Medieval Nights\nWW2-era OSS female assassin coming out of retirement.\nA former lingerie model turned big game hunter.\nA female treasure hunter who has a thing for the dead\nIn order to make B-Squad a reality, $8000 is the minimum I need to raise to cover a profitable print run using the existing distribution.  Most of the money will be used to pay illustrators for the work they do on this project.\nB-Squad will pay to have a main-series illustrator, and 6 other illustrators who will do the background dossiers for each of 6 characters.\nIf I get money beyond the minimum it will be earmarked toward evolving B-Squad toward becoming a whole different animal.\n$8000 & Beyond....\nMy dream for B-Squad is to develop into an animated/motion series. However, the costs of animation are far too steep for me. I would need approximately $25,000 to finance the initial pre-production work that would be needed to make B-Squad into some sort of animated series. If I can hit close or over that number - I will definitely move this kick-starter -while still making the comics a reward - toward the end of making an episodic animated/motion series. \nStandard Edition of the Book ($10)\nThe standard edition is $10, includes shipping (for USA residents), the custom backboard (as depicted below) and a stick of the character that dies in Issue One as a commemorative keepsake. The book will be 24+ pages (as many as 30). The script for issue one is complete except for rewrites that will occur in the event of successful kickstarter. I anticipate a print run of 5000-10000 books. \nKickstarter Edition Collecter's Book\nMockup of the KS Exclusive Edition\nIn my opinion, the real prize is one of the limited print run (100 copies only) of the first B-Squad issue. I've limited this to 100 issues as that will meet my minimum for funding, and it will be an excellent prize for any comic collector and B-Squad fan.\nThis version of the book will feature higher production quality and design plus it will feature the following bonus content making it around 36+ pages.\nPrinted with quality in mind on 80lb Silk Text paper and 100lb Silk Card cover.\nSketches from the series artist & from Eben E.B. Burgoon's moleskines\nA preview Issue Two's new \"Rookie\" character & the next mission\nA 6 page character dossier story of the fallen B-Squad member illustrated by a different artist.\nA roster of all 42 B-Squad characters with the names of the fallen crossed out. \n\"Back Board\" with sticker of the fallen B-Squad character\nEach issue will be signed on the cover by Eben E.B. Burgoon unless requested otherwise.\nIssues will be numbered 1-100 and distributed in a first ordered, first served manner.\nThe Poster\nConcept of the B-Squad Poster\nThe poster will be a large format poster that will feature blank grave plots for each of the 36 characters that will get killed over the course of the series. These plots can be filled using stickers (as rendered by 36 different artists) included with the boards of each issue or brought to conventions for sketchcards or however you'd like to fill them.\nHere is a sample of a board for B-Squad books:\nThe \"Back Board\" for B-Squad\nT-Shirt Mockup\nFront - Mockup\n\nBack - Mockup\nFront & back of the t-shirt that will used to reward certain donation levels.

Play with a different toolset. I felt like it would be great if there was a B-Squad Lego set, and after searching around the internet found the BattleBrick company. Worthy of a kick-starter on its own, the BattleBrick Black Hawk helicopter is a custom set designed by BattleBrick and will feature the 6 characters of Issue One as custom mini-figs. I'm working with them to get this done and ordered as soon as Kickstarter looks like it will be funded. Each one is admittedly expensive, but there will be very very few of these B-Squad version's ever made and will be an exciting must have collectible should B-Squad hit the big time goals I have for it.\nLive & Die with B-Squad Reward\nThis reward tier is ideal for the most faithful of supporters. Supporting at this level means you're locked in for as long as B-Squad is made. \n\nEvery single issue, every trade, every collection, every omnibus. Any DVD or BLUE-RAY, any 3D imaging mind modules in the far-future. As long as I breathe, I will make sure you'll get a copy of it. \nEach person who buys this reward will have one of the six stars where they will be thanked by name in each issue for as long as they are a member.\nThere will only ever be six of these \"Live & Die\" spots and they will only open up if they go unpurchased or if the person who bought the perk cancels it, or, far more likely, dies.\nThank Yous!\nThanks to Ms. Fearnow, Mikey, Lauren Monardo, The Urban Hive, Flywheel Arts Incubator, and the many friends and cohorts that have encouraged me to make this happen and click GO! to do this project as a kickstarter.

When his runaway granddaughter is murdered, Rick embarks on a bloody trail of revenge through Portland's internet porn community only to discover he may have inadvertently had a role in her death.\nThe other story, GIRL IN A STORM, is written by Jimy Palmiotti [ Painkiller Jane, Queen Crab, Jonah Hex] and illustrated by Juan SantaCruz [ The Resistance, Fantastic Four, The Hulk] and is a story about a NYC female police officer that becomes facinated with a lesbian couple that has moved across the courtyard from her apartment.

THANK YOU ALL! Beyond initial funding, if we could get to $70,000 I can then include a good size \"preview\" of the second graphic novel into everyone's copies of \"Volume 1\". This particular section would be about Captain's Hook, where he came from, and a glimpse into what drives him (and yes all the information came from J.M. Barrie!)\nIf we could get to $100,000 we could open up Volume 2 for purchase, but I understand that is probably just a dream! :)      \nTHANK YOU ALL FOR A SUCCESSFUL CAMPAIGN! :)   \nAbout this project...\nMy goal is to adapt the original novel of Peter and Wendy by J.M. Barrie into a graphic novel that is as true to source as possible. The original story is one of the most beautiful novels I've every read, and has always been a huge inspiration to me. I feel current adaptations leave a lot of the original story left untold, or have fundamentally changed story elements. Therefore I feel doing this Graphic novel is a terrific way to highlight the fantastic original story of Peter Pan in it's entirety. I also intend to further explore Peter Pan and Captain Hook's backstory by adapting parts from J.M Barrie's The Little White Bird  ( prequel to Peter and Wendy) and a little known information given by Barrie about Jas. Hook into the story. \nI also would like to create something that parents can share with their children. It's my hope that creating something children can also experience will encourage reading, creativity, and appreciation of classic tales.\nThose that have not read the novel may not realize just how much deeper and more involved the original story is. I don't want to give away all the differences between present adaptations and source material, but I promise it will be worthwhile to experience them if you are a Peter Pan fan like I am.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n2 page spread preview (unlettered) This part adapted from \"The Little White Bird\"\nI am not a Peter Pan expert, I am just a person who is a lifelong fan who loves the story.  I'm so looking forward to starting this project, and to highlight J.M. Barrie's masterpiece to the best of my abilities.\n                              (click image to see larger)\n                              *   *   *\nWhy we need funding....\nThis Kickstarter campaign is to get VOLUME 1 (of 3) completed, and set the groundwork for the rest of the series. I will be adapting and penciling the artwork, while my husband, Ray Dillon, will be tackling inking, coloring and lettering. Ray and I previously worked on the New York Times Bestselling adaptation of Peter Beagle's The Last Unicorn Graphic Novel by IDW. You can see some at our work on TLU HERE.\nI am focused on Volume 1 of Peter Pan right now because I don't want to keep backers waiting for over a year for the whole series to be completed before they receive their reward.\nUpon first sight, $48,000 seems like a lot of money. However, Kickstarter campaigns are not straight donations and in reality a campaign costs a lot  of time and money to fulfill rewards ordered and manage correspondance. So only part of the money asked for actually go towards creative production of the book. \nProduction costs- We are the entire creative team for the book, and if you break down what funding we'd get for the 90 pages of full production work we'd create, the rates break down to less than we would get paid elsewhere. I didn't even include funding for the time to adapt, letter, design, create promotional images, covers, pin ups, take care of the Kickstarter, or work on the sketchbook. In short; we are not becoming rich by any means with this campaign. Our only intent is to be able to work on Peter Pan, and be able to survive through it!\nKickstarter/Amazon Fees - Roughly 8%-10% of final funding\nTaxes -  self employed rates apply\nProduction of books - These rates vary depending on amount ordered, but takes up a nice chunk of funds\nShipping & shipping supply - Another large chunk, depending on amount shipped\nBuffer Amount - This should be included in ANY Kickstarter. This includes money aside for dropped pledges, lost books, refund requests, and any errors and miscalculations.\n                              *   *   *\nHow Kickstarter Works...\nKickstarter is unlike regular online ordering experiences in that you are not just buying an item for precise arrival, you are joining us in our personal adventure to complete this project. You'll be with us for both the victories as well as the bumps and difficulties, all culminating in receiving the final product which we have all given so much to achieve. Kickstarter is more about supporting ideas, people, and projects than it is to receive an item right away. Just so you're aware of everything before you join us in Neverland! :)\nStep 1. Create a Kickstarter account, and determine payment method\nStep 2. Decide which Reward you'd like, taking special note of any shipping estimates.\nStep 3. Wait and see what happens! If our campaign is successful by December 20th, then your card will be charged and your reward is secured. If our campaign is unsuccessful, then your card will NOT be charged.\nStep 4. (optional ;) ) If you would really like to see this project succeed, then the most helpful thing you could do is help spread the word! Tweets, facebook posts, blog posts, whatever you want to do to help, we would eternally appreciate it!\n                              *   *   *\nRewards...\nWe are aiming for September 2013 for delivery on most rewards. Please consider this includes an overestimate of about 4-5 months for research and production, 1 month for design, 2 months for printing, and 1 month for shipping.\n***Christmas 2012: For those who order Peter Pan: Vol. 1 as gifts, you will have access to a printable certificate on December 20th featuring new Holiday Peter Pan artwork. It will certify the recipient that they have a copy reserved for them for when the project is completed next year. They will also get a password protected URL link to visit to see the same previews and updates you receive as a Kickstarter Backer! :) Merry Christmas!\nUnless noted otherwise, ALL rewards include your name listed in the \"Honorary Lost Boys and Girls\" section of the book, as well as access to Kickstarter Exclusive previews and updates!\nTYPES OF REWARDS \nPeter Pan: The Graphic Novel - Vol. 1: This will be a hardcover, 100 page, full color graphic novel. The story will be about the first 3rd of the original story, as well as extra bits from The Little White Bird and, if space allows, a small peek at an adaptation of little know information given by J.M. Barries about Captain Hook. For bonus material I hope to include an interview with Christine De Poortere, Peter Pan director from the Great Ormond Street Hospital, as well as a brief biography spotlighting their relationship with Peter Pan.\nPeter Pan: The Companion Guide: A sketchbook sized 90 page booklet that includes ALL the penciled artwork for Volume 1, as well as thoughts and notes on the adaptation process by me!\nSigned/Sketch/Artwork Copies: These copies will require longer processing time as to have time to create the artwork on the interior cover :) Signed copies should be much faster.\nCameo Reward: This reward will require a photo and release of likeness form signed. I will send you a scan of your cameo when finished! :) Note: I probably won't have time for any revisions, but I'll do my best to make sure it's right!\nPage to Yourself Reward: Please contact beforehand to be sure we can print what you have in mind! :)\nEvent/Hooks Revenge Reward: Contact if you have any questions!\n*NEW* Penciled Page Reward - You'll receive one penciled page from the Graphic Novel.

HERE is a sample of my penciled work: Note - this sample is a 2 page spread. Your will be getting a standalone page\n*NEW* Tinker-Doodle Reward - (YES I noticed I typed \"dairy dust\" instead of \"fairy dust\" in the reward listing, and NO you will not be getting powdered milk with your reward! :p ) Here is the Tinker Bell Doodle to expect in the companion guide (though it may slightly vary)! There are slight gold \"fairy dust\" accents.\n                              *   *   *\n  Great Ormond Street Hospital...\nBefore J.M. Barrie passed, he relinquished all rights and profits to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in England. His hope was that Peter Pan's success would forever serve to help children in need. The novel version of Peter Pan is now in public domain, however I am determined to keep to the spirit of Barrie's gift. If somehow this series (Volume 1 and onward) becomes successful upon regular publication, it is my goal to benefit GOSH in some way.

Not only does sketching in the field create a more personal, universal connection with my subjects, as opposed to thrusting recording equipment in their faces, but publishing social justice stories in visual format has proven to raise far more awareness and enjoy more popularity among a younger, harder to reach demographic of readers.\nSample comics interview with a survivor of human trafficking: sfpublicpress.org/news/2012-07/comic-obedience-is-the-best-weapon and an introduction to trafficking in Truthout here: truth-out.org/news/item/6662:slavery-lives-on-in-the-united-states.\nThe Plan:\n1. Travel across Nepal (I landed in Kathmandu on Oct 25) gathering stories from human trafficking survivors, turning their testimonies into a series of comics (one per region, over seven regions) that will then  be collected as an interactive ebook and graphic novel and published both in english and nepali (with the potential for hindi too). I will also offer workshops that will give participants (specifically women and children) the means to tell their own stories in comics form. \n2. Conduct a series of surveys while in the field to gauge the effectiveness of visual outreach materials as a method of lowering human trafficking incidence in low-literacy areas - the first of its kind. First we'll roll out an initial baseline survey, then conduct interviews/create the comic, then distribute the collected stories in comics format (translated into the local language), then distribute a second survey four months later.\n3. Chronicle my process and the steps I go through to accomplish the above goals via a webcomic at www.archcomix.com - one of the first times graphic journalism has been used as a real time reporting tool in the field.\nTest page adapted from Patricia McCormick's SOLD\nIn 2011 I was the first comics journalist to be awarded a John S. Knight Journalism Fellowship at Stanford, where I spent the year creating and developing interactive digital platforms for explaining news stories using comics, animation, interactive documentary and audio. Here's a 3 min talk on the power of graphic journalism I gave at the end of it:\nCheck out my interactive comic on the Nisoor square shootings here or my graphic history of the Honduran coup here. Browse more of my work here.\nFor a brief explanation of comics journalism (in comics format), you can also read my piece, What is Comics Journalism? on the Poynter Institute\u2019s website here: http://bit.ly/poyntercomicsjournalism.\nAside from the obvious expenses of this trip (plane fare, travel, accommodation and food for eight months), your funds will go towards print costs (both in US and Nepal), distribution and paying local staff in Nepal (translators, fixers, survey givers). Anything that's left over will go towards paying me a salary - and part of the experiment with this project is to see if it's a sustainable model for similar future projects.\nIf we exceed the funding goal, I'm excited to experiment with other forms of media, such as making a Waltz with Bashir-esque animation or developing an iphone/android app.\nAny more questions you have about the project, feel free to leave a comment and I'll get back to you - another purpose of this trip is to lift the curtain on the reporting process using comics, after all.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis being a Kickstarter project, the biggest risk is not meeting the funding goal and therefore not getting any of the pledges! On a more serious note, challenges to the project include: gaining the trust and cooperation of survivors, complicated by the fact that many of them are women and are deliberately kept away from men at shelters; the language barrier; infrastructure issues (many of the regions are remote and hard to access by regular transport); not to mention the time-intensive process of making comics versus the need to create a fast turnaround for my reporting.\n\nOne key way I'll overcome many of these challenges involves my collaborators: during my Knight Fellowship at Stanford I met Madhu Acharya and Jaya Luintel, pioneers of radio and community storytelling (Jaya founded her own organization, The Story Kitchen, that focuses on giving women a voice) in their native Nepal. It was over the course of several visual storytelling collaborations that Madhu, Jaya and I conceived of a large-scale project in Nepal to my graphic journalism and visual storytelling work with their consolidated network of contacts around Nepal.\n\nAs for more logistical issues, the short answer is that I've done this before. In 2010, I collaborated with a Fulbright Fellow to create a graphic novel on human trafficking in Eastern Europe (Borderland: Seven Stories as Told by Survivors of Human Trafficking) from interviews with survivors, which was then translated into Ukrainian and Russian and distributed by the Kiev branch of the International Organization for Migration to over 100 schools in affected areas. After the overwhelming support for that project, including the crowd sourced funding (via Kickstarter) for a large-scale print run, I continued my investigation of trafficking through comics with a focus on the same issue in the US, where my pieces have run on Truthout and in the San Francisco Public Press.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Latest Graphic Journalism Piece is now up on BBC News!", "update_content": "Hi all,\nPardon the radio silence.

Not only will it earn you more rewards, do wonders for your karma and heighten that warm, contented feeling that you've had since originally pledging, but it will get me closer to the all important finish line and make this project a reality.

If you haven't already, please take the time to send the Kickstarter link (http://bit.ly/nepalGN) to as many people as you can who you think might be interested in graphic novels, visual storytelling, human trafficking (stopping it, that is...) or new media/journalistic innovation. Include @archcomix in your tweets and I'll pick one of you at random to receive a bonus drawing from my sketchbook. Another option, of course, is to increase your pledge to the next level. I've added some additional rewards, such as prints of my webcomic, so if you see a new option you like, or are interested in a bespoke commission, then drop me a line and we can work something out.

I was hoping we could hit $3000 by the end, and we did it with 9 days left! Thank you all so much!\n\nFirst, a big new goal, then a few smaller goals along the way in case we don't get there..\n\nIf I can get to $5000 by the deadline, I'll do THREE issues in one volume as a perfect-bound trade paperback, and I'll write them to be a self-contained story. As it stands right now, you're getting two issues in an ongoing series, but at $5000 I'll work it so that one major plot line gets resolved by the end of the third issue. It won't answer every question or wrap up every storyline, but there will be a clear 'through-line' in those three issues, and they'll be collected in one 54-page volume.\n\nBecause that's a pretty big goal to reach in nine days, I'm offering the following mini-goals:\n\nAt $3500, everyone pledging $15 or more will get a print of their choice (in addition to any prints already included in your reward). There will be four to choose from, one of Zoey, and one of each of her three roommates in the dorm.\n\nAt $4000, it becomes two prints.\n\nAt $4500, it becomes three prints.\n\nThis means that if you pledged $50 (the reward that gives you a print), you could end up with as many as all four. Only those pledging $100 will get the rare, limit-15 prints, though. Those backers therefore stand to get five prints - all four of Zoey and her roommates AND the rare, limited edition print.\n\nIn the coming days I'll be posting art of each of the standard prints you can choose from, and some character profiles to give you a bit better idea who each character is to help you choose.\n\nTHE CREATOR\nLarime Taylor is a disabled mouth artist living in California. Life on $750 a month from Social Security isn\u2019t easy, so he supplements his income with his art. Larime draws with his mouth on a Wacom Cintiq tablet generously provided by Wacom. \nTHE STORY \nSome people become killers.\n\nZoey was born that way.\n\nEver since she can remember, Zoey Aarons has felt the urge to kill. For eighteen years she resisted those urges and fought to be someone better than her base instincts would allow. In a moment of weakness and anger, however, she let go and took a life. That hazy Seattle summer day still haunts her, and as she begins college far away from home, she's afraid that she will kill again.\n\nShe's right to be afraid.\n\nInstead of leaving that fateful day behind her and starting a new life as a college freshman, Zoey's about to be tested and face temptation in ways far greater than she could ever imagine. The prestigious women's college that she's attending on a full academic scholarship is in Cutter's Circle, California, and Cutter's Circle has a dirty little secret: it has the highest population of serial killers in the country. The town is up to its proverbial severed head in murderers.\n\nCreator Larime Taylor grew up on the deadpan humor of eighties cult classic Heathers, the quirky absurdism of Edward Scissorhands, and far too many bad slasher flicks. Mixing tongue-in-cheek black comedy with gritty drama and suspense, his resulting creation proudly wears its influences on its sleeve. He writes, draws, tones, and letters the book himself, which is envisioned as an ongoing monthly series of 18 black-and-white pages, densely packed with content in the vein of FELL.\nTHE IDEA\nI'm wanting DARK ZOEY to become an ongoing series at a creator-owned publisher, and rather than simply sending a pitch and 5 sample pages, I want to send potential publishers an entire, finished #1. That's where YOU come in.\nBy helping me cover the costs of creating and self-publishing this issue, you'll get a copy of it of your very own. If it gets picked up by a publisher, great, but either way you get a copy. The best case scenario is that you get a rare #1 BEFORE it gets published and hits shelves. The worst  case scenario is you get a comic book you helped create. \nIt's a win-win situation.\nIf things go REALLY well, who knows? I might just continue self-publishing.\nTHE ART", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "Books To Ship", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Sylv Has Cancer", "update_content": "I've had to change dates for my trip to SDCC this year - I'll be there Saturday and Sunday now instead of Friday.

She was fortunate to have great musicians like Larry Campbell (Bob Dylan, Levon Helm) and Jon Graboff (Ryan Adams, Shooter Jennings) contribute their talents.  The title 'City Songs' speaks to the past few formative years of Anna's life living in various large cities.  It is in these places that Anna's songwriting has taken shape and, somewhat ironically, formed her love and appreciation for her Country & Americana roots, musically and otherwise.  \nWhile the album was made with a renowned producer and contributing musicians, Anna is now on her own with the finished product.  She is using Kickstarter to be able to start getting the word out about herself and her debut album.  She will use any and all funding to promote the album, tour, and shop it around for wider distribution.  While she has set her goal at $7,000, she is hoping to double this goal in order to have the opportunity to get her album in as many people's hands as possible.
