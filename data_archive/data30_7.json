His live performances have been honed over a decade of being on the road performing more than 200 shows each year. Elliott is lauded as \u201cIowa\u2019s Renaissance man\u201d by Culture Buzz Magazine. He has penned more than 1,500 songs in his career while also cultivating his skills as a painter, sculptor, illustrator and author (Wilderman\u2019s Treetop Tales; Rumble & Flash).\u201cThat man\u2019s music is as honest as was Woody Guthrie\u2019s.\u201d - Atesh Sonneborn, Smithsonian Folkways RecordingsElliott\u2019s early career demonstrates a love of folk, roots and singer-songwriter music. He has worked with many greats and shared the stage with artists of the highest caliber, including Odetta, Tom Paxton, Loudon Wainwright III, R.L. Burnside, Ruthie Foster, Jimmie Vaughan, Greg Brown, Bo Ramsey, etc.On his 20th album, Wreck and Ruin, Elliott dove into his love of roots-rock, soul and blues music with a rocking band behind his artfully crafted songs. Producer and drummer, Ken Coomer (Wilco, Uncle Tupelo) lined up the best rhythm and lead players in Nashville to create Elliott\u2019s greatest album to date. Guitarist and bassist Kenny Vaughan and Dave Roe, legendary Nashville players, add the needed touches to rocket Elliott\u2019s songs into a new arena of hard driving Americana.\u201cChad Elliott has assembled not only a great group of songs, but some of Nashville's finest roots music practitioners and producer drummer Ken Coomer to make a soulful and beautiful album. Townes would be proud.\u201d - Will Kimbrough about Wreck and RuinOn his 21st album, RINGGOLD, Elliott recorded songs at his home studio in Iowa. The studio, built in his grandparents\u2019 former home, helped him connect with his roots and explore difficult songs about those closest to him. It was released in 2017.\u200bToday, with his band The Redemptions, there is a marked shift in his sound that is entirely original. Elliott released his 22nd album, Rest Heavy: The Sun Studio Sessions, in 2018. Greg Brown said of the new album, it\u2019s \u201clow, loose and full of juice. This album\u2019s got a lot of life to it.\u201dWith Rest Heavy, Elliott shows his love of roots-rock, soul, and blues music with a rocking band behind his artfully crafted songs and gravelly delivery. Elliott, performing on acoustic guitar and harmonica, is joined by his full band, The Redemptions, including Tommy Lewis, Travis McFarlane, Kevin Boehnke, Joseph Cafaro, and Jim Van Dorn. The self-produced album was recorded at the famed Sun Studio in Memphis, TN by Ples Hampton. Hampton said, \u201cIt was honestly one of the best sessions I've ever had up here. This is gold.\u201dIn November 2019 Elliott released a new album, King Pelican. This album holds 8 tracks recorded live with his band, The Redemptions, during a set for The Sun Studio Sessions documentary series featured on PBS. The show is currently airing nationwide. The entire album delivers the goods. It is a colorful album including songs such as the title track, a fun New Orleans-style number about a ne'er-do-well character, and \"Paris,\" which would make Humphrey Bogart shed a tear. King Pelican was released Nov. 3, 2019.", "websites": ["chadelliott.net"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/chadelliott", "name": "Chad Elliott", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 13 projects", "location": "Lamoni, IA", "joined_date": "Joined Jan 2013"}, [{"title": "Avey Grouws Band: \"Tell-Tale Heart\" - Our 2nd Album", "content": "\"Tell-Tale Heart\" is the highly-anticipated follow up album to the top 10 Billboard Blues Charting album, The Devil May Care.", "project_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aveygrouwsnewalbum/avey-grouws-band-tell-tale-heart-our-2nd-album?ref=profile_backed", "creator_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/aveygrouwsnewalbum?ref=profile_backed", "pledged_amt": "$7,504", "fund_percentage": "46%funded", "project_category": "Music", "project_location": "Bettendorf, IA"}, {"title": "Avey/Grouws Band: The Devil May Care", "content": "The album is done.

Some of my friends call me \"John Quixote\" because my service dreams seem to be too big and impossible. I am 'nutty' in a good way (using my creativity to solve big problems that threaten our collective future). Every day, I look for ways to be grateful, and to celebrate the life I've been given... plus the Global Family that I am a part of. While growing up, my Mother gave me this elevating worldview: \"As we learn to see all of those around us as important sisters & brothers in our huge and beautiful extended family, our Global Family, then we can celebrate life better.\" It has been with the inspiration of many (local-global) that I was 'given' the words to author 'The Declaration of Peace Millennium' (Years 2000-3000) which is a thousand year plan for shaping our future. I'm excited to tell you that I also created \u00a9Atlanta: City of Peace\u2122, an ideal brand, and an organization that will transform the birthplace of Dr. King into a Global Capital of Peace. For today and everyday, I cherish my Rights and accept my Responsibility, as your brother in our Global Family, to propel hope for our future. Our GREAT future grows ever brighter as we all accept our Rights & Responsibilities to give back to the Beloved Community with gratitude in our Hearts & Minds.\u00a0Thank you.", "websites": ["facebook.com", "ATLpeace1000.com", "ATLpeace.org"], "url_link": "https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/atlpeacemaker", "name": "John R Naugle", "no_of_backed_proj": "Backed 78 projects", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "joined_date": "Joined Dec 2010"}, [{"title": "SKIP: A book connecting industrious people with land owners", "content": "A framework to connect industrious people with elderly land owners.
