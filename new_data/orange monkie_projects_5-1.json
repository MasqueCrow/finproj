[{"backer": "orange monkie", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "QTemp highlights the effects of UV radiation on skin health as well as provides a simple way to measure the temperature in user's\u2019 immediate surroundings. It estimates safe sun time based on the user\u2019s location, severity of local UV radiation and skin type that make it perfect for helping people safely spend time outdoors.\nQTemp is an awesome gadget with a companion app that helps you make your life healthier and more comfortable. We designed QTemp to be simple, convenient and durable.\nCompatible with all smartphones\nWe believe technology should make our lives simpler. QTemp is easy to set up and use. Just tap QTemp on or pair QTemp-i with your smartphone. \nQTemp-i\nQTemp-i continuously measures UV and temperature and transmits them to your smartphone via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity based on the reading interval. The safe sun time will be adjusted based on the updated readings. It should face to the main source of UV to get the most accurate result. \nQTemp-i has a replaceable regular coin cell battery (CR2032). Battery lifetime depends on the frequency of measurements. It is compatible with iPhone 4s & later, iPad 3rd generation & later and select Android devices with 4.3 and later with Bluetooth 4 and Windows Phone 10. \nQTemp-i easily works with iPhone and Android devices.\nQTemp\nOnce you tap QTemp on your smartphone, it measures weather data and transmits them to your smartphone. Based on your location and the time of measurement, QTemp estimates UV intensity for the next couple hours and adjusts the safe sun time.\nQTemp is battery-free and doesn't require any charging. It harvests energy from your smartphone via Near Field Communication (NFC) technology. Check this link to know if your phone is NFC enabled device. If your smartphone doesn\u2019t support NFC, choose QTemp-i.\nEasily tap QTemp on your NFC enable devices (Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone).\nQTemp or QTemp-i?\nBoth devices use the same sensors for measuring UV index and temperature, their function is completely similar. There are 3 main differences between QTemp and QTemp-i: \n1- Transferring data: QTemp-i uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity, so it is compatible with both iOS and Android devices; However, QTemp communicates with smartphones via Near Field Communication (NFC) Technology, a feature that iPhone doesn\u2019t support. \n 2- Power: QTemp-i requires a battery although QTemp is battery-free. It's a passive device and harvests energy from your smartphone. \n 3- Continuously measuring: QTemp-i can continuously measure and transfer data based on the reading interval. Data can be stored in on-board memory even when your smartphone is not connected to QTemp-i. However, QTemp is a passive gadget. Once you tap it on your smartphone, it measures and transfers data.\nDifference between QTemp-i and QTemp\nIf you are an iPhone user, select the 'Kickstarter Special' (QTemp-i) or 'TWO QTemp-i' perk.\nQTemp estimates how long you can stay outdoors before getting sunburned or developing skin damage. The calculation is based on:\n1. Measured UV index specific to users' location in real time.\n2. Environmental factors affect a person's UV exposure. Urban area, snow, green space, water and sand (beach or desert) reflect UV and increase exposure.\n3. Users' skin type based on the Fitzpatrick skin type.\nQTemp app helps you to identify your skin type based on the Fitzpatrick Skin Type\nPLAY\n\nQTemp gives you complete and accurate weather data to help you lead a healthier and more comfortable lifestyle. It provides recommendations based on the weather data and alerts you to protect your skin when safe sun time is over.\nMost people associate UV with warm temperature; however, UV rays hit people on cold days as well. QTemp is an ideal source of protection for people living in high-temperature or snowy locations or for those \u2018seeking the sun\u2019 during vacations. It is particularly useful for parents and young people, in addition to people with sensitive skin. \nQTemp fits comfortably on a key-ring. It can be as discreet or as visible as you want it to be. It is rain, splash and water-resistant. You can wear it all day, every day.\nStick QTemp on both sides of window, know the indoor and outdoor temperature and UV with just two taps via NFC technology.\nPrevent Harmful UV Rays\n1 in 5 Americans, 1 in 7 Canadians and 2 in 3 Australians are developing skin cancer in their lives, mostly because of overexposure to the sun. Therefore, we need new tools to identify and implement effective strategies that improve sun-protective behaviors. The aim of QTemp is to help people lead healthier lifestyles by preventing them from being overexposed to harmful UV rays. For more information visit the QTemp website. \nKnow the Weather Right Where You Are\nSmartphones nowadays have advanced greatly with different capabilities being added to the ongoing list of things they can perform. Sensor-packed phones have the ability to measure and detect a lot of things. To indicate the ambient temperature; they only detect a rise or fall in internal battery temperature. If a user wants to measure the temperature and UV of the immediate surroundings, then QTemp is the device to do that. \nWeather Apps vs. Actual Weather\nQuestions or Suggestions? Visit the QTemp website. We would love to answer your questions. Just email us at info@QTemp.co and we will reply as soon as we can.\nWhat about data? At QTemp, we believe that the data QTemp learns about you is yours! You can safely and securely access your data via your personal account. However, you can choose to make your weather data public on the QTemp Map or share it with friends on Facebook and Twitter.\nQTemp weather camera app enables users to add a weather overlay to their images. Users can share them with their friends via email or their favorite social networks.\nCustomize your selfies and other images with overlays of current weather conditions by QTemp app\nThe Weather Camera app is great for posting travel shots. You can share your feelings and what you\u2019re seeing with your friends.\nEveryone is exposed to UV radiation from the sun and an increasing number of people are exposed to artificial sources used in the industry, recreation and tanning beds. A moderate degree of UV exposure is necessary for the production of Vitamin D, which is essential for bone health. However, excessive exposure to UV radiation is associated with different types of sunburn, accelerated skin aging, cataracts and other eye diseases and skin cancers. Children and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of UV radiation. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, even one bad sunburn as a baby, child, or young adult, can increase risk over time. \nAccording to the Skin Cancer Foundation website about 2.8, 0.7 and 0.07 million are diagnosed with BCC, SCC and melanoma each year in the US.\nEven though UV rays make up only a very small portion of the sun\u2019s rays, they are the main cause of the sun\u2019s damaging effects on the skin. Many factors affect the UV intensity, which subsequently alters the UV index. This then affects the amount of time that you can spend in the sun before starting to burn.\nWhile both UVA and UVB rays can harm the skin and lead to skin cancers, UVB (cause of getting sunburned), is effectively blocked by glass. However, at least 50% of UVA radiation (which accelerates aging) can pass through windows. According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, car windows have been proven to let in more than 60%.\nA 35-year-old melanoma survivor\u2019s skin under normal light and UV light.\nIn the late winter and early spring, snow reflects up to 80% of the UV light from the sun, meaning that you are often hit by the same rays twice. That's why you need to protect your eyes and wear sun glasses on a snowy day. In the spring and fall, UV radiation from the sun can be very strong, especially in the spring when ozone depletion is of concern. Also, UV rays can bounce off surfaces like water, sand, snow, pavement, or grass, leading to an increase in UV exposure. \nVelcro, magnet and double sided tape will allow you to place QTemp on any surface.\n How do I get the mount?\nFor existing backers: Click \"Manage My Pledge\" on the main project page and increase your existing pledge by C$5 (there are no additional shipping charges) \n For new backers: Add C$5 to the pledge amount for the device you want (eg, if you'd like a QTemp for C$25, pledge C$30) \n Indicate in the backer survey following the campaign that you've pledged an extra C$5 to have a mount included with your QTemp or QTemp-i.  \nWe'll take care of the rest!\nThe perfect gift for tech lovers!\nWe started with a simple concept of improving people's health through analyzing weather data. We worked through countless research papers, development projects, prototypes, tests, and early marketing activities. We've received amazing encouragement and support along the way. Now we're ready to go to market and are asking for your help to gear up for manufacturing and development. \nWe are a team of designers, engineers and marketers with a passion for developing new products. We have worked on several projects to enhance outdoor thermal comfort over the last few years.After working on QTemp for the last year, we are still constantly working on it to ensure that it\u2019s the best it can be.\nWe have managed to aggregate enough resources to cover development, BUT we need YOUR HELP. We\u2019ve been building and iterating prototypes for the past year, and now we need your help getting our latest prototype up to manufacturing standards. Your support will help us through the DVT (Design Verification Testing), and PVT (Production Verification Testing) processes so that we can ship QTemp to you in June next year. \nWe launched QTemp campaign on Kickstarter because we believe in collaborating with our future customers to help us develop a world-class product. Kickstarter allows us to get in touch with passionate, like-minded, forward thinkers who can provide invaluable feedback.\nWe will be working closely with the manufacturers to make sure that everything runs as smoothly as possible and you will get your QTemp in time. \nInternational Backers: We will ship QTemp worldwide. Please note that you are responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to your region. Shipping QTemp is free in the US and Canada for early backers. Packages will come with regular post (no tracking number). \nWe're excited at the prospect of reaching our target so that we can begin delivering QTemp to the world, but we've also had some thoughts about what we'll do if we move beyond our funding goal. Surpassing our target will enable us to add extra features to the product:\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are excited that our project is helping to develop new components and feel that is what Kickstarter is all about in addition to helping raise funds. The nature of developing new tech mean that there is a possibility of unforeseen delays and supply chain risk. We adjusted our timeline to avoid that, however, we may have to update it.\n\nThe QTemp team is an execution-oriented team and confident in our ability to reach our goal. We understand that you\u2019re trusting us to deliver on our promise. We value integrity and will conduct our business at the highest ethical standards.\n\nWe will make sure to be transparent with our supporting backers by offering regular campaign updates and by answering questions from the backer community as they arise.

Not only is it practical, Okii 2.0 embodies elegance. My objective is to create key accessories that you can be proud to carry.\nOrganised. \nOkii 2.0 transforms your cluster of keys to a neatly organised stack. You can arrange keys in your order of preference, which will help you locate the right key quickly and effortlessly.\nQuiet.\nOkii 2.0 is truly silent. It just won\u2019t rattle! Perfect for keeping in your pocket when jogging and perfect for sneaking up on people!\nPersonalised.\nOkii 2.0 design comes in a wide selection of anodised colours to choose from. You can have several frame to suit your style and occasion with your key accessories.\nFlexible.\nOkii 2.0 caters for both minimalist and traditionalists. Whether you have 4 keys or 8 keys, the Okii 2.0 will stay compact and organised! Your keys will fit comfortably into any pocket or bag!\nPacked with features. \nThe Okii 2.0 is like a Swiss army knife for keys, spice up your Okii 2.0 with a USB stick, bottle opener, screwdriver, k-slice and k-tool.\nWill my keys fit?\nYou can use most standard keys with Okii 2.0.\nMy goal is to provide you with more materials and accessories options. When I reach certain number of backers, I will be releasing more materials / accessories for you to choose from. Please help me spread the word to make it happen! More stretch goals coming so stay tuned!\nWhere is Your Money Going?\nI funded the prototype with my own money. But setting up a full manufacturing process is expensive \u2014 I can\u2019t do it alone. Until I get large enough for huge orders.\nThe Manufacturing Process: Next Steps\nI have already arranged for manufacturers in London to make the aluminium frame. Once I secure the funding, I can pay for the material, tooling and finishing cost.\nOkii Machined from a solid block of high grade aluminium, machining to tight tolerances with precision and quality a high priority. Each material finish was tested and chosen to bring out the best qualities of the material and to enhance the design.\nI have worked on designing and building prototypes, during this time I have had dozens of prototypes machined, tweaking the design numerous times to produce something I'am proud of.\nAfter each Okii 2.0 is finished and checked, and then laser engraved with subtle branding so not to take away from the overall design. Working with the manufacturer I have manufacturing schedules, assembly and packaging arranged. I have arranged everything I need to make Okii 2.0 a perfect product.\nI plan to begin production as soon as I reach my goal so I can deliver as soon as possible. With your help it can be before schedule.\nInternational backers.\nInternational backers need not worry about additional shipping costs. We have a flat \u00a37 shipping no matter where you are in the world, or how many items you order. \nThank you for your pledge in advance, and for sharing this campaign with as many people as you can, through word of mouth, social media and email.

I'll take a photo using the prototypes and upload it for you!\nHere are some of the photos people have requested so far!\nSee the project update for more details.\nAlso, for anyone who has Photoshop, one of my awesome backers has created a .psd file that allows you to play around with the colour options!\nWhy?\nAt the end of last year, I lost my wallet. It was a bulky, faux leather wallet full of cards I didn't use, receipts I would never look at again and coins that might never see the light of day. And that's why I lost it - it was in my back pocket and simply fell out due to its weight and bulk.\nI decided to make a new wallet. A better wallet. One that was small, only carried what was necessary and wasn't easy to lose.\nEmpty traditional wallet compared to Minimo holding several cards\nFeatures of the Minimo wallet\nSlim design, hardly noticeable in any pocket\nShields your cards from RFID readers\nInnovative middle plate helps divide your cards\nComes in a huge range of interchangeable colours\nSecure\nLightweight\nComfortably carries 1-10 cards + cash\nDurable\nVery easy access to your cards and cash\nSilicone band prevents wallet from slipping out of your pocket, but is still easy to remove whenever needed\nThe Design\nFunctionality was key. The main purpose of a wallet is to store cards and cash. Finding the required card, removing it and putting it back inside the wallet needed to be as straightforward and simple as possible.\nMinimo started life as a rough, unglamourous prototype made out of cardboard and elastic. Gradually improving versions of it would come everywhere with me to make use of any opportunity for testing!\nAfter months and months of testing, Minimo eventually graduated from cardboard to metal and I had several different prototypes made, changing small details every time, until I finally came up with the perfect design.\nThe Minimo wallet is made up of three pieces of aircraft grade aluminium secured together with a silicone strap.\nThe four components of the wallet\nAll wallets come with three plates and the middle plate serves three functions:\n1. It acts as a divider, giving the wallet two compartments - separate your business cards, reward cards, credit/debit cards and so on.\n2. It allows you to carry more cards as it provides extra stability.\n3. It allows you to fan out the cards with your fingers (see the image of the green wallet below)\nIf you want to make your wallet even more minimalistic and decide you don't need it, simply take out the middle plate.\nWith and without the middle plate\nThe corners of the plates are rounded to make handling more comfortable and to help prevent them digging into clothing. The outside plates are slightly convex so, when placed together, a small gap is created. It's often quite difficult to insert a single card into a minimalist metal wallet but this feature makes it easier.\nCurve on outer plates\nCoin Plates\nMost minimalist wallets don't carry coins, and for good reason - coins are bulky, heavy and, in most situations, not really necessary these days. But what happens when you need just one or two coins for a parking meter or a supermarket trolley? I developed an optional alternative outside plate to combat this problem.\nIt's slightly thicker and has spaces machined into it to allow you to carry coins or other small items. Other than that, it works in exactly the same way as the regular outside plate and the silicone band holds the coins in place.\nI had originally intended to introduce the coin plates as a stretch goal or post-Kickstarter. However, a lot of people wanted them to be available now... so they are! You can either select the new reward tier that includes a coin plate OR add \u00a310.25 to any other pledge amount.\nPlease read the update for some important details about the coin plate.\nHere it is in action with three \u00a31 coins:\nHere are some items that fit in it:\nAnd here are the five designs to vote for!\nUsing the wallet\nPush your cards up to reveal them, then squeeze the plates together to fan them out.\nSqueezing the plates to fan through cards\nPushing from one side will give you access to all your cards while pushing from the other side allows you to select the cards from just one compartment.\nOr, if you prefer, you can fan them out with your fingers.\nCash can be stored either inside the wallet or underneath the band (you can also store cards there), whichever you prefer.\nThe Minimo wallet can comfortably carry 1 - 10 cards and several notes but can stretch to more when necessary.\nTo swipe a card, simply slide it out part way, use it and slide it back in.\nFinishing the Metal\nAs cards need to slide against the metal plates, it was important to achieve the ultimate finish. The edges are all smoothed off for comfort when using the wallet. Then the plates are completely polished on both sides to give as smooth a finish as possible. Finally, the outside surfaces are aqua blasted to give a more even look to the metal.\nThe inside surfaces (which, of course, aren't visible when the wallet's in use) are not aqua blasted in order to leave them with as smooth a texture as possible.\nRFID\nAs the wallet is made of aluminium it helps block RFID scanners. Different scanners and cards have varying strengths so while I am satisfied with how well the Minimo blocks signals, please remember that the only way to 100% shield from RFID scanners is to completely encase your cards in metal.\nColours\nIt was important, when designing the wallet, that it should be available in a range of classic and contemporary colours, giving it wide appeal and allowing it to be customised for complete individuality.\nEach of the plates and the band can be whichever of the colours you want, allowing you to create unique and fun wallets. It's actually possible to create over 20,000 different colour combinations!\nThe Next Stage\nTo get Minimo into production, I need to fulfil a minimum order quantity with the manufacturers. This is where Kickstarter comes in - I simply don't have the funds to do it without backers.\nI already have the manufacturers lined up and worked with them all during the prototyping process. The people involved were all very professional and incredibly enthusiastic about the wallet.\nOnce the individual parts are finished, they will be inspected thoroughly and assembled by hand. The estimated delivery date is November to allow plenty of time but we'll aim to get them to you before then!\nIf funding is successful, every backer will receive an email once their wallet has been shipped, keeping everyone as informed as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDuring the design and prototype processes and spending the best part of a year working on the Minimo wallet, I have built up good relationships with all of the companies I will be using. They are all based in England, are specialists in their particular areas and are enthusiastic about being part of Minimo.\n\nI believe that during the prototype period I identified (and eliminated) most of the risks and that the final version of the wallet is good to go in every respect.\n\nI have allowed a good amount of time to fulfil production and will be 100% open with my backers with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Just launched!
