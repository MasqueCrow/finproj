Tunnel through the land as The Great Underground Duchy. Infiltrate the hands of your opponents with the Corvid Conspiracy. And, with two additional maps, new and experienced players have never had so many ways to explore Root!   \nIn the fall of 2017, we brought Root to Kickstarter. With your support, we expanded the scope of the game, offering new factions and improvements to the game\u2019s components. It has been an immense privilege and a pleasure to bring Root to market, and we couldn\u2019t have done it without you all. \nShortly after the game\u2019s release, we began to see eager players and designers produce new content for the game. We understood the impulse\u2014even as we had moved to other projects, everyone in the office continued thinking about Root and working on new content for the game on their own.  \nIn the winter, Patrick pitched his concept for a new expansion: two new factions and two new maps, built to expand the possible faction configurations and offer totally new styles of play. Patrick handed the design to Nick Brachmann and Cole Wehrle for final development and, after months of work, the game is ready to share.\nWith this Kickstarter, we want to raise funds to print the new expansion and another large run of existing Root products. In the past, we\u2019ve always done our best to take care of our Kickstarter backers. Root: The Underworld Expansion will be no different. Backers who pledge at a level that includes the new expansion will also get a set of custom Vagabond meeples, a set of resin clearing markers, and an alternative deck (The Exiles and Partisans) for free!  \nIn addition, we\u2019ve got a new set of automated factions built in collaboration with Benjamin Schmauss and his Better Bot Project. And, for our returning backers, we have a full set of new faction boards with the rules updates from the third printing. If you'd like to play with these alterations without buying the replacement boards, you can find the update kit on our website. \nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. First released in the summer of 2018, Root was the next chapter in our exploration of truly asymmetric game design. Like our previous title, Vast: The Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different way to win. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. With creatures and cunning, you'll rule a fantastic forest kingdom in the ultimate asymmetric game of adventure and war. \nIn Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. \nOver the past year, Root has inspired players around the world. Just check out this amazing video tribute from Boris Ignjatovic and Sanja Ignjatovic. \nThe Corvid Conspiracy ransoms the hands of their opponents by filling them with their agents. Using these agents, the Corvids can trigger insidious plots and advance their own agenda. But as each plot comes to fruition, their hideout must move to a different forest in the Woodland before their great conspiracy is unmasked!   \nFor generations the Duchy extended its reach through the caverns below the great woods. Now, newly elected lords in the Duchy's Parliament have raised a call to explore the lands above. Armies have been mustered and new tunnels prepared for the coming struggle. The creatures of the woods will soon learn to fear the great power beneath their feet.\nThe struggle for dominance continues in the great mountains to the northeast of the Woodland. Fight for control of the narrow mountain pass or dig new tunnels to the great mountain caverns.   \nThe conflict moves west to the homeland of the Riverfolk! Battle for control over the great lake by skillfully managing the ancient riverboat.

Now, with designer Hisashi Hayashi, we bring you the brand new two player experience set in Meiji Era Japan, Yokohama Duel.\nAs before, we are offering up this brand new game is a Kickstarter Exclusive Deluxified\u2122 edition, with upgraded components that are certain to add to the enjoyment of the game.\nIn Yokohama Duel, you and your opponent are merchants in Yokohama, trying to succeed in your business ventures which will gain you prestige. You need to fulfill various goals, which involving amassing copper, silk, tea and seafood, mastering foreign technology, and building shop houses and trading houses. To achieve these goals, you need to run around the streets of Yokohama and gain benefits from the various districts. Also, it may be a wise strategy to employ foreign agents to your side to aid your cause. It is a contest to decide which player can deploy their subordinates the most successfully to become the best merchant in Yokohama!\nYou may notice that the components for the Deluxified\u2122 version of Yokohama Duel are already improved and are not dependent upon Stretch Goals to be upgraded. We are loading up Yokohama Duel with top of the line additions from the get go so all of our backers don't have to worry if they are going to get a full Deluxified\u2122 game with their pledge - they will! - and as the campaign continues, we have several additions in mind that will make the Deluxified\u2122 version even better! \nLook below for the comparison of the Retail version to the Deluxe to see how these components will be upgraded!\nTasty Minstrel Games is of the opinion that amazing games should also look amazing while you are playing them. This is why we offer an upgraded version of our releases when we have a Kickstarter campaign. Ever since we first undertook this process, with the game Orleans, the Deluxified\u2122 versions of our games have proven to be fan favorites, and we think that our Deluxe version of Yokohama Duel will continue this amazing tradition that some of our other games like Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done and Yokohama helped forge.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 version of Yokohama Duel matches our cost to make and deliver it to you, the backer, with no additional profit. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some for convention sales in Limited Quantity. Backing this Kickstarter at the Deluxified\u2122 level is the only way that you can guarantee yourself a Deluxe copy of Yokohama Duel.\nClick on the banner above to read the rules!\nPlease note, these are the original translated rules. They are being reworked by our development team for clarification purposes. \nReprinting Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama!?!  WHY?\nDuring the Orleans Deluxe Kickstarter project, we promised never to print the deluxe version of the game again. After seeing the disappointment of those who missed the opportunity to get Orleans Deluxe, we updated our pledge on Yokohama to allow for that possibility. We didn't expect to produce the Deluxified\u2122 version more than once, but we left the door open just in case we changed our mind.\nWe only make Deluxified\u2122 games through crowdfunding. This approach allows us to cover the additional cost of Deluxified\u2122 components and provide an excellent value to all, while looking forward to the continued growth of our hobby and audience.\nIt pains us to watch people new to the hobby, or new to Kickstarter, miss out on Deluxified\u2122 games. In order to address that, we have decided to open the vault, so to speak. When we feel that the time is right, we will offer select Deluxified\u2122 games through a new crowdfunding project. We do not expect that every Deluxified\u2122 game will come back to Kickstarter, but it feels good to know that we can support our Deluxified\u2122 brand with crowdfunded reprints when necessary.\nAnd for those of you who own a copy of the retail version of Yokohama, we are offering up an upgrade pack that will give you the extra components you need to upgrade your play experience without having to purchase a whole new game!\nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game. Yokohama Duel will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped inside a custom fitted box to ensure maximum safety when being shipped to you.. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy.   \nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of the above countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you!  \nFriendly Local Game Stores are an invaluable part of this hobby that we love, and we appreciate everything they do to bring value to the industry. We want to support them in any way we can. \n The $121 pledge level grants you as a retailer an invitation to the Crowdox pledge manager where you can purchase Yokohama Duel Deluxe in case quantities (e.g. 4, 8, or 12). The $121 will be applied towards your final purchase at checkout. \nRetailers are required to finalize their checkout no later than August of 2019. However, you must complete the survey through Crowdox promptly once the survey goes live. This will allow TMG to properly determine how many to manufacture.\nRetailers must have a US based address. If you live outside of the US, please determine a US base address for your freight forwarder. If you haven't done so in the past, you are required to provide TMG with proof of being a retailer. \nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will be among the most active and connected to be found on the crowd funding platform.      \nTo achieve this, TMG will do the following:  \nFor the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 business hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff.\nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis (but not continuously monitored) every day and questions will be answered at those times.  \nAfter the campaign has concluded, any questions about the campaign should be directed through normal TMG support lines, or through direct message on Kickstarter. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers.  \nAfter the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal email support lines. \nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay.

Since it sold out several years ago, we have received countless inquiries about when it would be coming back, and original copies of the game currently sell for nearly $300 on the aftermarket. From our perspective, it seems demand for a new edition has reached critical mass, and it\u2019s time to reprint. But is it? You decide!\nThis Kickstarter campaign has been created to fund a newly printed, second edition of the LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] board game. As it is impossible for us to gauge the true demand for the game, speculating on a reprint and distributing it through traditional channels is too risky and could result in a warehouse full of product. So, we\u2019ve turned to Kickstarter to determine the actual demand for a reprint with the express mission of fulfilling orders for backers of this campaign. Thus, the product will not be produced unless we hit our funding goal.\nTo keep things streamlined and deliver the new edition as quickly as possible, no stretch goals or add-ons will be offered through this Kickstarter. \n\u201cThere is no Subterra Bravo.\u201d\nLEVEL 7 is a sinister science fiction setting where nefarious conspiracies conceal the government\u2019s collaboration deep within an underground research facility with an unspeakable alien menace. Officially, the top-secret military base doesn\u2019t exist. There is no record of it: no blueprints, no photographs, no credible accounts. Rumors persist, but no one has ever found it. And those who have dared to look have disappeared\u2026\n\u201cTheir greatest weapon is fear. Yours is an assault rifle.\u201d\nNow overrun with swarms of monstrous genetic creations led by their nefarious alien overseers, the underground facility of Subterra Bravo is the epicenter of an unfathomable government conspiracy\u2014one that must be kept secret at all costs. To cover up the truth, the shadowy agency in charge of the operation has initiated the Omega Protocol, dispatching an elite team of commandos to retake Subterra Bravo and eradicate all evidence of the sinister creatures within. But the threat these creatures and their alien overlords pose may be far greater than anyone can possibly imagine.\nLEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] is a semi-cooperative tactical miniatures game for 2\u20136 players. In it, a fire team of highly trained commandos sent by an unspecified department within the U.S. government attempts to pacify the situation at Subterra Bravo and the sinister swarms of inhuman creatures that have overtaken the facility. Up to five players take on the role of commandos while one player acts as the overseer and takes control of the creatures inhabiting Subterra Bravo with the goal of ensuring the human intruders know true terror before they meet their grisly fate.\nDuring the game, commandos clash with the overseer\u2019s creatures, and dice rolls determine the results of the conflict. In addition, both the commandos and the overseer manage a resource called adrenaline. Commandos use adrenaline to perform heroic actions; the overseer uses adrenaline to fortify his forces. Careful management of adrenaline is key to winning the game.\nBefore each game, players select one of the missions included in the mission guide. Each mission presents the players with specific objectives they need to complete to win the game and describes the Crisis Point at which each mission becomes more difficult. The commandos will either win or lose as a team while the overseer wins or loses as an individual.\nThe game can also be played as a campaign in which players play each of the nine missions contained in the mission guide sequentially to experience the epic story of LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL]. \nThe EXTREME PREJUDICE expansion and this Kickstarter\u2019s bonus content add new creatures, characters, missions, and game cards to continue your adrenaline-fueled adventure!\nRULEBOOK DOWNLOAD LINK\nDownload the full *First Edition* rules for LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL] here (second edition rules coming soon):\n First Edition Rulebook Download \nTOP TEN GAMES OF 2013\n\u2014Tom Vasel\nTOP TEN SCI-FI GAMES\n\u2014Dice Tower\n\u201cWELL DONE, PRIVATEER PRESS, FOR GIVING DUNGEON CRAWLERS A SHOT OF ADRENALINE.\u201d\n\u2014The Esoteric Order of Gamers\n\u201cEXCEPTIONAL DEPTH AND STRATEGY\u2026LOOKS AMAZING WITH EXCELLENT ART AND SCADS OF MINIATURES\u201d\n\u2014Drake\u2019s Flames\n\u201cANY FAN OF THIS PARTICULAR GENRE IS GOING TO BE QUITE IMPRESSED WITH THE QUALITY OF THE DESIGN.\u201d\n           \u2014Nohighscores.com\n (Included in the Known Enemy, New Operator, and Fully Loaded Reward Tiers)\nTo celebrate the second edition of LEVEL 7 [OMEGA PROTOCOL], we\u2019ve added a new exclusive Commander figure, available only through this Kickstarter, as well as new game cards, room tiles, tokens, and an exclusive white die that can be used with the all-new mission content.

Go to robots.management for the most up-to-date print & play files, release information, and more! \nInhuman Conditions is a five-minute, two-player game of surreal interrogation and conversational judo, set in the heart of a chilling bureaucracy.\nEach game has one Investigator and one Suspect. Armed only with two stamps and a topic of conversation, the Investigator must figure out whether the Suspect is a Human or a Robot.\nRobots must answer the Investigator's questions without arousing suspicion, but are hampered by some specific malfunction in their ability to converse. They must be clever, guiding the conversation in subtle ways without getting caught.\nHumans may speak freely, but may find this freedom as much curse as gift. There are no right or wrong answers, only suspicious and innocuous ones, and one slip of the tongue could land Humans and Robots alike in the Bureau's Invasive Confirmation Unit. There, alongside Investigators who make improper determinations, they will await further testing ...\nCurrent box sketch\nInhuman Conditions is designed by Tommy Maranges (Secret Hitler, Philosophy Bro) and Cory O'Brien (Myths Retold, Monster Prom) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Secret Hitler, Letter Tycoon).\n In each game of Inhuman Conditions, there are two players: one Suspect and one Investigator. The players agree on a theme for the round, and the Investigator is given a series of question prompts related to that theme. Then the Suspect is randomly assigned an identity as either a Human or a Robot. Sometimes Robots are peaceful, and other times they're violent; but their weaknesses always cluster around the chosen theme being investigated.\nRobot catalyzers determine whether the Suspect is Human or Robot.\nAdditionally, the players agree on a penalty that will be face up on the table. Robot Suspects must perform the penalty if they violate their constraint or if they cannot finish their checklist; humans never have a reason to perform the penalty, and should avoid performing it accidentally.\nFinally, the Suspect chooses a Suspect Note, which is a roleplaying prompt that helps the Suspect develop a character for the round.\nThe Investigator always has the same two goals, which go hand in hand: \n Ensure all Human Suspects are properly identified as HUMAN\nAND\nEnsure all Robot Suspects are identified as ROBOT and safely detained. \nThe Investigator loses if the Suspect is incorrectly identified, or if they are killed during the course of their duties by a Violent Robot. \nAll Suspects, robots and humans alike, share one common, overriding objective: Convince the Investigator that you are a human. Any Suspect who is identified as a robot (whether or not that identification is correct) loses. Additionally, robots will have some programming which they must obey. Patient Robots must obey a constraint on their abilities or pay a penalty; Violent Robots must complete a checklist and then kill the Investigator.\nAt any point in the five minutes, the Investigator may declare the Suspect a Robot and order additional testing; a Violent Robot must complete its checklist before this can happen. If, however, at the end of five minutes, the Investigator believes the Suspect is a Human, the Suspect is free to go.\nInvestigators and Human Suspects win and lose together; Robot Suspects only win if they can fool the Investigator.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, nothing happens outside the conversation. there are no cards to count, no votes to track. The conversation is the event. Words don't explain or obscure your decisions; the words are the decisions. It's not just that everything you say can and will be used against you; it's also that there's nothing else you can rely on to defend yourself.\nHide your true nature from the inquisitive Bureau.\nAs a Patient Robot, conceal your true nature. Answer the investigator's questions, avoid certain behaviors, and outlast the Bureau's curiosity.\nPatient Robots must carefully conceal their weakness.\nPeaceful Robots must survive the entire round. For five tense minutes, find new ways to answer questions without arousing suspicion. Discover cleverness you didn't know you were capable of. Volunteer just enough information to throw the Investigator off the scent, without appearing uncooperative.\nAs a Violent Robot, go on the offensive, fulfilling a checklist of items during the conversation so you can kill the Investigator.\nViolent Robots must press the offensive.\nViolent Robots are on the offensive. Find the right opportunities to take control, move your goals forward, and fulfill your objective. Violent robots are more talkative than normal, and you must resist the impulse to strike too early without leaving everything for the very end.\nAs a Human, you must thread the needle. You have nothing to hide, but this works against you as often as it helps. If you're too talkative, the Investigator might think you're trying to kill them; not talkative enough, and the Investigator might wonder if you're hiding a constraint.\nBut remember, the goal is not to give correct answers (there are no correct answers!) but to give answers that don't seem suspicious to the Investigator, no matter how bizarre the character you've created is.\nAs an Investigator, your job is to tell the difference between these three roles. You'll ask pointed questions to expose robotic weaknesses in your Suspect, questions like\n\u201cWhat lie do you tell most often?\u201d\n\u201cWhere, physically, do you feel joy?\u201d\n\u201cWhen was the last time you saw your father cry?\u201d \nLines of Inquiry are provided to help Investigators, but where you take them is up to you.\nOr devise your own questions, improvising on the theme of the round. Watch carefully for behavioral clues: \"Why does he keep talking about dogs?\u201d, \u201cDid they rhyme those two words on purpose?\u201d, and \u201cIs she avoiding discussing her past because it\u2019s painful, or because she doesn\u2019t have one?\u201d\nLearn to focus on what's important, and trust your instincts. You'll encounter Suspects of all kinds, and telling the difference requires the right mix of intuition and knowledge. Sooner or later, everyone passes through the Bureau.\nInhuman Conditions combines the suspense and thrills of social deduction with the possibility and challenge of roleplaying games.\nEach Suspect chooses two cards\u2014the Robot Catalyzer, which determines whether they're Human or Robot, is private. The Suspect Note, which determines the role the Suspect must play, is public.\nSuspect Notes provide the beginnings of a character. Players decide how far to take it.\nIn games like Secret Hitler and Avalon, some event happens, and then players use conversation to make sense of that event.\nIn Inhuman Conditions, every Suspect, no matter what the Robot Catalyzer actually says, must convince the Investigator that they're Human, and the conversation is the only tool the Suspect has. The only way to convince the Investigator that you're Human... is to act convincingly like a human.\nOne of our favorite things about Inhuman Conditions is how playtesters enjoyed re-living the games they just played, hearing the perspective of others and sharing highlights from their inner monologue.\nAs with other social deduction games, players love talking about clues they noticed or strategies they tried. Investigators commiserate with Robots, bemoaning the one thing they wish they had followed up on, or proudly describing the small clues they caught. When Humans win, they celebrate with the Investigators who certified them; when Humans lose, they debate with the Investigator over whose fault it really was that they both lost.  \nBut they also love talking about the characters they created. It's unlike anything we've seen in any other social deduction game we've played. Playtesters consistently stayed late to re-live games and compliment each other on both clever maneuvers and hilarious or chilling characters. We still hear stories from our earliest playtests, and we can't wait to hear the stories from the games you play.\nBecause each round of Inhuman Conditions is only five minutes, players cycle in and out quickly. That means you don't need to decide between playing a game and hanging out. \nWe set out to create a social deduction game for two players, but through playtesting we discovered that the game is entertaining for more than just the two people involved in the interrogation. Inhuman Conditions to be as much fun to watch as it is to play. Playtesters often stayed late, swapping stories and complimenting clever maneuvers or twists that they had witnessed in other playtesters.   \nInhuman Conditions can be played on a quiet night in with a single friend, or at a bigger game night.  \nThe complete contents of the box.

But actually getting the game out into the world is going to be a big undertaking. We want to create a unique experience for players, and part of that is about the components. The stamps, the forms, the box, and the Investigator\u2019s badge all add to the atmosphere, which informs gameplay.

However, only a single player can win. As your coalition becomes powerful, former allies will turn to espionage and political subterfuge in an effort to secure their personal dominance.\nFor as long as I've been thinking about game design, I've wanted to do a game about European Empires in central Asia. This fifty-year cold war between the Russian and British Empires is sometimes called \"The Great Game.\" It's filled with compelling people from all walks of life and is set against a fascinating backdrop of espionage and empire-building. Think about it like a Victorian James Bond. Cool, right?\nWell, as I learned more about the period and about the study of history itself, it was clear that my first impressions were badly mistaken. The drama and romance of the period hid untold volumes of colonial violence. The imperialist policies put in place around the world at this time were unconscionable even by the measure of their own time. This was plainly not a good setting for the adventurous romp I had in mind.\nBut, as I dug further into the period, I started discovering another story, far more interesting than the tale of two European powers jockeying for position on the frontiers of their empires. The collapse of Durrani power in Afghanistan, which I had always understood as a secondary event, was actually the central drama of this place at this time. Though the Europeans played a critical role in the events that ensued, they are better understood as supporting characters in a dynastic struggle that lasted over a generation.\nWith this design, I hoped to reverse the standard tropes about games about empire and direct player's attention towards those struggling to pick up the pieces of their fallen order and build something new. Of course, one shouldn't romanticize them as well. Dost Mohammad was a ruthless and efficient ruler who viewed the British and Russian interests less as fearsome invaders than as regional rivals. He believed (correctly) that he could outlast and out-compete his foes. At its core, Pax Pamir is a game about finding sovereignty in an age of expanding global empires. It's also a game about trying to read and to understand complex geopolitical situations.\nIn preparing the game, I've done my best to consult a wide range of sources. The most important single document that informed this design was Fayz\u0307 Muh\u0323ammad Ka\u0304tib Haza\u0304rah's Sira\u0304j al-tawa\u0304ri\u0304kh. Written nearly two generations after the conflict, the Sira\u0304j al-tawa\u0304ri\u0304kh was the culmination of nearly twenty years of research and unparalleled access to primary documents (many of which are now lost). I also relied upon a wide range of secondary works ranging from popular histories such William Dalrymple's Return of a King to scholarly monographs such as Christine Noelle's State and Tribe in Nineteenth Century Afghanistan. A full bibliography and reading guide will be included with the rules.\nThe nineteenth century has cast a very long shadow over our own moment, and I hope this game, in its small way, offers new perspectives on complicated problems.\nBottom Shelf Board Games has produced a wonderful overview of the new edition that can be seen here.\nNote: The copy of the game featured in this edition uses an old version of the map and prototype components.\nThough Pax Pamir presents players with difficult strategic decisions that reward experienced and thoughtful players, the core of the game is simple. Most turns, players will purchase from a central marketplace.   \nAfter buying cards from the market, players can play them on their personal row of cards (called a Court). Playing cards like this will add new units into play, such as armies, roads, tribes, and spies. Each of these types of units has their own special utility.\nAdditionally, when a player expands their court, they gain access  to new actions which you can use to disrupt the game state. But, be careful, powerful cards on your court will attract the attention of enemy spies!\nPlayers score victory points by developing positions of influence in dominant coalitions. Influence can be gained by offering gifts to their supports, wooing patriots, and betraying high-value targets with your spies.\nHowever, too much infighting will likely prevent a coalition from achieving dominance. If no alliance can secure victory, personal power will be all that matters.\nPax Pamir: Second Edition can be played with one to five players. The game presents very different challenges at each player count.\nWith two or three players, Pax Pamir: Second Edition is a sharp affair, prone to sudden-death victories (in this way more like the first edition). The four and five player games tend to be longer, often extending until nearly every card has been bought. Larger games usually emphasize partnerships and player-to-player synergy, whereas the smaller games emphasize combo-building and diplomatic flexibility.\nIn the solo game, players will square off against an automated opponent. This opponent may be adjusted to be used in the two player game as well. Games with the automated opponent emphasize risk management and a deep knowledge of the game\u2019s core systems.\nThe rulebook for Pax Pamir: Second Edition can be found here. The solo rules are not yet included. Outside of that, the current rule set is complete, but has not yet been finalized. The final rule book will also include design essays, a bibliography, and a reading guide on the period.\nIn terms of components, this new edition improves on every element.\nIn terms of design, the second edition of Pax Pamir has offered me a chance to put into practice the many lessons I've learned over the past few years. I have done my best to simplify and streamline the rules of the game without compromising the game's strategic difficulty or interactivity.\nI have written about the changes of the edition at length here and here. But, briefly, they can be described as follows:\nThough these changes may seem small, fans of the first edition will quickly realize that Pax Pamir: Second Edition is very much its own game. \nI think that the differences can be best described as a shifting of priorities. At its core, the first edition focused on a player's ability to read and navigate an exceptionally difficult to track game-state. The shifting alliances between the players were a secondary concern. In contrast, the second edition elevates those player alliances to the fore. If you are interested in a further breakdown between the two editions, I'd encourage you to read Dan Thurot's excellent preview of the new edition. It can be found here. If you'd like a second opinion, check out Alex Singh's written preview here.\nIn short, though the rules are dramatically shorter and the design itself has been streamlined, Pax Pamir: Second Edition should not be mistaken for a light Pax game. While the new design is easier to teach, I think it remains a difficult game to master.\nIf we are able to raise sufficient funds on Kickstarter, Pax Pamir: Second Edition will be published by a new company, Wehrlegig Games. Our objective is simple: publish beautiful games with historical themes that treat their subjects and their players seriously. These are games that make arguments and encourage discussion. They don't shy away from difficult subjects.\nBecause we know the audience for such games is limited, in order to make sure we produce games up to our standards we have decided to rely on a direct sales model. The vast majority of all copies produced will be sent to Kickstarter backers. Hopefully we will be able to produce some additional copies which we will sell directly and to some retailers (MSRP $75). However, there are no plans to have this edition of the game enter regular distribution channels. This means we can spend many more resources on the game's physical production without having to worry about retail viability.\nCole Wehrle is a published writer and game designer who currently serves as a staff designer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. Before working in the board game industry, Cole earned his PhD at the University of Texas. His research concerned the ways that the British Empire influenced narrative structure in the nineteenth century novel. He has presented at conferences all over the world and taught classes on a wide range of subjects, from Classical Rhetoric to American Postmodernism. He is perhaps best known for his historical board games (An Infamous Traffic and John Company) and for his recent design, Root.\nDrew Wehrle is the older of Cole's two younger brothers. He has helped Cole develop every game he has ever designed. During the development of the first edition of Pax Pamir, Drew lived with Cole in Austin, Texas and was instrumental in preparing the game for publication. Drew will be handling all of the business and operational elements of Wehrlegig Games, as well as assisting in game development. He currently lives in Chicago where he is the School Programs Coordinator at the Chicago Botanical Garden. \nTravis Hill is a freelance board game rulebook editor, coffee connoisseur, corgi wrangler, and public high school educator. He co-hosts Low Player Count, a discussion-based podcast on 1-2 player board games. You can find all of his work here. After working on John Company last year, he is thrilled to work with Cole on yet another project.\nLily Zhu is a published writer on games who studied nineteenth century science and the British Empire as well as the digital humanities at the University of Texas at Austin. She and Cole hosted a brief podcast on games and politics while working together at the Digital Writing and Research Lab. Lily will be coordinating marketing strategy and customer service for Wehrlegig Games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production of Pax Pamir: Second Edition is a passion project for all involved. Cole, Drew, Travis, and Lily all are employed elsewhere, and work on this production will be limited mostly to evenings and weekends (and, for Cole, very early mornings). If the labor this project requires exceeds the amount of time we have allocated for it, we will not hesitate to hire help.\n\nCole and Drew will be overseeing the bulk of the project. Over the past year we've developed partnerships with folks around the gaming industry, and we have contingencies in place for every element of the project's production and fulfillment. This is the fifth game Cole will have shepherded through the development and manufacturing process.\n\nAt this point, Pax Pamir: Second Edition has been in active development for six months and all principal design is complete. Over the next few months, Drew and Cole and their playtesting teams will continue to fine-tune the deck balance and make small alterations. We will also oversee the completion of automated opponent for the solo and two-player variant games. We have built a lot of padding into our schedule to absorb any development delays.\n\nIn terms of the physical production, all of the artwork has been assembled and the vast majority of the game's graphic design is complete. Certain funding goals will demand additional graphic design work, but time has been allocated for these goals and built into the schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "FOR RETAILERS.

The book pays tribute to the amazing pixel art, product design and graphic design associated with this iconic 8-bit system. The book is officially licensed by SEGA and is the first book of this kind to be released for the Master System, ever.\nThe full range of visual compendium books\nThis will be the sixth visual compendium from Bitmap Books. Previous titles in the series on the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, ZX Spectrum, NES/Famicom and SNES/Super Famicom have all been met with critical acclaim, most notably with the ZX Spectrum book, which won gold at the 2016 Roses UK Design Awards.\nAs the name suggests, within each compendium the visuals are the main focus, with 200-word soundbites of text accompanying each game spread. This may be a quote from the game\u2019s original developer or artist, a review from a well known journalist, or even a fan recounting their favourite gaming memories. Within each book you'll also find a series of larger features and interviews with developers and artists, ensuring a great mix of visuals and words. Overall, each these books contains around 60,000 words and hundreds of iconic images; each one is a perfect coffee-table art book.\nAll of our books are produced by graphic designer Sam Dyer. Hundreds of man hours are spent making sure each and every page looks as good as it possibly can; colours are impeccably balanced and the presentation is perfect. The best printers and binders are used and little extra touches are added here and there to make each book a beautiful thing to own, read and collect. As standard, all books now come shrink-wrapped.\nBackground \u80cc\u666f\nThe Master System was originally released as the SEGA Mark III in Japan in 1985, and was a direct competitor to Nintendo's Famicom home console. Despite an impressive library of SEGA arcade conversions - such as Space Harrier, After Burner, Out Run and Enduro Racer - the Mark III couldn't match the popularity of the Famicom, even though it possessed superior hardware and featured some great ideas, such as the 'My Card' format \u2013 a credit card-sized alternative to cartridges that were smaller in capacity but more affordable.\nIn 1986, SEGA rebranded the Mark III as the Master System and launched it in North America. Visually similar to the Mark III, the Master System was clad in a black and red colour scheme and came bundled with the arcade classic Hang-On and the light gun shooter, Safari Hunt. Sadly, the story was very much the same as it was in Japan; the Nintendo Entertainment System had such a stranglehold on the video game market in North America that the Master System failed to gain serious traction and ultimately lost out to its 8-bit nemesis.\nFast-forward to 1987 and the Master System launched in Europe to huge success. Territories such as the UK were very computer-oriented at the time and Nintendo had yet to make serious inroads in the region; the result was that uptake on the Master System was huge, thanks to the affordable price tag and promise of an 'arcade experience in your home'. The Master System was no stranger to a wealth of weird and wonderful peripherals throughout its lifespan. These included items such as a pair of 3D glasses, a handlebar controller for racing games, the iconic 'Light Phaser' and the trackball Sports Pad.\nThe console also saw success in other countries, most notably Brazil, where it has a very loyal fanbase and is still manufactured and sold to this day. This presence in Brazil has been driven by the company Tectoy, which published notable games throughout the '90s such as Baku Baku Animal, Street Fighter II and Mortal Kombat 3.\nWhile it's fair to say that the Master System didn't have the most successful lifespan when compared to contemporary rivals but historically it remains vitally important to SEGA's development as a company, and the release of its most successful home console, the 16-bit Genesis/Mega Drive. The Master System gave SEGA valuable experience of converting their arcade games for home consoles, and this became the foundation for the astonishing worldwide success that was to come just a few years later. The library of games on the Master System is modest in volume, but packed full of quality and home to some of video gaming's most iconic franchises, such as Alex Kidd, Fantasy Zone, Shinobi and Phantasy Star.\nThe book \u76ee\u6a19\u306e\u672c\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium measures 170mm x 230mm and will be printed lithographically to the highest standards. This ensures that colours in the book are really vibrant and pages have a high-quality, luxurious feel to them. As standard, all visual compendiums now come with a spot varnished cover and a spot varnished protective dust jacket. The binding is 'thread sewn' which means that the book can lie flat so the imagery can be fully enjoyed. The binding does not use glue which can crack over time and result in loose pages. Thread sewn binding is the best available.\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium will be available in softcover and hardback editions, both 364 pages long. The page count will grow if more stretch goals are hit. Our previous two books on the NES and SNES ended up having well over 500 pages! Most stretch goal bonuses - such as additional pages, slipcase and gatefold pages - will apply to both the softcover and hardback editions.\nSEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium is being created by an experienced and talented team of writers, designers and artists. Sam Dyer is overseeing all design and the overall art direction and project management. Steve Jarratt (Total!/Edge/Sega Power) is overseeing all copy and is the book\u2019s editor. Damien McFerran (Nintendo Life/Eurogamer) is in charge of writing the features and facilitating developer interviews. Craig Stevenson is creating a suite of bespoke pixel artworks that will be used throughout the book, emulating the Master System pixel style and palette.\nContent \u5185\u5bb9\nWe're delighted to announce that SEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium will include a foreword written by Mark Cerny \u2013 programmer, game designer and most recently the Lead System Architect of the Sony PlayStation 4. Mark's career snowballed in 1984 when he designed Marble Madness at Atari. He then went on to work for SEGA in Japan, where he was involved in the launch of the Master System. While there, Mark designed the innovative 3D glasses, created original titles such as Missile Defense 3-D and handled some excellent ports such as California Games and Shanghai. We've also been lucky to interview Mark for the book and will go into detail regarding his time at SEGA, and his memories of the Master System.\nThe book then provides an overview of the creation of the Master System and sets the scene for what is to come. This section is a mixture of words, images and pull-out quotes.\nFor roughly half of the book, each spread features an image of a game accompanied by a 200-word review/critique. In total, more than 100 games across the various regions will be included. Due to licensing restrictions, not every single game for the SEGA Master System will be able to be included, but rest assured, we will be doing everything we can to gain the necessary permissions to ensure that the most famous games make the cut.\nAlso featured in the book will be a series of features written by Damien McFerran (Nintendo Life/Eurogamer), covering topics such as arcade conversions, the groundbreaking 3D glasses and the console's amazing success in Brazil. These feature sections will be a great contrast to the visual game spreads and will contain around 3,000 words each.\nWe will also interviewing a selection of key individuals that worked with the Master System. As it currently stands, the interviewees include Mark Cerny and current SEGA employees Mutsuhiro Fujii (planner of Fantasy Zone and Space Harrier), Takashi Shoji (a programmer in the Master System era) and Rieko Kodama (designer and artist of Phantasy Star and Alex Kidd). These interviews will provide a unique look into the development of games and life at SEGA in the mid-'90s.\nAs with the other books in the compendium series, we will once again be photographing a wide range of systems and peripherals. All the key hardware will be photographed and presented in a beautiful way, showcasing the iconic product design that became SEGA's trademark during this era. For the photography, we have been lucky to work with a very dedicated Master System collector (@segacollect) who has kindly gave us access to his impressive collection.\nThe book will also showcase the very best box art for the SEGA Master System, covering all regions. The Japanese box art had a very different look to the western designs and used a metallic gold border instead of the famous black and white, grid-style background. Each box art will be accompanied by a 200 word critique.\nOne of the things that made the Master System so unique were the 3D glasses peripheral. Designed by Mark Cerny, these glasses were incredibly advanced for the time and used shutter technology that has most recently been used by television companies manufacturing their own 3D specs, some 30 years later! Each book will come with a free set of 3D glasses and there will be a section of games with a '3D effect' applied to them. This effect isn't an exact replica of how the actual SEGA 3D glasses worked, but it will at least give you a taste of what it would have been like seeing these games on your TV back in the '80s.\nContributors \u8ca2\u732e\u8005\nSo far, we have a handful of contributors who will be writing in the book, and as the project develops, many more will be added. These contributors, more often than not, were the actual people that made the games, so they can offer some great anecdotal stories and insight that won't be found elsewhere. Also on board to write game reviews will be past and present game journalists such as Julian Rignall (Mean Machines Sega), Steve Jarratt (Total!, Edge, Sega Power) and Andy Smith (Sega Power).\nThroughout SEGA\u00ae Master System: a visual compendium, we will once again be working with John Szczepaniak \u2013 author of The Untold History of Japanese Game Developers Volumes 1, 2 and most recently 3. John has incredibly supportive of our work and we\u2019ve come to an agreement where we can use his interview content in the book. This is great news as we now have access to interviews with some truly legendary Japanese developers.\nOccasionally, it will not be possible to quote the original development team, so in these instances, we will be using text from existing interviews which is completely standard practice and all sources will be credited appropriately. We would like to thanks the great folks at shmuplations.com who we've worked with to gather some great translated Japanese interviews.\nPerks \u7279\u5178\nThis campaign features a selection of unique rewards that will hopefully appeal to SEGA fans. These range from unique box art postcards to the chance to own your own spread in the book and review a game of your own choice.\nBox art postcards (over pledge by \u00a35 to add to your pledge)\nWe've created two sets of postcard packs that can be added to your existing pledge or can be pledged for as their own tier. The first set features iconic imagery seen on the Western box art and the second set feature images from the Japanese boxes. These postcards are printed lithographically to very high standards and are then presented in a protective sleeve. They are not cheap digital prints; they are printed on high-quality uncoated paper stock.\nBlueprint poster (over pledge by \u00a315 to add to your pledge)\nHere's a unique chance to own a technical drawing of the Master System. This illustration is based on drawings from SEGA and would look great on the wall of any SEGA fan's gaming den. The poster is A2 (594mm x 420mm) and comes rolled (not folded) in a heavy-duty poster tube.\nClose-ups of the A2 blueprint poster\nBitmap Books t-shirt featuring Alex Kidd (over pledge by \u00a320 to add to your pledge)\nHere's a chance to own an official Bitmap Books t-shirt featuring Alex Kidd. Each t-shirt comes in its own polybag. Sizes available are as follows: Small - 35/37\" // Medium - 38/40\" // Large - 41/43\" // Extra Large - 46/48\" // Extra Extra Large - 50/52\". \nPlease note that you'll be asked in the backer survey (sent once campaign ends) to supply your required size.\nHave your own spread\nSomething we do throughout all our visual compendiums is to invite backers to pick their favourite game to be featured in the book. The backers get to write their own 200-word review for the spread. This is a unique opportunity to have your name in print and, in your own words, talk about your memories and thoughts on a particular game. However, please note that you will need to supply a list of five games in order of preference, and your words will be professionally edited to suit the style and tone of the book.\nStretch goals \u30b9\u30c8\u30ec\u30c3\u30c1\u30b4\u30fc\nIf the book goes past its \u00a350,000 target, we\u2019ve devised a series of stretch goals that will happen if the below amounts are reached. Basically, the more funding we get, the better the book will be for you!\nIn total, 8 gatefold spreads and loads more pages will be added to the book if the stretch goals are met. Gatefold pages (as used in our previous NES and SNES books) are additional fold-out pages which mean that you can effectively have four pages in a row. These are ideal for showing a beautiful game level map!\nGatefold spread showcasing a level map\nWe will also be adding bookmark ribbons and special Pantone ink upgrades into the stretch goals. The two bookmark ribbons will be red and blue to match the Master System logo and will only be included on the hardback. Pantone inks are essentially a much more vibrant ink option. In previous books we've introduced special Pantone golds, silvers and fluorescents. Is this book, we're proposing to upgrade the blue and red (from Master System logo) to Pantone.\nColour-matched bookmark ribbons (hardback only)\nAt \u00a3100,000 the book will come in a printed heavy-board slipcase. Those who have seen our NES and SNES books will be familiar with this style of heavy-duty slipcase. The slipcase will be applied to both the softcover and hardback editions.\nHeavy-duty slipcase\nFurther stretch goals will be dependant on the success of the campaign and will be announced in due-course. Essentially, the more the campaign raises, the better the book will become.\nBudgets \u4e88\u7b97\nDue to the associated costs with licensing deals such as royalty payments, the campaign target for this campaign has been set to \u00a350,000. This is the minimum required to deliver the proposed 300 page book. A large proportion of the budget goes on print and an even higher amount of tracked shipping. What's left goes on making sure the people who've worked on the book are paid appropriately and the various other printed items. Anything over the minimum \u00a350,000 will be reflected in the stretch goals such as adding pages, special print techniques and the slipcase for example.\nTimings \u30bf\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0\nBased on the Kickstarter campaign finishing at the end of July, The books will be delivered in February 2019. The PDF (that everyone gets) will be delivered in November 2018.\nThis may seem like a long way off but I've built in plenty of time for the official sign-off from SEGA. So this may be sooner if the process is faster.\nShipping \u767a\u9001\nAll books will be sent tracked. You will receive a tracking number as soon as fulfilment starts. We have tried to keep shipping to minimum \u2013 the UK is \u00a32, Europe in \u00a37 and Rest of World is \u00a310. These prices are heavily subsidised by Bitmap Books to keep costs as low as possible for you. We use a professional fulfilment house for all pick and pack. This minimises any issues that occasionally come up with Kickstarter fulfilment. I will be working with the fulfilment house to devise the best packaging solution. All books will be shipped in a protective book wrap, have hard plastic corner protectors and then be inserted into a waterproof poly bag. The feedback we consistently hear is how well our books are backed.\nPlease note that you will incur NO customs charges for importing the book. Books are zero rated and we clearly declare the contents and low value on the fascia to avoid charges.\nPartners \u30d1\u30fc\u30c8\u30ca\u30fc\nWe are delighted to be working some key partners throughout the campaign and I wanted an opportunity to say thanks for their help and support.\nA special thanks to GamesYouLoved who have been major supporter of me and my books.

Be afraid. Be very, very afraid....\nBack for another bite is this reprint campaign for Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, and the undead are just drooling to meet you. Arm yourself with a weapon or three, grab plenty of supplies, and go, guns blazing, into the chaos!\nNew to Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition are three fantastic, tension-packed Expansion Packs to aid you in your fight against the unrelenting horde of Zeds!\nNOTE: The reprint of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition includes all original gameplay stretch goals except for No Brains Mode (the rules can be downloaded for free here and the game mat for free here!). There are no stretch goals for the expansions, as we decided to include everything from the very beginning!\n   \"Why Dawn of the Zeds has stayed in my collection...\" - A review and testimonial on BGG.\nThings are far from good in Farmingdale. Some kind of virus or poison is turning ordinary people into vicious, zombie-like killers. You must lead citizens and emerging heroes to halt the Zeds' advances by (re)killing them, attempt to coordinate the discovery of a cure, and preserve as much of the area and as many of its inhabitants as possible. There's no time to lose\u2026.  \nDawn of the Zeds: Third Edition is a cooperative States of Siege\u2122 board game for 1-5 players that plays in 90-120 minutes. Your heroes must defend Farmingdale and its five outlying villages from the encroaching horrors. These heroes are supported by civilians (some armed, some heroic) and what little outside help is forthcoming. You must prevent the Zeds incursion from reaching the town center or causing so much chaos around Farmingdale that the government abandons it (and you)!\nThere's a whole world to experience for players new to the apocalyptic city of Farmingdale. For players who have experienced Dawn of the Zeds in previous editions, there are plenty of new things to discover as well.\n1-5 players\nCo-op, solitaire, and versus game play\nSix expanding levels of game play\nHeroes with unique abilities\nTruly cinematic game play experience\nCheck out how Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition plays in our Peek & Play video below!\nYou can take a look at the Basic Game Rulebook here, the Level Up! Rulebook here, the Farmingdale Dossier here, the A to Zeds Book here, and the Set Up and Epilogue Book here!\nCheck out the playlist of introductory videos from our Zeds Enthusiast, Lines Hutter, who gives a great in-depth tutorial on the game.\nThe first Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features 4 new characters (3 heroes and 1 heroic civilians), who are stepping forward, ready to confront the Zeds.\nCheck out their Dossier page here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nThe second Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features 13 new Outbreak! (blue) Level Event and Fate cards, broadening the narrative and gameplay excitement. Zeds are learning to move in new and unexpected ways, catching the citizens of Farmingdale unaware and, at times, unprepared. \nIn addition, a new hero has arrived. No one knows what \u201cBouncing\u201d Betty Bolivar is fighting for, but what they do know is the single-minded destruction she is capable of.\nCheck out her Dossier here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nThe third Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition Expansion Pack features two new game systems. In the first, Refugees are more helpful than ever as they bring with them Rumors about incredibly useful items for the ongoing battle. All 16 Rumor chits provide heroes with special goodies or abilities when discovered. \nThe second game system features two trains operating from the town's rail junction, providing heroes with new modes of transportation and unique strategic pieces on the chessboard at the Battle for Farmingdale.\nYou can read the rules about the new game systems here (NOTE: This is a late beta version. This document is complete, but layout, proofing, and small corrections are being finalized)!\nIn Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition, it is the cards that drive the story. There are several types of cards, each with a unique function.\nEach Hero card lists that Hero's unique gameplay abilities and backstory. The mix of Heroes dictates your strategy for defeating the oncoming Zed horde!\nEvent cards narrate and illustrate the game\u2019s story, manage some of the game\u2019s AI (artificial intelligence), and create those wonderful/dreadful moments that can only happen during a zombie apocalypse.\nFate cards add even more variations to the game's story (sometimes for good, sometimes... not). Fate cards also trigger unique plot twists, which must be dealt with before resuming the struggle to save Farmingdale.\nReference cards provide quick information about several types of units; Research cards allow the possibility of discovering the cure to Z.E.D. and the innovative Super Weapon; Heroic Civilians are Civilians with special abilities.\nPlease note! If you want multiple copies of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition or the Expansion Packs, they will be available in a pledge manager after the campaign has been completed.\nThe initial launch of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition was much more successful than we anticipated. It is presently sold out in most places and commanding impressive prices on the secondary market! To follow that up, we have three whole new expansions for those who already own and enjoy Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition.\nAnd if you missed the base game, this campaign is your chance to reserve your copy and also get the new Expansion Packs at the same time!\nShipping will be charged through a pledge manager after the campaign ends while the games are in transit from the printer.\nWe are working with Ship Naked to get the best possible shipping rates for everyone. Essentially, this is done through shipping zones. The shipping zone that you live in determines how much shipping you will pay. This is much cheaper for you than if we were to ship everything from our office in Irvine, CA and allows us to provide discounts that we would not be able to provide otherwise.\nIf you receive additional charges for receiving your package, please send us a message here on Kickstarter or to info[at]victorypointgames[dot]com and include a copy of your customs receipt. We will reimburse you via our pledge manager or Paypal.\nPlease note that the following list is for estimated shipping rates for 1 copy of Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition (estimated shipping weight 6 pounds), 1 set of three expansion packs (estimated shipping weight under 1 pound), and one of each (base game + expansion pack set):\nPlease be aware that the list above are estimated shipping rates. We will do everything we can to aggressively pursue the lowest shipping rates for everyone.\nThe following licensors have partnered with us and will be publishing Dawn of the Zeds: Third Edition:\nFrosted Games German language version: Preorder here\nMaldito Games Spanish language version: Preorder here \nNote that these publishers will have their own terms of service.\nRefund Policy:\n100% refund is available within 14 calendar days of the end of the campaign.\n90% refund is available before production begins (10% is retained due to non-refundable Kickstarter fees).\nNo refunds are available once our fulfillment service begins preparing your shipment.\nReplacement Policy:\nWe are happy to replace missing or damaged components. Please send us photos of the damage, your mailing address, and we will ship you a replacement at no cost to you. We can only provide replacement pieces as long as a title remains active in our store. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date that the pledge was delivered.\nYou may return new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a refund. You will be responsible for shipping the item back to us. Upon receipt of the undamaged item, we will provide a 90% refund.\nKickstarter Terms and Conditions\nBy pledging to our project, you acknowledge that the the final appearance, materials, etc. of the rewards are subject to change.\nShipping is charged through a pledge manager when the product is finally assembled and en route to fulfillment depots. You will be notified of this through a Kickstarter update. If you do not confirm and update your pledge (with a final address, shipping costs, etc.) within 8 weeks of being notified that shipping is due, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. Unconfirmed pledges and payments cause significant logistics problems and create other long term issues.\nWhen you confirm and finalize your pledge through our pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility ends when we ship the order to the address you have provided. Although as mentioned elsewhere here, we will reimburse you for any extra charges you pay to receive your package.\nAny pledges that are finalized after the 8-week deadline will likely be shipped from the United States and may incur increased shipping costs for this reason. In addition, significant delays in finalizing pledges may result in increased shipping costs if shipping rates have gone up in the meantime.\nPlease do not pledge if you do not agree to these terms.\nWe Follow Kickstarter's Community Guidelines\nWe love being able to present our projects on Kickstarter and to work with the enthusiastic backers in this community! We strictly adhere to the Kickstarter Community Guidelines. If you violate these guidelines by behaving abusively or spamming, we will refund you in full and cancel your pledge without notice. We want to thank the 99.9% of our backers who provide a positive, respectful, and lively dialogue on our projects!\nBulk Orders\nAnyone who would like to place a bulk order, such as retailers or distributors, should contact us directly at info[at]victorypointgames[dot]com or through Kickstarter and we will be happy to work with you to get you set up with whatever you need. Proof of business authenticity will be required.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to the nature of out-of-house printing, it can be difficult to pinpoint a time when a finished project will be printed and delivered to you.

Allow us to run you through the story so far...\nEscape the Dark Castle is a simple, fantasy adventure game with a focus on atmosphere, storytelling and player cooperation \u2013 perfect for newcomers to tabletop gaming. It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever the same.      \nPlayers take the roles of prisoners on a quest to Escape the Dark Castle, and must work together to overcome its many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card. \nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete challenges. \nThe goal of the game is to complete every chapter in the castle deck, then defeat the final boss. To win, you must keep every member of the team alive - if any player is killed the game ends immediately!\nAfter our first campaign in 2017, we released Escape the Dark Castle along with the first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight. Now we're back with a selection of new expansions and add-ons to further expand and deepen your adventures. \nThis game has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn.

Players will now encounter event cards in the item deck which trigger the arrival of one of the Companions. Each Companion has a unique mixture of traits and a special ability. They are powerful allies but their presence may be fleeting, so prisoners must choose carefully how and when to call on them. \nIn the most confined, twisting passageways; in the vaulted eaves of the highest towers; in the fetid air drawn sharply into your panicked lungs \u2013 there will you find his creation.

As they explore the labyrinthine castle passages, players can now encounter Carriers, plague-infected lunatics bent on spreading the disease.

The Death Knight himself, legendary swordsman and the one they call \u2018Lord of Decay\u2019, has risen to prominence. The weak and the mindless flock to his banner, twisted by his dark influence into powerful, feral fanatics. They say he sends curses to crawl into the souls of the weary. Beware the curses, prisoner. Beware the Death Knight\u2026\nContains: \n1 Boss - The Death Knight himself\n15 Chapter Cards - We won't spoil them for you\n3 New Characters - Each especially powerful in one trait\n3 Character Dice - Representing the skills of each new prisoner\n5 Curse Cards - With devious effects to thwart your progress\n1 Cult Dice - Pray you won't need to roll it...\nCard Sleeves\nClear card sleeves specially produced to protect your Escape the Dark Castle collection.\nThere are sleeves for both sizes of Escape the Dark Castle cards: A6 (large) and A8 (small).

He faded from consciousness...\"\nThis is a printed, perfect bound softback book, and includes a free PDF version.Tales from the Dark is designed to fit perfectly into the Collectors Box.\nThe Death Book - \u00a38.00\nAdd a new narrative dimension to your games with The Death Book.\nThis crumbling old tomb contains a contextual 'death scene' for every chapter card in the game - at least, those which are capable of killing a prisoner, and of the bosses too.\n\nNo matter which chapter card finishes you off, you'll be able to flip to the corresponding section of The Death Book and read out all the gory details of your demise. What better way to end a game of Escape the Dark Castle?\n\n\nExcerpt:\n\"You fall to the ground exhausted and delirious. There was no heroic battle, no valiant climax - just too much strain on a body and mind not fit to bear it. Eventually you rise, weak and jabbering with madness, destined to wander the castle in a state of physical and mental ruin, unrecognisable to any who once knew you...\"\nThis is a printed, perfect bound softback book, and includes a free PDF version. The Death Book is designed to fit perfectly into the Collectors Box.\nOriginal Soundtrack - \u00a35.00\nWhether you prefer your atmospheric dungeon-synth on cassette or MP3, you simply haven't played Escape the Dark Castle until you've played it to this!\n\nThis atmospheric soundtrack was specially composed by Escape the Dark Castle co-designer and illustrator Alex Crispin to perfectly accompany gameplay. \n(not final design)\nContains: \nOver 45 mins of atmospheric music on limited edition Cassette, and the MP3 files to download. \nBecome a Prisoner - \u00a365.00\nBack by popular demand, our incredible game artist Alex Crispin will hand draw your exclusive prisoner portrait, fully playable using the dice of whichever core game character you choose to become. \n\nWill you be the Abbot, Tailor, Mason? Choose from any prisoner released to date. Imagine the satisfaction when you Escape the Dark Castle personally!\nHow it works: \nPick the character you'd like to become, then send us a photo of yourself which meets our guidelines. You'll get two copies of the card - one to use and one to keep pristine or frame as a rare collectors item. \nOur \u00a325k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs of this ambitious campaign. But, if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following freebies and upgrades: \n(All stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the Escape the Dark Castle Original Soundtrack MP3 files to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get the new and improved Tales from the Dark book PDF file to download free of charge. \nAt this level of funding, all backers will get The Death Book PDF file to download free of charge.\nNaturally, the sleeves will be high quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard material to a matt finish. \nOur books will be a classy production, but if we reach this level of funding it will open up some more luxurious options and finishes to make the print editions of Both Tales from the Dark and The Death Book that little bit more special. \n At this level of funding we'd like to replace the Health Tracker cubes in the Collector's Box with something more thematic. Little skulls perhaps...\nThe Collectors Box includes a 'first player' card we refer to as the 'torch'. Given the chance, we'd like to upgrade this to an object as standard. \nIf you thought the Golden Axe was legendary, wait until you see what is perhaps the most influential relic the gaming world has even known - The Living Stone! We'll add this item card and its custom dice to the Collector's Box as standard. \nEscape the Dark Castle lends itself well to a tasteful companion app, to track health and play the soundtrack to augment the play experience. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign. \nWe can dream. While the best way to experience Escape the Dark Castle will always be on the tabletop, we can't deny the idea of making a digital version has massive appeal. This will be free to all backers if we reach this level of funding, but may not deliver at the same time as the other items in this campaign.\nAfter an impeccable performance handling our first campaign, we'll once again be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.  \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge.  \nThe following base level shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level:\nPlease note: Ordering add-ons may increase your shipping charge above the price shown below. You final shipping total will be calculated in Backerit at the end of the campaign, and any excess must be paid before shipping can take place. \nAre you a journalist or content creator?

It takes 1* to 5 players and plays in 20 to 25 minutes per player (average time of +/- 90').\n* During this campaign we decided to include a solo version.\nChina, 1570. China is under the reign of the Longqing Emperor, of the Ming Dynasty. The Emperor has inherited a country in disarray after years of mismanagement and corruption. Realising the depth of chaos his father\u2019s long reign had caused, the Longqing Emperor set about reforming the government by re-employing talented officials previously banished by his father. \nThe country was already famous for its very intricate bureaucracy, but this also led to a lot of corruption. However, the Longqing Emperor tried to eradicate corruption as much as he could, by simply having it officially prohibited, and punishable by death.\nThis measure seemed successful at first, but as we all know, it is not so simple to keep perfect control over one's \u201cloyal\u201d subjects. At the imperial court, the highest officials would pretend to uphold the ban on corruption, and instead of simply accepting money, a new custom saw the light of day: the exchange of gifts.\nPlayers take on the role of noble families and will need to offer gifts using an innovative card placement mechanism thus bribing the Officials of the Forbidden City to perform certain tasks for them. Whoever proves to be most \"influential\" will receive the honour of an audition with the Emperor in the Palace of Heavenly Purity.\nG\u00f9go\u0304ng is played in 4 rounds, symbolised by 4 Days. Each Day consists of 3 Phases:  \nThe Morning Phase, where players prepare the game for the coming Day.  \nThe Day Phase, where players perform multiple actions.  \nThe Evening Phase, where players check if they have successfully matched cards in their discard pile with the Destiny Dice.\nWhen it's your turn in the Day Phase, you exchange a gift card on the board with a card of higher value from your hand.\nAlternatively, you can also pay two Servants in order to exchange a gift card \u2026\n\u2026 OR discard another card of equal or lower value: \nWhen playing the right card a player may perform two actions: the action depicted on your card and the action of the chosen location.\nPlayers can choose between 7 different actions: \nTHE PALACE OF HEAVENLY PURITY: Progress towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity and reach an Audience with the Emperor before the end of the 4th Day. \nTRAVEL:  Send your Traveller to cities throughout China to collect taxes for the Longqing Emperor, which come in all shapes and sizes.\nTHE GREAT WALL: Participate in the construction of the Great Wall of China. This will allow you to take part in the Intrigue Benefits and potentially gain VPs and move your Envoy towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity.\nJADE: Buy precious Jade stones to score VPs at the end of the game.\nINTRIGUE: Climb up on the Intrigue track, which counts as a tie-breaker for all comparisons with your opponents in the game. Or you can gain one of the Intrigue Benefits whenever you help to complete the Great Wall.\nDECREES: Gain special Decree advantages during the entire game and/or VPs.\nTHE GRAND CANAL: Send your Servants on a journey on the Grand Canal, to trade with people outside of Beijing. This will grant you all sorts of permanent rewards. \nAt the end of the 4th Day, players receive additional VPs according to their achievements. The player with the most Victory points at the end of the game is declared the most influential Chinese Family and wins the game.\nBut watch out! Players who don\u2019t manage to get their Envoy into the Palace of Heavenly Purity by the end of the game, won\u2019t be eligible to win the game.\nA link to the video can be found here.\nTo subscribe to our newsletter, go to our website and subscribe at the footer of the page.\nThe rulebook of The Forbidden City can be downloaded by clicking on the banner of your language:  \n  Podcast by BOARD GAME CLOSET - Fragment of episode 43:\nItalian Review by Geek.Pizza\nFrench Review by Le Labo des Jeux\nGerman Review by Brettspiel Heroes:\nGame Brewer aims at publishing games of high quality in both gameplay as well as components. Because the highest grade of quality for components is not always feasible when one keeps the recommended retail price in mind, we decided to offer our Deluxe version of the Forbidden City through Kickstarter.\nTo be able to produce an edition with upgraded components, we need your support! \nIf our project gets funded, the number of Deluxe versions made will be limited to the ones ordered through this campaign with some additional ones for replacements and sales at conventions.\nThe Deluxe version may appear in a board game store if a retailer buys it in this campaign. After this campaign, the Deluxe version will not be sold through our regular distribution channels. \nThe only way to be sure you can get a Deluxe copy is to back this Kickstarter campaign. Of course, there will be a retail version as well which will have the best quality of components possible whilst retaining a reasonable price when it hits the shelves of your board game store.\nShipping costs will be added in the CrowdOx plegde manager after the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe do our best to keep shipping costs as low as possible. Below prices include the protection and packing of your game by ourselves or by fulfilment centers at various locations in Europe, the USA and Australia.\nFor the European Union, USA, Canada, China, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, the shipping prices include all duty, taxes and VAT (if applicable). For other countries, extra duty or taxes may apply at delivery, depending on your country's regulations.\nWe provide 2 FREE PICKUP possibilities:\nPICKUP at Spiel '18 in Essen, Germany\nPICKUP at games store \"de Kolonisten\", Turnhout, Belgium\nGroup pledges:\nFor Group Deal 2 (12 games), multiply the shipping cost for 6 games by 2. \nFor Group Deal 3 (18 games), multiply the shipping cost for 6 games by 3.\n We invite retailers to register themselves on our website: https://www.gamebrewer.com/partners/retailers/\nAfter approval of your retailer account, and when this project is funded, you'll be able to pledge both the Standard and Deluxe edition on our website.\nPlease note that after this campaign, the Deluxe edition will NOT be sold through our regular distribution channels anymore. This is your only chance to pre-order the Deluxe edition. \nGame Brewer is a Belgian publisher, dedicated to carefully brewing great board games, that are beautifully illustrated and feature top-notch quality components. Pixie Queen, Chimera Station and Castellum were previously released. Gentes will follow soon, and with this project, we hope The Forbidden City will too.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th Kickstarter. Pixie Queen and Chimera Station (euro edition) have been succesfully delivered. The production of Gentes (campaign lead by Tasty Minstrel Games) will commence very soon.\nIt\u2019s our intension to send all games to our backers in October 2018 and introduce it to the rest of the world at Spiel \u201918 in Essen, the final weekend of October. We\u2019ve made all necessary arrangements with the manufacturer to accomplish this. \nNevertheless it\u2019s always possible that we\u2019ll meet unexpected delays, especially with a very thight schedule like this. Therefore, please note that the delivery time is only an estimate.\nDue to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions, especially outside of Europe, may receive their game later than October 2018.\nIf you chose Spiel '18 in Essen as pickup point, and due to unexpected delays, we can't deliver your reward there, this will be our policy: \nWe may decide to send you the game to your address for free.\nIn all other case, we will offer you these solutions to choose from:\n- Another pickup point on a later date;\n- You pay an extra shipping fee and we send you the game to your address;\n- We refund the total amount of your pledge, including all fees (Kickstarter, paypal...)\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\nThis project is being funded in EURO and any refunds processed will be in EURO for the exact amount received in EURO, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\nAfter this campaign we\u2019ll use a pledge manager, in which you\u2019ll be asked to confirm your pledge.

You and up to 3 friends play the roles of the surviving leaders and must defeat the armies of Vesh over a series of 7 stories. Each story offers a unique puzzle and has optional objectives depending on how long you want to play.\nThe game features full character customisation, worker management, board exploration, roleplaying-style quests and strategic combat designed for replayability. Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time!

Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes.

Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations.

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

The number one request, by far, was Fireball Island. After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Extra room is provided in the center section should you desire to sleeve the cards.\nThe wood establishment platforms conjure the look of an old western storefront. Since each platform is stained and laser cut, the wood grain and color will be slightly unique in each copy of the game. The platforms are laser cut in the negative space, so each letter and design comes outwards.\nThe ten wooden dice each use custom designs instead of standard dots. Each colored dice corresponds to a gun in the game and has different values depending on the gun. Each die is colored and engraved.\n Nine wooden stars act as the pawns in the game.\n The dice and stars come in a faux leather bag.\nThe 9 characters are based on people who actually lived in or visited Deadwood in 1876. Character biographies are included in the rule book. Each character card is colored on the front, and black and white on the back.\nThe 20 Safe cards are designed to look like genuine safes from the 1870's.\nEach of the 50 Deadwood cards contains a gun on top and a special item on the bottom.\nIn Deadwood 1876 you\u2019ll use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!\nNote: The video above gives a brief overview of rules. Strategy tips, rule clarifications, advanced optional rules, card descriptions, and character biographies are all included in the game rule book. We currently have rules available to view in English, German, French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch on our website. You can also view the contents of this page in Chinese.\nValuable items are hidden behind each Safe. You won't know which Safes have been shuffled in, so every round will play out differently.\nEach player always has 4 Deadwood cards in their hand. You'll get to play one card from your hand each turn, and then it will be replaced from the deck.\nEach card can either be used as the gun listed on top, or the special item listed on the bottom. The Holster lets you help out teammates, the Stetson lets you view hidden Safes, the Horse lets you abandon your team for a different one, and the Duster lets you improve your hand of cards.\nThe more powerful guns, such as the Messenger, have higher values on its dice, whereas worse guns, such as the Pepperbox, have lower values and zeros on its dice.  For shootouts you'll need to manage your hand and decide when to use a powerful gun and when to gamble with your weaker guns.\nEach player takes on the identity of one of nine people who actually roamed the streets of Deadwood.\nA game in progress.\nThis game requires teamwork, but also actively punishes you if you play too nice. That balance makes every round insane. - Sam J.\nMix strategy with the best and the worst of the Wild West, and you get Deadwood. - Charlotte C.\nThe strategy never gets old and I consistently find myself playing with new options every single game. -Spencer H.\nBackstabbing has never been so much fun. This game keeps you on your toes. It is not one you can play half-heartedly. -Abigail S.\nThe more I play Deadwood, the less likely I am to trust other players. When I trust them too much, they take my gold and shoot me with a gun they stole from me. I always regret it. -Patti S.\nIntrigues of Deadwood 1876 video from Beasts of War.\nA great game (in our opinion), needs three things: solid mechanics, an awesome theme, and beautiful design.\nMechanics\nDeadwood is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best Deadwood cards and Badges to hunt down Gold for their team, they\u2019ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates in the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Showdown Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn\u2019t seem to be pulling their weight, they\u2019re probably plotting to use your Gold to reach the Final Showdown and then destroy you! There may come a point when you need to attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.\nTheme\nWhen we were searching for the city for the 3rd Volume in the Dark Cities Series, we fell in love with Deadwood almost immediately upon learning about it. Large deposits of gold were discovered in the Black Hills of South Dakota in late 1875. Word quickly spread about the gold and the town of Deadwood was born almost overnight in early 1876. It soon reached a population of 5,000 miners, gamblers, prostitutes, outlaws, and businessmen. Lawlessness was prevalent as people flocked to the town to find (or steal) their share of the gold. Deadwood quickly became an infamous western town where old west legends lived and died.\nThe book has a raised UV effect so that all designs and logos pop out from the cover and spine.\nDesign\nThe illustrations from Sarah Keele and graphic design from Holly Hancock take players into the world of the wild wild west! We used wood and leather textures with our components, old west Victorian charm with our book and character cards, and cards that look like antiqued metal Safes built by the \"Facade Safe & Lock Co\" similar to Safes from the time period. The goal of our design is to take you and your friends deep into the raucous, chaotic, exciting world of Deadwood, South Dakota in its prime. You can view time-lapse videos of Sarah illustrating Molly Johnson, Solomon Star, Seth Bullock, Kitty Leroy, and the Holster.\nWe've already made many \"premium\" choices for the game (wooden platforms instead of cardboard, faux leather bag instead of plastic, wooden star tokens instead of standard pawns, faux book instead of standard box, etc.), because we believe in publishing awesome games regardless of funding amounts. But if we reach the following milestones, we'll be able to make Deadwood 1876 even better!\nNote: Some of these upgrades will be exclusive to the 1st Edition of Deadwood 1876. Backing on Kickstarter is the only way to guarantee that all upgrades listed above will be included in your copy of the game.\nWe've been working hard on logistics all year and for this campaign we're very pleased to offer free US shipping at all reward levels, and low international shipping rates. We are also using fulfillment companies around the world so that you won't be charged extra customs fees. If you are mistakenly charged customs fees when the games arrive, just let us know and we'll pay you back. (For EU backers, we will be shipping games from Germany so you won't have extra customs fees)\nBecause of cheaper shipping, we\u2019re happy to be selling Deadwood 1876 at prices that are even cheaper than the early bird levels of our previous two Kickstarter projects!\nDeadwood 1876 is Volume 3 in the Dark Cities Series! Each Volume is a stand-alone game that comes in the same sized faux book box, focuses on a particular city and year, and includes a dark or mysterious element in its game play. \nVolume 1: Tortuga 1667 (Published 2017 thanks to Kickstarter!). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website. Tortuga was recently nominated as the best party game of 2017 by Board Game Geek!\nVolume 2: Salem 1692 (Published as \"Salem\" in 2015 thanks to Kickstarter! Second edition published as \"Salem 1692\" in 2017). Click the links to view the original Kickstarter campaign or our website.\nBoth of our released games have sold over 20,000 copies and are now played around the world! We're already hard at work on Volume 4, and we will continue expanding the series. We know your game closet is a mess. Start your bookshelf collection of games with the Dark Cities Series! See Add-Ons section below for details.\nIf your pledge includes at least one copy of Deadwood 1876 then you can add an unlimited amount of Tortuga 1667, Salem 1692, or extra copies of Deadwood 1876 to your pledge! Just add the indicated amounts below to your pledge amount without changing your reward level. After the campaign we'll send out a survey where you'll select which games you'd like to be added to your order based on how much extra money you pledged. If you have any questions, please see the FAQ section or shoot us a message.\nYour shipping cost does not increase at all regardless of your location or the amount of add-ons you order. You will receive all add-on items at the same time that all of the Kickstarter rewards are received (estimated delivery October 2018).\n Examples:\nYou are outside the US and want 2 copies of each game. Select the $43 reward level and pledge $129 ($43 two-copies reward level + $6 reward level int'l shipping + $40 two add-ons of Salem + $40 two add-ons of Tortuga).\nYou are in the US and want 6 copies of Deadwood, 1 copy of Salem, and 10 copies of Tortuga. Select the $110 reward level and pledge $300 ($110 six-copies reward level  + $20 Salem add-on + $170 Tortuga large group add-on). \nIf you want Deadwood and Salem, Deadwood and Tortuga, or one of each game, we have reward levels available for those options.\nOur illustrator Sarah Keele wants to turn you into a Dark Cities character! During the campaign Sarah is offering a limited number of discounted custom portraits in her shop! We will then turn this portrait into a card that you'll be able to use during game play in your copy of Deadwood 1876!\nCustom Character Cards are also available in her shop for Tortuga 1667 and Salem 1692. Discounts are also available in her shop during the campaign for other art from the game.\nFollow her instagram for other giveaways and discounts.\nWe will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account on April 10th using the CrowdOx pledge manager system. You will be able to choose your add-on orders and provide your shipping information at that time. If you change addresses before we ship your rewards, you will be able to access your survey at this link anytime after April 10th: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/travishancock/deadwood-1876-a-safe-robbing-game-of-teamwork-and\nGame creation and graphic design is by Facade Games, owned and operated by Travis and Holly Hancock (and our little cheerleader Margo).

Follow her beautiful artwork on instagram.\nPhotography was by Jes Childress. See more of her pictures at her website. \nA huge thank you to the hundreds of hours put in by our many play-testers. This game would not exist without your ideas, feedback, and criticisms. Thank you!\nWe fell in love with the Kickstarter community when we launched our first game, Salem. We had another great experience with the launch of our second game, Tortuga 1667. The feedback, support, trust, and positivity from the community was incredible. We're proud to reward our Kickstarter backers with discounts on the very 1st edition of the game, the lowest shipping costs we can offer, first-in-line knowledge and insight into the project, and a direct line of communication to us as the creators. We also take your feedback into account before launching production. We consider each Kickstarter backer to be a close ally in our game-making endeavors and we'll do everything we can to protect your trust in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see from our photos, samples of the game have already been produced by our manufacturers and designs are complete. We just need to raise the funds and say go! We will do everything in our power to achieve on-time delivery, and we will reach out concerning any unforeseen circumstances. Our first two projects, Salem and Tortuga 1667, were delivered on time to backers as promised. \n\nSalem: \"I have backed over 46 projects and I just wanted to say this project has been an absolute delight to have been a backer for. Your updates have been insightful, but not overbearing. You clearly put a lot of time, thought, and effort into this game and it really shows. I was impressed with how fast this project came together. It was a fast, well organized campaign. Kudos to you and thank you for a wonderful end product. I couldn't be happier.\" -Snuffles00\n\nTortuga 1667: \"I backed this and another project that ended a day prior at the same time as my first kickstarters.

It's up to you to decide what to do with the goods: Keep the cargo, trade it away or sell it!

You'll need help from another captain to clear the transaction. Hopefully the other captain decides to help you launder the money, but beware, they could just as easily call the fuzz!\nAssist: Every ship needs starside assistance from time to time. Working as a tow-ship isn't glamorous, but it can help pay the bills!\nBOOM! It takes a special kind of captain to load a bomb onto their ship. You'll be given a target, but no one's going to stop you from detonating your munitions whenever you see fit!

The primary risks involved are:\n\n-Manufacturing Delays: I have worked with our manufacturing company PandaGM on my previous projects. They are a well known and reputable manufacturer. I will work with PandaGM to minimize manufacturing delays, which are often caused by incorrect file preparation for printing, or coloration issues. Since this is my fourth project I am confident we will overcome any unforeseen manufacturing issues with minimal delays.\n\n-Manufacturing Defects: Panda GM has a 99% guaranteed defect free rate for their products. However, they also account for the 1% of defects by sending me replacement parts. Should you have any issues with your copy, simply let me know and I'll get you replacement parts as soon as possible!\n\n-Shipping Delays: There is always the possibility of shipping delays - I hope to minimize these by having a solid logistics plan in place.

Did you miss your chance to play it when the original edition was available? Did you play a friend's copy and can't understand why it ever went out of print? Did you play your own copy into ragged pieces like we did? Whichever one of those is true, or if this is your first look at the game, welcome to the campaign! It is a dream come true for us to bring this game from Jarratt Gray and Carl de Visser back to gamers everywhere!\nEndeavor: Age of Sail is a strategy board game set in the historic Age of Sail. Starting out in the crowded hub of Europe, you must struggle to dominate at home while sending ships to the closed regions of the world... and be ready to seize control when they open up! You'll compete to grow the most successful empire through a smooth combination of:\narea control (capture key cities and the routes that join them!)\nresource collection (get the assets to build your empire!)\nengine-building (construct the buildings to power your strategy!)\naction management (use your population and trade tokens wisely!)\nThe elegant gameplay is driven by five different actions (Occupy, Ship, Draw, Attack, and Payment), and five different attributes (Industry, Wealth, Culture, Influence, and Glory):\nThe way you build, combine, and manage those elements creates your empire. Your challenge will be to navigate the maps of the world as they unfold, and write the history books so that the Age of Sail describes your victory!\nFor a detailed description of gameplay, see the How to Play section below. \n      Endeavor: Age of Sail preserves everything about the original edition that you know and love. The satisfying pacing which begins briskly but grows richer and deeper with every turn, the always-interesting breadth of the choices available to you, that feeling of the world unfolding as the game progresses, it's all still there. And it's all driven by that surprisingly lean ruleset which draws its complexity from the interactions and tensions that it creates. So how did we improve on this? Let's take a look:\nExploits are the major new gameplay addition unique to Endeavor: Age of Sail. Sure you can play the game without them (and for your first play you probably should), but once you play with them you'll never go back!\nIn each game you'll deal out three random Exploits (or choose three you enjoy playing with). Like the regions of the world, Exploits are locked at the start of the game. Each Exploit is a historical event from the era that is related to two of the regions on the board. When both of those regions are opened during the game, that Exploit becomes unlocked, and players may now begin interacting with its unique mechanisms and scoring opportunities.\nFor example, the Spanish Main Exploit is related to North America and South America. When those regions open up, that means that the Spanish Main is now occurring in the story of our game. Players may now use the Exploit's actions to Fortify their cities using the provided tokens (making them costlier for foes to attack), and once they've fortified, can trigger a powerful mid-round payment of workers back home! In addition, a new scoring opportunity opens up. Amazing! \nEach Exploit comes with its own immersive new abilities and strategic possibilities, and the game includes all of the special components that are needed to carry them out. This exciting variety of possible Exploit combinations means that every game will drive player interest towards different regions of the world, and create new pathways to victory even for seasoned veterans!\nPlayers command major seafaring empires during the historical Age of Sail. You have your own player mat, where you track your empire\u2019s attributes, construct buildings that permit you actions in the game, and gather Asset cards to build your attributes and gain Glory!\nEach round, you\u2019ll construct one building (based on your Industry level), gain population (based on your Culture level), pay workers to free up buildings (based on your Wealth level), take actions, then manage your cards (based on your Influence level).\nAt the start of the game, player actions are mostly limited to interacting with Europe; using your population to activate your own buildings, you\u2019ll draw Asset cards to increase your abilities, and occupy Cities to gain their Glory and assets, and to control the valuable links between them.\nSoon enough, you\u2019ll construct buildings that permit ship actions, and this allows you to reach out to the closed regions of the world. By shipping to a region, you can begin drawing cards from that region; when its shipping track is filled up, the valuable Governor card is awarded and the region becomes open. An open region\u2019s Cities and links can be competed over just like Europe\u2019s.\nEventually players will run out of room to expand, and if you\u2019ve built buildings with attack actions, you\u2019ll be able to engage in combat. Drive your opponents from the cities they\u2019ve claimed, to deny them the city\u2019s Glory points and to break up their network of profitable trade routes!\nOnce seven rounds have passed, the game comes to an end and scores are tallied. You\u2019ll earn Glory for:\nHow well you\u2019ve improved your four attributes (Industry, Culture, Wealth, and Influence)\nThe Cities you occupy and the links you control\nGlory symbols on your cards and buildings\nSpecial scoring opportunities from this game\u2019s Exploits\nThe player whose empire has accumulated the most Glory wins! \n           Tom's Playthrough\n Tom's Final Thoughts\n       ...plus glowing praise for the original edition of Endeavor:\n\"A very elegant design with easy to grasp, easy to teach mechanisms. Rich choices of actions on a rapidly evolving world map. No randomness beyond initial setup. Plenty of strategy and tactics packed into a 75 minute play time window. A definite 10 after repeat playings. Bravo!\"\n~Thorwolf (bgg user)\n\"A fantastic game - just the perfect level of depth for non-gamers to grasp reasonably well, but plenty of room for strategizing as well! Well done to the designers! So many paths to victory - and each so beautifully balanced.\"\n~superbgg (bgg user)\n\"I was surprised at how simple Endeavor is. It looks so thinky and complex, but the game play is actually quite easy. What sets it apart is the uniqueness of its mechanics and how it covers its historical theme in a way that is much more complete and accurate than most games with the \"Age of Discovery\" theme.

Created by the same design team who brought you the Zombicide series, under the supervision of Eric Lang, HATE combines the gruesome artwork of Adrian Smith with exquisitely sculpted miniatures to immerse you in a universe of cruel survival by any means.\nTake control of your tribe and lead them in battle against your opponents. Each battle pits two tribes controlled by different players, clashing against each other to achieve objectives, massacre the enemy, and reap rewards from blood and land. As the Chronicle unfolds, players engage each other in numerous clashes in an effort to defend or conquer territories, trying to be the ultimate Tyrant and rule the wastes of the world. While the HATE core box initially allowed for up to 4 players to fight through a Chronicle together, more tribes have since been unlocked allowing the game to expand to up to 6 players. Explore the 4 original core Tribes here: Um'Gra, Um'Rak, Um'Kator, and Um'Cal.  \n  Find out more about these Optional Buys in these links: The Mother Prophecy, Tribe of Vore Nash, Tribe of Um'Tull, Tribe of Sarrassa, Battlegrounds of HATE, HATE Art Book, 3D Plastic Plateaus, 3D Plastic Huts, 3D Plastic Trees, Red Dice.\nThe Tyrant - Only a worthy tribe will be led by this legend, all others will cower under his hateful gaze.\nEach battle in the Chronicle has consequences, not only in terms of the control of the land, but also in the tribes that fight for it. Killing your opponent in merciless fashion and reaping all that which the land has to give increases your tribe's Hate and Resources. These then allow your warriors to gain new skills, turning them into ever more formidable killers as the Chronicle progresses. You will also be able to bolster your village, giving your tribe extra abilities and features to use in both short and long term. However, dismemberment and death may also be your fate in the battlefield, and you will also need to carry the burden of that in your struggle for power. \nTribe of Um'Gra - Blood-frenzied maniacs, their recklessness is their greatest strength, though it can often be their weakness.\n  The world of HATE is brutal, and is recommended for mature audiences only. The art of the game depicts acts of extreme violence, as well as nudity. To survive and thrive in this barren wasteland, you'll need to embrace the savagery of not only massacring your enemies, but taking innocents captive, torturing them, and even feasting off their flesh. You've been warned, this is not a world for the faint of heart!\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Gra.\nEach tribe is composed of 11 characters: 2 Youngbloods, 6 Warriors, 1 Shaman, 1 Champion, and 1 towering Prince. (The last belong to the Varn, a \"higher\" lineage of men, who grew monstrous as the ages passed, by feeding on the lesser kind.) Each of these have different stats and starting skills, offering their own tactical choices in battle.\nThe Character cards show your tribe's initial skills and stats.\n  Tribe of Um'Rak - Hive minded, they move as one, to strike like a horde.\nEach tribe also counts on their own unique deck of 8 Tribe cards that they can employ at different points of the battle, usually by spending gathered Savagery tokens. These cards reinforce each tribe's individual nature by offering powerful bonuses and abilities to outmaneuver your enemies.\nTribe cards can often turn the tide of battle.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Rak.\nWhen a player challenges another to battle, they choose among 10 different scenarios to play, depending upon how close they are to conquering the heart of the land. Each scenario contains a different terrain setup, as well as different objectives the attacker and defender must accomplish in order to be victorious, and different rewards they may gain from that.\nTribe of Um'Kator - Jacks of all trades, they are relentless and always prepared for changes in the tide of battle.\nBattles are fast and furious, taking around 40 minutes to play. Players maneuver and activate their characters around the board to crush their enemies and reap rewards. Ganging up on an opponent is a sure way to bring them down, or hinder their attacks. Use terrain to your advantage, holding the high ground to dominate your foes. Pillage huts you find to steal their resources or capture any innocents hiding within (being careful of possible ambushes), and harvest withering trees for the meager resources they may yield.\nThe figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Kator.\nIf you happen be knocked out in battle, though, you had better pray your allies keep your limp body safe so you may live to fight another day. If you're carried off by the enemy, a fate worse than death awaits you (usually followed by death). At the end of a battle, captives are dragged to the villages, where the sadistic choice of whether to torture them to death (to gain Hate) or kill and cook them (to gain Resources) is made.\nTribe of Um'Cal - Fearless berserkers, they leave a trail of blood where they go, even if some of it is their own.\nAt the end of each battle, all Hate and Resources gained by each tribe is tallied in the Chronicle sheet. Every few of these gathered unlocks a milestone, which allows you to upgrade your tribe in several different ways. Resource milestones help you upgrade your village. Your tribe's Village sheet shows the buildings you have, and the ones you can build, as well as upgrade. The more you upgrade your village, the more resourceful your tribe becomes. The Forge offers you several Feats of Savagery that can be activated during a battle by spending Savagery tokens to gain different bonuses. The Hall of Heroes allows you to conscript Mercenaries to your tribe, the Training Grounds allow your characters to learn extra skills, and the Shaman's Hut gives you more control over your Tribe cards. At the end of each battle, you may use your Chiurgeon to heal your warrior's scars, and the bigger your Oven and Torture Pit are, the more enemies you can cook or torture!\nVillage Sheet.\n  The figures that make up the Tribe of Um'Cal.\nMeanwhile, Hate milestones allow you to choose Upgrade cards to add to your characters (those that have proven worthy in battle). These dozens of transparent cards contain a myriad of different skills for you to choose, including 6 of them which are exclusive to your tribe. The character cards are all protected by plastic sleeves, allowing you to simply slide the Upgrade card on top of them. Each character may have up to 4 different skills, becoming a legendary fighter. But be careful, such legends can still be killed and erased from the Chronicle.\nAdding an Upgrade to a Warrior.\n  Mercenaries come in all shapes and sizes, with varied abilities. They have their own goals, but you can force them to join your tribe!\nBeing wounded in battle can have drastic consequences. Any characters knocked down on the battlefield (those lucky enough not to have been dragged off and roasted) must make a roll to determine their fate. They may come out of it unscathed, or suffer a tragic death, but more often than not they'll go on carrying a scar to remind them of their failures. These can range from a mental debilitation, to a gouged eye or torn off limb, with the penalties associated with that. Scars are added to characters similarly to Upgrades, possibly cancelling a skill the warrior possessed!\nAdding a Scar to a Warrior.\n  The Mercenary figures, and the imposing Tyrant.\nOnce the Chronicle is over, how much Hate and Resources you accumulated, as well as the strength of the territories you conquered, will determine who becomes the Tyrant that rules the world, while their enemies cower under their merciless feet!\nExample of an epic battle between 4 Tribes!\nUPDATE: With the Stretch Goals unlocking an extra board and extra components, the game will also allow players to use a set of Optional Rules that introduce, at certain points of the Chronicle, massive battles involving more than 2 players. Form alliances in 2x1 or 2x2 battles, or go crazy in a free-for-all slaughterfest!\nDue to its violent, adult content, we have decided to make it so the entire HATE board game is Kickstarter Exclusive (or other crowdfunding platforms). This means the core box and any of its ancillaries can only be acquired through Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms, and will not be made available to stores through normal distribution channels. Limited quantities will be available to retailers who want to make a Retail Pledge to this campaign (see below), but if you're interested in HATE, this campaign is the only guaranteed place to get it.\nThe HATE miniatures are 32mm scale. However, the Princes and other members of the higher race are gigantic figures standing about 75mm tall! The pictures shown in the campaign are of resin copies, while the figures that will come in the game will be high-quality pvc plastic.\nOn the left is a resin figure, and on the right a first test sample of the plastic figure. As you can see, the detail already holds very well, even with improvements still being done to the mold.\nGame Components:\nAt the start of the campaign, the HATE core box includes:\n51 Highly Detailed Miniatures\n1 Game Board\n30 Terrain Tiles\nOver 100 Cardboard Tokens\n32 Tribe Cards\n51 Figure Cards\n88 Transparent Upgrade/Scar Cards\n44 Plastic Card Sleeves\n6 Custom Dice\n13 Counter Bases\n5 Scenario Dashboards\n1 Village Sheet Pad\n1 Chronicle Sheet Pad\n1 Rulebook\n  WIP RULEBOOK - Please note this is not the final version of the rules.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\n                                                                                            Please Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $60-$70 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $80 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries.\n $35 to Norway, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n $40 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n $60-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia. \nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\n  To learn about Retail Pledges click HERE. Keep in mind this will be the only chance for retailers to grab some copies of this game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 29th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is January 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia, Arcadia Quest: Inferno, Rum & Bones: Second Tide, and Massive Darkness. The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, Rising Sun and wave 1 of Zombicide: Green Horde are on their way to backers.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: wave 2 of Zombicide: Green Horde, and A Song of Ice & Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game, which are in production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of HATE.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features.

And we need YOU to help make #HipHopHistory!\nThis will be the third major anthology produced by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings that tells the story of a defining era of music \u201cof, by and for the people,\u201d following the Anthology of American Folk Music and Jazz: The Smithsonian Anthology. It will also serve as an extension of the objects and stories of hip-hop already displayed in the galleries of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, offering perspective on the African American experience and its impact on American culture. The Anthology will be a tool for education as it explores hip-hop\u2019s evolution and global influence.\nDesign subject to change.\nCreating something this ambitious is not easy. The Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap will be the first collection of its kind to include music from all the major labels as well as dozens of independent record labels.\nWe want to bring the Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap to as many people as we can, and we want to make it as affordable as possible once it is available. But the costs of production, research, and licensing are high. That\u2019s where you come in. We need YOU to help make this project a reality.\nMore than 120 tracks on 9 CDs;   \nA 300-page book with 10 essays, extensive track-by-track liner notes, and never-before-published images;   \nA 9th Wonder Digital Remix based on Smithsonian Folkways' catalogue, available exclusively from the Smithsonian through this Kickstarter;\nA Free Digital Album download from Smithsonian Folkways Recordings!\nThe box set will include a 300-page book with extensive liner notes, essays, photos, plus 9 CDs with over 120 tracks. Design subject to change.\nThe Smithsonian Anthology of Hip-Hop and Rap will illustrate different social and political trends within the genre, such as police brutality, feminism, and Afrocentrism. It will explore these themes through music from old school pioneers like the Sugarhill Gang and Roxanne Shant\u00e9 to artists of today like Kanye West and Nicki Minaj \u2014 and four decades\u2019 worth of essential names in between.\nThe track list is still being finalized \u2014 a major reason why we need your support! \nThe Anthology was developed by the Smithsonian in collaboration with an advisory board comprised of members of the hip-hop community including artists Chuck D, MC Lyte, Questlove and 9th Wonder; industry veterans Bill Adler and Bill Stephney; author, journalist and music critic Jeff Chang; and university scholars and authors Adam Bradley (University of Colorado, Boulder), Cheryl Keyes (UCLA) and Mark Anthony Neal (Duke).  \nThe committee reached out to more than 50 artists, scholars, DJs, photographers, filmmakers and other members of the hip-hop community for their input into the track list and final package.  \nCey Adams, artist and founding creative director of Def Jam, designed the Anthology.\nThe Anthology is currently planned for release in December 2018. A successful Kickstarter will help us stay on schedule! Backers will also be the first to receive the Anthology, plus receive rewards that won\u2019t be available anywhere else. \nBack and side view.

This includes albums from the African American Legacy Series, a multi-year collaboration with the National Museum of African American History and Culture that explores the rich African American musical and oral heritage in the United States. \nBackers of the project at higher levels get even more bundled with their Anthology, including a cling-on decal of the box set cover art designed by Cey Adams, illustrated hip-hop trading cards, and a subscription to Smithsonian magazine.\nReward designs subject to change. 9th wonder by Chris Charles.

Each print is signed by the photographer and is a limited edition artwork, 15\" x 17\" in size.\nJanette Beckman moved to New York City in 1983 and was drawn to the underground hip-hop scene.

Further, if a cause beyond the Smithsonian's control requires rescheduling or cancellation of an experience, the Smithsonian is not responsible for any additional travel or other costs a backer may incur in order to participate at the new time.

In fact, the Smithsonian was founded 171 years ago by a private donation to the United States government! Federal appropriations provide the foundation of the Smithsonian's operating budget and support core functions \u2013 safeguarding our collections, building operations and maintenance as well as staffing. However, we rely on private donations of all sizes to support many of our priorities, including research, educational outreach and special projects.\nIn other words, your support will make the Anthology possible. By backing the project, you will help the Smithsonian tell the powerful story of hip-hop and its place in American culture. You will truly be the reason it is brought to life \u2013 and we'll keep you involved as we create, design, produce and ship it to homes, including yours!\nYour Pledge Helps Support the Smithsonian\nThe Smithsonian Institution is a nonprofit organization exempt from tax under section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.  Depending on your level of support for the project, a portion of your payment may be deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

We are dedicated to supporting cultural diversity and increased understanding among peoples through the documentation, preservation, and dissemination of sound. Our collection consists of more than 3,000 albums and 43,000 tracks along with videos, playlists, podcasts, lesson plans for teachers, and Smithsonian Folkways Magazine.\nWe believe that musical and cultural diversity contributes to the vitality and quality of life throughout the world.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game. Nothing else comes close to touching it in terms of its raw, epic scope, ambition and design.\u201d\nRichard Ham \u2013 Rahdo Runs Through\n\"I have over 50 hours of gameplay logged with 7th Continent and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. This is easily the best game of the year, and one of the best I have ever played in my life.\"\nLance Myxter \u2013 Undead Viking\nPlay solo or in a team of up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood.\nNo dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings.

Each player uses their deck of cards to perform up to two actions per round. Actions range from colonization to naval movement, to battle, with most activity centered in Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. Players may also purchase additional cards to bolster their decks and provide them with more choices. There are also Strategy cards that players can purchase to give them additional advantages. \nInspired by A Few Acres of Snow, this game features several new elements, including navies and naval battles, cavalry superiority, mercenaries, field battles, sieges, manpower, strategy cards, random events, turn based scoring, bribery and tactical bonuses. The name of the game is based on a quote from a Carthaginian commander, who claimed at the outbreak of hostilities that the Carthaginian control of the seas was such that the Romans would not even dare wash their hands in the sea.\nThe game is played over the course of several turns, up to a maximum of twelve. At the end of each turn, players resolve random events, collect income and score victory points. There are several paths to victory, from simply having the highest score at the end of the game, to capturing the opposing player's capital.\nFor a copy of the version 1.1 rules click here.

When both of those happen then Knight Works, LLC will receive the funds within 14 days of the project end date. At that point, we will begin working with the manufacturer to produce the expansion. Based on previous estimates it will take approximately nine months to receive the game. Once we have the game a survey will be sent out through the Kickstarter website to collect shipping addresses.\nAdditional Copies? - Backers are more than welcome to add one additional copy of Hands in the Sea to the $50 \"General\" pledge reward (or) an additional Upgrade Pack to that $20 reward. All you have to do is add the additional cost of the reward to the appropriate pledge and we will cover the extra shipping cost! (NOTE: You may only add a maximum of 1 additional copy of each specific item and both items must go to the same address. Once again, we are unable to ship more than two games, or Upgrade Packs, per backer. If you are looking for additional copies of the game please check out our \"5 Copies Bundle\" reward.) If you have any questions, or need more than two copies, please send me a private message on Kickstarter.\nRetailers - If you are a retailer and interested in purchasing Knight Works products please contact me to discuss additional discounts. (Note: You will need to provide proof of your physical or online store.)\nShipping? - The cost for shipping has drastically risen over the past few years. To ensure the future success of Knight Works, I can no longer offer free shipping to US backers. The cost for shipping packages overseas has sky rocketed but Knight Works is absorbing a small portion of those costs.\nFor anyone interested, the \"5 Copies Bundle\" reward offers groups of backers to combine their pledge for free shipping to limited areas.\nPlease refer to the chart below for specific shipping information.\n  We started developing board games back in 1999, but it was not until the introduction of Kickstarter that we were able to mass produce games. We have many titles designed, play tested and ready to go. The number one issue in getting those games produced is the high cost to manufacture board and card games. With your help, we can bring several fun, high quality, and thematic games to players across the world.\n100% of the money we gather from Kickstarter will be used to pay for printing costs or the making/delivering of pledge rewards (art, shipping, etc.) If we raise significantly more, the extra funds will go into a larger print run, bringing the cost of the games down, and in upgrading the already existing pledge rewards.\nPlease check out our Facebook page and click \"Like\" on our page at www.facebook.com/knightworksgames.

Thanks to your continued support since then, we've released sixteen great books about classic video games, and we've got so much more planned for the future. \nFor Season 4, we're offering five all-new books by six all-new writers. This time around, every book this season shares one thing in common: unprecedented access to people who made these games. In our first ever Creator Access Edition, you'll meet a diverse group of creators and characters, including:\nFinal Fantasy legend Hironobu Sakaguchi\nMark Turmell's team behind NBA Jam, including announcer Tim Kitzrow\nKnights of the Old Republic Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn\nYacht Club Games, the entire team behind Shovel Knight\nthe team behind Postal, and infamous video game film director Uwe Boll\nWe hope you\u2019ll subscribe to Season 4 and join us as we explore these fascinating games.\nFor Season 4, we've enlisted designer Cory Schmitz to give our covers an updated aesthetic that will look great on your shelf alongside all of our previous titles.

With a groundbreaking job system that combined the usual character classes like knights, thieves, and mages with offbeat classes such as chemists, dancers, and bards, the game appeared to be a shoo-in for North American distribution. But the game was dubbed \"too hardcore\" for a Western audience and was swapped out with Final Fantasy Mystic Quest, a simplistic new game tailor-made for Americans.  \nThat didn't stop a teenage Chris Kohler from tracking down Final Fantasy V. The young RPG fan got a Japanese copy of the game, used it to teach himself Japanese, and with the help of some internet companions created the first-ever comprehensive English-language FAQ of the game. As the internet narrowed the cultural gap between the East and West more each year, the game was eventually translated into English for the PlayStation, Game Boy Advance, and iOS. \nFans in the West finally got to learn what all the fuss was about. Now the acclaimed author of Power-Up and an editor at Kotaku, Kohler is revisiting the game that started his career in games journalism. Based on new, original interviews with Final Fantasy V's director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, as well as previously untranslated interviews with the rest of the development team, Kohler's book weaves history and criticism to examine one of the Final Fantasy series's greatest and most overlooked titles.\nRead an early excerpt at Kotaku and listen to the author talk about the game on this recent episode of Retronauts.\nChris Kohler is the author of Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life, and the founding editor of Game|Life, the Webby-nominated video game section of WIRED. He is currently Features Editor of Kotaku, and lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. \nShovel Knight by David L. Craddock\nIn 2014, Yacht Club Games released its very first game, Shovel Knight, a joyful 2D platformer that wears its NES influences on its sleeve. This unlikely pastiche of 8-bit inspirations manages to emulate the look, feel, and even the technical limitations of nostalgic titles like Mega Man, Zelda II, and Castlevania III\u2014imbued with a contemporary sense of humor and self-awareness. But how is a fundamentally retro game created in the modern era? And what do the games of the past have to teach today's game designers?  \nBased on extensive original interviews with the entire Yacht Club Games team, writer David L. Craddock unearths the story of five game developers who worked so well together while at WayForward Games that they decided to start their own studio. From the high highs of Shovel Knight's groundbreaking Kickstarter to the low lows of its unexpectedly lengthy development, Boss Fight presents a new master class in how a great game gets made. Get ready to steel your shovel and dig into this fascinating oral history. For Shovelry!\nDavid L. Craddock lives with his wife and business partner in Ohio. He is the author of Stay Awhile and Listen, a three-part series that chronicles the history of World of WarCraft developer Blizzard Entertainment and Diablo/Diablo II developer Blizzard North; Break Out: How the Apple II Launched the PC Gaming Revolution by Schiffer Publishing; and HERITAGE, a young adult fantasy novel. Connect with David on Twitter or Facebook.\nNBA Jam by Reyan Ali\nWhen NBA Jam dunked its way into arcades in 1993, players discovered just how fun basketball can be when freed from rules, refs, and gravity itself. But just a few years after Midway's billion-dollar hit conquered the world, Midway, home version publisher Acclaim, and even video arcades themselves fell off the map. How did a simple two-on-two basketball game become MVP of the arcade, and how did this champ lose its title?  \nJournalist Reyan Ali dives deep into the saga, tracking the people and decisions that shaped the series. You'll get to know mischievous Jam architect Mark Turmell, go inside Midway's Chicago office where hungry young talent tapped into cutting-edge tech, and explore the sequels, spin-offs, and tributes that came in the game's wake.\nBuilt out of exhaustive research and original interviews with a star-studded cast -- including Turmell and his original development team, iconic commentator Tim Kitzrow, developers and executives at Midway and Acclaim alike, secret characters George Clinton and DJ Jazzy Jeff, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell, Doom co-creator John Romero, and 1990s NBA demigods Glen Rice and Shaq -- Ali's NBA Jam returns you to an era when coin-op was king.\nFollow Reyan's progress on Twitter at @nbajambook.\nReyan Ali is a writer from Columbus, Ohio. He\u2019s been published by Wired, Rolling Stone, Spin, The Atlantic, Pacific Standard, and alt-weekly papers across the country. Born in Dallas, he grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, where he soaked up 1990s NBA action almost exclusively through trading cards, Beckett Basketball back issues, and NBA Jam: Tournament Edition on the Sega Mega Drive. His first writing gig was contributing to the Mortal Kombat Netherealm (MKNe), a fan site long lost to time. At MKNe in 2000, he scored his very first interview: GamePro editor Dan Elektro. Over a decade later, he interviewed Elektro once more -- this time for NBA Jam, his first book. \nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic by Alex Kane\nSet in an even longer time ago in a galaxy far, far away, BioWare's 2003 RPG Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic wowed Jedi and Sith Lords alike with its compelling characters, lightsaber customization, complex morality choices, and one of the greatest plot twists in video game history. Among the droids and blasters, the game delves into themes like choice, free will, and the construction of identity and memory.\nFeaturing brand new interviews with Lead Designer James Ohlen and Senior Writer Drew Karpyshyn, game critic Alex Kane's book unveils how this classic game was made, analyzes KotOR's worldview through the lens of philosophy, mythology, and the ethics of war, and investigates how the game borrows techniques from contemporary films like The Sixth Sense and Fight Club. Whether you align with the light or the dark side, you're invited to dive into this fun and thoughtful exploration of the most beloved Star Wars game of all time.\nYou can read an early excerpt of the book here.\nAlex Kane is a freelance journalist and critic based in west-central Illinois. His work has appeared in Glixel, Kill Screen, the website of Rolling Stone, StarWars.com, and elsewhere.\nPostal by Brock Wilbur & Nathan Rabin\nIn 1997, game studio Running with Scissors released its debut title, Postal, an isometric shooter aimed at shocking an imagined pearl-clutching public. The game focused on a disgruntled \"Postal Dude\" whose goal is to murder as many people as possible. It was crass, gory, and dumb\u2014all of which might have been forgivable if the game had been any fun to play.  \nPostal gained enough notoriety from riding the wave of public outrage to warrant a sequel. And DLC. And a remake. And, perhaps most surprising of all, a Golden-Raspberry-winning feature film adaptation directed by the infamous Uwe Boll.  \nIn this thoughtful and hilarious tag-team performance, comedian Brock Wilbur & media critic Nathan Rabin mine the fascinatingly troubled game and film for what each can tell us about shock culture & mass shootings, interviewing the Scissors team and even Boll himself for answers. Like it or not, Postal is the franchise that won't die\u2014no matter how many molotov cocktails you throw at it.\nBrock Wilbur is a writer and comedian from Kansas who now lives in Los Angeles. He lives with his wife Vivian and their cat, Cat. He is the author of a forthcoming book about growing up with a adopted Bosnian brother, and an investigative journalism piece where he exposes a cult that has haunted the east coast since the late 70s.\nNathan Rabin is the former head writer of The A.V Club and a staff writer for The Dissolve as well as the author of six books, including The Big Rewind (Scribner), My World of Flops (Scribner), Weird Al: The Book (with Al Yankovic) (Abrams) and most recently 7 Days in Ohio and Kanye & Trump for his own imprint, Declan Haven Books. He is also the proprietor, owner and editor-in-chief of his own website, Nathan Rabin\u2019s Happy Place. He lives in Decatur, Georgia with his wife, dog Ghostface Killah, and son Declan.\nEach campaign, backers get a chance to decide the subject of one of our upcoming books. Thanks to our supporters, we've published fan-selected books on Chrono Trigger and Shadow of the Colossus, and last season's choice Final Fantasy VI is planned for future release. Now it's time for you to pick the next fan-selected Boss Fight Book.\nWhen you back the campaign, hit the comments section and name the game you most want to read a book about. Then, in the final week of the campaign, we're going to tally all the games mentioned and create a shortlist of 3-4 finalists, and you can vote once more on the finalists. From there, we'll put out a call for book pitches about that particular game, and choose the author who we think will write the best book.\nMay the best game win!\n  Since the series launch, Boss Fight Books has been written up in top-tier publications. Check out a small sample of our reviews for last season's books:\nOn Super Mario Bros. 3 (named one of author Dennis Cooper's Favorite Nonfiction Books of 2016): \"Super Mario Bros. 3 is worth a look, especially if that mustachioed plumber holds a place of reverence in your own nostalgic heart.\" - ZAM\nOn Mega Man 3: \"This is a fantastic book for anyone who is interested in the history of Mega Man, Nintendo in general, video game design, the Japanese gaming industry, nostalgia, and excellent writing.\" - E.C. Myers\nOn Soft & Cuddly: \"[...] a love note to all things grungy and bootleg, to everyone who managed to succeed despite standing in their own way.\" - Heavy Feather Review\nOn Kingdom Hearts II: \"[I]t's Alexa's own personal story and attachment to the game's questions [...] that make up the hardest-hitting points of her critiques and analyses over the series. If this is the start to a new age of discussion over the series, I welcome it with an open heart.\" - Kingdom Hearts Insider\nYou can check out our Press page for more coverage, and read some reviews at Goodreads and Amazon.\nTry before you buy!

The knights were closely tied to the Crusades, and they were considered to be some of most highly skilled fighting units of that time. The orders grew in wealth and power for almost 200 years until King Phillip IV of France had them persecuted and arrested for reasons that are discussed by historians to this day.\nCrusaders: Thy Will Be Done, a brand new game from designer Seth Jaffee (Eminent Domain, Terra Prime), will put players in the role as the leader of a Crusading Order. Using an innovative Mancala/Rondel mechanism, they will move their knights through Europe and the Middle East. They will battle with enemies, construct buildings, and train troops - all the while trying to be the order that has gained the most influence before the game comes to a close.\nCrusaders: Thy Will Be Done will be published in glorious Deluxified\u2122 format, with all the quality you have come to expect from TMG.\n  First, why don't we let the designer, Seth Jaffee, tell us in his own words what was behind his creation of Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done:\n\u201cAwhile back, I heard about a brand new boardgame coming out that was going to combine a mancala mechanism with a rondel. I thought that idea was brilliant, and made some assumptions on how that must work. My guess was that on your turn you would choose an action to do, resolve that action based on the number of action tokens in that space on the rondel (the more, the better), then distribute those tokens around the rondel a-la Mancala. This sounded fantastic, as each action would sort of grow in power until you take it, then it would revert back to zero, and you\u2019d have to build it back up before taking it again. I was really excited about this idea, but to my surprise, I found out that I\u2019d guessed wrong!\u201d\n\u201cSo in a weird bit of serendipity, my incorrect guess at the mechanism ended up giving me an idea that would make for an entirely different mechanical experience, one I thought was well worth pursuing. Looking at how Crusaders turned out, I think I can safely say I was right.\u201d\nTasty Minstrel Games is committed to not only publishing amazing and excellent games, we also want those games to look amazing and excellent as well. Our past Kickstarters for Orleans and Yokohama have set a high mark for Deluxified\u2122 components, and we will continue that standard of quality with Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done.\nThe additional cost for the Deluxified\u2122 components matches our cost with no additional profit, to make and deliver them to you the backer. For this reason, TMG will only make a Deluxified\u2122 version through crowdfunding. We will make enough for Kickstarter Backers, some replacement copies, and some convention sales in Limited Quantity.\n   A major part of playing Crusaders happens on a players personal player board, which has a lot going on as you can see.\nTo get a full run down of game play, and how the player boards interact with the main map, check out this video.  \nCheck out the rules for Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done HERE\nHelp our Crusaders rise up!!!  Conquer these funding goals one step up at a time.\n  TMG thinks Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done is sure to make gamers all over the world happy, but instead of taking our word for it, we reached out to several independent reviewers and asked them to tell us what they thought of the game.\n        While technically not a review, Twist Gaming was kind enough to have TMG's own UndeadViking on their channel at Dice Tower Con and played Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done!\nAlso at Dice Tower Con, TMG had dozens of people demo Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done. We were able to capture some of their thoughts on video!\n    With more reviews on the way. \nPeople have come to expect a premium experience when choosing to support a Deluxified\u2122 TMG game. Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done will follow our high quality shipping standard of being bubble wrapped, boxed individually and then boxed up again before being shipped to you. This will ensure that your copy arrives in pristine condition, ready to enjoy. The following is an unboxing of a Deluxified\u2122 Yokohama, to illustrate what we are offering:\nPLAY\n\nIn addition to premium packaging this project is:\nWhat does Friendly Shipping mean? It means that for each of these countries we will be sending bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly. We have also done all we can to ensure that globally everyone has a good experience with the best shipping options that we could source. Whenever a shipping partner has the games and is ready to ship, we give the green light. This means that some parts of the world might receive their game a few weeks before other places. This is done so that you get your game the earliest we are able to get it to you!\n\nCrusaders: Thy Will Be Done will be sent in 4 primary shipments that will go to shipping partners in the US, EU, AU, and Asia.\nThe approximate weight of this game will be 4kg - a heavy package. Shipping fees are not a profit center for TMG, and all shipping prices listed below are based on the shipping quotes of a package of that weight.\nUSA - $6\nUK - $14\nCanada - $15\nBelgium - $19\nDenmark - $19\nGermany - $19\nIreland - $19\nNetherlands - $19\nEuropean Union - $22\nMexico - $23\nAustralia - $25\nCroatia - $29\nGreece - $29\nChina - $30\nHong Kong - $30\nJapan - $30\nPhilippines - $30\nTaiwan - $30\nCyprus - $33\nNew Zealand - $35\nUnited Arab Emirates - $44\nSaudi Arabia - $51\nBrazil - $60\nRest of the world - $90\n\nWe realize that the last amount is quite expensive. We suggest to backers that fall inside that shipping category to possibly look into using an independent freight forwarder This would allow the use of an address in the U.S. which could lower the overall cost of shipping.\nTMG is offering a Retailer Level pledge for Deluxified\u2122 copies of Crusaders: Thy Will Be Done. Yes, this will include all of the stretch goals and be identical to the other Deluxified\u2122 copies. Only Brick and Mortar retailers can pledge at this level. \nRetailers can order 4 or 8 copies for $50 each, which is 50% off of the $100 MSRP pricing. This price includes shipping. This is for US delivery addresses only. Retailers outside of the US will need to use a US forwarding address.\nThe pledge tier cost of $30 which will applied toward the final payment. Final payment will be due just prior to shipping the games.\nAt the close of the Kickstarter campaign, retailers will receive a survey Retailers must provide a copy of their business license or similar information as proof of their retail business to qualify for this pledge level. \nWe are excited to offer this option to our Retailer partners so we can explore even more ways for people to enjoy the Deluxified\u2122 version of our game.\nAll of us here at TMG realize that a good relationship between publisher and backer during a crowdfunding campaign is paramount for it to be a success. It is our goal to make sure that the communication in the Kickstarter projects run by Tasty Minstrel Games will be more active and connected than ever before. For the first 7 days of the campaign, we will post updates at least once every 72 hours. In addition, during normal business hours (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Mountain Time on weekdays), the comments page will be monitored for questions and those will be answered by the TMG Staff.    \nAfter the first 7 days, while the campaign is live, we will update the campaign at least once a week. The comments page will continue to be checked on a regular basis every day and questions will be answered at those times.  \nAfter the campaign has concluded, the comments page will continue to be monitored on a regular basis, but with less frequency than before. Any questions posted will be answered when they are seen. Updates will be sent whenever new, pertinent information about the campaign can be relayed to backers. If 30 days go by without new, pertinent information, a quick \"all is well\" update will be posted to maintain communication with our backers.  \nAfter the games have been sent to our backers, and fulfillment has been completed, we will consider the campaign to be concluded, and any further communication would need to go through our normal support lines.   \nIt is our mission and our intent that with these guidelines, our backers will enjoy an unprecedented level of connection to the campaign, ensuring a satisfying experience from the beginning of the campaign to the day that the game is delivered to them, and beyond.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTasty Minstrel Games (TMG) has delivered numerous games throughout the world.

As their car approaches the edge of the continent, the world outside the window seems to be unraveling ever faster as if somewhere beyond the horizon, the hollow core of civilization has finally caved in.\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag is the internationally acclaimed author, concept designer and artist behind Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood. His highly imaginative images and stories depicting illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes have made St\u00e5lenhag one of the most sought-after visual storytellers in the world.\nNow, St\u00e5lenhag turns his unique vision to America in a new narrative artbook: The Electric State. With your support, these amazing images will turn into a top-quality narrative artbook, truly doing justice to the extreme attention to detail and quality of St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nThe book will also add St\u00e5lenhag's own texts to supplement the images, giving you an even deeper understanding of the universe of The Electric State.\nJust like Tales from the Loop and Things from the Flood, The Electric State will be a thick, oversized artbook of over 120 pages with print, paper, and binding of the highest quality.\nThere will be two versions of the book - the standard edition (included in the ROBOT RUNAWAY reward level) and the limited edition (included in the SENTRE AGENT reward level and above).\nThe limited edition, with an exclusive and beautifully embossed cloth cover, is unique to this kickstarter and will never be printed again.\nThe Electric State - Limited Edition\n  Through this Kickstarter, you can get your hands on exclusive art prints of Simon St\u00e5lenhag's work.\nAt the DRONE PILOT reward level, you get a 50x70 cm canvas print, signed by Simon himself.\nAdditionally, we have the five ART COLLECTOR reward levels, limited to a single backer each, that include a unique artprint of an illustration from The Electric State. These top quality artprints in format 70 x 70 cm or 70 x 100 cm are printed directly on sturdy polystyrene board and each includes a rigid metal frame for easy hanging on your livingroom wall.\n  The Electric State kommer \u00e4ven att publiceras p\u00e5 svenska. I den backer-enk\u00e4t som f\u00f6ljer kan du ange vilket spr\u00e5k du vill ha boken i. Det g\u00e4ller \u00e4ven den begr\u00e4nsade utg\u00e5van.\n  The Electric State will be a top-quality artbook no matter what, with paper, printing and binding of the highest grade. The illustrations and the story form a unified work of art, that will not easily benefit from expanding. This means that this Kickstarter will not have a large number of stretchgoals, as we have a very clear vision for this book and we will not compromise on it in any way.\nThat said, we have a few stretchgoals - which have all been unlocked during the first day of the campaign! See below for more information on those. We will consider new stretchgoals to add - stay tuned!\nSTRETCHGOAL 1: ELECTRIC STATE ROADMAP - UNLOCKED!\nA full-color map of the alternate 1997 America depicted in The Electric State. The map will be included in the book for all backers, and printed separately as well at no extra cost for backers at the ROBOT RUNAWAY level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 2: IN-WORLD AD FOR ELECTRIC STATE VR TECH - UNLOCKED!\nIf we hit this stretchgoal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag will create a fictitious advertisement booklet of four pages or more for the virtual reality technology present in universe of The Electric State, letting you learn more about it. The \"ad\" will be included in the book itself, expanding it for all backers at level DIGITAL WANDERER and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 3: IN-WORLD AD FOR ELECTRIC STATE DRONE TECH - UNLOCKED!\nIf we hit this stretchgoal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag will create a fictitious advertisement booklet of four pages or more for the robot drone technology present in universe of The Electric State.

The art print will be included at no added cost for all backers at the ROBOT RUNAWAY level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 6: SOUNDTRACK BY SIMON ST\u00c5LENHAG - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself will compose a short soundtrack for The Electric State (4-5 songs). The music will be in the same style as the score in the trailer video, which is also composed by Simon. The soundtrack will be delivered digitally to all backers at the DIGITAL WANDERER level and above.\n STRETCHGOAL 7: ART PRINT #3 - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print a third separate high quality art print of one of the images in The Electric State.

In it, players take on the role of a starship captain stranded in hostile space. As captain, you'll be tasked with assigning crew member to various stations in order to deal with external threats like enemy spaceships, as well as internal threats like system malfunctions. \nOriginally starting as a print & play game, Deep Space D-6 released commercially in 2015 through a successful Kickstarter campaign. Beautifully minimalistic and tightly designed, the small print run was quickly consumed by avid gamers of all types and stock has been scarce ever since. \nIt's time to return to the deepest of deep space! Whether you are an accomplished D-6 Captain or have never tried a solitaire board game before, I'm glad to have you aboard! Now is your chance to get a hold of Deep Space D-6 with a revised rulebook. In addition, there is a new mini expansion that brings a new threat to the galaxy. This is a rescue mission and we'll need all the help we can get. \n          What's new in the reissue? \nThis is a straight reprint (not a 2nd edition). The first Kickstarter unlocked a wealth of enhancements and the box is at max capacity. As such, there will be no stretch goals and only minor changes from the first printing. The components are largely identical with the following revisions:\nRevised Rulebook - added some card clarifications\nHull and Shield cubes now have rounded corners\nOuroboros gameplay text has been modified\nRead more about the changes here.\nNew RPG game mode:\nClick the image to learn more.\n  The Long Way Home is an optional roleplaying supplement for DSD-6 that will be made available for free to all backers in the months following delivery of the game. A professionally printed version may happen in the future, but will not be part of this campaign. \nEach turn in Deep Space D-6 you'll roll crew dice and assign them to stations to perform unique ship actions. There are 4 unique ships, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. \nYou can learn more about the game by visiting the original Kickstarter campaign here. \nHere are some videos made from the first printing:\n   Special thanks to all video contributors!\nWant to know more? Check out the original rulebook.\nOr try the Print & Play.\nMagnetic one-piece box\n4 Ship Boards\n6 custom 14mm crew dice, 1 standard threat die\nThreat Deck of 54 cards including the Ouroboros Boss Encounter  \n8mm plastic Hull and Shield tracker cubes\nRevised Rulebook\nInfirmary card\n  As with all my Kickstarters, you won't find crazy positive video reviews/previews or extensive marketing campaigns with stretch goals where I try to maximize funding by over promising. As an independent publisher, I believe in investing in a solid product, and not my ability to convince you to back it. The following videos are completely independent and have no affiliation with Tau Leader games. \nThis video nails my design intention regarding the interesting decisions and how they are less about the random dice rolls, and more about deftly managing threats and resources:\n  See more written and video reviews at BoardGameGeek.com\nFound this cool piece on reddit: I'm really surprised how well designed Deep Space D-6 is\nCalling all captains! A new threat has been detected. We don't know where they came from or what they want, but their numbers never seem to end.\nnon-final artwork\nTo defeat this new threat you'll have to perform overkill effects or be prepared to be overwhelmed by rapidly deploying enemy fleets. The Endless feed off each other and the more of them on the board, the more dangerous they become. Lucky for you, we've got ship upgrades available to help you overcome this radical new threat. \nThe Endless Expansion, available for the first time through this Kickstarter consist of:\n54 new cards including external threats, internal threats, ship upgrades, and a new final encounter.\nReplacement Ouroboros cards to bring the 1st edition inline with the 2nd printing.\nNote: You do not mix this new expansion with the base game cards. This new mini-expansion plays on it's own but requires the base game. However, the upgrades can be used with the original threat deck. Fully compatible with all 4 ships. Yes, it fits in the base game box.\nThe nice thing about this campaign is that shipping is no longer a mystery. Final box dimensions and weight have been predetermined. Shipping for this project is a subsidized rate of the actual shipping costs I was charged from the original Kickstarter campaign fulfillment. \nTo see the shipping rates, click on the pledge tier you are interested in and it will display the different costs based on your region. \nGames will be shipped through fulfillment centers primarily in China, the EU, and the US. This reduces custom fees and VAT. \nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge. You may add up to 2 additional copies and/or any number of expansions for the listed pledge price. There is no extra shipping charge.\nPlease note: There is an error in the Fleet Commander pledge. The estimated delivery is not November 2017. Estimated delivery for Fleet Commander pledge is December 2017, just like the rest of the pledges. \n  Tony is a visual designer and UX specialist currently residing in New York.

A vast network of mossy underground tunnels and connected forest areas await your adventurers! \nForest of Shadows is a stand alone expansion that you can play on its own or in combination with the original. \nOne Deck Dungeon: Forest of Shadows is a 1-2 player roguelike adventure card game (just like the original One Deck Dungeon!) It's a standalone expansion, so it can be played as its own full game, or mixed with the original. If you're new to One Deck Dungeon, see the Basics section below for an introduction to gameplay.\nThe game includes 44 Encounter cards, 5 Dungeon/Boss cards, 4 Level cards, a Stairs card, 5 postcard-sized Hero Cards, a Turn Reference, a set of campaign sheets, 15 hearts for damage tokens, 6 potion cubes, 8 poison cubes, and 30 shiny translucent dice. The 3D shot above doesn't show them as translucent, but that's merely a failing of my amazing 3D skills. Basically, the expansion has the same types of components as the base game. Since it's a stand-alone expansion, that makes sense!\nForest of Shadows comes with both a full v1.5 rulebook and a small rules supplement for its new mechanics. \nThe core gameplay elements are the same as the original One Deck Dungeon; you'll still be busting through doors ready to beat up baddies and avoid dangerous perils. There are some new twists, and of course all-new cards!\nYou can download a full Print and Play version of the base game and Forest of Shadows, along with the rules PDFs for each.  \nPrint and Play: [ Base | Forest ] Rules: [ Base | Forest ] \nv1.5 Upgrade Pack\nSince the original game's printing, we updated some of the terminology and made a few balance tweaks. A full list of these can be found in our [v1.5 Patch Notes] \nSeveral tiers offer a v1.5 upgrade pack, which is a full deck of 56 cards and 6 hero cards + turn reference with all the updates. You can add-on upgrade packs to any tier by adding to your pledge according to the chart at the bottom of the KS page. A full copy of the v1.5 rulebook is included with each copy of Forest of Shadows.\nPlastic Cards vs Normal Cards\nPlastic cards are waterproof, durable, and still very smooth to shuffle. Most people say that they feel like normal cards! You should never need to sleeve plastic cards, but avoid getting acidic foods or drinks on them. That can damage the coating. Both types of cards fit safely in the box (normal cards fit with sleeves, unless they are very thick sleeves)\nAdd-ons / Shipping Costs\nAt the end of the page there is a list of add-ons available and shipping costs. Simply increase your pledge by each add-on you want, and you're good to go! No additional shipping costs required. If you're in the EU (including the UK) we cover VAT and customs fees for you.\nWe'll have a post-campaign pledge management website to let you specify what your add-ons are, and increase your pledge if you decide you want additional items!\nOne Deck Dungeon is fully co-operative. Each turn in the game is shared by the entire party. Every turn, time will pass, and then the party will decide to either Explore or Enter a Room. Exploring will add more face-down cards to the dungeon as closed doors. Entering a room flips over one of these doors to reveal an encounter: either a combat you must face, or a peril to overcome.\nCombat encounters pit you against the monsters and denizens of the dungeon. Each card has a variety of challenge boxes, representing the amount of damage and spent time you might incur while fighting.\nIn a combat, you'll roll one die for each of the attribute icons on your hero card (plus any items you've picked up). You can place a die in any box matching its color, as long as the die's value is at least as high as the number in the box. \nAny boxes you don't fill with dice represent the consequences of vanquishing your foe: the amount of damage the party incurred and how long it took to win. Damage tokens are placed on your hero card, but be careful -- if the number of tokens is equal to your health, the game is over. As long as you survive, though, you always win the battle and claim loot. You're heroes, after all!\nPeril encounters pit you against all sorts of obstacles you may encounter on your adventure. Each peril has two options to choose from for how to best overcome it. \nAgainst a peril, you'll roll only your dice of the color that matches the choice you picked, trying to fill the box on the peril card for the option the party chose. Wide boxes like those on peril cards can be filled by any number of dice added together. Don't worry! You don't have to roll an 11 on one six-sided die.\nEven if the party takes damage and spends time, you still claw your way to the loot behind the peril... as long as the fall from that rope bridge wasn't too bad.\nEvery encounter you survive brings you loot! Each card in the dungeon deck can be used as loot in one of three ways. You always get the card as loot, even if you took damage or spent time during the Suffer Consequences step for not filling some of the challenge boxes in the encounter. \nItems and Skills are tucked underneath your Hero card. Items will increase your dice pool and possibly your maximum health. Skills are used during encounters to modify your dice or roll additional ones to help you overcome the situation at hand.\nExperience is tucked underneath the Level card. Your current level determines the maximum number of Items and Skills your hero can possess. Each time you level up, you'll also get a free potion. At the start of the game, you only have access to Healing potions, but you may find other types as you delve deeper...\nEach of the five dungeons has its own unique set of effects and challenge boxes. As you delve deeper into the dungeon, more and more of these boxes will be revealed. They add difficulty to every encounter in the game, and mean that an adventure in the Vile Roots feels very different from the Realm of Venom.  \nOnce you go through each section of the dungeon, the boss awaits at the end, on the back of the dungeon card. The boss battle is a multi-round combat encounter. If the party can vanquish this final foe, you'll have emerged victorious!\n  Poison is a new type of consequence that appears in challenge boxes. 8 green poison cubes are included with the game, and they get placed on heroes just like normal damage. Poison is dangerous for two reasons:\n1) If you ever need to add a poison token and none are available, the heroes lose.\n2) Every time the party explores, and before each round of boss combat, roll one die to resist poison. If the roll is higher than the number of poison tokens in the entire party, remove one poison token. Otherwise, remove one poison token and replace it with two damage tokens.\nLuckily, there are herbs in the forest! Half of the cards in the expansion have a leaf icon on them. For each open door with a leaf showing when the party explores, add 1 to the resist poison die roll.\nRemoval: Several boss and dungeon effects remove dice or poison tokens from play. These are not returned to the supply, they're placed in the box for the remainder of the game! \nSince running out of poison tokens ends the game, this is quite dangerous. Having less dice available is no picnic either, as you'll start running out when you try to use skills during encounters.\nPet Panther / Peril Options: Do you want a pet Panther? I bet you do! Several of the perils in Forest of Shadows have the loot they provide determined by which option the party chooses. In the case of the panther, you can try and sneak by it to claim an item, or charm it to keep it by your side for the rest of the adventure. Nobody's fighting that panther. It's big!\nCombining Sets: Forest of Shadows is a standalone expansion, which means you do not need the original game to play. You can mix and match heroes and dungeons from the two sets. The Hunter could visit the Dragon's Cave, and the Rogue could journey into the Realm of Venom. You can also create a dungeon deck of the two sets mixed together, taking 22 cards from the original One Deck Dungeon and 22 from Forest of Shadows. See the rulebook for more details! \n              We're doing something fun for this campaign: instead of small stretch goals for things we really wanted to put in the game no matter what, we're focusing on big exciting stretch goals! \nIt's still fun to reveal and unlock things as the campaign goes along though, so we revealed a number of bonus items over the course of teh campaign!\n5th Hero: The Alchemist was added. She gets a second use out of every potion!\n5th Dungeon: The Lair of Indrax was added, the hardest of the 5 Forest of Shadows dungeons!\nCampaign Sheets: New Campaign Sheets, with 3 new focus groups were added.\n6th Dungeon + Hero: Caliana and the Phoenix's Den will be in every copy of Forest of Shadows. Previously, they were available only as a PDF download.\nHordes of the Shadows: A special card to increase difficulty for 4 player games was added. Since the Phoenix's Den increased the deck size to 60 for the expansion, we added this card, along with Basic Potions and Poison Reference cards.\nThe big stretch goals below are all for items that don't go in the game box, because they are either digital in nature or simply too large and awesome. The goals are high, but that's what stretch goals should be - things we wouldn't be able to do without your support:\nOur first stretch goal is for a story mode to accompany the campaign sheets included with the game, and also a full soundtrack with a song for each of the five dungeons. The story will feature a choose-your-own-adventure style plot between games, linking together the 10 available dungeons into one larger campaign. It will be available as a PDF or on our website, OneDeckDungeon.com.  \nWe've already made one track, it's the one used in the video. Here's the full version:\nThe playmat has been unlocked early, and is available as a $20 add-on to your pledge. See the add-ons section below for details!\nShipping rates for this campaign are very simple. You pay one rate based on your region, regardless of the number of games you want to add on.\nUPDATE: We have reached a deal to prepay your customs and VAT if you're in the UK or elsewhere in the EU. In addition, we've been able to reduce shipping from $20 to $15 for UK backers. There's a special pledge level for UK backers, the $20 UK Shipping Zone level.\nKickstarter backer orders will be sent out first, before any copies bound for conventions, retail, or distribution. You're our backers! You deserve to be the first to delve into the Forest of Shadows. Sorry about all the poison and monsters~\nIn keeping with our simple shipping scheme, additional copies are very easy to add to your pledge. Simply add the amount below (after shipping), and note in the Kickstarter survey which thing you've backed for when the campaign concludes.

After the first campaign, many people remarked that they couldn't possibly be plastic after feeling how nice the surface and shuffling was! \nJust, you know, don't put ketchup on them. Turns out the coating doesn't like acidic condiments.\nNeoprene Playmat:\nWe commissioned a beautiful playmat for One Deck Dungeon: Forest of Shadows, with spaces all lined out for your adventures! The mat accommodates 1-2 players, sitting either next to each other or across a table (simply rotate the hero card area to sit across from each other. The mat is 24\"x14\", and it's been on display in paper form on our last few streams. The playmat will come rolled-up inside a box (15\"x2\"x2\") for each storage and shipping.If you'd like one, simply add $20 to your pledge like any other add-on. There's no additional shipping charge.\nThe playmat was illustrated by the talented Naomi Robinson. You can see more of her work on her website, twitter, and instagram.

This year we are excited to expand the Aeon\u2019s End universe with a standalone game compatible with the existing world. If you aren\u2019t familiar with Aeon\u2019s End, you can check out the BGG page, watch The Dice Tower review where it was given the Seal of Excellence or the \"Watch It Played\" video tutorial.\nGravehold remains the last bastion of The World That Was. As the otherworldly incursions from the creatures known only as The Nameless intensify, a cadre of strange survivors emerge from the void itself. Will they be Gravehold's salvation or its undoing?  \nWar Eternal is a standalone game compatible with the hit cooperative deck building game Aeon's End. Players will struggle to defend Gravehold from The Nameless and their hordes using unique abilities, powerful spells, and an all new cast of dynamic characters. Featuring a number of innovative mechanisms, including a variable turn order system that simulates the chaos of an attack and deck management rules that require careful planning, War Eternal can be played alone or combined with other Aeon's End content for a game experience like no other. \nClick here to read Aeon's End designer, Kevin Riley explain the new LINK mechanic.\n          Man vs Meeple's review and developer interview:\n  Rahdo Runs Through review:\nBower's Game Corner: Aeon's End: War Eternal Review:\n Two Bats Aeon's End: War Eternal Review:\n    Backers that would like to further enhance their game play experience can add $20 to the pledge level of their choosing to receive the Accessory Pack. \nThe Accessory pack includes:\n124 Player cards - enough cards to have a unique set of starter cards for each mage included in War Eternal, Aeons End, and all the expansions/stretch goals for these two projects. \n24 Player Dividers - Dividers for each Mage's starting deck. \n10 Translucent d10s - Life Counters for each Mage, and extras for Minions. \n 24 Translucent Charge tokens - \"Gems\" used to track charges on Player mats. \n12 Translucent Power tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Player abilities. \n10 Translucent Nemesis tokens - \"Gems\" used to track Nemesis abilities.\nThese accessories make the game easier to store, set-up and play, and even more visually appealing.\nWith the new graphic design of Aeon's End, we are offering updated player cards, nemesis cards, and player mats to backers who already own the original release. We are not changing card backs, so those who prefer to not update their cards may continue to enjoy their existing games and expansions with new expansion materials across the different editions without using the Update Pack. \nIf you backed or preordered Aeon\u2019s End directly, and you back War Eternal: You will automatically be sent the Update Pack (for Aeon\u2019s End, Depths & Nameless) with your War Eternal rewards for no extra charge.\nIf you back War Eternal, and you purchased Aeon\u2019s End, Depths and/or Nameless elsewhere: You will be able to get the Update Pack for what you\u2019ve already purchased by adding $10 to your pledge amount (includes shipping costs worldwide). We will require photographic proof of purchase (a picture of your Kickstarter username on post-it note attached to the game box and/or nemesis mats). Your Update Pack will include cards and Player Mats for Aeon\u2019s End and the expansions you\u2019ve purchased.\nA limited number of Update Packs will also be available directly from Indie Boards and Cards in the late fall of 2017. Those update packs will be $10 plus shipping & handling, and will require photographic proof of purchase.\n Player Mat\nThis player mat isn\u2019t necessary \u2013 but it is very functional! If you want the player mat sent with your rewards, add $25 to your pledge. You can add more than one copy.\nNew Games from Indie Boards and Cards\n In addition to War Eternal, we are planning on releasing two new games at GenCon this year. Both of these games are in a similar vein as Coup; light, fun, high player interaction, and definitely more strategy to them than is apparent on the first play.\nClick here for the rules for Pirate 21.\nClick here for the rules to Witching Hour.\nPirate 21, by Jeremy Commandeur & Franklin Kenter, is a trash talking, special power using, and deductive (but no bluffing) variation of 21 for 2 to 6 players. It\u2019s a game that we first played at BGG Con in 2015 and have been tweaking it since then. If you want Pirate 21, add $10 to your pledge amount. You can add more than one copy.\nWitching Hour, by first time designer Bruce Baskir, is a very clever hand management game for 2 to 5 players that we first played at Geekway 2016 and have been playing and thinking about it ever since. If you want Witching Hour, add $10 to your pledge amount. You can add more than one copy.\nExtra copies of rewards\nWe know that some backers want more than one copy of a reward level. To do this, you will need to 1) pledge at the highest level from which you want the rewards, and 2) add to your pledge amount based on the chart below. The numbers in the two leftmost columns in chart below are inclusive of shipping (ie, you don\u2019t have to add shipping cost for each item, just the first which Kickstarter does automatically).\nPledge Manager\nIt is important that everyone knows that we are not using a pledge manager. That means you\u2019ll have to add to your pledge amount for all the add-ons that you want, before the project is completed at 10pm pacific, April 20th. To change you pledge amount, click the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the top of this page.\n Then click \u201cChange your Pledge\u201d, enter the new pledge amount and click \u201cContinue\u201d. The tricky part is that you\u2019ll need to calculate the total pledge amount on your own (see details below to help) and won\u2019t get an immediate confirmation of what you have added. This has to be done before the project ends (10pm pacific, Thursday April 20th). We will get all the details we need from you when we send the project surveys out, that will be done the week of April 24th (we need to get the information quickly in order to send the right number of games and add-ons to their fulfillment centers).\nExamples:\nExample 1 \u2013 US backer wants Enlightened Exile ($65), Accessory Pack, Update Pack & Witching Hour:\nSelect the $65 pledge level and change the pledge amount to $109 - $65 pledge level, $20 Accessory Pack, $10 Update Pack, $14 Witching Hour. Note the Update Pack will require a photographic proof of purchase, see the FAQ for more details.\nExample 2 \u2013 Canadian Backer wants Voidwalker ($130), two Enlighted Exile ($65) and 3 player mats:\nSelect the $130 pledge level and change the pledge amount to $340 - $130 pledge level, $15 shipping, 2x$60 add-on Enlighted Exile (from chart above) and 3x $25 Player Mats.\nNote \u2013 Add-ons are only available at the $65 and higher pledge reward levels. Add-ons are not available on the $1 or no reward levels.\n                                                                                    Note that anything marked with these symbols are:\nPromo - an item that Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Gen Con & Essen) will get in their rewards, and will not be included in the retail edition of Aeon's End: War Eternal or The Void Expansion. These items may be released at a future date as promotional materials and/or game expansions.\nKickstarter Exclusive - an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (and those signed up to get rewards at Gen Con & Essen), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. \nAeon\u2019s End: War Eternal is the 36th project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. With the successful execution of our first 35 projects, we have become experienced publishers with a reputation for great games (in design and production) that are delivered in a timely fashion. \nAeon\u2019s End: War Eternal was designed by the talented Kevin Riley. This game has undergone extensive testing and development to ensure the best possible experience. We are confident that this game will be in your collection for years to come. \nThe original base game Aeon's End received The Dice Tower Seal of Excellence\nAll of the art assets are complete and ready for immediate upload after the project funds. \nPrices include US shipping. This project is also EU & Canadian friendly.\n  Kickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects. Every month, tens of thousands of people pledge millions of dollars to creative projects in dozens of categories.  \nA person who supports a project is called a \"backer.\" The process of giving money to this project is called a \"pledge.\" \nIn return for your pledge, we (the creators of the campaign) are able to offer \"rewards,\" depending on the amount you pledge. For example, if you pledge $65 to help back the project, we'll offer you a copy of the game along with any stretch goals we achieve as soon as it is manufactured. \nYou can become a backer in just three easy steps: \nStep 1: Read through the pledge levels and rewards we're offering in the right sidebar of this page. \nStep 2: Click the large, green \"BACK THIS PROJECT\" button to the right of the trailer video at the top of this page. \nStep 3: Enter your pledge amount, and complete the steps for filling in your information. This process takes just a few seconds! That's it! It's really that simple! Thank you for backing! \nOnce you've backed this project, we encourage you to share this page on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, and share with your friends and family.

For additional copies in the US and international, check our rates below.\n    Our plan is to have Aeon\u2019s End: War Eternal available at Gen Con. While our current production schedule looks like Kickstarter rewards will ship out before Gen Con, it may be the case that we have games at Gen Con before the Kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Gen Con in time. I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results, but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.  \nIf you want Gen Con or Essen pickup \u2013 DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT \u2013 all you have to do is sign up for our Gen Con email list by giving an email address here or the Essen email list by giving an email address here. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pickup (NOTE: we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). \nAll the stretch goals will be available in the games we bring to Gen Con and Essen \u2013 your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games. \n                                   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the 36th Kickstarter project from the combined teams behind Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games. We have learned how to streamline the game publishing process and have successfully delivered all of our previous Kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. Our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time and we have every confidence that Aeon\u2019s End: War Eternal will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards & Action Phase Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nThe component quality of Aeon's End was lacking in a couple of places. We are working hand-in-hand with the factory to make sure that these issues are addressed. We've expressed concern with them that the cards must be aligned better, the dials must be tighter, and some of the components must be thicker. We are confident we will be able to deliver a final product for War Eternal that is more in line with our, and your, expectations.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Survivor", "descp": "Your continued support will help Gravehold to endure.\nNote - this reward level is not eligible to receive the Update Pack, nor the Accessory Pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["106 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "Enlightened Exile", "descp": "One copy of War Eternal and The Void expansion with all stretch goals.\nBackers of the Aeon's End 2016 Kickstarter will also receive the Update Pack.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing.

I felt like the game was a sandbox for points but I had some really interesting directions I could go. \nCombat system felt solid and exciting enough to create elements of the unknown while not being bloated or time intensive.  \nInteraction/timing/playerboard all blended together great.

Earth's shield fell and the Znu scorched the surface to an irradiated wasteland. In desperation and for the survival of the species, she sent Earth's massive Worldship on a decade-long journey to uncharted space. Their destination was the fringes of the galaxy, where there was a chance to gain a foothold, grow in strength, and perhaps find new allies for the fight against the Znu and Decima empires. Learning of this plan, the great empires sent their own Worldships, following Earth to the edge, determined to stake their own claim and win the war for the fringe. \nRecruit alien units to fight for your cause.\n    In Empires of the Void II, each player has been given command of a mission by an alien empire to establish a foothold at the fringe of the galaxy. The game begins when their massive Worldships reach the fringe, where they must explore, wage war, use diplomacy, and construct buildings to gain victory. The fringe is sparsely populated with many sentient species struggling to survive, leaving huge regions of planets open for exploration and colonization. Many species are eager to ally themselves with a powerful empire to gain security and stability in a chaotic and difficult time.\n  Player board for Sreech.\nA few insights by the game designer:\nWhy only eight main planets instead of twenty or more?  \nOne thing that I feel like I miss in most space empire-building games is unique planets with character. In the 4x genre, it's not uncommon for planets to be little more than rocky globes with few features other than a resource or two. In many of my Empires of the Void prototypes in past years the planets lacked enough personality, history, or inhabitants to help me remember them clearly while I was playing. I settled on a smaller number of planets because it means that we can tell more stories about those places. We can spend some time on them, learning about the people who live there and experiencing the memorable events that take place. Does this mean that there are fewer spaces compared to other games in the genre? Not really. There are uninhabited planets and other interesting places to visit, which in another design might have been split into 6 different square or hexagonal tiles. Players can spend more time making interesting choices rather than slowly uncovering the map one tile at a time.  \nCard Play  \nMy favorite thing about Empires of the Void II are the action and event cards. The action cards were inspired by games like Twilight Struggle and other modern war games, which I admire for their ability to tell a compelling story in an area control game. I love the multiple uses they have, and the challenge of playing them in the most efficient way possible. And you can't just get rid of them. You've got to use each one, and when you find that perfect combo of actions it can be extremely rewarding. Will you use the high power number for battle? Or will you wait and bide your time and use the card for an action at the perfect moment?  \nPlayer Interaction  \nMany of the design choices were based around player interaction. It's common in a 4X game to not have anything to do with your opponent until over half-way through the game, when you finally have that giant battle, which is something I wanted to avoid. That can be fun, but I wanted to explore a new angle in the genre and give players something different. Right out of the gate, you'll be competing against your opponents and working on a strategy to get ahead of them. You'll be battling each other before even half of the board is revealed. The tension is fun and immediate, and that's the way we wanted it.  \nAlien Units Instead of Ships  \nThere aren't many different types of starships in the game. We don't have buckets of generic plastic fighters or carriers or dreadnoughts, or battles that include throwing rounds of dice to see how they fare against one another in a battle of attrition. Instead, I wanted to give the alien inhabitants the spotlight. Each alien that you encounter in the fringe has their own power and special abilities. Some of these let you disable other types of units. Some allow you to move farther. They break the rules in interesting ways, and encourage you to make a unique squad of memorable characters.\nRulebook\nLeaf through the work in progress and definitely not final RULEBOOK.\nGameplay Video\n      3d Renders- Not Final\n      Hi, I'm Ryan Laukat.

The standard, retail version will include stretch goals (except where noted).\nChanging Backer Rewards\nFor this project we are unable to change or accept alterations to the backer level rewards (backers may, however, add one extra copy of the game for $60).  There is no additional shipping cost for this extra copy.\nAdding Copies\nThe limit for adding copies to your reward level is 1 copy. So in total, the maximum amount of copies per backer would be 2 copies. There is no additional shipping cost for the extra copy. The two games must go to the same address. You must add $60 to your pledge for this additional copy.  We are unable to ship more than two copies per backer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my thirteenth Kickstarter project, and with each project, I could not have printed and produced them without the support of Kickstarter backers. We've worked for months testing and polishing the game. Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth preproduction process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 54 or more", "title": "Empires of the Void II", "descp": "1 copy of Empires of the Void II, Standard Retail Edition.\nDoes not include metal coins, Fusian Beast minature, cloth goods bag, or designer diary 40-page book.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Empires of the Void II Deluxe", "descp": "1 copy of Empires of the Void II, Deluxe Edition.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,920 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Shipping the Games!", "update_content": "Hello!\nI'm excited to tell you that the games are in and our fulfillment partners are starting to ship them!

All previous North Sea titles are also available as add-ons in this campaign. Please see the add-ons section to see exactly which titles are available in each language.\n  In Raiders of the North Sea: Fields of Fame, enemy jarls have joined forces to help defend against the onslaught of raids on their settlements. But despite their threats, there is fame awaiting those who seek to kill or subdue them. Encountering a jarl is sure to bring injury, but now is no time for the faint-hearted. Onwards to the battlefield!\n\nKey Features:\nComponents for an extra player\nTownship Board with 3 new raids\nJarls bring new strategies and more ways to score Victory Points\nCrew Members can take wounds in battle, weakening players' crews\nPlayers collect Fame in battle, worth Victory Points at the game's end\nHow Does It Change Raiders?\n\nFields of Fame brings a new dynamic into the game with the addition of Jarl tokens being mixed in with the Plunder and Valkyrie. When taking a set of Plunder with 1 or more Jarls, the raiding player must reveal from the draw pile, which Jarls they are encountering. They have the option to kill (for Fame and other rewards), subdue (to recruit them) or to flee. Killing and subduing will bring wounds to a players crew, but fleeing will lose them Fame or Victory Points. Players can also gain Fame by raiding with overpowered crews. When a crew's strength is above the highest tier for scoring Victory Points, players move up with the Fame Track, which scores additional Victory Points at the game's end.\n\nRulebook - Download the PDF here\n\nComponents\nAdditional Components\n(Conquered Stretch Goals)\n18 More Townsfolk Cards\n3 More Jarl Cards\n2 Valkyrie Dice\n6 Double-sided Multiplier Tokens\n3 Reference Cards\nUpgraded Wound Tokens\nIn Raiders of the North Sea: Hall of Heroes, a mead hall has been constructed, attracting a new breed of adventurers. Each raid brings new quests for the daring to endure. But with mead in abundance, there is little room for the wary. So sharpen your axe and ready your shield, there are new adventures awaiting!\n\nKey Features:\nComponents for an extra player\nMead Hall Board with new Village location and card drafting area\nQuests bring new strategies and more ways to score Victory Points\nNew Mead resource allows players to gain more strength in battle\nLarge Player Boards for storing cards, Quests and resources\nHow Does It Change Raiders?\n\nHall of Heroes brings in new ways of gaining resources, acquiring crew and scoring Victory Points. After each raid, a new Quest is placed onto the Board. To complete a Quest, players will need to send (discard) warriors from their hand of a certain strength value. Once completed, the Quest is placed above a Player's Board and will score Victory Points at the game's end. Each Quest also rewards players with Iron, Gold, Silver and other resources. Players can also collect Mead, which can be spent during a raid to fuel their crew and gain even more strength in battle!\n\nRulebook - Download the PDF here\n\nComponents\nAdditional Components\n(Conquered Stretch Goals)\n18 More Townsfolk Cards\n4 More Reputation Tiles\n6 Double-sided Multiplier Tokens\n3 Reference Cards\nUpgraded Mead Tokens\nThis optional add-on item is a larger box (classic Ticket to Ride / Village / Endeavor size) and comes with a custom plastic insert, designed to hold all components from Raiders of the North Sea + both expansions. The insert also allows space for sleeved cards.\n\nAdditional Components\n(Conquered Stretch Goals)\n40 Wooden Provisions\nCan Both Expansions Be Played Together?\nAbsolutely! Fields of Fame and Hall of Heroes have been designed to complement each other. Mead gained in Hall of Heroes can help boost your crew's strength to gain more glory in Fields of Fame. Likewise, subduing strong Jarls in Fields of Fame also frees up your hand to go on more Quests in Hall of Heroes.\nWhat About Additional Players?\n\nEach expansion adds components for an additional player. So playing both expansions together now allows for up to 6 players in a single game.

Gather your squad of Giant Killer Robots (GKRs), build your deck, and face your rivals in the ultimate fight for fame, fortune, and sweet salvage rights. Scheme, strategize and strong-arm your way to victory as you dominate the media landscape, one billboard at a time. \nTHE ROBOT RUMBLE STARTS NOW!\n      GKR: Heavy Hitters is a standalone, customizable tabletop game for 1-4 players, combining high-quality collectibles with dice-rolling, mech-building and tactical play! Pilot your Heavy Hitter (the biggest, baddest robot on the board) and a squad of three Support Units through the ruins of an old city, competing to either wipe your opponent off the map or reduce four skyscrapers to rubble.  \nKEY GAME FEATURES\nA unique hex-based tabletop gameplay experience\nx4 Giant high-quality Heavy Hitter miniatures up to 139mm tall\nx12 highly detailed Support Units  standing up to 47mm tall.\nx10 Buildings that break up the landscape and alter the way you play, every time\nx193 cards with unique artwork from Weta Workshop artists\nFour corporate Factions, each with its own weapons and abilities\nFour Pilots with special skills\nFive distinct phases of play\nTwo ways to win!\nTHE WORLD OF GKR\nThe story goes like this...Big plague. People died. Governments fell over. Things got bad, real fast. Fortunately, the corporations saved the day! Under their command, things got a whole lot better. But what to do with all those abandoned cites? There\u2019s money to be made in the salvage rights. But which corporation gets them? Enter the Giant Killer Robots League.\nAIM OF THE GAME\nThere are two ways to win GKR: Heavy Hitters. Defeat your opponent through brute force, or reduce four buildings to rubble by Tagging them with advertising. Winning is a careful balance of managing energy, repairing damage, earning new Pilot skills, gathering and using sponsor-endorsed upgrades, and moving into positions that give you tactical advantage for your unique weapons.\nCHOOSE YOUR PILOT\nPart superstar athletes, part celebrity spokespeople for their corporate Factions, these guys have been chosen as much for their ability to drive Heavy Hitters as for their ability to drive ratings. Pick your Pilot carefully! Each will unlock special skills and upgrades on the Achievement board to help you strategize your way to victory. \nCHOOSE YOUR FACTION\nGKR: Heavy Hitters features four unique corporate Factions. Each has a squad of GKRs ready for you to take control, including one Heavy Hitter and three Support Units with a whole heap of special abilities. As Pilot, you get to pick one Faction to fight for. Which will you take into combat?!\n   DEPLOY PHASE\nThis is your chance to deploy your Support Units to the field. The Combat, Repair and Recon Units come with attack and defence capabilities unique to your Faction. \nMOVEMENT PHASE\nNext, move your Heavy Hitter and Support Units into a tactical position on the battlefield.\n  COMBAT PHASE\nTime for the smackdown! In the Combat Phase, Factions attack and defend against each other with the roll of the dice. Rather than turn-based order, weapon speed determines who strikes first.\n  Every Heavy Hitter has an arsenal of Primary Weapons, Secondary Weapons, and Orbital Strike. Primary Weapons are broken into 3 classes: Energy, Missile, and Ballistic. Use your cards wisely! If you sustain damage, you lose cards. If you lose all your cards to damage, you\u2019re OUT!\n TAGGING PHASE\nThis is your chance to assert advertising dominance on the battlefield. Place four Tags on a building and you demolish that Building. Demolish four Buildings, and you win the game!\nFor each Building you Tag, you also earn a Sponsor Card. Use \u2018em throughout the game to give you a tactical advantage through hacking, counter-hacking, or even a spot of corporate espionage.\nDon\u2019t underestimate the power of a Sponsor Card. They can tip the balance between sweet victory and humiliating defeat!\nRESET PHASE\nThe final phase of the round is the Reset. Draw new Faction Cards, replenish your energy and get ready for another round of robot rumble!\n\nUpgrade to plastic Dashboard available in Stretch Goals!\n         No game is complete without putting it through its paces in the playtesting arena.

As the R&D Lead Designer, Matt has more than 30 board and card game releases to his name, working with iconic properties such as DC Comics, The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Naruto, Street Fighter, Cartoon Network, and many more. \nOn home turf, we\u2019ve been able to call on the talents of the incredible Weta Workshop crew: from model makers, painters and motion graphics artists, to marketing and management maestros, graphic designers, and behind-the-scenes image-makers.\nWe\u2019d like to thank everyone who has poured their time and effort into GKR: Heavy Hitters, including all the people we\u2019ve met on our playtesting sessions across New Zealand, Australia, and North America!\n Backers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand, and the USA will not have to pay any extra fees!                                                              \nShipping of the GKR: Heavy Hitters Kickstarter will be coordinated by our dedicated Consumer Products team here at Weta Workshop in Wellington, New Zealand. We have more than 15 years\u2019 experience shipping collectibles, merchandise, and other types of consumer products all over the world! For this Kickstarter, our planned fulfilment centres are located in the USA, Canada, the Netherlands, Australia, and New Zealand. Your order will ship from the closest hub to your country. \nFinalized shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter ends, through our Pledge Manager. Revised estimates for shipping our GKR: Heavy Hitters Core Box follow. \nPlease note that these are estimates ONLY. We will be charging shipping based on the EXACT cost required to ship you the game, the applicable Stretch Goals, and Add-Ons. \nUSA - $35\nCANADA $40 \nEU - $40 (excluding EEC countries) \nNZ - $25 \nAUSTRALIA - $40 \n *All prices are in USD, and include all Tax, Duties, and Customs. \nTo all our New Zealand backers: We\u2019re hoping to give you the option to pick your game up in person from the Workshop. Watch this space as plans are taking shape! \nRegions where additional fees may apply (all prices quoted in USD): \nNon-EU EEC Countries - $40 \nAsia - $50 (China, Hong Kong, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, & Vietnam) \n Rest of the world - $110 \nPLEASE NOTE: There are different import laws and customs entry rules for some countries that may prevent your goods arriving. Please check your country\u2019s rules and regulations relating to the importing of goods. \n If your wallet\u2019s feeling the burn on those shipping costs, rest assured \u2013 we hear you (and your wallet). Here\u2019s the deal, though: those shipping costs are pretty colossal because GKR: Heavy Hitters is a pretty colossal game! I mean, check out this size comparison\u2026 \nHapsi soda can used for scale reference only\n  And rest assured \u2013 we\u2019re packing a whole lotta goodies in the final package. Including many Kickstarter exclusives that you won\u2019t be able to get anywhere else! We reckon you\u2019ll be stoked with the final product and we can\u2019t wait for our box, to land in your mailbox.\n\n\nCancellations and Refunds Policy\nWe know that sometimes, situations change. Maybe you\u2019ve spent all your pocket money getting the rust off your Recon Unit. Maybe you bet the house on King Wolf winning Division One. Whatever the reason, if you find yourself seeking a refund, here\u2019s what we offer:   \nYou may cancel your order at any time during the funding phase. We recommend you have a quick read of the Kickstarter terms and conditions before you pledge \u2013 they can be found here.\nAll pledges are binding at the closure of the GKR: Heavy Hitters Kickstarter. After this time, no refunds or alterations will be available.\nIf you receive a damaged item, you may return it for a replacement. All replacements are subject to availability and proof of damage. If no replacement is available, we\u2019ll refund you in full.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe estimated delivery for GKR: Heavy Hitters is December 2017. This may be our first Kickstarter, but rest assured, this isn\u2019t our first rodeo: we\u2019ve created and delivered high-quality consumer products for more than 15 years. We have fantastic relationships with our manufacturers and distributors, who - like us - have very high standards when it comes to quality and meeting deadlines. \n\nIn this industry of manufacture and logistics, there\u2019s always the possibility of unexpected delays on matters like production, shipping and customs. Best laid plans, and all that. While we can\u2019t foresee every bump in the road, here\u2019s what we do know: We\u2019ve put many, many months of planning and love into making sure that the manufacture of GKR: Heavy Hitters goes as smoothly as possible. We guarantee you that this product has our full attention, with a dedicated team on board every step of the way. In the extremely unlikely event that we are unable to deliver the game, we\u2019ll refund all pledges in full. That said, we\u2019ve got no reason to expect that this will occur. \n\nIf we do hit speed bumps along the way, we\u2019ll get the message out to our backers openly, honestly, and immediately.\n\nOur goal is to share the world of Giant Killer Robots through a fantastic game that\u2019s an absolute blast to play.

Gone are days of the merry band of travelers fighting off evil. In Vast, you will become part of a new legend... Any part you wish!   \n    Play as the daring Knight, the chaotic Goblin horde, the greedy Dragon, the cunning Thief, or even the Cave itself \u2014 powerful, brooding, and intent on crushing the living things that dare to disturb its gloomy depths. Each role has its own powers, pieces, and paths to victory \u2026 and there can only be one winner.\n  The Knight must kill the Dragon. The Knight gains power by completing Sidequests and recovering lost Treasures. She can reset her abilities each turn.\nThe Goblins must kill the Knight. The Goblins builds three Tribes by playing a push-your-luck game. Then they move around the board trying to corner the Knight.\nThe Dragon must wake up and escape through the entrance. The Dragon starts out slow but wakes up as he steals Treasures, devours Goblins, and explores the Cave. He does this by playing cards to fuel various powers.\nThe Cave must fully expand and then collapse. The Cave does this by gaining Omens, placing Treasures to lure the other players into its depths, and placing tiles.\nThe Thief must steal treasures to buy his freedom. The Thief uses stealth and actions to take Treasures from the other players and the Cave. As he does this he must get them back to the entrance.\nWith a Cave constructed of tiles, and decks full of monsters, special abilities, and game-changing events, no two playthroughs will ever be the same. Vast is truly unlike any game you\u2019ve ever played. \n            The Ghost\nThe spirit of a long-lost adventurer, cursed to haunt the Cave for eternity. Her only hope of finding peace is to collect the few lasting remnants of her mortal life scattered throughout the Cave, and draw enough strength from them to finally escape the curse.\nThe Ghost is an advanced role that works with any combinations of players and roles, or allows you to play with up to six players at once. She travels slowly through the Cave, but has telekinetic powers that allow her to manipulate other objects from a distance, and she can even temporarily possess other players to force them to do her bidding.\nMoving Entrance\nThis stretch goal adds a miniature for the entrance to the set of miniatures. You can place this miniature on top of the Entrance tile to show its location clearly. The miniature will also come with a new rules variant, in which the Entrance tile can be destroyed like any other tile, making it move to a new place. \nThe Ghoul\nCorrupted by the Cave\u2019s power and the last remnants of its humanity long gone, the Ghoul lives only to hunt. It relentlessly stalks and terrorizes the other roles, growing stronger with each battle.\nThe Ghoul is an additional player role that can be used with any combination of player number and roles.\nTreasure Chest Miniatures\nThis stretch goal adds 12 Treasure Chest miniatures to the set of miniatures.\nBonus Cards\nThis stretch goal adds 6 bonus cards to the game for all pledge levels.\nThese cards will not be exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. They will include the Treasure Trove and Silver Gauntlet promo cards. I will add a funding level for people who just want the cards and the ability to purchase addons.\nCrystal Miniatures\nThis stretch goal adds 9 Crystal miniatures to the set of miniatures.\nNightmare Unicorn\nThe Nightmare Unicorn will run around the board attacking and teleporting until it brings the Cave down on you. Stop it while you can.\nThough the Nightmare Unicorn was designed just for solo play, we are trying to adapt it so it can be played instead of the Dragon or automated with a mix of other roles.\nThis stretch goal also unlocks the option to pledge for a $30 bundle of all three role addons.\n  Vast | LederGames\nPrint and Play Files\nLederGames on Facebook\nLederGames on Twitter\nVast: The Crystal Caverns sticker pack for iOS 10\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMiniatures are always a challenge to make which is why we pushed it into a later project.

In each episode, we'll use VR to interview creators from inside the digital worlds that they've created, giving you a unique new perspective on their work.\nFor the first season of the show, we're producing five episodes. We'll release the first episode on Oculus Home and Steam in December, a few weeks after this Kickstarter closes. And if you haven't bought a VR headset yet, Kickstarter backers will be able to watch the first season using our experimental non-VR client. After that, you'll get two episodes of The FOO Show every month, until we complete this first season. \nSTRETCH GOALS: We've posted stretch goals in the updates section, but we wanted to let you know about them here. We're already adding hats that you can put on the avatars in the first season of the show. Our next goal is to add a virtual version of the delightful Danny Baranowsky as our bandleader to the first season. Check out the post for full details, and enjoy a sneak peek at the theme he's written for us below. \n We have more stretch goals, planned, so let's make this awesome graphic even longer in the next 48 hours or so! \n     Even if you don't have a VR headset, you can watch (and interact with) The FOO Show. In addition to standing and room-scale VR with hand controllers (like the Oculus Touch or HTC Vive), seated or standing VR with a gamepad, Kickstarter backers will get exclusive early access to our 2D client. Using the 2D client, you'll be able to watch the show, explore the environment, and even pick up, rotate, and take a closer look at the objects you find in the world. \nAt FOO, we believe that VR shows should highlight the strengths of virtual reality. They should be engaging and interactive, but most of all, they should be fun. That's why we've built immersive, 3D-rendered worlds for our guests and viewers to explore. Our show can only exist in virtual reality. If you've tried our Firewatch episode, you know that exploring the inside of a video game--walking around and picking up props is exciting, fun, and a completely unique experience. (If you haven't tried it yet, what are you waiting for? Head over to Steam or Oculus Home and try it out now, the preview is free!) \nUltimately, we believe making this kind of virtual reality show should be accessible to everyone. You shouldn't need a Hollywood production studio and a multi-million dollar budget to build the type of shows we envision. We want the virtual reality equivalent to the television show to take full advantage of the strengths of the medium--VR demands interactivity. Producing The FOO Show on a regular schedule is the first step on the path to making that dream a reality.\nWe've been working on FOO for more than a year. It turns out, it takes time to turn an idea into something people can use every day. Our deliberate approach has let us continue to iterate and learn from our experiments and minimize time lost due to mistakes.  \nWe started with the animation. Andre built a simple prototype last summer to experiment with inverse kinematics using the Rift DK2 and a Razer Hydra. He sent a version of that to me so I could see how it worked in person.  \nHow do elbows work again?\nAs you can see, the movement was OK, but the arm joints weren't modeled in a believable way. Instead of the complex movement of the human shoulder, we relied on a simple ball and socket joint.  \nOur next step was to build a demo we could show to potential production partners and investors. We brought Sindre on, who built the first version of my custom avatar, and jammed out a demo that I showed to a few hundred people in the fall of 2015.  \nOh snap!\nWe iterated the demo a few times, and went to some fun/weird places building variants with increasingly weird features. Those culminated in this proto-FOO Show, where I interviewed myself about why I quit my job to start a VR company. It demonstrated the VR talk show concept to people who didn't get it, but was also kind of terrifying.  \nThis may be hard to believe, but interviewing yourself about yourself is challenging.\nOur next major milestone was our first public release of the Firewatch episode. In addition to figuring out how to record our avatars, we also had to track objects, and it was our first time recording multiple people at the same time, in the same space.  \nI regret not asking Jake and Sean about this mug. It remains hilarious to me.\nSince then, we've done a lot more work, added the ability to animate and track the state of objects in the world, further improved the character animation, added a rudimentary editor, built the experimental 2D client, built a VR-native user interface for the client, and lots more. We can't wait to show you what else we've been working on.\nLook, sometimes I miss the old Franken-arms.\n  We're raising $50,000 to pay for production of the first five episodes of The FOO Show. Our costs vary based on the location we're shooting, the amount of hardware we need on-site, the personnel we need on-site, the number of guests we have, and the complexity of the game assets we have to import or create. While travel and on-site personnel can be expensive, our largest cost lies in building virtual sets, creating avatars for our guests, and adapting art from other projects to work in virtual reality. Our cost for the episodes we're planning ranges from $5,000 to $20,000, with an average price of $10,000. \nWe already have one full episode of The FOO Show done and ready to publish, with more ready to shoot during the Kickstarter campaign. We'll start posting episodes of The FOO Show as soon as we can send codes to backers, to ensure that backers will be the first to get access to the new episodes. After that, we'll publish two episodes a month until the first season is completed.\nNo one has tried to do a 3D-rendered VR show on a schedule this aggressive before, so by supporting FOO, you're helping make VR history. \nTo make The FOO Show, we've built tools and infrastructure for VR that mimics a live television studio. Our tools let creators front-load the hard work of making 3D-rendered VR so that they can record and release shows quickly, without the need for much post-production, just like a TV studio. \nWe wanted to be able to record shows using off-the-shelf hardware, including the HTC Vive and Oculus Touch. Using this hardware helps keep our costs down, but it also affords interesting opportunities for multiplayer experiences in the future.\nMy elbows, they're powered by MATH!\nWe use the Vive and some complex math to animate our 3D characters. This lets us capture the nuances of human motion, so that even though our characters use a low-fidelity art style, your brain immediately starts treating them like humans. After just a few moments in an episode of The FOO Show, you'll forget that you're in a recording of human-like avatars and will feel like a fly on the wall of a fascinating conversation.  \nIn the real world, productions ranging from the local news to The Price is Right to The Tonight Show happen in live studios. By building these tools for VR, we hope to enable a massive explosion in the variety and quality of non-gaming VR experiences. We're using The FOO Show to refine our tools and pipeline. When they're ready, we'll bring in more creators, with the eventual goal of making FOO technology available to anyone who'd like to make 3D-rendered, interactive VR shows. \nWe've put together some awesome rewards for backers! There are more details below, or feel free to send us a question if you're curious about anything. \nIf you back at the $20 level or higher, you'll get your choice of an Oculus Home or Steam code that's good for the entire first season of The FOO Show. Steam users will also get access to the non-VR client. Before you ask, we have versions of FOO for Sony's Playstation VR (PSVR), GearVR, and Google's Project Daydream in the works, but they won't be ready until 2017.\nSo far, we've announced that Season 1 will feature Brendon Chung discussing his game, Quadrilateral Cowboy. We'll have more episodes to announce in coming weeks. \nWe've also put together some exclusive rewards for people who back us. These designs will only be available through this Kickstarter, so once it's done, they'll be gone. \nOur T-shirts are screenprinted in the San Francisco Bay Area and will be as close to the one Will wears in the first season of the show as we can make them. (If you want the low-poly look from the show, expect to spend lots of time with an iron and starch.) We're doing these as a print-to-order run, so it will be a while before we can ship them out, but that means you'll be able to order any size you'd like in men's or women's fits. Oh, and you can also  get any color you'd like, as long as it's black.\nWe've also commissioned an awesome collectible pin. It features Will's avatar and is made of die-cast metal with a highly-polished surface. The pin is of comparable quality to Pinny Arcade or Disney trading pins, and comes with a metal butterfly clasp. \nWe've already made prototypes of the pins to test colors and different metal finishes.\nFinally, for folks who love cutting and gluing small pieces of paper, we've harnessed the power of Pepakura to make a papercraft bust of Will's avatar that any backer at any level can print and assemble. Once finished, the digital Will will be yours forever, to keep a watchful eye over the other stuff on your swag shelf or use as an effigy. It's up to you! \nWe also have a very limited number of unique experiences. If you'd like a one-on-one tour of our virtual studio, Will would love to show you around (you'll need to provide your own Vive, PC, and Internet connection). If you'd rather have a custom rigged avatar in the unique FOO style, we'd love to make one for you. Once we're done, you'll get the 3D assets and will be free to use them however you'd like, including commercial projects (with approval from us). If you'd like, we'll also include your avatar in our regular studio audience. \nWill Smith is the CEO of FOO VR and the host of The FOO Show. You likely know him as one of the co-hosts of Tested.com, its YouTube channel, and podcasts, but Will has been covering technology for more than 15 years. He got his start writing about alternative operating systems and graphics cards at Ars Technica, before moving to Maximum PC, where he ended up as the editor-in-chief. After Will tried an early prototype Oculus Rift, he was hooked, and is convinced that VR/AR represents the next major platform for computing.\nAndre Infante is FOO's lead developer. He's been waiting for virtual reality since he read Snow Crash at age twelve. Originally recruited on the basis of a grainy Youtube video shared in a Reddit post, Andre is fascinated by the problem of reproducing authentic human interactions inside of virtual worlds. \nSindre Skaare is the lead artist at FOO. Originally from Norway, he moved to San Francisco to attend college and spent 3 years in the Bay Area games industry. He's worked for studios like Warner Brothers, nWay, and Massive Black. He also had a short gig with Campo Santo, which is how he met Will. Now he's moved back to Norway and is shacked up in a weird little hackerspace in Oslo where he tinkers with polygons and shaders.\n\"It\u2019s like hanging out inside a videogame with the people who created it.\" - Wired  \n\u201c...it creates a real sense of actually being there.\u201d - Famitsu  \n\"It\u2019s a bit crude and clumsy at times, but the potential of Smith\u2019s show is tremendous.\" - Kotaku  \n\"This is what modern talk shows should be.\" - deprecatedcoder\n\"Because of VR it feels like you are participating in the talkshow instead of just watching one.\" - Tabledevil  \n\"this is actually REALLY enagaging...

We currently have one recorded and another that's ready to shoot, but adapting each new game to work with FOO presents a unique set of challenges. That said, our schedule should include enough extra time to accommodate the unexpected and allow us to get the remaining four episodes shot, edited, and published.\n\nWe haven't booked every slot for the first season yet. Some publishers and developers are understandably anxious about giving us access to their intellectual property so we can integrate it in FOO. It's possible, but unlikely, that we'll run out of people who have made interesting games and are willing to give us access to their IP before we complete the first season. \n\nWe know that making merchandise is difficult, but we have well-established relationships with both the T-shirt and pin manufacturer. We haven't manufactured these types of items at FOO, we have previous experience designing, manufacturing, and distributing merchandise, and feel that the March 2017 deadline for delivery provides us plenty of time to work out any production kinks. \n\nWe are a small team of three people, so illness or injury of one of the core team members could delay production. While we're each extremely careful, we do spend lots of time in VR. If one of us is killed while in virtual reality, that team member's subsequent death in the real world would significantly impact our schedule.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Virtual Supporter", "descp": "Thanks for your support!

Which is why we not only focused on making a product that works, but one that looks good too. The Catalyst introduces elegant functionality and good design into the world of home brewing, so you have equipment worth showing off rather than being hidden in a closet.\n  Making beer at home consists of a few basic steps:\nWith the Catalyst, we\u2019ve simplified the steps that come after brewing so you can do all of them without having to siphon, transfer, or use any more tools until bottling day.\nNo more transfers means less chances of contamination and oxidation, less product waste, less space and equipment needed and less time and energy spent, giving you more time to enjoy good beer!\n  With the help of our Trub Trap, transferring your homebrew is now a thing of the past! Consisting of a 3\u201d butterfly valve, the Trub Trap is compatible with any wide mouth mason jar so you can remove kettle trub, pitch a yeast starter, catch fermentation trub, harvest yeast and bottle without disturbing or oxidizing your beer.\n  The Catalyst\u2019s tank is made from Tritan\u00ae, a medical-grade, BPA-free, polymer. This food-safe polymer is the highest quality material ever used in a fermenter, providing the clarity of glass with the durability and convenience of plastic. This material acts as an excellent barrier against oxygen, makes our tank 93% more scratch-resistant than other plastic fermenters and is even dishwasher safe, withstanding temperatures of up to 230\u00ba Fahrenheit. We\u2019ve also incorporated removable, 100% silicone gaskets to make sanitation and cleaning a breeze.\n                                    The Catalyst was thoughtfully designed to fit in tight spaces, especially fermentation chambers.\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have done all of the leg work of finding the best partners, manufacturers, completed tooling and tested the first production units.

We're a NY-based melodic rock band with some heavy/progressive leanings. We play acoustic guitar, electric guitar, loud fuzzy bass guitar, drums, and keys. We like effect-pedals. We like meaningful lyrics. We like to make layered, mosaic-like songs that catch your ear AND keep you guessing about where they're going to go next. And we have some sweet harmonies too.\nTake a listen right here: http://stvc101.bandcamp.com\nThose who know us know that this band started very humbly as a bedroom recording project, but over the last few years St. Van Cortlandt has grown into a full-fledged rock'n'roll band. We've been paying our dues in clubs around New York City and tightening our sound along the way. During that time we've recorded a new 4-song EP that highlights our development as songwriters and as a live band. We took great care coming up with compositions are intricate and unpredictable, and creating a sound that is lush but immediate. We couldn't be more proud of how it turned out.\nBut as some of you may also know, we've struggled with how best to introduce this new work to the world. Every record that a band releases is an opportunity to let everyone know what that band is all about. It's an opportunity to make a splash, leave a mark, and hopefully gain some new listeners. But that opportunity needs to be nurtured and supported or it can easily be lost in the din of all the other new releases that are happening at the same time. We want to make sure that our new record does as well as it can and after giving a lot of thought to how best to do that, we have decided to take the plunge...\nWe are about to release our latest effort, The Lion Tree, on June 10th of 2016. Although the record is already mixed and mastered, we still need to press copies of it and proclaim its arrival from the rooftops as loudly as we can.\nWe are asking the members of KickStarter to pledge $8,000 to our project so we can push The Lion Tree to reach its fullest potential. Here's how that money will be spent:\n$2,700 - a music video for our lead single, \"Like the Arrow, Miss the Stone.\"\n$1,300 - pressed copies of the record for promotion and for sale at shows. \n$1,000 - transportation, food, and lodgings for the band while we're on our East Coast tour.\n$2,000 - promotion, printed and digital advertising, new press kits, radio placement.\n$1,000 - a new band website, t-shirts, and other merch.\n Thank you for taking the time to check out our KickStarter campaign! Whatever way you can help whether by donating or sharing with your friends, we really appreciate it!

After we complete our KickStarter campaign we will have a rather short window to press the physical CDs, shoot and edit a music video, promoted the release, and create additional content. However we felt that giving ourselves a definite deadline was the best way to move forward.\n\nIdeally, we would like for all these things to come to fruition at the same time as the record release on June 10th, but given the limitations of time we may end up staggering the record release, the music video release, the website launch, etc. However, we are doing everything we can, even now before we have the funds, to make sure production is completed as quickly as possible on all fronts for the June 10th date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Things Are In the Works!", "update_content": "Thank you again to all of our backers!

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

We don't use a pledge manager\u2014backers may NOT increase their pledge or add on more items at the KS prices after the campaign ends. Future pre-orders and add-ons can be made on our website.\nDesigned by Jamey Stegmaier (Viticulture & Euphoria) and based on the art and worldbuilding of Jakub Rozalski, Scythe is a 4x game (explore, expand, exploit, exterminate) set in an alternate-history, 1920s Eastern Europe. Scythe tells the stories of 5 factions competing over an unclaimed patch of land surrounding the mysterious Factory.\nDuring Scythe's 750+ blind playtests, the playtesters consistently said they most enjoyed:\nthe dual benefits of the upgrade system (increase an action benefit and decrease a cost)\nthe distinctly different faction and mech abilities\nthe thematic choices presented by the encounter cards\nthe asymmetry and variability created by random pairings of faction and player mats\nthe twist to area control due to all resources being kept on the board\nCheck out the Scythe rules and playtest print-and-play files to see how Scythe blends an engine-building system inspired by Terra Mystica with a deterministic combat system influenced by Kemet. Renders of the 25 miniatures in Scythe are below the \"What's in the Box?\" image.\nTo add items onto your pledge, manually add the $ amount during the project. We don't use a pledge manager, so all pledges must be made in full by November 5. You can mix and match up to 3 total games (any version) and any number of add-ons. On the post-project survey, you will tell us the various items that comprise your pledge.\nEach player is represented on the board by a character and their animal companion (1 miniature). Each character miniature has a 25mm base and a height of 36-58mm.\nEach faction has 4 mechs in their faction color that can be deployed during the game. Each mech miniature has a 30mm base and a height of 26-36mm.\nThis is an example of a faction mat (the Rusviet faction). This shows your faction's special ability, starting military strength, mech abilities, and one-time recruit benefits.\n                                                                                                                                                        This is an example of a player mat (\"Patriotic\"). Each player mat is divided into four sections, each with a top-row action and a bottom-row action. Your actions improve as you build your economic engine.\nThe highly detailed game board for Scythe (full board on left, sample territory on right) depicts the areas near the mysterious Factory. This is a fully-formed world with a specific story, so the board is not modular (see FAQ for more details).\n                                             All promo items are included in every Kickstarter game for free and will be available for additional cost post-Kickstarter (there is no Kickstarter-exclusive content). All non-promo stretch goals are in every version of the game.\nFind all Scythe media on our website and join discussions about the game on BGG.\n\"Scythe is a game that\u2019s about contrasts.

We'll even pay for return shipping.\nThe Factory promo pack contains 6 extra Factory cards for Kickstarter backers. The promo pack will be available for an additional cost to those who discover Scythe after the Kickstarter campaign.\nIt may not be these exact Factory cards that end up in the promo pack.\nThe custom metal coins  (80 total) featured in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games were designed specifically for Scythe. The set of coins is available for order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $22.\nThe plastic resource containers (4 total) in the Premium, Collector's, and Art Connoisseur Edition games allow for easy storage, setup, and distribution of the various tokens and coins in Scythe. There's room for exactly 4 of these containers in the Scythe box.\nPlastic container with coin prototypes.\nThe board extension in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions slides next to the back side of the game board, creating a complete board with +50% bigger hexes (the content is the same; see Update 3). All units and resources in Scythe are kept on the board, so the larger hexes provide more space.\nThe game board is 624x818mm, and it grows to 818x936mm with the extension. It is available as an add-on to any copy of the game for $10 (every game board is double-sided) and will be available to order from our website by itself for $12 (+ shipping) after the project ends.\nThe realistic resource tokens (made out of resin or zinc) in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions replace the wooden resource tokens (there are no wooden resource tokens in those editions). They include 80 tokens (20 each) for food, metal, oil, and wood. These tokens are available in our treasure chests (one in each chest), as well as in an add-on to any copy of the game for $21.\nThe individually-numbered boxes in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions are randomly assigned. The limit of these boxes will be determined by the total number of backers at those levels.\nThe art book included with the Art Connoisseur Edition is a 100-page, full-color, hardback collection of the art featured in Scythe, as well as other pieces in Jakub Rozalski's acclaimed 1920s series. The book will measure approximately 250x290mm. It's available for pre-order by itself on the Stonemaier Games website for $25 (+ shipping) or as an add-on to any copy of the game for $23. The art book will be packed externally from the game box.\nThe wooden resource tokens aren't in the Collector's and Art Connoisseur Editions, so if you want both one of those games and wooden resources (or if you just want extra resources with any version of Scythe), please add $10 to your pledge. This is for an external pack of 20 food/grain, 20 metal, 20 wood, and 20 oil tokens.\nSamples on the left; final colors on the right.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total games per pledge (a mix of any 3 versions of the game is fine; only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add more games beyond the first (or add-ons), manually enter the $ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge.\nAn example of an encounter card. When your character reaches certain parts of the board, they encounter a situation that gives you a choice of one of the three options.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Jamey at stonemaiergames@gmail.com during the campaign for pricing information. After the campaign, you can reserve retail copies of Scythe by contacting our distribution broker: paul@greaterthangames.com\nAn example of an objective card. Each player receives 2 objectives at the beginning of the game and can complete one of them as a goal.\nJamey Stegmaier is the designer of Scythe, Viticulture, Tuscany, and Euphoria. He's also the co-founder and president of Stonemaier Games, and he's written a book about crowdfunding.\nJakub Rozalski is the artist, worldbuilder, and creative director of Scythe. Art prints of his work are available for purchase from him here.\nMorten Monrad Pedersen is Stonemaier's development specialist. He designed the Automa solo variant for Scythe as detailed on his BGG blog.\nCarsten Biernat & Jozsef Szollosi of Unique Voodoo Studio are the 3D modelers for Scythe's miniatures. \nChristine Santana is the lead graphic designer for Stonemaier Games.\nChris Matthew is the Panda Game Manufacturing project manager for Scythe.\nScott Wadyko is the the sculptor of the realistic resource tokens found in the collector's edition and in our new treasure chests.\nVideo: The project video was created by Josh McDowell,  narrated by A.T. Chandler, and features original Scythe music composed by Micha\u0142 Wo\u017aniak. The gif explaining the board extension was designed by Bryce Walter and reduced in size for faster loading times by Bruce Alcorn.\nPlaytesters: The development process for Scythe featured over 750 blind playtests and 628 individual playtesters. We owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of them, especially to Barry Schmaling (who built the playtester forum) and all of the lead playtesters. They had a lot to say about Scythe, but here are a few of our favorite quotes:\n\u201cFarm your little piece of the world, spread out and colonise as much as you can, or rampage with mechs projecting lethal force over your opponents. This game has it all and with so many routes to victory, no two games are the same.\u201d \u2014 Stephen \u2018Azrael\u2019 Ogden\n\u201cScythe is an excellent blend of resource management and conflict which also manages to leave you with a delightful sense of having told a story.\" \u2014 Andrew Busam\n\u201cThe Automa is challenging, relentless, and at times unforgiving, but it's also a whole lot of fun. It's a worthy adversary that earns a begrudging respect.\u201d \u2014 Jeremiah Power\nWhile we don't offer existing inventory or unrelated products as add-ons through Kickstarter, we offer other Stonemaier products on our website. These items will ship right away and cannot be held until Scythe ships.\nViticulture, Tuscany, Euphoria, Between Two Cities, and our treasure chests are also available from your friendly local game store.\nJamey's book, A Crowdfunder's Strategy Guide: Build a Better Business by Building Community, is available in a number of online and offline locations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough Stonemaier Games, Jamey Stegmaier has raised over $1.4 million on Kickstarter and has delivered over 20,000 individual rewards to backers within a few months of the estimated delivery date (most are on time or early). He is an avid backer and gamer, and his book about crowdfunding was published in September 2015: http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/book/\n\nHowever, Scythe presented three specific new challenges: miniatures, shipping, and balance.\n\nThis is our first time working with plastic miniatures. We had heard horror stories about other projects involving miniatures, and we've experienced a few as backers. So we wanted to start early to avoid some of the delays that can occur as the result of miniatures. We started working with Jakub and his 3D modelers in March, using Shapeways to print each version of the sculpts to see how they worked on the game board. We also worked closely with Panda's team throughout the process to make sure the sculpts are feasible and durable. We've created the molds for the miniatures and are ready for production.\n\nWe've picked up and dropped fulfillment partners over time, keeping those who pack our games well and excel at communication. Because shipping is particularly important for Scythe\u2014a big game with a box that we want delivered in pristine condition\u2014we tested out two new-to-us fulfillment partners (Funagain in the US and Snakes & Lattes in Canada) on our previous project in preparation for Scythe. We add those two to Ideaspatcher in Europe, Good Games in Australia, and Agility in China, all three of which we've worked on in the past and have had excellent results.\n\nOne of the main features of Scythe's gameplay is asymmetry between factions. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game, so after we got Scythe to a good place with local playtesters, we ran 3 different waves of multi-player blind playtesting and 2 waves of solo blind playtesting. The huge amount of anecdotal and quantitative data we collected as a result helped us ensure that Scythe is extremely well balanced (and fun!).\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to http://stonemaiergames.com/kickstarter/full-list-chronological/ to see 160+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the Scythe Modular Board", "update_content": "Hi!

To make this manageable, the game includes a simple yet effective save system that allows you to quickly interrupt the game at any time and have it ready for your next session, just like in a video game.\n\u201cAbsolutely phenomenal!

Coincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it very hard to manage even simple tasks. You must face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. Your body is wracked with convulsions as you contemplate what mysterious ailment is overtaking you.\nAt nightfall, you fall into a restless sleep without knowing that, for you, another adventure is about to begin.\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the characters available to you.

Every action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing at performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, therefore reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more achievements. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted every action could be your last!\nThankfully, you may add Idea cards to your hand when performing actions. Your Bonus, Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you.

And one of us happens to be pretty handy with a crayon too ;)\nSerious Poulp\nWe founded Serious Poulp in 2010 so we could persue our dreams of publishing the games we designed.\nWe started with Steam Torpedo, a tactical Submarine combat game for 2 players with quite a significant metagame potential and combo mechanic.\nNext up was 8 Masters' Revenge, a martial arts game for 1 to 4 players that revamps the standard combat game genre.\nNow, it's time for The 7th Continent, our third game, the one we've been working full-time on for the past 2 years.\nLudovic Roudy & Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends since childhood, we love all kinds of games!\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp which we founded in 2010 when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludo was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives whether they be from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent: Ludovic also creates all the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpSlayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the community manager for The 7th Continent.\nA passionate gamer and journalist and far too English for his own good. He currently works for the French-based board gaming site Tric Trac. He is an aficionado of any tabletop game featuring toy soldiers. You may have already heard of him from his work on the incredibly successful CONAN board game by Monolith.\nThe chat with Mr Jamie\nAs passionate gamers, we imagined a game that didn\u2019t exist, as far as we were aware, and that we would love to play.\nThis game is The 7th Continent: an exploration and adventure game offering many hours of solo or cooperative fun with friends.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t have started working on The 7th Continent without the prospect of launching it on Kickstarter.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE of the investment that this game implies. Be it in terms of time spent on its conception, design or illustrations. It can\u2019t be supported by a small company like Serious Poulp without a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nBECAUSE after 2 years of work on this project we cannot, unlike with our other games, continue without ensuring a certain degree of success through Kickstarter first.\nBECAUSE our goal is to not publish a standard run-of-the-mill board game. We want The 7th Continent to be an adventure of epic proportions with the largest game board ever created! We can do this with your support and all the stretch goals that we hope to unlock during the campaign.\nWe\u2019ve invested over 2 years of our lives and a significant part of our savings into this project, the first \"choose-your-own-path\" exploration board game. Now we need to know if all this work is going to bear fruit. If this campaign is not successful then The 7th Continent game will never see the light of day. Any possible commercial release will also depend on the level of the campaign\u2019s success.\nWe\u2019ve done all we can to make this dream come true, now the rest is up to you!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in October 2016.\nNo extra customs charges for EU, USA and Canada.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends, which will be managed through the Pledge Manager.\nHere is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (between 2 and 3 kg). Please acknowledge that these are just estimates and that we\u2019ll do our best to get you the best shipping deal possible.\nArea 1 - Mainland USA, Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal): Between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15\nArea 2 - Canada, Australia, Rest of EU countries: Between \u20ac15 and \u20ac23 [update]\nArea 3 - Russia, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, North Africa, Maghreb, New Zealand, Vietnam, India: Between \u20ac28 and \u20ac33\nArea 4 - Rest of the world: Between \u20ac33 and \u20ac38\nMORE PLEDGES ?\nIf you want more than one pledge (including All Applicable Stretch Goals), the shipping cost for each additional reward - from the 2nd and up to the 7th and last - will be divided by 2!\nGame mechanics : 99%\nGame conception (terrain, events, characters) : 85%\nNarration (flavor and event texts, descriptions, etc) : 50%\nArtwork* : 45%\nProof reading and translation : 5%\nIf the project is funded, we will start production in summer 2016.

We have been dedicated to The 7th Continent for over 2 years now. We will be concentrating on what we know and outsourcing other skills with industry professionals.\n\nZERO RISK DOESN\u2019T EXIST. BUT IT\u2019S STILL A LOT SIMPLER WITH CARDS.\n\nCards being the main component of The 7th Continent means that this project has a lower level of risk than others, particularly those with lots of miniatures.\n\nThat being said, outside of making sure that the game is properly prepared and choosing our partners wisely (printers, logistics, etc.), it is not impossible that we face delays from uncontrollable sources (curses, rafting accidents, attacks from giant bears, killer bees, etc). This may cause some delay in the delivery date but rest assured that, if this were to happen, we will keep you informed about the situation.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is asked more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded of them at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You must explore the harsh wilderness and engage in deep tactical combat, where the decisions you make have an impact not only on your own character, but also the world around you.\nGloomhaven is cooperative game of card-driven combat set in a persistent fantasy campaign which will change and grow as you play the game.\nThere is always more to unlock and explore in the world of Gloomhaven.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards from their hand of ability cards which determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can play the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up.\nPlayers gain the experience needed to level up by performing certain actions in their ability card deck. Through leveling up, players will also get access to more powerful, higher level ability cards which they can use to customize their deck.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase powerful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nOne way to unlock items is to increase the prosperity of the town, which players can do by completing scenarios and making decisions during events between scenarios. Players will also have to manage their reputation during these events, as reputation will influence the outcome of some events and also affect shop prices.\nAs players interact with the town and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing career goals. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like more information about any aspect of the game, you can find a wealth of information on the Gloomhaven website and also the BoardGameGeek page which features a number of illustrated lessons on how to play the game.\nIn addition, here is a PDF of a preliminary draft of the rules.\nIf you learn through action or just want to get a better feel for the game, there are a couple easy ways to sit down and play the game on your computer.\nThe introductory scenario of Gloomhaven is available through Tabletop Zen (free) and Tabletop Simulator (this requires the purchase of software).\nYou can get the Tabletop Simulator Steam Workshop mod here. From there you can play around with it on your own, or sign up to be taught the game through this Google Doc. When you become familiar with the game, you can also sign up for pick-up games, or even be a teacher yourself.\nTabletop Zen now has an open lobby where you can go play around with the game on your own, or you can sign up for pick-up games or teaching games through the Google Doc. All that's required is a valid email address to sign up.\nKeep in mind that the game is not automated. Players will have to move the pieces around according to the rules, and communication between players is highly advised. Tabletop Simulator has accompanying voice software, but Google Hangouts is needed to play on Tabletop Zen.\nFor those interested, a PDF Print-and-Play of the first scenario is also available, along with the accompanying pages from the scenario book.\nThe scenario available online is just the beginning, though. A scratch on the surface of the world.\nGloomhaven is deep and expansive. It is a game of exploration and discovery; of branching story paths and decisions with real consequences. You always have a choice of which scenario to undertake next and which plot thread to unravel.\nMore than that, though, there is plenty of content to support multiple game groups. If you want to play the game with someone new, you shouldn't reset the game, but instead just pursue a different story line. Each party of adventurers will develop their own campaign, but everyone will interact with and expand upon the same world.\nGloomhaven provides a persistent world of permanent choices without the restriction of only being able to play with the same people time and again. It does this by focusing on the stories of individual characters instead of an over-arching linear plot.\nAnd a few comments from play testers:\nNew classes will become available to play when players meet certain conditions in the game. If you want spoil yourself on the surprise, or you just really want to check out more amazing artwork, click here to see what else you'll be getting, or if you want to get a detailed look at the miniatures, you can check out all the original sculpts by clicking here (also full of spoilers).\n(Note that all depictions of miniatures are digitally modified pictures of the original physical sculpts.)\nI love Kickstarter. This platform brings together creators and their audiences in such a wonderful way. I absolutely would not be able to get this game made without your financial support, but what really makes Kickstarter exciting to me is the opportunity to involve the community in the creation of the project.\nThis project doesn't just give you a great game that will show up on your doorstep in May. It gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. There is also a scenario design competition to allow the backer community to make a significant mark on the creation of the game.\nMy amazing play testers have helped me get this far, but now with your help, we can not only get the game made, but also continue working to make it as great as possible.\nAlso remember that if you purchase the game through Kickstarter, you'll get the game before it comes out in retail and it's a significant discount off the MSRP (estimated at $100-120), especially after considering the added cost for shipping.\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.\nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nPledging at the MINIATURES level will get you all of the minis for the included 13 character classes (12 base plus 1 stretch goal). Any additional stretch goals that unlock extra classes beyond that will also unlock extra minis for you. If you'd like a better idea of all the minis you're getting, head on over to the spoilers page.\nPledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH STANDEES level will get you everything that you would get at the $79 level, except that you will get cardboard standees of the character classes instead of the plastic minis. You will also receive all unlocked stretch goals, with the exception of additional minis (receiving standees of additional unlocked character classes instead).\nOr you can get the whole package - all the content, all the stretch goals all the minis. Pledging at the GLOOMHAVEN WITH MINIS level gets you this.\nNote that this level does not come with standees for the character classes. If you really want both standees and minis (this is redundant and in no way adds content to the game), you can pledge at the $64 level and do a $20 add-on. That will get you absolutely everything.\n$15 for shipping is included in the base game price. All additional shipping fees are added automatically when you pledge.\nThe game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAll three main rewards levels are also available as add-ons. You can add $20 to your pledge to get an additional box of minis. You can add $64 to get a copy of Gloomhaven without the minis. And you can add $79 to get a copy of Gloomhaven with minis.\nUp to 4 $64 and $79 add-ons can be added to your order this way, PLUS you can add up to 5 $20 add-ons as well. You will not have to pay any additional shipping fees on your order.\nIn the proud tradition of slaying helpless rats, I have decided that to reward backers of the Gloomhaven project, I will graduate to a slightly more formidable - but equally prolific - foe: the animated skeleton.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar or more to the campaign, I will foray into a host of fantasy-themed games and slay a necromantic abomination in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, last April.

I know problems with miniatures plague a lot of projects, but James is very nearly done with the sculpting and he is a seasoned veteran in the field, so I don't expect there will be any significant manufacturer issues with the miniatures. We've already made masters of 4 of the sculpts without problem.\n\nI would say the biggest challenge at this point is going to be finishing the content for the game - both creating it and making sure everything is balanced appropriately. A lot of it has been done, but there is still more to do.

Each player competes to be the first to successfully guide his animal through the dream world.\nEasy to learn, but challenging to master! Includes simplified rules for younger children and tougher challenges for experienced players.\nYou start with a grid of 25 tiles, set up at random in a 5x5 dreamscape. You also start with one extra tile, with a picture of your animal on it. On the opposite side of each of your tiles is a picture of your animal. Each turn, a random card is drawn, telling players which tile they should flip. When you flip a tile, it means your animal is travelling through a part of the dreamscape. Your goal is to guide your animal through the dreamscape by putting him in specified spaces (which are different each time you play).  Each time after a card is drawn, you take your extra animal and slide him into the dreamscape, shifting one row or column of tiles until a new, different tile emerges from the opposite side.  You'll use this tile to shift another column or row on your next turn.  Play continues until one player's dreamscape tiles matches the goal.  The player then shouts his or her animal's name-- \"Dingo!\", for example, to win the round.\nTake a look at the rulebook.\nAlf is an internationally published designer of Euro-style strategy games.

My first full game of Hocus was played with my immediate family... parents, sister, biker guy... and it was a HUGE hit. I would have never suggested we play poker, but Hocus is so new and refreshing, no one wanted to stop playing.\" - Chevee Dodd, designer of Scallywags, Pull!, and tester for Hocus\nHocus is a card game for 2-5 players that plays in 30 minutes. The origin of the idea was: \"what would poker be like with spells?\" Hocus is about using your unique spells, carefully managing the cards in your hands, and scoring big when your opponents aren't watching.\nHocus is deeply interactive, as you must observe and react to the play of opponents, judge the pace of the round, and make the most of your limited turns. The game is extensively tested and has been in constant development for 18 months. It has simple mechanisms, but requires thoughtful strategy. It is a highly replayable mix of skillful play and luck.\n\"You may be skeptical of a game that\u2019s based around making poker hands, but Hocus is a great new take.\" - Matthew Gravelyn\nWhat's in the Box!?\nGet a copy of Hocus for $15 plus the cost of shipping. Shipping is free for backers in the US and subsidized for other destinations.\nPrototype cards\nThe game's components include:\n101 high-quality, linen-finish cards \n1 Rule Sheet \n1 two-piece box\nThere are 60 beautifully illustrated playing cards, 24 unique and colorful Spell cards, 5 Reference cards, 2 Jokers, and 10 Score Tracking cards, all with a high quality linen finish. \nThe Score Cards\nIn addition to all of these, to thank backers for making Hocus so successful, we're also including a wooden first player token with every copy of the game purchased. \nWooden first player token\nHow to Play the Game\n\"Played Hocus over lunch. Thinkier than I would have thought. Very cool.\" - Jonathan Schindler\nThe video above features Grant explaining how to play the Classic version of Hocus. This is the simplest place to start. The video below features Josh explaining the full version of Hocus, including Advanced Spells and Owls.\n\u201cIt has kinda a pokery beginning, but you can tell it has wandered very far away from Texas Hold \u2018Em as an overall idea.\u201d - Jonathan Cox of JonGetsGames\nThe game is played in rounds until at least one player earns enough points. At the start of each round, every player is dealt a number of cards. Each card has a Suit, a Strength, and a Point value.\nThe Owl Wizard cards also have special abilities. \nPrototype cards\nOn your turn, you choose a single spell to use. Every player has three common Basic Spells. \nThe first lets you play cards to the Community. All players share the cards in the Community. \nFor the second, you play cards to the Community's Pot. The total Point value of the cards in the Pot are the prize for winning the Community. \nFinally, players can build a personal Pocket of up to 2 cards. The player who can form the best poker hand by combining the Community with their Pocket wins all points in the Pot.\nThere's a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can have multiple Pockets. What emerges is a unique experience where having the best hand isn't enough. The best players are those who see opportunities with their hand of cards, build a set that's just good enough to win, and stuff the Pot full of Points. \nA sampling of Spells\nThere are also 8 Spell Books, each with 3 unique Spells that provide a different way to play and gain the upper hand over your opponents. With all of this, you have a rich and fascinating game that fits in your backpack and is perfect for a picnic, a lunch game, or as the opener to game night.\nRules and Print and Play\nWe want you to try the game for yourself!

Each set is unique and offers a different approach to gameplay. You have to balance pulling off your own combos while keeping an eye on your opponents. The theme, artwork and spells turn a familiar game into a great game.\" - Brian Suhre, tester and designer of Paradox\n\"My wife is very selective in her gaming and not what I would call a \"gamer\" in any sense of the word. But here we have a card game that most people will understand the fundamentals of right off the bat with the use of poker. The community building and spells add enough complexity to scratch my gaming itch while still being accessible for her. And the community building gives us a nice mechanic for competition and tension. All together, these make this game a great choice for any gaming couple, especially where the tastes vary widely.\" - Matthew Tate, tester and devilish Carcassonne player\n\"A really fun game that was easy to carry, teach to folks quickly & went over well with a wide range of ages (8-55). I loved the theme. It was fun & added some great twists to a classic game!\" - Dave Gordon, tester\nWe have written extensively about the development of Hocus (previously Hocus Poker).

It's been at multiple UnPubs/Protospiel events, BGG Con, and more.\nWe're positive this is a great game and a wonderful value for our backers. Here is why you should back now instead of waiting.\nGrant and Josh testing\nDiscount: We're giving Kickstarter backers a discount off MSRP. We know you're taking a risk with us. Therefore, we want to give you a great deal.\nMoney Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Hocus within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it and receive a full pledge refund, which includes shipping. Try the game at least twice to learn it and see the fun. If it's not for you, send it back.\nGet it First: Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of Hocus before others. \nYou're helping us get our start. We need to know if Hocus is viable. Furthermore, in order to prove ourselves and get into distribution and onto retail shelves, we need to demonstrate there is demand. You can be instrumental in that. \nWhat Things Cost\nPublishing a card game, even one as simple as Hocus, is expensive. Below is a chart that breaks down our costs, approximately, against the notion of just hitting our funding level.  \nGaining additional backers and selling additional copies helps us further offset our fixed costs, like manufacturing and art, and greatly increases our chances of getting into distribution. That is where we hope to earn additional revenue to make this entire project viable in the long run.\nAbout the Team\nJoshua Buergel is a 20 year veteran of software development based in Seattle, Washington.

By skipping Stretch Goals, we can stabilize our costs, better manage delays, and maintain focus on making our initial offering the best offering. The cards have a high quality linen finish, we support 5 players, there are 8 different Spell Books, and a rule sheet. We could have made them Stretch Goals, but we decided to make them the default offering.\n\nShipping: To ensure the game arrives safely from China, we're sparing no expense to utilize the simplest method of shipping. Fewer hand offs means fewer opportunities for mistakes.\n\nFinally, we will act transparently and thoughtfully. If we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it as quickly as possible.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo. Brian was directly involved in the creation of all three The Bard\u2019s Tale games in the 80s, the first game launching his long and storied career at Interplay and inXile through the 90s to now.\ninXile has embraced the crowdfunding model fully, delivering the fan favorite Wasteland 2 (over 70,000 backers raising over $3 million), and following it up with Torment: Tides of Numenera (over 90,000 backers raising almost $4.9 million and still going). We doubled Wasteland 2\u2019s crowdfunded budget with our own funds, and continue to support it with the upcoming Game of the Year Edition, which will be released as a feature rich and extensive free upgrade to all PC backers and buyers.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is spearheaded by the same team that delivered the award-winning Wasteland 2.\nAs always, inXile Entertainment is proud to be a part of Kicking It Forward, pledging to spend 5% of our eventual profits back into crowdfunding projects.\nIf you\u2019ve already pledged at any tier $20+, you can include add-ons with your pledge. To add an add-on, go to \"Manage\" at the top of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the same amount your add-on(s) cost.

The studio is in its 12th year of existence now, and has a proven track record for Kickstarter-produced games, having released Wasteland 2 to fan and critical acclaim and with a second project in production in Torment: Tides of Numenera.\n\nThe main challenge is indicating a fully accurate delivery date, which is not possible to do before we know how much funding we have. As funding increases, it allows us to increase the scope and depth of the product, but this will inevitably impact the release date. Our initial estimate is based on a $2.5 million budget game and we will openly communicate on changes to the release date as our project progresses.\n\ninXile has established revenue streams from its back catalog, including Wasteland 2, The Bard\u2019s Tale, as well as the upcoming Wasteland 2 Game of the Year Edition. This revenue is invested directly back into the games we\u2019re working on \u2013 we will be investing at least a matching $1.25 million should Bard's Tale IV fund.

They don't care about anyone but themselves except when it is time to feed with the blood of the living, or to have fun torturing their favorite victim.\nTheir leader is Count Dracula, who was already a Vampire on earth. He and the ones he chooses are immortal, that is to say they do not rejuvenate like others. Living in Necropolis, Vampires need black opium to forget their evil actions on earth, without it they would go mad and lose control.\nRequiem, the character at the heart of the comic is about, is a Vampire. Otto von Todt is one of his familiars (\"friend\" has no meaning on Resurrection). \nRequiem's allegiance is not really clear since his previous incarnation is Thurim, who once betrayed Dracula. Even worse, he is still in love with Rebecca - a Lemure; a deadly sin on Resurection.\nClick on the picture to see some notable Vampires\nGhouls are selfish, if you are among them, you better watch your back.\nThey also feel that their karma is not fair since they were good on earth. Or at least they think so. In fact they did terrible things, pretending it was for a greater good. The difference is minimal, isn't it?\nThe Guild is an amalgam of various pirate gangs whose purpose is to get rich or richer. They have a Code: but you know what they say about the Code... it's a guideline, rather than a strict set of rules...\nMitra (reincarnation of John Edgar Hoover) sits on the throne and has been ruling the guild for a long time now. She can read your thoughts, so you better be careful.  \nVenus is one of the ship Captains. She was once the ruler of the eponym planet, where women killed billions of men, since cloning could already help them procreate...\nClick on the picture to see some of the most important Ghouls\nThis is a very restricted club.\nTo get involved you must be a demonologist, worshipper of the limbos god Aiwass and most of all, you must have unlimited hatred for Dracula.  \nTheir grand Priest, Black Sabbat von Dracula (previously Aleister Crowley) is the head chief of the Metropolis Police. He carefully moves his pawns and tries to always have several weapons ready against his opponents.  \nHe even bets on the return of Thurim, whose power is only comparable to Dracula's strength. Thurim is trapped in the tortured mind of Requiem.\nClick on the picture to see some characters of this faction\nHere are the good people!\nIn fact in this world of violence and evil, Lemures are not at the right place. Victims on earth, they are bound to their torturer and unless they can kill him or her on Resurrection, they will always live the same cycle. This is a bad karma.\nRebecca, the lover of Requiem, was the victim of Otto... and wants to leave Resurrection... but she still loves Requiem... but she wants to leave... but ...\nIt would be difficult for Lemures if they did not have the Werewolves on their side. In fact Werewolves do not even have a word to say since they are actually remote-controlled. To become a werewolf you must have been an illuminated religious, doing evil things in the name of God, like Torquemada.\nClick on the picture to see some characters of this faction\nMad Scientists... all of them !  \nIf these guys had the choice - finding a cure for every disease in the world or creating a new weapon more powerful than any other \u2013 they would choose the second option, which is certainly more stimulating!\nThey live in surviving-tanks that prevent them from rejuvenating.  \nThe Archi-Hierophante is the first of them. He can count on his Brain Library where he stores the brightest minds of all times... just in case he would need a new ultimate weapon, you know...\nClick on the picture to see some characters of this faction\nDragons are greedy. On Resurrection... dragons are greedier! \nThey hand over the Papal-holy-water-Acqueduct and so control the entire production of deadly weapons against vampires.\nBut their credo is \u201cToo much is not enough\u201d. So they could sell anything as long as you give gold in return.\nRuhtra is the ruler of Lonava, their big city. He is the Greatest Dragon who ever lived. But he keeps sleeping so that his mind can control Great-britain politics and become richer.  \nUntil something needs him to wake up, Perfidia, his queen, stands on the throne of Distopia.\nClick on the picture to see some characters of this faction\n\"I have just checked the campaign and was very intrigued by the nice background introduction video, the amazing artwork and the interesting game mechanisms.\"  - Wargameterrain\n\"Evil characters, revisited 2nd World War, parallel world, vampires, fights... and a love story.

Poorly-prepared and unrealistic, it didn\u2019t allow us to raise the funds required. We also canceled one just a few days ago, we had a good start but we did several mistakes we fixed too late. Relaunching was necessary to make the best campaign we could!\nWe\u2019re back with a more complete and comprehensive project.\nAll of our pledges include shipping costs to the United States, Canada and European Union. Art Lover pledges even include worldwide shipping!\nUS and CAN games are shipped from the US, and EU games are shipped from within the EU.\nThis should prevent the troubles people may have with foreign shipping and deliver the game to everyone at about the same time!\nFor other destinations or if you purchase add-ons, you may have to add some shipping costs to your pledge, depending on destination, that will be displayed when using the pledge manager once the campaign has ended.\nThe game is already balanced for the Base Pack and four Faction Expansions. \nSo all we have left to do is \u201ctweaking\u201d expansion and special expansion contents. This should take us a few months. During that time, we\u2019ll of course get the artwork and 3D models done for each missing character.\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2016.

These are:\nBook One: Tales from The Loop\nBook Two: Swedish Machines, Lonely Places\nThe first Tales from The Loop book was released on the Swedish Book Fair in September 2014 and was an instant success. The book contained the full first set of paintings from The Loop, the enormous particle accelerator hidden beneath the pastoral Swedish countryside, as well as a score of short stories chronicling life in the shadow of the machines. For the first time the deep and layered setting behind Simon's paintings were available to the public. And soon, thanks to your help, this book will be available to the international English speaking audience.\nBut with this Kickstarter we are seeking funds for publishing not only one, but two beautifully crafted art books schock full with Simon St\u00e5lenhag's paintings and stories.

The central location is the countryside of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna, a string of islands and half islands just west of Stockholm. The background is this:\nIn the 1950s, the Swedish government orders the construction of a large particle accelerator. The state agency RIKSENERGI is tasked with developing this massive project. In 1969 the The Facility For Research In High Energy Physics is ready, located deep below the pastoral M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna-countryside. The local population soon calls it THE LOOP.\nFrom it's inception to it's closure in 1994, The Loop was the largest accelerator in the world. The thousands of staff: scientists, engineers and maintenance workers, all serve Riksenergi during these years \u2013 and makes possible tremendous scientific advances. But the power of the Gravitron, the heart of the accelerator, proves difficult to control. The side effects of the project are dramatic. Strange sightings and bizarre rumours taints the scientific image of The Loop.\nIn the shadow of the weird machines filling the countryside, life continues as normal. The kids of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna grew up living above the technological marvel of The Loop, but for them it was just a part of their very ordinary lives. Until strange beasts from another time showed up, that is.\nThe Gauss freighters \u2013 painting from Book One.\nInvasive species \u2013 painting from Book One.\nThe Fire Guards \u2013 painting from Book One.\nThe Vagabond \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nMissing person, Karasuendo \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nHacking The Loop \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nYou can see a lot more of Simon's paintings at his Tumbr or website. Go have a look!\nSimon St\u00e5lenhag \u2013 Photo: Mariette Svensson\nSwedish artist Simon St\u00e5lenhag burst onto the art scene in 2013 when his first series of paintings were shared on the Internet. His original blend of naturalistic landscape paintings with science fiction elements and a very low key recollection of growing up in the eighties struck a chord. Not just in Sweden, but all over the world. The Verge, Wired, IO9, Scientific American and The Guardian have all praised his work. But until late 2014, the only place you could watch his art was in digital form on the Internet.\nBased in Stockholm, Sweden, Simon uploaded his first digital paintings onto the Internet in 2013, since then he has become something of a phenomena in the art and sci-fi communities. Simon shares his time between a small cabin at M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna (the setting that inspires his work) and an apartment in Stockholm.\nInterviews and other stuff:\nImagining a dystopian Sweden full of robots and dinosaurs\n \u2013 Wired\nChildhood of Tomorrow\n \u2013 Scientific American\nLa Maison WERTN\nDecember 1994 \u2013 painting from Book Two.\nThere is more than just the books!

The books will be printed at an art house printer in Europe and then shipped to our distribution centers in the US and UK.\nThe money will also be used for translation (of the second book), proofing, layout, editorial work.

Since 2011 we have produced a range of pen and paper RPG's (of which Mutant: Year Zero has been published to an international audience), and have won several awards in the process including RPG of the Year for three consecutive years. In late 2014 we published acclaimed artist Simon St\u00e5lenhags book Ur varselklotet to rave reviews in Sweden.

Cabinet will provide know-how and expertise for the international market.\nFAQ\nWhat about shipping? \nShipping will be charged through Backerkit. Please be advised that if you order both books, we will charge you for shipping twice as the later book will be shipped in 2016. Shipping is always tricky as rates differ and change over time but we estimate that it will cost 10 USD within the US and the UK, and 15 USD to the rest of the world.\nBut will not shipping be super expensive as you are located in Sweden?\nNo! We are working with Shipwire for this Kickstarter and will have fulfilment centers in the US and UK. That means that we offer domestic shipping rates within these countries, and shipping to other countries will be from the closest fulfilment center.\nHey! I just bought the Swedish version and paid a lot for shipping across the world... \nWe hear you. Let us know and we will pay for shipping of book one, regardless of which edition you choose.\nWhat is the format of the books? \nThe books will have a 280 x 250 mm landscape format.\nWhat is the page count?\n128 pages for Book One. It is too early to say what the exact page count will be for Book Two but it will be in the same ball park.\nWhat kind of quality can I expect the books to have? \nBoth books will be printed at our printer of choice who are specialized in premium grade art books. This is the same printer that most major publishing houses in Sweden use for top quality art books. Both editions of the books will have hardcovers, clothed spines and be printed on sturdy 170 g semi-matte, fully coated Arctic Volume White paper.\nWill the books be available in book stores?\nWe will most likely team up with an international distributor so that the books will find their way to retail stores in US and UK. However, that is beyond the scope of this Kickstarter. The Limited edition will not be sold through retail stores.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen it comes to any Kickstarter project shipping and logistics is a challenge.

Just bring a screwdriver and a good attitude. \nFor renters, this solution provides convenient wall charging that can be taken with you when you move.  If you move out, just pop the old cover back on.\nMake any standard outlet in your home USB compatible...in seconds\n* Not compatible with GFCI outlets\n Installation is drop-dead simple. For real. Seriously.\n Wiring is a buzzkill. The SnapPower Charger installs in literally seconds, and requires no wiring whatsoever. Here\u2019s the play-by-play:\nSimplicity makes all the difference\nPLAY\n\nTake back your outlets!\nEven when charging your devices, both outlets remain open and available for other uses at all times.\nDesign\nWith custom-built components engineered to fit entirely inside the cover plate, it's the sleekest, most low profile charger around.\nIts slim design allows furniture to be positioned snug against the wall. The side access to the charging port enables you to plug your USB cables in with no hassle.\nNo more searching for lost adapters\nUnlike plug-in adapters that get shuffled around from room to room (and eventually lost), the SnapPower Charger is securely screwed to the outlet and always there when you need it.\n Charges any device from any manufacturer\nBlends in with any home decor\nHow it works (or, the science behind the magic)\nWhat type of outlets can be used with the SnapPower Charger?\nThe SnapPower Charger comes in a variety of styles and colors. The Chargers are compatible with standard duplex and decor outlets that have exposed screw terminals, regardless of the manufacturer or year. The SnapPower charger is not compatible with Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) outlets that are sometimes found in bathrooms. GFCI outlets do not have the required screw terminals and can be identified by the \u201ctest\u201d and \u201creset\u201d buttons located on the face of the outlet.\nCompatible Outlets:\nIf you\u2019re picking up what we\u2019re putting down, help us by sharing SnapPower with your friends and family!\nFor the Press\nIf you're looking for hi-res pictures, you've come to the right spot!

The USB port is designed to be installed on the same side as the ground prongs on the outlet. For example: If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing down, the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port beneath the outlet.  If the ground prongs on the outlet are facing up, then the Charger will need to be installed with the USB port above the outlet (pictured below).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nForecast Risk\nWe've spent a lot of time engineering a product that meets the highest standards of performance, durability and convenience.

It's not too late to secure your copies of our books from bossfightbooks.com, to order existing books from our site and the Kindle store, to review the books on Goodreads, and to follow/like us on Twitter and Facebook.\nWe can't wait to deliver these books to you over the next year, and to look ahead even further into the future.\nSincerely,\nGabe Durham\nEditor, Boss Fight Books\nBuzz\nCheck out new Boss Fight coverage at Joystiq, Eurogamer, Rock Paper Shotgun, indie(Function), Retrospekt, BITPULSE, Cliqist, Cartridge Lit, This Is Infamous, Entropy, AnaitGames, and 4 Color Rebellion. Also, we've got new posts on Tumblr from Matt Bell, Gabe Durham, and Derek Yu, and new interviews with Ken Baumann, Ashly & Anthony Burch, Gabe Durham, and Matt Bell. We are proud to be both a Kickstarter Staff Pick and a Kickstarter Featured Publishing Project of the Day.\nThe Story\nLast year, Gabe Durham had the idea for a series of critical, creative, historical, and personal books about classic video games. When he pitched his idea for \"the 33\u2153 of video games\" to the world, the world went, \"YEAH DUDE, GO FOR IT!\" and Boss Fight Books was born.\nA year later, we've released six titles and sold more than 15,000 books worldwide.\nNow we've got some new ideas.\nA book about Spelunky by the designer himself.\nA book about BioWare's D&D epic Baldur's Gate II.\nA book about the most infamous unlicensed game of the NES era, Bible Adventures.\nA book about Metal Gear Solid from the brother/sister duo behind Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'?\nA book about World of Warcraft featuring new interviews from WoW developers.\nAnd a new book about... any game you choose.\nThe Books\nEach book will be numbered, collectible, and will look great on your shelf together thanks to our returning series designer Ken Baumann. All the books will be available in\nPaperback: 5x7-inch, matte finish, 130-200 pages\neBook: DRM-free in EPUB, MOBI, and PDF formats\nand will be sold both directly from bossfightbooks.com and from the Kindle store.\nMetal Gear Solid by Ashly and Anthony Burch\nBefore they co-created the hit web series Hey Ash, Whatcha Playin'?, before Anthony was lead writer of Borderlands 2, before Ashly lent her voice to Saints Row IV, Towerfall, and Adventure Time\u2014Ashly and Anthony Burch were just a brother and sister who shared a weird obsession with Solid Snake and his 3D debut, Metal Gear Solid (1998).\nAnd why wouldn't they? Hideo Kojima's attempt at creating the Playstation's greatest game featured groundbreaking stealth mechanics, a gruff and hunky leading man, a brilliantly claustrophobic setting, tons of cinematic cutscenes, shocking fourth wall breaks, and terrifying bosses. Several console generations later, Metal Gear Solid is still often touted as the series high water mark.\nThe only problem: Ashly and Anthony grew up but their all-time favorite video game didn't. After nearly two decades, Metal Gear Solid's once-innovative stealth mechanics seem outdated, the cutscenes have lost some of their action movie punch, and the game's treatment of women is often out of touch. Witness a celebration/takedown of this landmark game with the combination of insight and hilarity that Ashly and Anthony have made their careers on.\nAshly Burch is a voice actor and writer, and she speaks about representation and issues of gender and identity in the games industry. Anthony Burch is a former blogger and current writer at Gearbox Software. He was lead writer of Borderlands 2.\nBaldur's Gate II by Matt Bell\nBehold, Boss Fight's nerdiest gambit yet: a book about a computer game based in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. And what a game it is. Upon its release in 2000, BioWare's PC role-playing epic Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn was hailed as a paragon of its genre and named \"RPG of the Year\" by IGN, Gamespy, and Gamespot.\nA game like Baldur's Gate II requires not just a master wordsmith but a dungeon master. Enter award-winning novelist Matt Bell, author of the surreal domestic novel In the House upon the Dirt between the Lake and the Woods and co-author (with Matthew Simmons) of the Dungeons & Dragons novel The Last Garrison.\nBell's book takes a close look at BGII's immersive story and brilliant mechanics, how the Baldur's Gate series anticipates future BioWare releases, how play in the D&D universe inspires creativity, and how BGII helped pull Bell out of the darkest season of his life. Dig in, geek out, and go for the eyes, Boo!\nMatt Bell is the author of the novel In the House upon the Dirt between the Lake and the Woods, as well as two previous books, How They Were Found and Cataclysm Baby. His next novel, Scrapper, will be published in Fall 2015.\nBible Adventures by Gabe Durham\nFrom Boss Fight Books series editor Gabe Durham comes the story of a small, unlicensed game development company called Color Dreams who struggled to turn a profit until they were hit with divine inspiration: They could make a lot more money creating games for Christians.\nThe company changed its name to Wisdom Tree and got to work on what would become its first and biggest hit, a 3-in-1 platformer starring Noah, David, and Moses's mother, called Bible Adventures.\nBased on extensive research and original interviews with Wisdom Tree staff, Durham's book investigates the company's rise and fall, the Christian retail industry, growing up in the 90s among spiritual warriors, our retro obsession with \"bad games,\" and why we're finally ready for a fully playable Jesus.\n\nGabe Durham is the founder, editor, and publisher of Boss Fight Books. His novel FUN CAMP was one of BuzzFeed's 17 Books We Loved in 2013. He lives in Los Angeles, CA.\n Spelunky by Derek Yu\nWhen Derek Yu released Spelunky for free on the PC in 2008, he had no idea that his roguelike-inspired platformer would catch on so quickly. The game's combination of throwback mechanics, extreme difficulty, and random level generation made it a paragon of what an indie game could be.\nA year later, Yu assembled a team to remake Spelunky as something bigger, richer, and more beautiful. It went on to become PC Gamer's Game of the Year, GameSpot's Platformer of the Year and XBLA Game of the Year, Destructoid's Best Console Exclusive of 2012, and earned both an IGF Excellence in Design award and a rare perfect score of 10/10 at Polygon.\nBut how is a \"perfect\" game made? This time, Boss Fight is going straight to the source. Spelunky the book is our first autobiographical game development history: the story of a game's creation as told by its creator. Spelunky is a game design manifesto in which Derek Yu uses his own game to discuss wide-ranging topics such as randomization, creative process, team dynamics, the philosophy of challenging games, and player feedback. Grab some ropes, a mattock, and your favorite pug\u2014this book is going to dig deep.\n\nNote: Check out the new Spelunky Minis tier! 14 tiny figurines of your favorite characters: Spelunker, Damsel, Shopkeeper, Tunnel Man, Caveman, Jiang Shi, Yeti, Mantrap, Frogs, Idol, Old Bitey, Alien, Lord Yeti, and King Anubis. (Photo here, courtesy of Fangamer.)\n\nDerek Yu is an artist and game developer. In addition to creating Spelunky, he co-created the underwater adventure game Aquaria. He's also editor-in-chief of The Independent Gaming Source, a long-running indie game development community and news site.\n\n World of Warcraft by Daniel Lisi\nAt more than 100 million user accounts created and over $10 billion made, it is not only the most-subscribed MMORPG in the world, but the highest-grossing video game of all time. Ten years after its launch, Blizzard's World of Warcraft is less a game and more a world unto itself, and it's a world Daniel Lisi knows well. His high school years were spent more in Azeroth than in his hometown of Irvine, CA\u2014a home he happened to share with Blizzard itself.\nNow that Lisi has founded the Los Angeles-based game development studio Game Over, WoW remains one of Lisi's greatest inspirations for what a game can be. Based in part on original interviews with WoW developers, Lisi's book will examine how WoW came to exist, how the game has shaped culture since its release, and what our increasingly online social lives will become.\nIn addition to founding Game Over, Daniel Lisi is the production editor at the world literature press, Unnamed Press. He has previously worked with Write Bloody Publishing, PEN Center USA, and has created literary events for the Associations of Writers & Writing Programs and USC.\nFan-Selected 12th Book by ???\nIf you could read a book about any game, what would it be?

You're tasked with defending your division of the NorTec base as wave after wave of horrific aliens attempt to destroy the base and end NorTec's strip mining operation.\nXenoShyft Onslaugt is a base defense deck-building game for 1 to 4 players. Using a wide array of troops, weapons, armors, and technology cards, players must last 9 rounds as the alien hordes bombard the NorTec base in increasingly difficult waves. \nXenoShyft Onsluaght has many deck-building elements, but plays more like a table top version of the base-defense game genre made popular on mobile devices.\nGameplay Features\n1 - 4 players - Single player compatible, fully cooperative gameplay.\nStrong focus on coordination and strategic planning - to overcome the game's intense difficulty players will need to work together.\n60 Minute game length\nBase-Defense with deck-building elements\nIncredible art - Illustrated by three amazing artists, XenoShyft features beautiful and consistent art.

Do take note that, being an Alpha, images, rules, (and typos!) are subject to change.\nAlready well-known and respected for our ability to bring big box games to the market that feature dozens upon dozens of highly detailed miniatures, XenoShyft Onslaught represents a new direction for CoolMiniOrNot. \nWith XenoShyft CoolMiniOrNot wanted to create a deck-building style game that task players with working together rather than defeating one another. This goal lead to the development of an outstandingly brutal card-based game that played more like a tower defense game then your standard deck builder. Furthermore this focus made the game not only a great cooperative experience, but also allows Xenoshyft Onslaught  to function as a single player game. \nOne of the most appealing aspects of all CoolMiniOrNot games is our ability to consistently make some of the best miniatures in the board game market. However, being a card based game, XenoShyft Onslaught has no miniatures, not including the Ajax First Player token only available to Kickstarter backers. This allowed our art direction team to use their keen eye to create one of the most beautiful card games ever made. We brought on three amazingly talented artists to create all the cards for XenoShyft Onslaught.\nThanks to this, all of the art in XenoShyft Onslaught is cohesive, beautiful, and, most importantly, creates one horrifically realized science fiction universe. \nComponents\nOver 400 beautifully illustrated cards\n1 Large fold-out poster gameboard\n1 Rubber backed playmat\n2 D10 dice  - for tracking base health points.\n20 Cardboard wound markers\n20 Cardboard ability markers\n1 Specially designed Vacuum formed tray - designed to organize and hold all your cards, both with and without sleeves. \n1 Rule book.\nThe XenoShyft Onslaught core box is a huge value for players already familiar with the card game genre. The game contains: over 400 cards that feature the best art seen in an original I.P. game. One large fold-out poster gameboard that is a great way to learn and teach the game because it clearly displays where all cards go. A rubber-backed play mat that duplicated the center of the poster gameboard, perfect for organizing the resource pool an for players who utilize a smaller gaming space. 2 D10 dice, 20 cardboard wound markers, and 20 cardboard ability markers, for tracking base health, damage on NorTect Troops and Hive Aliens, and used or exhausted abilities. Finally, we've spent a great deal of time designing the vacuum-formed tray that players will find inside the XenoShyft Onslaught  core box. We've taken great care to make sure the tray holds all 400+ cards, with separate slots to organize the cards, so the different card types will all have their own unique space for easy storage and retrieval. Best of all, all slots are wide enough for the cards to be sleeved if the player chooses to do so.\nPledge Levels\nNorTec Commander Early Bird!\nThis level includes: the XenoShyft Onslaught core game, which will retail for $59.99, 4 folding lane boards, which will retail for $15, and the Kickstarter exclusive Ajax First Player Token.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign concludes.\nThis is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.  \nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

As a player you'll have access to lots of user generated content!  \nYes, there will be other animals in the pet store. What kind? Let's hit this goal and you can find out!\nThe PlayStation 4 version of the game will come out about 6 months after the Steam and OUYA versions, likely in summer 2015. All backers will be able to choose between EITHER the PS4 version or the Steam + OUYA + DRM free download version. Alternatively backers can get all versions by adding an $3 extra to their pledge (the PS4 keys cost us $3 each).\nCatlateral Damage is a first-person destructive cat simulator where you play as a cat on a rampage, knocking as much of your owner's stuff onto the ground as possible. It's a highly original, experimental concept that was born out of a game jam last year. Oh, and it's based on a real-life mischievous cat!\nMy childhood buddy, Nippy, in real life and in-game.\nSee the world from the perspective of a cat! Like other first-person games, you can walk and look around, jump, and crouch. Unlike other first-person games, your primary weapons are your two cat paws, which you can use to swipe at and knock objects onto the floor.\nCatlateral Damage garnered a bit of attention back in January (see the What People Are Saying section below!), and lots of people have asked to play a full game with more feline destruction. In fact, the demo was so popular that it was Greenlit on Steam after only 8 days! So now I'm making the full game, which will come out on Steam (Windows, Mac OS X, Linux), OUYA, and as a DRM free download. The anticipated release window is Q4 2014.   \nIntrigued? Go play the demo now, in case you missed the big flashing yellow button surrounded by cat paws up top.\n YouTube Features & Let's Plays\nLet's talk about all the new features and content that will be going into the game thanks to your support! In Catlateral Damage you will be able to:\nChase (or ignore) mice. You can play with or catch them! \nSit in a box, lie in a sunbeam, or both at once \nChase a laser pointer and completely freak out \nHack up a hairball. Why not? \nFind long lost cat toys under the couch and play with them \nExplore/hide underneath the bed \nTrip out on catnip \nStand at a doorway and be indecisive about going in or out \nMeow using state of the art, cutting edge meowing technology \nAct indignant because you are the higher species \nKnock over this TV:\nHere's a more thorough explanation of where the game will be going.\nYour goal is to reach the fancy mansion down the street and destroy the super secret, super valuable object hidden within its locked safe. You start in your home apartment, traversing and trashing various houses on the street until your reach the mansion. In each house, you start in a locked room and make messes in rooms to unlock adjacent ones. Once all rooms are sufficiently sloppy, you nap in a box (yes, really) before moving on to the next house. Each residence is larger and contains more valuable possessions than the last. You may even encounter special locations on your journey...\nProcedurally-generated gameplay: Every time you play the game will be different as all houses, rooms, and challenges are procedurally generated. As you play the game more you'll unlock different cats, with different special abilities.\nMore cats and special abilities: As you progress through the game you'll have to make choices about which cat to use for which level, because cats have different special abilities! Some cats jump higher than others, while other cats are stronger and can knock over heavier objects. Some cats prefer to destroy plants, while others hate electronics.\nCollectibles and power ups: What cat doesn't like to collect things? Hunt around for secret objects (or maybe just cat toys you have previously lost?) which can help unlock new abilities. And power-ups enhance your cat's abilities, like catnip which temporarily makes you a super-powered furball of terror!\nTons of polish: I'll focus on getting the controls as perfect as possible, so that moving around really feels like you\u2019re a cat. I'll also spend lots of time focusing on the user interface and experience so the game feels as great as possible. It sounds boring but you'll appreciate it! I'll also add in achievements, leaderboards, and Steam trading cards. \nLots more content: Tons of new objects to topple! A glorious soundtrack, fun sound effects, and more! This messy room is a merely a prelude to the destruction you'll cause as a cat.\nTL;DR \u2013 There's gonna be a TON of new stuff, and I'm going to make this feel like you're a cat as much as possible.\nA sincere thank you and access to backer updates and newsletter. I may occasionally send you a cute pictures of cats. Not too frequently though.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $10 then you'll get an extra copy of the game! You can get as many extra copies as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. If you back the HIPSTER CAT tier or higher then the extra copies will also be early access! ADD-ON COPY does not work with the KITTEN tier, nice try!\nA DRM-free digital copy of the game for PC, Mac, or Linux (and/or Steam key and/or OUYA key) when it releases later this year and full game soundtrack.\nA DRM free copy of the game PC, Mac, or Linux (and Steam key and/or OUYA key), full game soundtrack, and you get your name in the game credits! I'll also send you a special backer-only digital book (PDF) with special cat pictures and developer commentary. It will be awesome.\nYou get special early access to the game before it comes out! Play the game early, give feedback, and tell your friends how great it is before it goes mainstream. Note that early access will be for PC, Mac, and Linux and only available with Steam keys. Includes the BACKER CAT tier.\nThe HIPSTER CAT tier plus games from friends of ours! Includes Steam keys for Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers.\nTHIS IS NOT A TIER! It's an add-on - if you increase your pledge for any of the below tiers by $50 then you get to put another cat photo into the game! You can add as many cats as you'd like, just increase by the appropriate amount. All of your photos will be displayed together in-game as a set.\nMake your cat famous! Send us a photo of your cat and it will appear as a framed poster or picture in-game. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier.\nMake your dog famous! This is just like the LOLCAT tier, except just for dogs. Because this is a game about cats you have to pay an extra dollar for this, and I expect you to submit an unflattering, silly picture of your dog. Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier. \nThe best of both worlds! Get your cat (or dog) in a framed poster or picture in-game, plus we'll send you Steam keys of our friends' games (Goat Simulator, Octodad: Dadliest Catch, The Stanley Parable, Go Home Dinosaurs, and Slam Bolt Scrappers). Includes the HIPSTER CAT tier, and an extra second copy of Catlateral Damage for a friend!\nA game for you and one for your cat! Your cat can't play the video game, but he or she will LOVE this sweet Catlateral Damage laser pointer. You also get a snazzy Catlateral Damage t-shirt (we haven't figured out the design yet, but trust me, it'll be snazzy) plus the GAMER LOLCAT tier for you. Add $15 shipping for non-US addresses.\nPlay as YOUR cat in the game! Your cat will be famous, and appear as a playable character, complete with name and fur color. Includes LONG CAT tier. This was originally $400 but it sold out, so I've put up a second round of 10 slots. Once this is gone that's it, I can't add a third round!\nBUSINESS CAT tier, and you get listed as a \"Fat Cat Producer\" in the credits, which includes a picture of you and/or your cat as opposed to just your name. You also get to have lunch with me and the folks at Fire Hose Games to give feedback on the game, talk about cats, or discuss quantum mechanics - whatever floats your boat. You have to provide your own travel arrangements, or you can Skype in. You'll also get 5 extra copies of the game for your best friends.\nDo you love cats? Are you not messing around? Then this is the tier for you! Eitan (Fire Hose Founder, helping me with this game) will adopt a cat for each person that pledges this tier! There is no limit! Troll him and make him adopt 20 cats, he'll have to do it! Eitan will periodically send you pictures of the cat, and you are invited to come and hang out with him or her when you are in Boston. Includes FAT CAT tier, with a total of 10 copies of the game to share with your best friends.\nI started creating Catlateral Damage last year. I had a full-time job working as a video game tester, and would spend nights and weekends on this game, pursuing my dream to become an indie game developer. In March of 2014 I lost my job, which allowed me to start working full-time on the game but also came with the burden of not having an income. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, I'll be able to continue putting all my effort into creating the game and releasing a great, polished experience for you to play!\nI've been developing video games for about 8 years now and I've been a gamer for the majority of my life. I was also partially raised by cats, so I have extensive experience with feline behavior. Catlateral Damage is truly something I was meant to create.\nIf you want to learn more about me, check out this interview on Gamasutra. You can also check out my website for some other projects I've worked on. Feel free to follow me on Twitter, too!\nI\u2019m not working on the game alone, either! I've been given the opportunity to work alongside Fire Hose Games as part of their indie accelerator program. They will be providing marketing, additional development, and other resources on top of the work I'll be doing on the game. They\u2019re the guys who made Slam Bolt Scrappers and Go Home Dinosaurs. They\u2019re also big time cat lovers so it was a natural fit. Eitan (the founder) has spent way too much time at my place playing with my cats.\nWhen they aren't sleeping or wrestling with each other, Wil & Lyn help out with the research and marketing aspects of the game's development. Wil is a 1-year-old orange tabby and Lyn is a 4-1/2-month-old polydactyl manx.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is actually very low risk! The main challenge with creating this game so far has been working as a solo developer. However working with Fire Hose Games has given me the extra support that I need to make this happen so I\u2019m not alone in a bubble.\n\nAnother risk with this game is underestimating how long it may take to add certain features and content to the game. Features may be delayed due to bugs or unplanned content might need to be created. Luckily the game isn't especially complicated (no online multiplayer). We've planned for some amount of bug fixing and unexpected problems in the schedule so we\u2019re not too concerned.\n\nIf anything were to happen to me due to an Act of God or other such event, I believe the game is in the dependable hands of Wil & Lyn, the fully-capable feline game developers featured in the video. If for any reason they are unable to continue the project, I'm sure the team at Fire Hose Games can handle it!\n\nFinally, we're participating in the OUYA double our funds program, which will reduce our risk even further and help us to get the game on console. Here are the details.\n\nDouble Our Fun(ds)!\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games. OUYA will match your pledge dollar-for-dollar up to your goal amount (and a max of $250,000), so help us get there and make a great game for everyone!

Published by Sony, these games became legendary for their unique soundtracks, their snappy, frenetic action and the zen-like \"flow states\" that players entered into when they got into the groove. \nOriginal game screen and box cover art. The Amplitude logo is a trademark of Sony Computer Entertainment America LLC.\nBoth fans and reviewers REALLY liked the game. Some select quotes from back in the day:\nIn the 11 years since Amplitude\u2019s release, Harmonix has gone on to create true pop culture phenomena with the original Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Still, there was a quiet clawing in the back of our minds. Pleas from Amplitude fans, strangers on the street, and veterans of the studio - we needed to revisit this era of gaming and update it for the modern age! \nWith the advancements in technology and the huge creative leaps forward our studio has taken, we believe we can rebuild Amplitude for current consoles and make it an even more amazing experience than before. We're aiming to deliver an updated soundtrack, incredible visuals, and fine-tuned controls. These improvements will be layered on top of the core mechanics and hallmark difficulty that made both FreQuency and Amplitude such amazing experiences when they first debuted. We\u2019re confident that we can make a game that will do its predecessors justice!\n\n  Early Crippler concept - Purple player launched a debilitating power-up on the green player.\nDuring Rock Band, we perfected our methodology for \u201cbeatmatching\u201d, which we intend to apply to this new title. We\u2019ll also be moving the game into the new proprietary engine Harmonix has developed over the past 10 years. In addition to better control over timing windows, this will also allow us to run at 60 frames per second and smoothly port the existing mechanics to PS3 and PS4.\nThe game, as designed for this Kickstarter, focuses on the core Amplitude experience. Single player and local multiplayer are included in the design, as are leaderboards for online bragging rights. The Beat Blaster (the ship), music notes, tracks and FX will all be modernized and gorgeous. The cyberworld around the tracks will be designed by artists and crafted by coders so that every pixel on screen can be driven by the underlying music. Even as we work through our plans for this Kickstarter, the game is beginning to take shape \u2013 an HD reinvisioning of the cult classic, smartly updated for today on every axis. We believe this is the game that fans of Amplitude have been asking for and a game that can only come from Harmonix.\nEarly Beat Blaster concepts\nMusic is at the heart of Amplitude. The all-new soundtrack will focus on songs with an electronic-based feel, with tones spanning dark and moody to bright and bouncing. \nOur award-winning audio team is uniquely capable of composing amazing music with ideal GAMEPLAY in mind. All the amazing patterns and runs that made Amplitude's gameplay so fun need sick music crafted to match perfectly. For this game, we plan to focus our efforts on music that is custom-created for the game. This has the best chance of creating KILLER gameplay feel and a well-balanced list of songs. And you can help us pick which tracks make it into the final shipping tracklist! Take a look at our backer rewards for more details on how you can make your voice heard, contribute tracks to the game, or get your hands on a limited edition vinyl soundtrack!\nLimited edition colored vinyl (mockup)\nAt its higher difficulty levels, Amplitude was hard as hell. We\u2019re talking \u201cDark Souls\u201d hard, but with music. We know that fans of the original will be expecting that same level of challenge in this new version, and we won\u2019t disappoint. The game will still feature its hallmark difficulty as you progress.\nIn the years since Amplitude, Harmonix developers have become masters at making rhythm games fun for everybody. While we\u2019re focused on designing this project to appeal to a \u201chardcore\u201d base, we intend for fans of more recent Harmonix products to feel right at home with this new game as well, if they\u2019re willing to put in the practice and hone their skills!\nOriginal Amplitude team members still rocking it at Harmonix\nMany of the original developers who made this game a classic are still here at Harmonix, and psyched to update the experience for all players.\nThese veteran developers will be joined by the best rhythm game devs in the industry, folks who\u2019ve shipped dozens of AAA titles. We\u2019re ready to deliver a one-of-a-kind experience that players can pick up and enjoy. This is a game only Harmonix can make, on time and on budget. But we know that we can't do it without your help.\nThe levels are dark and quiet on entry, but jump to life as players release the musical notes.\nOur aim with this Kickstarter is to be humble in our expectations. The current goal is to make a faithful Amplitude \"HD\" - the core experience from PS2\u00ae re-developed for modern gaming devices. We certainly have LOTS of crazy ideas that could blow this concept out. Your contribution, feedback, and community input will decide where this project will land and how many crazy ideas we can incorporate!\nEarly Beat Blaster sketches\nThis project is intended to be a love letter to old-school PS2\u00ae fans, but we need to know that this is something you actually want. This is the project WE desperately want to make, but we can\u2019t do it without your interest and support.

We have a strong plan about how to adapt our proprietary engine for these purposes, especially on PS4, but it is a risk.\n\n\nMUSIC LICENSING AND SOUNDTRACK COMPOSITION\n\nWe want to have the right balance between great electronic songs you know and the type of amazing original compositional work we did in the original PS2\u00ae games.

One of the players is chosen at the beginning of the game to be \u201cthe storyteller\u201d, they use innovative quest building cards to help them create a quest for the other players on the fly. Each of the other players assume the role of a single hero, they get to create who that hero is and then how that hero interacts in the storytellers world.\nPocket Odyssey is designed to be portable, the first micro RPG ever, measuring 1in. thick, 3.5in. tall and 5.5in. wide, this game will quite literally fit in your pocket. Pocket Odyssey has been designed for board game players of all backgrounds to pick up and play. Ever been curious about what a role playing game is, but were too intimidated by all the rules? Maybe you have played role playing games before, but don\u2019t have the time to commit to a huge campaign anymore. Just want an engaging and fun fantasy game? Pocket Odyssey is what you have been waiting for.\n  Gameplay Features\n2-4 players (5-6 w/ expansion)\n90-120 minutes play time\nA tabletop RPG hybrid! No pen or paper needed!\nInnovative \"on the spot\" quest creation method allows for anyone to play as the Game Master. No prep needed!\nFocused rules keep the game moving quickly and bring the most fun parts of traditional RPG's into the limelight!\nDuring combat the game is played on modular map cards with heroes and monsters acting in sequence; the storyteller controls all the monsters. Heroes obtain loot cards at the end of combat in addition to leveling their characters stats. To win the game, each player must complete the main quest developed by the storyteller (through the use of the quest cards) as well as their own personal quest cards (which are kept hidden until completed).\nThe main way to create characters in Pocket Odyssey is for each player to randomly draw 2 background cards, 3 skills and a flaw. The background cards determine what your character is good at, for example \u201cthe Ogre Slayer\u201d is a master at athletics, can withstand pretty much anything tough (like extreme weather or poison gas), and can even intimidate almost anything. The \u201cAelfen Blood\u201d on the other hand knows everything there is to know about nature, has animal like senses and has the stealth of a ninja.\nEach power card represents a unique ability your character will be able to perform, for example the \u201cTough\u201d power allows your character to take more hits while the \u201cFireball\u201d power allows your character to cast a fireball spell. Hold on a sec. What if a tough fighter type draws a \u201cFireball\u201d card, can he use that? Of course! Think of it this way, maybe he has natural fire abilities. And yes, if you have the \u201cCharmer\u201d background, he could have the \u201cTough\u201d power and \u201cQuick Shot\u201d power making him deadly in combat and great at dealing with people.\nThe last element of character creation involves drawing a random flaw card. This represents how others would describe your character in one word. Some examples of flaws include \u201cgullible\u201d and \u201cepic beard\u201d. These help each player to get into their role a little easier.\nPROJECT UPDATES\n1.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nFor two years I have been looking for a great dice game.\nDRAGON SLAYER is that game.\nDragon Slayer has everything I wanted in Indie Boards & Cards' first dice game:\nIt's fast playing, games take 15 minutes, so you can play while waiting for friends to arrive, in line, or over and over again all night long.\nIt has dragons that you are trying to kill.\nIt has dragon dice, dragons that are trying to kill you.\nIt's a \"press your luck\" classic, roll till you stop, go too far and you'll die.\nDid I mention that your friends are trying to get you killed?\nThat\u2019s right, it is a dice game with a twist \u2013 real player interaction! Think your friend pressed his luck too far \u2013 challenge him to keep going. If he does, he can score big \u2013 but if he fails or worst yet doesn\u2019t take the challenge, he\u2019ll lose points and you get some.\nDragon Slayer plays 2 - 5 players, but we are including everything you need to play with 6 in the box.\nFast, Fun and Full of spite \u2013 what more could you ask for?\n Dragon Slayer is a great game, but you can\u2019t know that yet. So if you are getting a reward from our recent Coup Reformation project, then we can add Dragon Slayer to your Reformation rewards and pass along the combined shipping savings to you. A great game at a fantastic price is good deal for everyone. Didn\u2019t back Reformation? Dragon Slayer is still a great game, and you can add extra copies at the same price. And you\u2019ll help us reach our stretch goals.\nIt\u2019s a dice game with 12 custom dice, nice art, detailed rules and six challenge tokens for 7 bucks \u2013 so you know that we can\u2019t get crazy. But I would like to give backers a few extras in addition to a fantastic price. And since this is mass produced, we need to make a minimum number to be able to offer special items.\nSo stretch rewards are based on number of backers (not counting those that aren\u2019t getting rewards, just counting those that are in at the $7 level and above)\n1000 Backers \u2013 Metallic Ink Dice: It looks cool, it is cool. Everyone will know that you got the special edition as soon as you take them out.\nAchieved!\n3000 Backers \u2013 Foil Box: We all like shiny, and a nice shiny game box is a great way to get your friends to play. We can\u2019t understand why, but we all know that it happens. So help us get more backers and we\u2019ll get a box that screams \u201cPlay Me!\u201d \nAchieved!\n4,000 Games - Battlemat: The Battlemat is a convenient way to track your turn during the game. It's been designed to help you quickly learn and teach the game by emphasizing the core game rules and steps in your turn.\nAchieved!\n5,000 Games - Score tracker:  a compact scoreboard with small cubes to track each player's progress and tokens to remind everyone what color they are!\nAchieved!\n6,000 Games - Score tracker for 6 players & and a 2nd copy of the Battlemat: Even though we are listing the game as supporting 2-5 players, there is no theoretical maximum number of players. We are including challenge tokens to support up to 6 (or have an extra if you lose one), so it makes sense that we could also include scoring markers for that 6th player as well. If we get 6000 committed games in this project, we will include the 6th player in green.\nACHIEVED!\nALL STRETCH REWARDS UNLOCKED!\nNote - These stretch goal upgrades won't be included in the retail version of the game that is sold via distribution.\nNick Hayes (a full time game designer, as well as a illustrator & graphic designer) did a great job on the box and game component art as you can see here:\nAs you might have expected in a PYL (push your luck) game, there are dice! 12 dice, 10 different with only the 3 warrior dice repeated. Each of the dragon dice have different head, wing and tail designs that really add to the \"wow\" factor. And yes these are molded dice - not silkscreened, so they will be durable. Also in the box are the challenge tokens - enough to support games with up to 6 players, though we are listing on the box that this will play 2-5.\nGame designer David Mortimer really made this game shine - creating a new PYL game is a deceptively difficult challenge, and he did this one right.  The rules can be found here. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, format of repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge, and rewards for passing or failing when challenged, add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?\nDon't get me wrong, it is still a classic PYL game with rules that are easy to learn and teach - it is just that the challenges really do add something very interesting to the genre and nicely complement the rest of the great design ideas that David has incorporated in Dragon Slayer.\nI really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the Indie Boards and Cards, and be able to offer this fantastic deal to those that helped us blow the roof off the Reformation project. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nThank you for supporting us!\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it is ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has another project that is due for deliver (Coup Reformation expansion), that game will be produced at the same time as this game. As the artwork is already done for both games this should not present a great risk.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents.

Each kingdom competes to attract the tribes, eager for the strength of the combined peoples, who are now leaving behind old traditions with the hope that the titans can be defeated once and for all.\nIn The Ancient World, players compete to grow the largest and most influential kingdom by managing citizens, treasury, military and defeating titans. Players take turns sending citizens to take special actions or using military cards to attack titans.  Players also purchase Empire cards to add strength and abilities to their kingdom.\nA kingdom's influence in the world is measured by sets of tribe banners that it owns. Each Empire card has one or more tribe banners. Tribe banners can also be gained by defeating titans.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing. The rules are easy to teach, learn, and understand but they combine to give you seemingly endless combinations and countless strategies.\nDavid has done something really extraordinary here. He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head. I have no idea how I'm managing to type this right now, but convincing you to support Lagoon is that important. It's that good. Trust me.\"\nJason Tagmire, Designer of Pixel Lincoln: \"Lagoon feels like Magic the Gathering meets Summoner Wars meets a very thinky game of rock, paper, scissors. A very subtle, beautiful game.\"\nBen Pinchback, Co-Designer of Fleet, and Eggs and Empires: \"Lagoon is a gorgeous looking game and a real brain burner under the hood. Each decision is meaningful and fun. This is the type of game you think about long after you're done playing.\"\nDarrell Louder, Designer of Compounded: \u201cLagoon is a fantastic game where options and gameplay grow as the game goes on. It\u2019s a brilliant puzzle that I love to unravel every single time I play. Probably the best game I played at BGG Con 2013.\"\nMichael Mindes, Founder of Tasty Minstrel Games: \"Lagoon is fun, intriguing, and as you can see the artwork is amazing. I will be an excited backer on day 1 and I expect great things for this game and its designer David Chott.\"\nKyle Hendricks, Game Designer and Player Extraordinaire: \"There is a damn good chance that Lagoon will end up being in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\"\nThe components included in one copy of Lagoon are listed below.

Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them.

Thank you for making Lagoon a success and being a wonderful backer community!\nPersonally, the past year has been transformative. Of course I changed careers and learned a lot of new skills in the process. More profoundly though, the empowerment of my Kickstarter success sparked unprecedented personal growth for me.

You'll traverse the galaxy, exploring planets and battling other players to build up a strategic hand of cards.\nAs you progress through the game, you'll gather weapons and tactical equipment that help you discover, gain control of, and protect The Ovoid. This mysterious artifact is your civilization's last hope for survival, and you will have to use deception, misdirection, and strategy to outwit your opponents and possess it at the exact moment the universe collapses! By carefully balancing your hand of cards, spending your turn actions wisely, and cleverly using your alien powers, you'll maintain a grasp on the state of the game while plunging everyone else into chaos.\nRulebook: http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosRules1-5.pdf\nPrint & Play: http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosPnP.pdf\nQuick-Start Rules (on BoardGameGeek): bit.ly/1bqESda\nNew Strategy Video!\n\u2022 New Mechanic - Area-Specific Envelopes: Chaosmos uses a unique system in which each of the planets on the game board has a corresponding envelope of cards. When you land on a planet, you can take any of the cards there, leave behind cards you don't need, and hide cards for later. Special tactical cards can be left face-up to protect that planet from your rivals.\n\u2022 Alien Powers: Each player controls an alien character with powerful unique abilities that reflect their culture and personality. Atturnuk the Brutal may bludgeon enemies, while Drusu the Scryer can use telepathy to scout the Ovoid from afar. \n\u2022 Open World: Chaosmos is a sandbox-style game that gives you the freedom to explore many paths to victory. Each turn you can move in any direction, exploring new planets and choosing how to adapt your strategy as you discover new equipment. You can test out cool gadgets, protect caches of items, stock up on weapons, or anything else you can imagine.\n\u2022 The Ovoid: All players are vying for control of one singular victory card - the Ovoid. You'll have to carefully time your strategies to hold the Ovoid in the final turn to win.\n\u2022 Card Interaction: Cards will move organically around the planets, as players find uses for them. Most cards go back to your hand after you play them, allowing you to use them multiple times. By paying attention to what your opponents play, you can pick up cards that counter their strategies, giving you an edge the next time you encounter them.\n  \u2022  Facebook  \u2022  Twitter  \u2022  BGG  \u2022 YouTube  \u2022\nMore information about each alien can be found in the print-and-play pdf linked at the bottom.\nTom Vasel Video Review:\nUndeadViking Video Review:\nCrits Happen Video Review:\n\"I don't know that I've ever played a game like this before!

He is the producer and editor of the feature length documentaries The Inventor and the Daredevil and Pauly Shore Stands Alone. He loves games, and has designed and refined over a dozen card games, board games, and RPGs. Chaosmos is his dream project, and the response to it inspired him to start Mirror Box Games.\nMatthew Austin is the Lead Developer at Mirror Box Games. He developed the navigation iPhone app Falcon, which has successfully partnered with Insomniac Events and UCLA to provide walking navigation to festival attendees and incoming students. Prior to working on Falcon, Matt started and ran a successful home improvement company.\nDanny Vigour is responsible for the graphic design of Chaosmos. In the past, his mixed-media short films have earned him awards from companies as diverse as Sony Creative Software and Lea & Perrins Steak Sauce. Danny offered his help long-distance initially, but once the project got serious enough, he moved to California to join the team.\nSam Vest defines himself as a \"Freelance Videographer by day, artist all the time.\" He started as a Chaosmos play tester, but eventually became the demo runner at conventions, recognizable from a distance thanks to his signature top hat.\nChaosmos began as a personal project for me many years ago. I've completed several finished game designs, but this one is special to me. The response to the game convinced me that it was worth spending months testing and balancing, and ultimately publishing.\nIn January 2013, I decided to produce the game with my friend Matt. Old friends came out of the woodwork with endless love and support for the project, and my brother Danny moved to Los Angeles to work on it with me. We met with three major publishers at the Gama Trade Show and Gen Con, but ultimately decided to form a company and self-publish.\nFor a detailed history of the origins of the game, click here.\nWe've invested our own money into producing the prototypes and reviewer copies. With Kickstarter, we will have the flexibility and support we need to finish our art and components, and to deliver Chaosmos in a way that will stay true to our vision and make our fans proud.\n-Joey\n                                                                                                                               Rulebook:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosRules1-5.pdf\nPrint & Play:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosPnP.pdf \nLow Ink Rulebook: http://www.mirrorboxgames.com/rules.html\nPress Kit: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0gy6rau6ij3hvft/hCuieoI6sX\nDisclaimer: Art and design for Chaosmos is not final and is subject to change.

What, are you nuts?\nWe have made some counter-intuitive decisions for this Kickstarter, and it's our hope that you'll prove us right, not just for this project, but for future game projects by other creators.\n1. We have chosen not to do any exclusives as part of this campaign. That means we are lacking the \"rare components\" incentive. Many will simply choose to wait for the game to hit retail. We understand the risk, but think it will be better for the game in the long run. If you agree, this is a chance to show that exclusives are not needed to succeed.\n2. In lieu of exclusives, we have decided to offer the game at the ridiculously low price of $15, but only to Kickstarter backers. This is not a micro game. It is a game with over 125 cards that has a high level of strategy & theme, world class art, and first rate graphic design. The MSRP on Draco Magi will be $25.  Our hope is that a $15 Kickstarter price will encourage you to back this project instead of waiting. By backing the Kickstarter you will get the game for just a tiny bit over wholesale and you will have it in your hands before the general population. \n3. All stretch goals that we reach will apply to every game we manufacture.\nIf you agree that rewarding Kickstarter backers with a significant discount is a better road to take than selling at or above MSRP with exclusives, you can help by pledging! \nThis campaign will only run for 24 days!

The Human Player and the Orc Player are either battling or cohabiting... most likely battling. =)\nCohabiting is when two players create an alliance and share the benefits of that region. The alternative would be to battle, in which one player will lose his meeple and the other player's meeple will remain. War is resolved through a resource bidding system.\nThe Orc Player is gathering all 3 resource types.\nThe Elven Player is fortifying the Forest so that no other player may enter. However, she is gathering 1 Mana, not 2. The Human Player is gathering 2 Food.\nThe Tower & Improved VP\nEvery player will be competing to build a great Tower. They will keep track of their status on a community Tower Card. Because the Tower does not offer any immediate benefits, it is worth additional Victory Points in the end.\nThe scrolls on the right indicate the VP value of that tier.\nThe Action Selection Card & Exploitation\nThe Action Selection Card is the driving engine in Tiny Epic Kingdoms. The players share a community Action Selection Card and even community actions. During a turn, the active player selects an action by placing a gray cube next to it. He may either perform the action he selected OR perform no action at all. Now, the other players, in order, must perform the action that the active player selected OR gather resources. \nThe number of resources gathered is based on where a player's cubes are placed on the Territory Cards. A player gathers 1 resource per region that he has at least 1 cube in. The type of resource gathered is based on the type of region occupied. \nIt is now the next player's turn, he is now the active player that is selecting the community action. He may not select an action already chosen in previous turns, this is tracked by the gray shields. Once all the gray shields have been placed, they will wipe on the following turn. That active player will now have a clean slate to choose from.\nPlayers are able to use the Action Card to exploit other players by selecting actions they know their opponent(s) can't afford to perform.\nRules of Play\nYou can download the prototype rules below.

Any factions, maps and the mini expansion left out of the final version will be available via the BGG store, conventions and/or other outlets.\nPrior to launching on Kickstarter, we sent out tons of prototypes of Tiny Epic Kingdoms. Some to established reviewers and some to gamers who like to write reviews. Both crowds received the game so well, that I had to reach out further and see just how far the excitement for TEK went. So, I released a FREE Print 'N Play of the game and within two weeks it had already been downloaded over 1,500 times!

Microgames and 4X games are two of my weaknesses, and this manages to combine both together in a tidy package.\" -Craig Imprimis\n\"For us, many 4X games are simply inaccessible due to their over-production of rules, mechanics and sometimes graphic layout. There were none of these obstacles in Tiny Epic Kingdoms and we felt like we were expanding, exploring, exploiting and exterminating. Finally, there is a 4X game that we can play and want to play.\" -Sarah Reed\n\"It's a nice game some people can fit in a lunch break, has fast setup and take down, and benefits from smooth paced turns.\" -Justin Lowmaster\n\"TEK manages to capture all the depth you'd expect to find in a 4X game\" -Legend Montgomery\n\"Having a game of this caliber in a very portable size is rare. I can bring this anywhere and pull it out nearly anywhere. The game plays quickly so it doesn't over stay its welcome. I\u2019m so glad this game found me.\" -J.

Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have put endless hours into bringing Tiny Epic Kingdoms to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic art over 50% completed.

After a lot of searching over nearly two decades we decided to make the book that we want to use. We\u2019ve created many prototypes and are ready to place our first order for manufacturing\u2014and that's where we need your help. Without a significant amount of orders the manufacturers cannot make any books at all.\nWe're a small group of thinkers (designers, illustrators, writers, entrepreneurs and the like) that love to sit down with a notebook or sketchbook and give birth to interesting thoughts and ideas. While today\u2019s digital age is fantastic\u2014we love technology\u2014we\u2019ve found that our best work always starts on paper.\nFrom the very beginning we've had to ask ourselves to define and redefine what a notebook is. We came to the conclusion that a notebook is a tool\u2014a means to something greater than itself. Using this understanding as a guide we began to break down the individual subtleties that comprise the whole and improve the design in small ways. There are no gimmicks, no unnecessary parts\u2014just intelligent improvements to a simple tool.\nUsability is important, and we wanted a notebook that felt natural when used at your desk, on your couch, in the train\u2014anywhere. To do this we had to account for various use cases, including laying the book flat on a desk, holding it with one hand and writing with the other, carrying it in a backpack or purse, using it all day or just in spurts, and so on. (At roughly 5.4\" x 7.7\" it's small enough to go with you anywhere and big enough to comfortably use all day at home or work.) We\u2019ve strived to bring you a more refined book through detailed questioning and testing.\nWe've worked hard to get out of your way. The books aren't covered in branding (the cover is completely blank) and inside we've included the absolute minimum necessary tools: a bookmark for keeping your page and a box on the inside endpaper (where you can write your name, subject, date, or anything else you desire). This is your book, not ours.\nWe started a dialog with hundreds of artists, designers, developers, entrepreneurs, illustrators, and other thinkers around the world and asked them one simple question: What do you like in a sketchbook or notebook? All the hours of research, testing, and discussion have helped us distill the qualities that make a tool conscious enough to help the creative process and simple enough so that it doesn\u2019t get in your way.\nThe subtleties that make a difference.\nSmart design is crucial when it comes to the subtleties of a simple item. We've carefully considered every detail to create a great tool for exploration.\nEvery inch of our books have been meticulously pored over\u2014and we will continue to work on and improve them. Your feedback will help shape our books as we make them more and more refined.\nWhat does Baron Fig mean?\nThe creative journey revolves around the dichotomy of Discipline and Impulse: having the impulse to go to places you (and others) haven\u2019t, and the discipline to see it through. The Greek gods Apollo and Dionysus represent this dichotomy perfectly. From Apollo, who is associated with order and discipline, we derive \u201cBaron\u201d; from Dionysus, a god of madness and ecstasy, we took the symbol of the \u201cFig.\u201d\nThus Baron Fig\u2014Discipline & Impulse.\nHow Kickstarter works.\nThe following is taken from Kickstarter's info page.\nKickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others.\nThousands of creative projects are funding on Kickstarter at any given moment. Each project is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility over their projects. They spend weeks building their project pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they're ready, creators launch their project and share it with their community.\nEvery project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing.\nBacking a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.\nRewards.\nCheck out the rewards below. Keep in mind you can pledge as little as $1 or as much as you like\u2014every little bit helps.\nOur project is based on simplicity, in keeping with that spirit we're not going to do stickers, posters, and postcards like many Kickstarter campaigns do. We believe in these books, and have worked on perfecting every subtlety to make a product you can use and love.\nOnward.\nThese books are a work in progress. We plan to create open channels to easily connect with you, the very first Baron Fig users. This will be achieved by having part of our website dedicated to receiving your feedback. We will actively listen, respond, and refine our books. You're part of the process\u2014and we can't wait for what's in store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing a product is a monumental feat.

The different elements include (but are not limited to): cover material, end papers, bookmark material, quality paper stock, printing on the endpapers, dot grid printing, ruled lines printing, quality control, packaging, shipping packaging.\n\nOnce the books are created then we have them delivered to us in New York City where we will ship them to our backers all over the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Bags for Thinkers", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Something new is coming!", "update_content": "4,242 shipments containing 8,760 books have been shipped to 48 countries around the world.\nTwo Fridays ago we told our backers to start watching their mailboxes.

Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still pre-order yours on our website.\nTouchscreens are amazing, but when you just want to turn on your flashlight, take a quick photo or send your location, simple actions can become a bit of a hassle. \nWithout Pressy, if you just want to turn your flashlight ON you need to: \nWake your screen -> Unlock it -> Exit your current running app -> Search for the app you want to use ->  Launch it  ->  And finally, perform your desired Action.  \nThis \u201csimple\u201d process requires 5-7 different Actions and takes more than 8 seconds! Additionally, you must maintain eye contact with your screen throughout the entire process.\nDon't believe us? try and beat that time yourself!\nBut what if you want to perform an action quickly and without having to deal with or look at the device?\nPressy lets you perform any Action on your smartphone by using the most intuitive input \u2013 clicking a button \u2013 Saving you time and effort! Pressy is a tiny physical button that connects to your phone through the headphone jack.\nConnecting the Pressy Button with the free Pressy app lets you easily customize and use your favorite, everyday actions. For example, if you use your flashlight on regular basis, set a Click-combination the app for turning on your flashlight and start clicking the Button!\nGetting started using Pressy couldn\u2019t be any easier. Plug the Pressy Button to the headphone jack, download the free app, and you\u2019re good to go. Click the Pressy button and see your phone\u2019s flashlight turn on. Click it again and it turns off. As simple as that. \nPressy comes with 3 pre-set Actions, but once you get the hang of things you can customize clicking behavior and trigger dozens of different actions.\nQuality assurance is very important to us. Boaz is going to accompany the production process right from the start and we are going to test each button on several devices. We designed a device that tests the button mechanically and electronically to make sure each and every product is intact. We plan to begin production as soon as we reach our goal so we can deliver as soon as possible. With your help it can be in less than 4 months!\nPressy is in the News! Check out a few of the website Pressy was featured in:\nFor Beginners\nPressy comes with three awesome, out-of-the box default actions so you can immediately start having fun with it, even if you aren't a tech-geek like us! \n\u2022 One short Click to toggle your flashlight \n\u2022 One long Click to toggle your phone in and out of silent mode \n\u2022 Double-Click to snap a photo\n Just plug in Pressy, download the free app and start clicking!\nGot the hang of it? Let\u2019s start having even more fun! \nPressy is not just a one-trick-pony. The Pressy app allows you to select your favorite Actions and set different Click-combinations for each Action. \nHere are some examples: \nPressy also allows you to customize the settings of each Action.\nFor example, you can set Pressy to take a regular photo or to take a discreet photo (with your screen off and without sound or flash). \n How to Set an Action:\nThe new app design\n\nFor us Geeks, let\u2019s go crazy!\n If you are a developer, Pressy has 3 ways to create your very own Action: \n1. Develop an app or a service and utilize the Pressy button to launch it with your desired parameters.\n2. Initiate 3rd Party apps, like a specific task in Tasker or AutomateIt.\n3. Embed Pressy in your own app to perform your specific in-app actions (using Pressy\u2019s API \u2013 free for Kickstarter Backers!). For example, use the Pressy button as a game controller, PTT button or any other usage. \nFurther tips, instructions, Q&A, and social sharing of Actions will be available on www.PressyButton.com. \nHow Does it Work ?\nOnce you launch the Pressy app, you activate a background service. The service monitors the headset-jack into which the Pressy Button is plugged. The application is then activated only when the Pressy Button is clicked, therefore, it does not drain your battery. The application recognizes the specific input and preforms the desired Action. The Pressy app works on all Android devices, versions 2.3 and up. \nWhere do We Stand  \nAt the moment we have many working models and prototypes of the Pressy Button. All prototypes were made using 3D printing and CNC, and manually assembled by us. In order to take production to the next level, we have already contacted all the suppliers and manufacturers we need. We got the best price offers in order to make Pressy affordable for everyone. Production costs per item are relatively reasonable, but the molds and minimum order quantity make it really difficult to carry out with our own funds.\nHere is where you guys can truly help. All the money we raise will help us manufacture mass quantity of Pressy buttons and bring the application to the next level. Your help will bring Pressy to life within 4 months!\nThe 3D printed parts\nPrototype Lineup\n  The Pressy Story \nAs we said in the video, smartphones are really awesome! But, if you need to spend about 10 seconds and perform 5-7 actions in order to \u201csimply\u201d do something on your phone \u2026. Well, in the words of Seth Godin, \u201cIt\u2019s broken!\u201d \nThis is exactly how the Pressy project was born. We want to give you a new, simple and intuitive way to preform everyday actions on your smartphone with a quick and simple click of a button. \nOf course the pledges are important and we could not continue without them, but we also want to hear what you guys think about our product. Don\u2019t be shy! Feel free to contact us with any questions, comments or ideas you may have. We will be grateful for any feedback and will do our best to answer any message as soon as we can.\nUse Your Headset media button as Pressy!\nThe rewards\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nDuring the last 4 months, we were working around the clock designing and building the prototypes, during this time we also contacted dozens of manufacturers, got pricing offers and more importantly, production plans. After choosing some of them each manufacturer was examined carefully by us, and we started discussing specific details including the molds and tooling costs, specifying materials, manufacturing schedules, assembly and packaging options...

We\u2019ve become a culture that\u2019s quite good at sitting.\nThe problem is, sitting isn\u2019t good for us.\nRecent studies conclude too much sitting leads to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and decreased lifespan.\nThat\u2019s right: the more you sit, the sooner you die. \nIn fact, scientists found regular, prolonged sitting has such a negative impact on our health that its effects aren\u2019t even offset by regular exercise.\nScary stuff. Especially for those of us who make our living sitting in front of a screen.\nDon\u2019t just sit there\nThe best way to counteract the negative effects of sitting is to simply sit less and move more. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always possible or realistic.\nThe ooloo rocking footrest makes it easy to maintain some motion whenever you\u2019re seated. Even the moderate activity ooloo provides can help keep your leg muscles firing and your blood pumping. Plus, ooloo\u2019s patent-pending design allows you to fully stretch your calves and Achilles, so you\u2019ll be ready for that noon run. \nIf you already spend part of your day at a standing workstation, you can use ooloo to shift your weight from one leg to another and add motion to standing.\nArt at your feet\nWe partnered with fantastic artists to develop a range of graphics to make looking at ooloo as rewarding as using it. We\u2019re launching with a few designs but we\u2019ll release more if we receive enough support.\nThese designs are currently available:\n\"Hiker\"\n\"Drift\"\n\"Red Bird\"\n\"Tall Boy\"\n\"Waves\"\n\"Minimalist\"\nooloo DIY kit\nThe perfect platform for motion\nWhen designing the platform for ooloo, we found it\u2019s hard to beat a modern skateboard deck. The slightly concave shape and upturned nose and tail help hold your feet in place in just about any position. \nooloo\u2019s 8\u201d wide by 32\u201d long platform is made from 7-ply North American maple. We cover the top surface with a translucent grip material made from ground, recycled glass. This platform rests on two powder coated aluminum rockers. \nUsing ooloo will raise your feet about 3.5\u201d above the floor. Typically this requires little or no adjustment to your current seating configuration. ooloo works on any floor surface. Keep in mind you\u2019ll want to use a floor protector (just as you would with a chair) on floors that may be damaged by frequent contact. On hard floors (like wood or concrete), ooloo will slide around easily. This is intentional, as it allows you to move ooloo from one position to another.\nMoving forward\nWith the support of the Kickstarter community, we'll be able to fine-tune ooloo and complete the first production run. This includes making final adjustments to the graphics, fine-tuning the rocker design, establishing an efficient assembly process, and working through the inevitable details required to bring such a project to life. We're super excited to get ooloo in the hands of more people than just our small crew of prototype testers!\nWe've been experimenting with different wood veneers. A walnut veneer is shown on this ooloo. Let us know if you'd like to see a veneer option\u2013if there's enough demand, we'll try to add it to the mix!\nWhat's in a name? Our patent-pending rocker design shares the same shape as the traditional Eskimo knife, the ulu. We changed the spelling and arrived at \"ooloo.\"\nThe real team\nNo project like this gets off the ground without the help of many individuals behind the scenes.

This gives us better control of material and finish quality and allows us to build personal relationships with our suppliers. \n\nHowever in our case, sourcing from the U.S. results in higher component and labor costs. As an example, many skateboard decks are now made in China, and are available for a fraction of the cost of a U.S.-made deck. But typically these decks are of inferior quality (they are prone to warping and cracking), and the wood sources cannot be traced.\n\nWe\u2019ve all become accustomed to prices that are based on cheap overseas labor and materials. While the pendulum is slowly swinging back toward domestic production, today ooloo must deal with consumer price expectations that are likely based on overseas production. \n\nReliance on suppliers:\nWe\u2019ve developed great relationships with our component suppliers (almost all of whom we work with in person), but we\u2019re only ordering in small volumes. That means we may not receive priority when placing orders, causing delays in our production scheduling. \n\nChallenges of meeting demand:\nWhile our manufacturing process is in place, a lot must be coordinated in order to meet a large volume of orders in a timely fashion.

The ultra portable C.24 transforms from a protective cover into a piano-style keyboard at the touch of a spring-loaded latch.\nKeyboard performance\nThe use of anti-polarity magnets creates the semi-weighted feel of the keyboard. By using magnets instead of traditional springs reliability and longevity are extended.\nEach key press is sensed by an infrared emitter detector pair providing real time analog position data. Optical key tracking technology delivers MIDI velocity, monophonic aftertouch as well as detailed performance capabilities.\nDetail of magnets under keys\nCapacitive modulation\nJust above the keyboard is the capacitive ribbon controller. The ribbon extends across the width of the keyboard and is divided into two regions, each with 32 embedded LEDs for visual feedback. The left region is configured to function as eight buttons, by default assigned to shift the keyboard\u2019s octave assignment. The right region is designed for analog expression such as pitch bend.\nLEDs in capacitive controller\nWe didn't stop at keys and ribbon controls\u2026\nOur team designed an open standard for hardware expansion modules.Tactile controls such as knobs, faders and XY pads will be available in the future. This allows you to configure your C.24 based on your performance requirements. Third parties have already started work on innovative modules.\nCommunication and compatibility\nThe C.24 communicates to the iPad via Bluetooth Low Energy. We developed an open standard for CoreMIDI over Bluetooth. This technology can be used by any developer to transmit and receive MIDI wirelessly to compatible iOS devices.\nKEY app\nMiselu\u2019s KEY application makes it possible to use Bluetooth devices to make music. KEY allows you to assign your keyboard\u2019s output to any CoreMIDI compatible iOS application. You can also save presets, allowing you to quickly change your setup during a performance.\nWho we are\nSan Francisco based Miselu develops music interfaces and instruments to enrich the experience of creating music with the iPad.

That is why we decided to assemble at least the first 1,000 units in-house. The things engineers learn and notice by assembling a large number of units themselves are crucial and lead to the iterative process that refines manufacturing to the best possible state. This is something that could never be achieved this well or quickly if manufacturing and assembling is outsourced. We believe this is the best way to guarantee that everything will work the way intended and -- at the same time -- get ready for mass production much faster. \nWe are currently evaluating production partners in China, Malaysia and the United States.

Companies have systematically lowered your expectations to the point where it's hard to know what to expect anymore. But it ends here.\n4 - 100% Made in America. The tags, the labels, even the fabric (all the way down the yarn and the cotton it's made from) are domestically produced.\n5 - Sold direct. Premium sweatshirts cost anywhere from $130 - $190+ in department stores. Cheap ones are only a few bucks less. And that's without the guarantee, domestic production or free mending, of course. Flint and Tinder is cutting out the middleman to keep the price to just half of what it should be. \nTHE STORY:\nIt starts when the Flint and Tinder team overheard a conversation in a factory we were visiting. Someone was talking about using coarse thread with delicate fabric. Doing this accelerates the process of wearing holes into a garment as it goes through the dryer time and time again. \nIn the manufacturing industry, knowing that something will need to be replaced instead of fixed is known as \"planned obsolescence.\" Increasingly it's become the norm.\nIt doesn't have to be this way though \u2014 far from it. Eager to prove a point, send a message, and make a sweatshirt that could last a lifetime (the way your favorite sweatshirt should), we set out to make a premium piece that's so well constructed customers would rather have it mended (free of charge, of course) than replaced. \nWe'd like to think we've done just that. It's more than a sweatshirt though; it's a battle cry. Not everything should be disposable. It's time to buy less, but get more!\nCOLORS:\nThe 10-Year Hoodie is available in the following colors:\nUNISEX FIT:\nFlint and Tinder's 10-Year Hoodie was designed in a slim, modern fit (nearly identical to that offered by JCrew).\nIt is unisex, but the female model shown at the top is wearing a medium, not the small she normally wears. (Currently, we've only made samples in medium, as soon as enough people order we'll begin producing them in all sizes, so you can see before selecting size.)\nWe'll get your size and color selections after the funding period has closed. Rest assured though, we'll have a detailed sizing guide for you to reference at that time to ensure the perfect fit.\nSUPERIOR COMFORT & DETAILS:\nNOTE: By popular request, the leather pull on the zipper is now optional. We'll get your preference at the end of the funding period. We've scoured the globe for a rare 100% cotton18 oz. all-weather knit, one with a tight enough weave to last a lifetime, but where the yarns were spun in such a way that it will actually get softer over time. The fleece we chose is made of 3-end yarns, which means 3 separate yarns are spun together to create a stronger quality. Best of all: We found the last standing manufacturer of this fabric right here in America!\nWe chose a custom raglan style sleeve for comfort and full range of motion, without bagginess. (Go ahead, put your arms above your head - see how the waist-line barely comes up? That's raglan for you.)\nThe 3-piece lined hood and kangaroo pockets are oversized, and the fabric around the zipper \"kisses\" (covers the teeth without getting in the way) so you'll stay cozy for years to come!\nBy popular request, we've now added an inner pocket!\nIt measures 5 in. x 7 in. That's deep enough to tuck an iPhone 5 in an extra large case with room to spare. The pocket will include bar tacks on all stress points for maximum durability. Throw your wallet in there, or your keys on a run, and you'd literally have to hang upside down on the monkey bars to have them jostle free!\nDURABILITY:\nTHEIRS:\nSeams, even at stress points, are made by bringing the pieces of fabric together, pushing both exposed edges inwards, then sewing them together with a single needle. THE PROBLEM: Once a single thread or stitch is broken, the whole thing unravels. Outward pressure on the seam accelerates the process. \nOURS:\nAll stress seams are reinforced with a mock safety stitch for extreme durability. We begin by overlapping the pieces, then sewing it down on both exposed edges (first with a cover stitch, essentially a series of tiny knots that if broken along their chain maintain integrity elsewhere, then a double-needle) to make sure they're never coming undone. It's flat on the inside, and looks almost like piping on the outside. You will not find this on lesser-made garments.\nThe cuff and sweep are made of a heavy-weight ribbing with Lycra to retain shape and create better recovery.\nWe've added a custom F+T zipper pull to an industrial zipper that is reinforced with heavy-duty twill tape for long lasting wear.\nFREE MENDING:\nOver time, every stitch tells a story. As the years go on, this sweatshirt will become more and more unique, comfortable, recognizable and your own!\nSure, we've made it to last a lifetime and are guaranteeing it for the next decade, but we'll also mend it free of charge should life ever get in the way. What exactly does that mean? If your hoodie rips, tears, or otherwise comes apart at the seams, send it back to us. It's not that it's so cheap we can replace it, it's that it's so well made, we'll make it whole before returning it to you!\nYou'll have two choices: Contrast thread or thread of the same color.\nTHE PATCHES:\nTHE TEAM:\nFlint and Tinder began life with just one guy, Jake, noticing that all of the underwear in the underwear aisle of major department stores seems to have been made in other countries. He put the video above on Kickstarter, and 30 days later had sold several times his original goal.\nToday, Flint and Tinder is a team of 5. We are America's first and only premium, high-volume manufacturer of men's underwear. We'd love to add a premium sweatshirt to the line.\nTo make the minimums required to get production going, we need 1,000 people need to raise their hands and tell the world it's time to buy less but get more!\nTHE FINE PRINT:\nThere's really not much fine print - if you send the thing back to us, we'll fix it and send it back to you. Return postage is on us (that is to say, shipping back to you once you've shipped it to us for mending), but give us a heads up before dropping it in the box. Also, international customers will have to pay shipping both ways (last time we did this, just shipping a single package to Dubai cost $60. In cases such as those, we reserve the right to ask for a bit more to ship the sweatshirt out in the first place, once actual and final shipping costs have been calculated. Unfortunately, this can't be done in advance as shipping costs vary by country and Kickstarter doesn't tell us where you are until after the funding period has closed. We will not be making money on shipping though and will be transparent about these costs). We cannot fix stains or lost strings.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you SO much for the support! We will not let you down.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first Rodeo. \n\nIn May of 2011, Flint and Tinder went on Kickstarter asking for support in setting-up America's first high-volume, premium men's underwear production. We wound up selling nearly 10 times the amount we'd planned on selling (close to 30,000 pairs when it was all said and done) making us, at that time, the top Fashion Kickstarter of all time. \n\nProducing anything, let alone your first product, at high-volume poses a number of problems. Still, 4 months later, having kept over 100 people working for 120+ days, we shipped the complete order!\n\nOn top of that, we were able to provide top-notch customer service to our backers... even in an industry (underwear) not traditionally thought of as having customer service at all. \n\nThis time around we've limited the quantities available for order. This alone should cut most of the trouble spots out of what lies ahead. Beyond that, we're actually able to work now with vendors we've been working with for months.

Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

This is in spite of the fact that some of the largest names in technology such as Apple, Cisco and Netgear have been actively making such routers for over a decade.\nAll that changed with the introduction of Almond.\nAlmond: World\u2019s 1st Touchscreen WiFi Router\nThe original Almond is the world\u2019s first wireless router that can be setup entirely from its built-in touchscreen without the need for a PC or Mac or CD. Technology journalists immediately hailed it as a router for the post-PC era. Its design and ease-of-use were recognized by such illustrious media sites as the New York Times, CNet, CNBC, Ars Technica, and others.\nMore than a critical success, it proved wildly popular with those who matter most: customers! Within 3 months of its release, Almond beat hundreds of other routers to become the #1 Best Rated Router on Amazon.com. Not bad for a new product from an unknown startup.\nGenesis of the Smart home Era\nSmartphones have revolutionized what we can do on the go. Although Home Automation technologies have been around for decades, adoption has been slow due to high cost and the lack of integrated products. Thanks to the emergence of always connected smart phones and the app market, there has been growing interest in creating a smarter home. There have been some interesting products such as Philips Hue lightbulbs, LIFX and Smartthings taking advantage of these trends.\nAlmond+ : One-Box to do it all\nToday we have one remote for our TV, one for the DVD player, one for IP media player and another for the set top box. Do we want the same mess of controller boxes to make our homes smart? In a sensible world, the smart home controller would be built into the router itself. That is exactly what we\u2019ve set out to do with Almond+. It is not only one of the fastest routers (1.17 Gb/s) on the planet but also a highly capable smarthome hub.\nWe\u2019ve chosen ZigBee and Z-Wave so that right out of the box Almond+ supports hundreds of existing sensors in the market.\nAlmond+ : Exquisite Design\nThe original Almond has been generally acknowledged to have one of the most elegant industrial designs for a router. We wanted to up the ante with Almond+. In spite of all these cool new things it can do, it still maintains an extremely small footprint. Also it can be wall mounted or table mounted. In the wall mount position you can hide those annoying cables completely out of sight, thanks to its innovative recessed connector design. Surprisingly there isn\u2019t a single other router that can do this today.\nAnd to top it all, we will have 4 exclusive colors just for Kickstarter backers - Pearl White, Sky Blue, Kickstarter Green & Funky Red.\nAlmond+ : Unprecedented Integration + Unbelievable Price\nWe looked at the existing home automation technologies - They all require too much fiddling around. Not to mention it costs over $500 to put together a system as capable as Almond+. But that system would comprise several boxes criss-crossed by a rat's nest of wires. Not only would it be messy, but the integration process would be a huge headache for most customers.\nOn top of integrating all these technologies, we also wanted to make Almond+ very affordable. In the last one year, we went through many hardware and mechanical prototypes to optimize our design and cost.\nForget about the touchscreen, forget about home automation and forget about 802.11ac, you can\u2019t find a decent dual band wireless N router for $99 today\nDo more with less.\nComparison of key specifications with other Routers and smart home hubs\nCurrent Software Status\nAs you can see in our CES demo, we have the basic Home Automation functionality working with some sensors. We currently have a basic working UI on the router and the iPhone App. We have yet to start the Android App. Also the UI is not very refined and there are some bugs in our current software. We will be working on improving the UI, bug fixes and additional features in the coming months. Expect to see more videos as we make progress here.\nHardware Production Plan\nWe have gone through 3 mechanical designs and more than 5 PCB versions to date and are quite comfortable with where we are in the design cycle. Over 90% of the suppliers for Almond+ are the same suppliers behind the original Almond that has been in production for a few months. Most of our suppliers have their factories in Taiwan and China. The OEM factory where we plan to assemble Almond+ also makes WiFi Routers for well-known brands and has monthly manufacturing capacity of over 400,000 routers. We expect to finish Mechanical Tooling by April, Certification by May. Production will start with small quantities in July and ramp up in August.\nStages of Almond+ Design\nWhat is 802.11ac\n802.11ac is the latest WiFi standard that provides Gigabit Wireless speeds for the first time. It is also referred to as fifth-generation 5G WiFi. Its about 4x faster than the currently prevalent 802.11n standard.\nIt is still 100% backwards compatible with older 11a/b/g/n devices. So all your existing WiFi enabled devices will still work with Almond+\nZ-Wave Options\nIt seems Z-Wave is a source of much confusion so we will list all the key information about it in one place\nWe cannot integrate all the bands (US, Europe, AU/NZ/HK) into a single unit. This problem is due to the chipset vendor and is out of our control\nSo you will only get one of the 3 versions\nWe will ship US, Canada, Mexico backers the Z-Wave US version\nWe will ship AU/NZ/HK backers the Z-Wave AU/NZ/HK version if we get atleast 500 backers for this version. Otherwise these backers will receive Z-Wave EU version\nWe will ship the rest of the world (Europe included) Z-Wave EU version\nWe want to emphasize again that WiFi and ZigBee do not have such tricky compatibility issues.\nRouter Features\nControl settings through Touchscreen or Web Interface\nGateway, Bridge, Access Point and Range Extender Modes\n2.4GHz + 5GHz or 2.4GHz Only or 5GHz only\nWireless Security - Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA/WPA2-Enterprise\nMultiple SSIDs upto 4 per each band\nVLANs, Port Forwarding, Port Filtering, Firewall, DMZ, QOS\nVPN, Samba Server (USB Storage/Printers)\nDLNA Streaming, UPnP\nUpgrade firmware without needing a PC or Mac\nAlmond+ : Future Proof Specifications\nIts very likely that the next generation computing devices such as iPhone 6, Galaxy S4, iPad 5, etc. will support the faster 802.11ac WiFi. With Almond+ you will be fully equipped to enjoy the faster speeds that come with these devices. Below are the other key specs\n802.11ac + n Dual Band Concurrent\n2.4GHz 2x2 MIMO - 300Mbps\n5GHz 2x2 MIMO - 867 Mbps\n1+4 Gigabit Ethernet Ports\n1 USB 2.0\nZigBee (2.4GHz) <-- Compatible Worldwide\nZ-Wave US, Canada, Mexico (908.42 MHz)\nZ-Wave Europe (868.42 MHz)\nZ-Wave Australia, New Zealand and Hong Kong (919.82/921.42MHz)\n620MHz Processor\n128MB RAM\nLinux 2.6.30\n2.8\u201d TFT Touchscreen\nSpread the word\nRT @Securifi #AlmondPlus\nFollow us on Twitter @Securifi", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDesign: We've iterated Almond+'s design multiple times and solved most of its mechanical and electrical issues. We expect to have 1 to 2 more design iterations before going into production to get the best possible yields.\n\nManufacturing: We've chosen a manufacturer that has a proven track record with top consumer electronics and networking brands and feel strongly we can handle a large initial order without encountering delays.\n\nSupply Chain: Almond+ shares a lot of the components and suppliers used in the original Almond. Our core team has been working with hardware suppliers in Taiwan for many years. During the prototype development we already finalized all of the suppliers and components.\n\nConclusion: During the design and manufacturing of the original Almond, we learned a great deal about all the things that can go wrong in a highly integrated product. The same team that worked on Almond is now working on Almond+ and we feel confident we can deliver the product on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "What\u2019s coming and a special pre-order discount", "update_content": "What to expect in the next 2-3 months \n Inasmuch as we\u2019d hoped to have some really good news to share with you by now, there are still many things that we\u2019ve promised that hasn\u2019t been delivered.

Headknife is a one-man operation running out of my home studio in San Jose, California. All products are handmade, by me, using American sourced leather and hardware.\nI've always thought leather was cool, but it wasn't until I came across some amazing leather masks at an art fair that I wanted to try working with it myself. I never did get into making masks, but I did start making practical items for my family and friends. Eventually friends of friends and strangers starting seeing the goods and asked where they could get their own.\nThe Project\nI want to offer the highest quality product that I can, and that means using the highest quality materials. In order to buy the types of leathers I want to use in Headknife's product I need to meet minimum quantity requirements from the tanneries.  With the funds from Kickstarter I'll be able to do a couple of things:\nFirst and foremost, I'll be able to order a custom run of leather from Horween Leather Company in Chicago for several types of leather in different colors and thicknesses. This order should supply me with enough leather for about 6 months.\n\nAny money remaining will go towards a foot press (which will allow me to quickly and accurately punch holes, place rivets, etc) and various cutting dies to ensure consistent quality in the goods I'm producing.\nRewards\nHandwritten Thanks + Patch\nSlim Single and Double-Wrap Bracelet\nKey Carry Lanyard\nCard Wallet\nCustom Belt\nBoneca Hip Bag\nNatural veg tan starts out beige, but ages to a rich caramel with time and use.\nThanks!\nThanks to everyone to who dedicated their time, energy and good mojo towards helping me get this up and running!\nSpecial thanks to:\nMikul Eriksson and crew for helping me make an awesome video.\nMatt, Kristina, Tasha, Filipe, and a bunch of other folks for user testing the goods for months.\nChris and Kristyn for letting me take pictures of them for this project.\nBelinda for her support, encouragement and putting up with me when I just want to talk about leather stuff while we're having dinner.\nAND YOU, THE KICKSTARTER BACKERS WHO MAKE THIS EVEN POSSIBLE!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "A Long Overdue Update", "update_content": "Hello gang,\nIt's been a long time since I last updated y'all on what's going on.

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults.

This level of support is just mind-blowing.\nUpdate #4 is up.\n** stretch #1 already met: Silicone cap added\n** stretch #2 already met: Rare Tea Cellar sample\n** stretch #3 already met: The big one! Set of custom glasses at $300k\n** please read our full update page here\nThe Porthole is a simple, beautiful infusion vessel designed by Martin Kastner of Crucial Detail design studio. The Porthole can be used to create striking cocktails, oils, teas, dressings, lemonade, coffee, or any other type of infusion.  \nNick's Lemonade\nThe Story:\nThe idea for the Porthole was born during a conversation with bar chefs preparing for the opening of the Aviary. We were discussing \"fast infusions\" -- cocktails evolving during the course of the time it takes to serve them -- and it occurred to me that what we're really looking for is a window into another world, space, and time. An image of the submarine porthole in Karel Zeman's 1958 movie 'The Fabulous World of Jules Verne' came to my mind and the design direction was set.\nSubmarine Porthole in The Fabulous World of Jules Verne.\nA small batch of the Porthole vessels was hand-crafted at Crucial Detail design studio. At the Aviary, it is used to create, display, and serve a variety of time-lapse infusions for seasonal cocktails. \nTequila Ginger Apricot cocktail at the Aviary.\nSince its debut a little over a year ago, the Porthole has gained significant attention.  Aviary cocktails displayed in the Porthole have been featured in dozens of magazines and blogs, including the cover of Food Arts magazine. \nMany Aviary guests have requested to purchase the vessel, including some who, when told they couldn't buy one, have taken it upon themselves to \u2018liberate\u2019 them from the lounge. That's when I realized that the design and functionality of the Porthole resonates strongly with people. The enthusiastic response to the piece has driven our decision to adopt the Porthole for production. \nAdaptation:\nThe technology used to produce the original small batch revolved around our in-house capabilities, utilizing methods suitable for small-scale production. The cost of each unit in the initial batch was over four hundred dollars. In order to make the Porthole more accessible, we have sought higher volume manufacturing technologies and have completely redesigned the components to achieve our target price of less than $100 dollars. The finished Porthole is dishwasher safe, durable, and easy to use. We have gone through a rigorous manufacturer selection process and identified a partner with the capacity and experience to produce the Porthole to our high standards.\nWe are now ready to pull the trigger. We've gone a long way towards our goal of bringing the project to life outside the Aviary but we're still facing a $ 28,500 investment for molds, first batch manufacturing, and associated expenses. By pre-ordering your Porthole, you help us get it off the ground.\nPlease check out the backer rewards on the right and help us make it possible to bring this artful service piece to your home.\nSpecs:\nThe Porthole holds 390ml (13 fl oz) of liquid.\nIt is made of precision ground and tempered Low Iron Glass, food grade Delrin,  food grade Silicone, and Stainless Steel.\nWhat is Included:\nOne Porthole.\nThree photo-etched stainless steel filter screens of varying densities.\nOne flexible silicone cap to seal the contents for longer term infusions.\nA set of thumbscrews that can be used as an alternative to the countersunk screws for faster assembly.\nPorthole use tips:\nThank you!\nMartin Kastner and the Crucial Detail team\nSpecial Thanks:  Lara Kastner, Grant Achatz, Nick Kokonas, Micah Melton, Christian Seel, and everyone at the Aviary in Chicago.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays!", "update_content": "Hi everyone.\nI hope you\u2019re enjoying your Portholes.

With an incredibly wide field of view, high resolution display, and ultra-low latency head tracking, the Rift provides a truly immersive experience that allows you to step inside your favorite game and explore new worlds like never before.\n\nWe're here raising money on Kickstarter to build development kits of the Rift, so we can get them into the hands of developers faster.

We hope you share our excitement about virtual reality, the Rift, and the future of gaming.  \nDesigned for gamers, by gamers.\nThe Rift takes 3D gaming to the next level. There are a number of VR headsets out there, but none that deliver a truly immersive gaming experience. Most products either lack the technical features required for believable immersion or sit at a very high price-point ($20,000+) reserved for the military or scientific community. \nWe set out to change all that with the Rift, which is designed to maximize immersion, comfort, and pure, uninhibited fun, at a price everyone can afford. \nWe\u2019re working with the best teams in the industry.\n\"What I've got now, is, I honestly think the best VR demo probably the world has ever seen.\"\nJohn Carmack, id Software\n\"Needless to say, I'm a believer...

You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others.

All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too.

We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty).

What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA.

Well, partially because they just aren\u2019t attractive enough to leave out in the open. That is, unless you\u2019ve got a Trioh!.\"\nKEEP YOUR FLASHLIGHT WHERE YOU CAN SEE IT\nIf you\u2019re like most people, you keep your flashlight hidden away. Maybe it\u2019s in a drawer, or a toolbox, or under the bed. The Trioh! was born out of the thinking that if flashlights were simply more attractive, then they might be kept out in the open where they would be more accessible when you need them. Like when the power goes out.\nThe Trioh! is designed to be displayed making it instantly more useful. No more searching for the flashlight when you need it.\nThe Trioh! consists of a flashlight and a charging base. Together, they look great anywhere in your home. You\u2019ll always have a place for your flashlight, and you\u2019ll know right where it is.\nAnd because you keep the base plugged into an outlet, the Trioh! will always be fully charged when you need it.\n3 Lights in 1\nFlashlight\nSimply remove the Trioh! from its base any time you need a flashlight. With three super-bright LEDs, the Trioh! will light the way.\nAccent Light\nWith a twist of the lens, all the light is contained in the diffuser and the Trioh! becomes a beautiful, accent light on or off the base.\nEmergency Light\nWhen the power goes out, the Trioh! automatically turns on. No more fumbling in the dark to find your flashlight.\nBattery Life\nThe rechargeable batteries provide over 12 hours of battery life with constant use.\nIn emergency mode, the light will pulse so that it will last for up to 3 days. Just in case it goes off when you're not at home.\nBasic Specs\nColor: Silver with white accents\nSize: 10.6\" Tall, 4.5\" wide (diameter)\nLight source: 3 LEDs\nMaterial: Plastic\nBattery: Rechargeable Lithium Ion, not-intended to be replaced\nCharging: Inductive charging - no exposed connectors\nPower: External adapter, 110/220v, with North American plug (included)\nPatent Pending\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe process of designing, prototyping and getting the product just right took a lot of time and effort and required more funds than anticipated. I have made the initial investment in the tooling and find myself short of the funds needed to finish the project. So I am reaching out to the Kickstarter community for help. The funds raised will be used to complete the tooling investment and place the initial order from the factory.\nManufacturing\nThe product is being produced in China.

Highest quality ingredients for SUPERIOR COMFORT and DURABILITY\n2. 100% Made in America - SUPPORTS USA ECONOMY\n3. Fairly priced\n... help support by making this your next pair of underwear today.\n\n\nHey Kickstarter,\nThanks for checking out my project.\n\nIt\u2019s been a wild ride, starting with my noticing that all of the underwear currently on sale at major department stores comes from other countries\u2026 and the vast majority is made with poor materials.\n\nBefore I knew it \u2013 and without much prior-knowledge \u2013 I was trying to find a US factory to make the superior product I had in mind. So far, so good. \nI've got the designs, sourced the fabrics and findings, and found a factory that needs this product as much as I need them... I just need $30,000 to get it going. \nPlease support at whatever level you're comfortable with. We'll pay you back with some really fantastic underwear, crafted for comfort with super-high quality materials you\u2019re going to love. If you\u2019ve got the time though, be sure to read the info below as well, it\u2019s wordy but worth it.\nReady for the best bit? Beyond this opening order, for every 1000 pair we sell per month, 1 full-time job is literally added back to the assembly line. Amazing, right?\nThanks for your support. - Jake\nAND NOW, A LAST MINUTE EDITION: We've added shirts to our line.\nYou asked for it, you got it! Flint and Tinder 100% Supima cotton, double soft-washed, Tagless Tees in two great styles: V-Neck and Crew Neck. Comparable shirts retail from $45 to $85, and go up from there. PLEASE NOTE: Shirts only come in white at this time. They're coming in the same S, M, L, XL, and XXL as the undies (even larger sizes to follow soon after our proper launch).\nA few questions you're likely to ask... \nWhat makes this underwear better than the other stuff out there? \nWe started with the highest quality materials for an unbelievable level of comfort, then spared no expense making sure the construction was built to last.\nThe goal is that, from the minute you first put them on through a lifetime of washing, you can feel the difference. That they were made in America should be the icing on the cake.\nPIMA cotton vs SUPIMA cotton; What\u2019s the difference there? \nPIMA cotton is some of the finest cotton on earth. It has extremely long, silky fibers that when properly spun produce a breathable, soft yet durable yarn. But garments labeled PIMA are known to have as little as 5% PIMA, with the remainder of the fibers coming from lesser, easier to produce cotton strains.\nSUPIMA is a trademarked term referring only to American gown PIMA cotton. Using this term requires a license in which the governing body, which closely monitors and licenses every step of the process, certifies that 100% of the cotton used is SUPIMA.\nFlint and Tinder only uses SUPIMA cotton.\nLets talk design... \nYes, lets. We started by incorporating every feature you\u2019d find on the most expensive pairs of underwear. With each prototype, we stripped away a little bit more, until we were left with a perfectly balanced garment; Simple in design, rugged in construction, refined in our selection of top-notch materials.\nWhere does the underwear I\u2019m wearing right now come from? \nHard to say without looking at your tag (even a single brand often manufactures in several different countries). Of the underwear available on shelves in Manhattan, here\u2019s what some of their tags say:\n2(x)Ist \u2014 Thailand\nA/X \u2014 Peru\nAdidas \u2014 Indonesia\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters \u2014 Macao\nBanana Republic \u2014 Indonesia\nBoss Orange \u2014 Egypt\nBrooks Brothers \u2014 Thailand\nBVD \u2014 El Salvador\nCalvin Klein \u2014 Vietnam\nClayborne \u2014 Pakistan\nDavid Beckham/H&M \u2014 Cambodia\nDiesel \u2014 China\nEmporio Armani \u2014 Thailand\nFruit of the Loom \u2014 Vietnam\nGap \u2014 Indonesia\nHanes \u2014 India\nHugo Boss \u2014 China\nIzod \u2014 China\nJ. Crew \u2014 China\nJockey \u2014 India\nJoe Boxer \u2014 China\nKenneth Cole \u2014 Thailand\nOld Navy \u2014 India\nPact \u2014 Turkey\nPolo / Ralph Lauren \u2014 El Salvador\nStafford \u2014 Thailand\nTommy Hilfiger \u2014 Indonesia\nUnder Armor \u2014 Cambodia\nUniqulo \u2014 China\nWrangler \u2014 China\netc. etc. etc. Only one comes from the US\u2013 American Apparel, but it's not hugely comfortable, isn't made of premium materials, and falls apart in the dryer over time.\nWill buying Flint and Tinder create American jobs? \nYou bet your ass it will! And not in some vague way either\u2026\nThe factory I'm working with is family owned and operated. It\u2019s over 100 years old. Just before the recession hit, they moved into a larger facility and invested in some of the capital improvements shown in the video (solar power etc.).\nAt that time they had 300+ employees and were hoping to double or triple in size. When we started this project however, with the economy in free-fall, they were down to just 90.\nThey\u2019ve agreed to learn to make this new, high-end brand of American-made underwear. Here\u2019s the fun part though: For every 1000 pair we sell per month, 1 full-time job has to be added back to the assembly line. Hopefully, with your support, it will help them keep the doors open.\nWait, how can you make a product here in the US (where labor costs are higher), using better materials, and still charge a competitive price?\nGreat question. It\u2019s hard, but not impossible.\n1\u2014Flint and Tinder will sell direct to consumers through our own website. This will avoid the 100% mark-up most stores add to products.\n 2\u2014The next stop is wholesale, but with almost no mark-up on our end, making the final retail price about the same as what we sell them for online. Why would we sell our product in a way that lets stores profit while hardly making anything on the deal ourselves? Simple: It\u2019s going to allow us to create an American alternative that sits on shelves right next to it\u2019s foreign-born competitors at a competitive price. Doing this supports our manufacturing partners (as they\u2019ll get to make more underwear), but it\u2019s also good marketing since many customers  like touching products in a retail environment that they later order from the web (meaning we\u2019ll get to sell more underwear online too).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Meet the next big thing - WHISTLER!", "update_content": "Anyone who's smelled Flint and Tinder's Campfire and Cut Grass soap will recognize the fragrance.

If you need more detailed lists of each reward level, see Update 26.\nOgre was the first game I ever designed. It came out in 1977! It\u2019s been out of print for years, except for the miniatures rules. I\u2019m constantly getting requests to bring it back, and in 2008 we started working on a new edition . . . a \u201cdesigner\u2019s edition\u201d that would be as big and beautiful as any wargame you\u2019ve ever seen.\nEven as planned right now, the game is huge. The current prototype weighs 14 pounds! There are three huge maps - one 17\" x 21\" Ogre map and two geomorphic two-sided G.E.V./Shockwave maps. The hexes are 1.5\" across, with counters to fit. And the Ogre and building counters are 3-D models made of heavy cardstock. There are already about 40 square feet of chipboard in this game.\nWe couldn\u2019t sell this for $100 if it weren\u2019t for the cash that Munchkin has brought in (thank you, Munchkin). But it\u2019s something I want to do.\nWhy are we using Kickstarter, when we had decided to do the project no matter what? Three reasons:\n- First, our margin on this game is low, so we had to be conservative in our plans. We couldn\u2019t put a 10-year supply in the warehouse. We were going to print only 3,000, which is the absolute minimum we were sure of selling in a year or so. There would probably not have been expansion sets, or even a reprint. Something that\u2019s expensive to do at 3,000 units is impossible at 1,000!\nBut with Kickstarter, we can reach a lot of people quickly, and gauge our support. If the initial print run can be bigger, fine! If the gamers show that they want an expansion set later, then I get to do it! (Edit: And they did. And I will!)\n- Second, because I got literally hundreds of requests to pre-order the game, and we don\u2019t do pre-orders. When we get our new shopping cart set up, sure . . . but that won\u2019t be any time soon. By using Kickstarter, we get a pre-order system automatically. And, because so many people said they wanted more than one copy, we\u2019re offering options for two and even three.\n- Third, because with Kickstarter we can have stretch goals, which will let us add more components and improve the ones that are already there. (Edit: And boy, oh, boy, did THAT work out well!)\nThe $200,000 stretch goal is the one that excites me the most, because that\u2019s the level where we can afford to turn the two two-sided maps into four one-sided maps. That doubles the potential play area. (Edit: DONE!)\nOur actual funding goal was low - only $20,000. We're long past that now!\nAnd some of the support levels are intended to let the gamers get into the game. Everybody who buys a game on Kickstarter will be acknowledged both on our website and on the box. At higher levels, you can put your initials on an Ogre, get painted into an illustration, or even get your own custom counter sheet. (Edit: Those have all been taken . . . sorry . . .)\nSo please support us. Help us show that classic wargames aren\u2019t dead. And remember the guys you played Ogre with in high school or college? Let them know so they can reserve a copy too. Spread the word!\nThank you. It means a lot to me to be able to do this, and with your help, I can.\n- Steve Jackson\nUPDATES!

It will go through your national customs and then, for good or ill, into the hands of your national postal system. This is \u201cUS Priority Mail.\"\nNote that a medium box is definitely bigger than two smalls, and a large is definitely bigger than a small and a medium, but two mediums are bigger than a large.\nBe sure to read the \u201csubstitutions\u201d note after the Large Box listing. Sorry this is so Byzantine. Maybe we\u2019ll find a way to make the next one better. In the meantime, do your best to calculate, and we\u2019ll do our best to hold up our end.\nInternational Shipping: Small Box\n         Canada/Mexico: $13. Everywhere else: $15. (You are not losing your mind; that number was $17 until it was pointed out that $17 represented an increase from the earlier rate for the smallest possible international \"extras\" order.) Untrackable and uninsurable. We will not send this size box to Brazil.\n         Can hold: One shirt plus a couple of dice sets or pins, OR five sets of dice or pins. Maybe more, but let\u2019s not promise more than five. This is a little box, so a counter sheet will not fit at all.\nNOTE: If you order a game from outside the US, and the only extras you order are pins, dice, and the Ogre Supporter T-shirt, and we can get your stuff into a Small flat rate box, shipping is FREE. The extras do have to be a separate shipment; we can\u2019t get them into the carton with the game, but we won\u2019t charge for that shipment.\nInternational Shipping: Medium Box (shipping prices now reduced)\n         Canada/Mexico: $23. Everywhere else: $38. Trackable (if the USPS employees enter the info) and insured \u201cup to $100\u201d by the USPS (with some weasel words, and some online comments indicate that collecting a claim is not always easy). Here\u2019s their info page: https://www.usps.com/business/priority-mail-international-flat-rate-for-business.htm\n         Can hold: One Giant Battlefield Set or Tournament Ogre Package plus 4 shirts and a couple of dice or pin sets, OR seven shirts plus a dice or pin set.\nInternational Shipping: Large Box (shipping prices now reduced)\n         Canada/Mexico: $30. Everywhere else: $51. See tracking and insurance notes for the medium box.\n         Can hold: Two sets of maps (Giant Battlefield Set or Tournament Ogre Package) plus five shirts, OR one set of maps and six shirts, OR 12 shirts.\n         OR this box can hold a single Ogre Canvas Bag, 2 shirts, and a few patches.\nSubstitutions in Medium/Large Boxes (much updated)\n         We hope these are conservative estimates:\n      We are now willing to say that one Extra Counter Set, including the Kickstarter extra counters, can replace one set of maps.\n         A classic counter set would replace one shirt, perhaps leaving a bit of slack.\n         Extra Kickstarter counter sheets are skinny, so figure that three of them would replace one shirt. Luckily, we have three to offer.\n      A couple of dice or pin sets would replace one shirt.\n      A woodkit set would replace two shirts.\n     Four shotglasses would replace a shirt. Fewer than four should also be treated as replacing a shirt, to be safe.\n    A hat would replace a shirt.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$40,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  Build your own Ogres! We have posted blank 3-D designs online for the Mk III and Mk V, so you can cut out, color, and assemble your own, assuming you have the right tools and/or inhuman patience. Here's the PDF with line art, here's the completely blank \"platform toy\" version, and here's the \u201cHow To Build An Ogre\u201d video. Send us pictures of what you do! ogrepix.sjgames.com\n$75,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Thanks to everyone who voted in the survey to choose the contents of this sheet. Another bonus! We will create a big Exclusive Kickstarter Counter Sheet and add it FREE to every Ogre game ordered through Kickstarter. A double chipboard sheet (about 10\" x 16\") of 3-D counters, including a lot more buildings and one each Ogre Mk III and Mk V with graphics exclusive to Kickstarter supporters. The survey decided: The buildings will include a nuclear reactor and a lot of other things to shoot at, and the Ogres will be green. We call this sheet \"Targets Go Boom!\"\n$90,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Steve started working on the new scenarios last night . . . Four new Ogre scenarios designed by Steve Jackson will be posted to the SJ Games website: one each week during the month of November (the game\u2019s release month). At least one of these will play off of something new introduced on the $75K counter sheet.\n$100,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! A bonus for everyone! We will include the Ogre blueprint poster in every copy of the game, and we\u2019ll announce at least one more stretch goal.\n$110,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Targets for your homemade Ogres! We'll post blank 3-D outlines for the Command Post, Laser, and Laser Tower, so your custom Ogres can have custom targets. And here they are. With line art: http://sjgames.com/ogre/img/ogre-pob-lineart.pdf. Without line art: http://sjgames.com/ogre/img/ogre-pob-noart.pdf.\n$120,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! We'll post some pictures of acrylic vs. urea so you can see the difference you made. At this level, the game dice get much nicer for everyone. Instead of using the standard die material, urea (which is available in only a few standard colors), we will order a mold suitable for acrylic dice. This will increase our die cost, but we will be able to create the dice in many more (and cooler) colors, forever.\n$130,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! You have totally proved to everyone that Steve can spend more time on Ogre. Steve is happy! Four more Ogre scenarios by Steve Jackson will be posted during December 2012.\n$140,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! And Steve was up late last night drawing overlays in his head. Now to find some paper . . . At this level, your game gets heavier (again). A new full-sized (not the 8\" x 10\" we first offered at this level) sheet of terrain overlays will be created and added FREE to every copy of Ogre.\n$150,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Now Phil has to schedule that container! Your support has earned you an early release for YOUR copies. At this point, we will have enough Kickstarter copies to fill a 40-foot container. So . . . that container will be the first one shipped out, and Kickstarter copies will start shipping two weeks before the regular release date.\n$175,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  Phil, go to China, please, and talk to the factory! You have made the dice bigger as well as shinier. Instead of the standard 16mm dice in the original budget, we\u2019ll go up to 19mm. And, of course, they\u2019ll still be acrylic.\n$200,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! Now we need to figure out what that did to box weight! You have made the game MUCH better for everyone! Instead of two double-sided maps, every copy of the game will include four single-sided maps. You will be able to use all four maps in a single game if you want to! Yes, print costs just went up a lot, but so did the awesomeness of the game, and your support made that possible.\n$250,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! This is the level at which we use two containers! One 20-ft and one 40-ft container of games will come to Austin . . . and these will ship one month earlier than the distribution copies.\n$300,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! We are now committed to releasing an Ogre computer game, for some platform or platforms, by the end of 2014. It might very well be a lot sooner. This is totally separate from the record sheet app, which will be free and come out before the boardgame ships. This is not an addition to any current reward levels - this is just something that your support and feedback has convinced us to do.\n$325,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  We will release an Ogre expansion set late in 2013, with new units and at least one map. The pricing and contents will be determined by survey. Mmmm, surrrrrvey.\n$350,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  - We will add a new 11.5 x 17.625\u201d Kickstarter-exclusive sheet containing either more 3-D units, or more 2-D units and/or overlays. (To avoid increasing weight, we have canceled the one unsold $3,000 custom counter sheet.) We will survey to see what YOU find most interesting, and the survey includes requests we have had in comments, such as \u201cFlat Ogres\u201d and \u201cOld-style square B&W counters.\u201d\n    We have had a number of requests for duplicates of the extra overlay sheet that was the $140,000 goal. So, having hit $350K, we will also \u201cunlock\u201d that sheet, print more copies, and put it in every set sold -- and we will offer it in W23 so you can buy individual extras. This means that the supporters' exclusive sheet will be one YOU voted on, instead of the one I had made up. But everyone still gets the one I made up . . .\n$375,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Translation! This goal is in honor of our Eurogamer supporters. We will make the rules and scenario book available, in PDF form, in one other language. The new survey lists ten languages where we know we will find a lot of gamers. Update: The survey is over. A translation will be released in German.\n$400,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  - Pocket Ogre! By popular demand, a new \u201cmini\u201d edition of Ogre that will look a whole lot like the very first edition. We will send a copy to everyone who pledges $150 or over, regardless of what that support consists of - so Canadian and overseas supporters will automatically get one to say \u201cthanks for paying all that postage\u201d. This edition will eventually be sold in regular distribution, but not until the summer of 2013, so supporters can gloat over it for a whole year.\n$425,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  More Tom Smith music! At least 30 minutes, with several different tracks: we\u2019re talking about themes for the GEVs, the infantry, and so on. We\u2019ll offer this as a free download to everyone who sponsors at the $25 level and above. (There may be a ringtone in there, too . . .)\n$450,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Okay! Somehow, some way, we WILL bring back the Ogre miniatures (and not just the Ogres themselves, but the whole line). Maybe resin, maybe metal. I have already gotten some interesting responses from custom casters.\n$475,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will run a scenario contest, pick at least four winners based on fun and balance, tweak them if required, and put them online. We will also combine them and the previous eight scenarios in a laid-out color PDF and make that file available (probably by DropBox) to everyone who supported at $25 or above.\n$500,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Classic counters. Okay. We said we would never do these. You changed our minds. They will be available as an extra and in Warehouse 23.\n$525,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will replace the cardboard \"Ogre garage\" in the box with a heavy-duty vacuum-molded piece. More expensive, but you've told us you want it. To anticipate questions: We can probably order extras of these for W23, but not as part of Kickstarter. And they will not have separate lids, because really, the Ogres should be heavy enough that they won't just jump out.\n$550,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will start interviewing for a full-time Ogre line editor in the Austin office, because it looks like this game is back for the long haul.\n$575,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will put Ogre Miniatures, 2nd Edition on the schedule for late 2013, as both hardcopy and PDF. It will incorporate the material in the \"update\" PDF now available, as well as whatever gets developed as we work on Ogre over the next year. There will be new photos and new graphics. Good thing we will have a Line Editor!\n$600,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - I will come to at least two major summer/fall game conventions in 2013 (which ones? Still to be determined). The point is that at those conventions I will make Ogre my main focus, rather than That Card Game. I will run Ogre events, blow up your CP, and discuss what will be in the next supplement(s).\n$601,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - New unit added! For those who weren't excited by the convention goal above, here's a goal that specifically improves the set for all KS supporters. I will add the Heavy Weapon Team unit type to one of the Kickstarter exclusive sheets. Some counter sponsors want to put them on their sheets, too. This will be an improved (both clearer and more flexible) version of a unit that appeared only in Ogre Miniatures. Rules will be online, so as not to make the purchasers of regular editions go crazy looking for a counter that is not in the set.\n$650,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - We will do some kind of special launch event in Austin. It may be a simple, free open house where you can pick up your game and get it signed. Or it may be a mini-convention with food, events, special giveaways, maybe a GoH. If it\u2019s a convention, there will be a cost to attend, but we will not offer the memberships through Kickstarter, as there is absolutely no time to sort out details or set a reasonable fee. I guess I should surrrrrrrrrvey to find out what you prefer.   (Edit: Enough of you like this idea that we like it too and hope to do it, but many commented that since they don't live close it's a meaningless goal. Hmm. Lesson learned. So see the goal below.)\n\n$651,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Two more new units added! I will add (a few) Engineers to one of the Kickstarter exclusive sheets, plus a Vulcan. The Vulcan will be flat, matching the scale of the sheet of flat Ogres provided by supporter Michael Johnson - thanks, Michael! Preliminary rules for Engineers and Vulcans, developed from Ogre Miniatures, will go online when the set is shipped to you, and your reactions to those rules will shape the final version of the Engineers/Vulcans supplement . . . if and when you choose that as a release. Surrrrrrveys will continnnnnnue.\n\n$700,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Drive Offensively! We will launch a Kickstarter project for Car Wars! We *think* this will turn out to be a refinement of Car Wars Compendium 2.5, but you'll tell us. Our supporters at the [new] $23 level and higher will be invited to join an exclusive Car Wars forum, where we\u2019ll build the new edition from the ground up - issues like \"which classic cover do we use?,\" \"10 phase, 5 phase, or 3 phase movement?,\" and \"do we include boats?\" Once the project launches, surveys will be open to the public, but only supporters of the current project will get in on the preliminary planning. And we'll take everything we have learned from our Ogre Kickstarter project to make the Car Wars project even better. If we make this goal, the private Car Wars forum and surveys will launch before the end of 2012. The game will be published in late 2013.\n    (PS #1 - And we will add staff as necessary to make sure that the Car Wars and Ogre projects don\u2019t compete for attention!)\n    (PS #2 - To make sure this is clear: Supporters of Ogre are not receiving a copy of the new Car Wars. You\u2019re just making us DO it. Thank you . . . we think!)\n\n$750,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED! - Say thank you to the Car Wars fans, because they helped us to this probably-final goal for Ogre. Because you asked for this the most: we will cram one more exclusive Kickstarter sheet into your box. If it drives up shipping, we\u2019ll eat the cost. Contents will be determined by surrrrvey (one option will be a 3-D Vulcan), and when we post it we\u2019ll give you as much info as much as possible about the already-planned sheets so you know what you are already getting. That surrrrrrrrrrrvey will be posted AFTER the campaign ends - this page will still be here and we will keep updating!\n$782,000 - GOAL ACHIEVED!  We have regained first place for Board/Card Game Funding. There was whooping and hollering. A video will be posted.\nSince you are being excellent to us, we will continue to be excellent to you in whatever ways we can - and we have already found a couple of ways to improve the project further - but there will be no more specific stretch goals. Support as you wish, tell your friends while there's still time, and it ends where it ends. This has been an incredibly successful campaign.

It's as Easy as Downloading an App.\nPebble is the first watch built for the 21st century. It's infinitely customizable, with beautiful downloadable watchfaces and useful internet-connected apps. Pebble connects to iPhone and Android smartphones using Bluetooth, alerting you with a silent vibration to incoming calls, emails and messages. While designing Pebble, we strove to create a minimalist yet fashionable product that seamlessly blends into everyday life. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH APPS\nApps bring Pebble to life. We're building some amazing apps for Pebble. Cyclists can use Pebble as a bike computer, accessing the GPS on your smartphone to display speed, distance and pace data. Runners get a similar set of data displayed on their wrist. Use the music control app to play, pause or skip tracks on your phone with the touch of a button. Don't worry about the rain, Pebble is water-resistant! If you're a golfer, feel free to bring Pebble onto the course. We're working with Freecaddie to create a great golf rangefinder app for Pebble that works on over 25,000 courses world-wide. Instead of using your phone, view your current distance to the green right on your wrist. These apps will be the first, with more in the works!  \nCUSTOMIZE WITH WATCHFACES\nPebble can change instantly, thanks to its brilliant, outdoor-readable electronic-paper (e-paper) display. We've designed tons of watchfaces already, with more coming every day. Choose your favourite watchfaces using Pebble's iPhone or Android app. Then as the day progresses, effortlessly switch to the one that matches your mood, activity or outfit. \nCUSTOMIZE WITH NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you need to stay on top of things, Pebble can help with vibrating notifications, messages and alerts. Dismiss a notification with a shake of your wrist. Don't worry, it's easy to disable all notifications.\nIncoming Caller ID\nEmail (Gmail or any IMAP email account)\nCalendar Alerts\nFacebook Messages\nTwitter\nWeather Alerts\nSilent vibrating alarm and timer\nAndroid users can also receive Text Messages (SMS) on their Pebble. Unfortunately iPhone does not expose this data. Have any suggestions for other notification types? Leave us a message in the comments! \nCUSTOMIZE BY CODING\nWant your watch to tell you when your next bus is leaving? Maybe you're jonesing to see your compile status or recent github commits.. Think push notifications, directly to your watch using the data connection on your phone. Want to check-in on your watch, or create an app that can monitor your sleep? Pebble can send data from the accelerometer and buttons back up to the internet. \nPebble can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web-facing RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Pebble SDK, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain full control of the watch. Multiple apps can run on Pebble, along side watchfaces and regular notifications.\nLoad apps using Bluetooth \n144 x 168 pixel display black and white e-paper\nBluetooth 2.1+ EDR and 4.0 (Low Energy)\n4 buttons\nVibrating motor\n3 axis accelerometer with gesture detection\nDistribute apps via Pebble watchapp store\nDetailed SDK specs are available on our Pebble Dev Blog.\nHow does it work?\nPebble connects by Bluetooth to your iPhone or Android device. Setting up Pebble is as easy as downloading the Pebble app onto your phone. All software updates are wirelessly transmitted to your Pebble.\nCompatibility\niPhone 3GS, 4, 4S running iOS 5 or any iPod Touch with iOS 5.\nAndroid devices running OS 2.3 and up. Works great with Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich)!\nUnfortunately Pebble does not work with Blackberry, Windows Phone 7, or Palm phones at this time.\nWhere we're at\nWe\u2019ve been working on smartwatches for over 3 years now. The Pebble that you see in the video is a real, working prototype.\nWith your support, we can bring Pebble onto wrists worldwide. While we're close to entering production, your contribution will help fund:\n- Production tooling\n- Large component order\n- Global Bluetooth certification\nREWARDS\nEach Pebble has a textured plastic case, shatter resistant lens with an anti-reflective optical coating and a custom-designed 22mm rubber strap. You'll also receive a special USB cable that recharges the watch.\nColor Option: Voter's Choice You're part of the design process! Three color options are already set: Arctic White, Jet Black and Cherry Red. If you back any of the color options, we'll email you a survey after the project closes so you can vote on a new, 4th color option. Later on, we'll email you again asking which of the final color options you'd like to select. Even if you don't like the Voter's Choice, you'll be able to choose from Red/White/Black.\n$99 - Early Bird: 200 Black watches available.\n$115 - One Black Pebble.\n$125 - One Color Pebble.\n$220 - Two Black Pebbles.\n$235 - Prototype Pebble for early app development + one Color Pebble.\n$240 - Two Color Pebbles.\n$550 - Five Color Pebbles.\n$1000 - Ten Color Pebbles.\n$1,250 - Custom watchface + five Color Pebbles.\nFAQ\nQ. How long does the battery last?    A. The rechargeable battery keeps Pebble going for 7+ days. \nQ. Does the watch display stay on all the time?    A. Yes. The display shows a watchface at all times.\nQ. Does it have a backlight?    A. Yes, Pebble has a backlight to view the display at night.\nQ. Is it waterproof?    A.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.
