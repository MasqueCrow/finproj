Discover an incredible world, fight against different enemies and create your own adventure, making your own experience. Help the moonwalkers to bring the magic to their universe again.\nPlanned for endings of 2021.\n The Moonwalkers promised to be the keepers and the protectors of the magic. All the portals that bring you to new places have been closed and forgotten into the realm of the moonwalkers; your mission is to visit them, bring your magic to every world and resurrect their essence to keep them alive.\n Kandra, the main character, will be the chosen one to make this happen. Her feathers bring magic and with them you can make the world alive once again, fight against all kinds of dangers and collect all old artifacts to make all this possible.\n Several years ago, the moonwalkers disappeared, taking magic with them. Darkness took place and brought corruption, and then, all portals suddenly closed. But now, your mission is to travel around every universe and bring purity to all this worlds.\n\n\nKandra is the main character, the chosen one. She is a moonwalker, a race of spiritual creatures which are the protectors of the magic.\nBeing really young, she starts this adventure with us, to complete her training and get the knowledge to control the magic power of her feathers.\nAs a moonwalker, she gets her feathers from her spiritual form, always available when she is prepared to attack or wants to fly around this amazing universe.\nSoley is an ancient Moonwalker, older than Kandra. He will be our mentor and will help us discover all dangers and history surrounding us, to have a complete knowledge about what happened while the moonwalkers were away.\nWhile we explore, we will find different characters that will need our help. We will face enemies to protect them or to get items they are in need of, to restore the balance once again on \"Mystic's lake\" lands.\n\nWithout magic, all kinds of dangers appeared, causing troubles and bringing corruption. Our mission is to defeat them and keep our people safe.\nThe prisms are the most valuable object in this universe. With them, you will be able to unlock new paths for your adventure. Find them in every world and collect them!\nThe moonwalker\u2019s feathers have been stolen, all of them are unique and we are in need to find them to recover the magic in our world!\nThose feathers appear from the moonwalker's magic shape. All of them are very important for the moonwalkers. This feathers bring the magic alive and will erase the corruption and darkness created by our enemies.\n\nThose are the gates to brand new areas, find them and expand your horizons in that incredible universe!\nKandra's universe is full of landscapes, sunsets and secret places awaiting for you to step in for the first time in centuries. The moonwalker's lands are alive, with their stories, their people and an ancient knowledge ready to be shared with you if you are ready for it!\n\nEvery corner hides a challenge, every step leads you to a maze, every wonder suits you with a question without an answer, and you must find all the clues to solve it, which are hidden deep within yourself. All worlds have their own puzzles, that will give you the feathers you need to collect.\nFace your enemies with your powers and clean the corruption that has been established.\nAll music in \"Kandra: The Moonwalker\" has been made by ourselves. Each piece is a reflection of Kandra\u00b4s world. We try hard that their melodies were not mere accompanists, but a complement to the story we tell, printing feeling and enriching the player's experience, because Kandra is not just a game, it prettends to settle as a memory of those that you can't stop to remember. Here you have an example, enjoy!\n * All rewards with an asterisk include rewards above, except the reseller's pack.\nAll included in designer's pack will be modified if necessary to be adjusted to the game.\n\nThe current plan is to release Kandra: The Moonwalker for Steam on Windows and Mac platforms first. Searching to expand for consoles.\n            We are planning to launch \"Kandra: The Moonwalker\" in English and Spanish.\n            With time, we are planning to expand this to more languages in the future.\nBased in Spain, our team consist in 15 passionate talents. This include both permanent crew members and collaborators.

The correct phrasing to say the game is included in these tiers is \"as well as the previous rewards\" or \"on top of the previous rewards\". And this phrasing would also mean that the 75 euro also includes the OST. The last thing about the pledges is that you've limited the amount of backers who can get 1 copy of the game.

You wake up on the beach of a foreign island, unable to recall anything. Alone and equipped with only basic farming tools provided by the town residents, you aim to recover your memories. Complete quests and explore Omoide Island as you unfold your story.\nGifted a small and empty plot of land by the mayor, transform and manage the terrain as it blossoms into your own unique farm. From growing crops, planting trees and flowers, and raising your own animals, you are free to choose the life you want.\nBe careful where you plant your crops as certain plants only grow during a particular season!\nCooking\nAs your farm grows, you are sure to harvest plenty of fruits and vegetables. Instead of selling your produce in full, why not save some of those fresh ingredients for yourself? There are many recipes that can be discovered on the island.\nTip: Be sure to restore your stamina by preparing food to take with you for long and busy days!\nMining\nStaying cooped up inside all day can be quite boring, why not go on an adventure to liven your day? Head down to the mines to release some pent up energy and explore a network of secret caves. You may stumble upon precious gems and mine ores which you can utilize to upgrade and improve your tools. If you dare to visit deeper into the mines, you may discover rare resources. What treasures will you bring home?\nFishing\nSome days are meant for hard work while others call for a bit of leisure. What better way to relax than to take your beloved pet out for a fishing trip? Omoide Island has a variety of water sources that yield different fish, so feel free to explore and catch them all! Not only can you enjoy the day fishing, but you can also bring home a freshly-caught dinner. Don\u2019t forget to continuously upgrade your fishing rod to tackle bigger and rarer fish.\nRelationships\nYou don\u2019t have to be isolated on your farm, feel free to speak with and befriend the townsfolk. You may have items to trade with those in town, or perhaps you just wish to visit. Every island resident has a unique personality and carefully tailored backstory - it\u2019s up to you to learn all about them!\nImprove your relationships by completing side quests for your neighbors - you may even fetch a better buying and selling price from them or unlock special rewards. Friendship may even turn into romance when you least expect it.\nQuests\nThe residents of Omoide Island will need help on occasion. If someone is in need, you can view their request on the bulletin board in town or you may receive a letter directly. Don\u2019t worry if you are busy with another task as side quests and missions are optional.\nCurrently, there are two types of quests available: the main quest linked directly to your character\u2019s storyline and optional side quests. The former will lead your character to uncover their forgotten memories and answer the question of what happened before arriving on the island?\nThe latter quests will allow you to improve your relationships and unlock unique items that cannot otherwise be crafted. \nPets\nWhat is life without a furry companion at your side? Pets are, and will always be, your most loyal companions. Explore Omoide Island together, give them endless pets, and play until the sun sets. Your pet, aside from keeping you company, can also assist with farming duties. When exploring more dangerous areas of the island, it may be best to leave your companion at home for their safety. \nPets Currently Available:\nAnimals\nIn addition to planting and managing your crops, you can also raise farm animals. Care for your adorable neighbors with feeding, grooming, cleaning, and - of course - plenty of petting! Your animals love to be showered with affection and, in return, will yield a variety of important resources such as milk, eggs, wool, and feathers.\nIf you have animals of different genders in the same barn or coop, they may even make a family of their own.\nCharacter Customization\nIf you ever feel the need to upgrade your look, spice things up by altering your wardrobe or hair. While your character\u2019s gender is chosen early on in the game, you have the full ability to customize your character by switching hairstyles, eye and skin color, and clothing. Looking for a new outfit? Different clothing can be found all around Omoide Island!\nHome and Base Customization\nOne of the most important places is your home. Your home is where you relax and unwind after a long day\u2019s work. Upgrade your space to have everything from a larger interior to new and decorative furniture. Take it a step further and customize your farm by having full control over barn placement, coops, fences, and more!\nWeather\nOmoide Island will experience four different seasons with each having their own festivals.\nSpring - brings cherry blossoms to the island\nSummer - has plenty of sunshine\nAutumn - leaves change color and fall to the earth\nWinter - soft snow and slick ice\nMain Areas\nYour Farm - this is where you start a new life and, while it may begin with an empty plot of land and a basic home, make it yours!\nOmoide Town - the island\u2019s residents live here. This is where you will handle business transactions.\nThe Forest - has beautiful scenery, including a waterfall. You can complete a variety of activities in this location such as chopping wood, fishing, and foraging for herbs and flowers.\nThe Mountains - uncover cave entrances in this area where you can mine for ores and gems.\nThe Beach - what island is complete without a stunning beach?

We want to be able to grow our team and also convert our part-time team members to full-time. Kickstarter will also bring awareness to the game and help us build a community filled with farm-sim lovers who are passionate in helping with the development process. We would love to add more features and customization options to the game. However, we don't have the resources to pursue these projects, despite having a plethora of ideas. We believe Kickstarter will help us achieve a portion of our dreams: by building a farm-sim that everyone will enjoy playing.\nBased in Singapore, our team is made up of nine individuals that are passionate in game development.  Some of us are developing A New Leaf: Memories part-time and we hope to convert everyone to full-time with the help of this Kickstarter.\nThis Kickstarter page is powered by Crytivo - a California-based Indie Game Publisher running successful Kickstarters since 2014.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile our team has been working hard these past fourteen months and have many contingency plans in place, unexpected problems can still happen.

An individual named Haevermaet Anthony did not provide any services or assistance to the campaign and any such representations by such an individual are false.\n\n Press Kit |  Discord |  Reddit | \nClick to read the summary of the campaign in Spanish and Catalan or scroll down to read it in English\n Elementallis is a 2D top-down adventure mimicking the style and feel of classic 2D Zelda games. Explore a vast world and conquer the dungeons to restore all the Elements and use them to solve puzzles, defeat your foes and progress on your adventure. \nAs a descendant of elementallists, you took part on the disruption of the Elements and now you'll need to travel the world and restore them with the aid of your newly met Elemental. Explore the lands of Elregir, help its inhabitants, face enemies and strong bosses and solve puzzles in your quest to restore the Elements and bring back the world to its former balance.\n Features\nProve your worth in the 8 dungeons, full of puzzles, secrets, enemies and bosses.\n Use the Elements to fight, solve puzzles and uncover previously inaccessible areas in a metroidvania-esque style.\nDiscover the 8 different biomes and help its inhabitants.\nFight in real-time combat and defeat your foes using the Elements wisely to exploit their weaknesses.\nExperience a story about growth and overcoming guilt. \n Elementallis is coming to Steam (Windows), Nintendo Switch, PS4/5, Xbox and itch.io in June 2022.\nPLAY\n\nFootage of Elementallis running on the Nintendo Switch\nLanguages\nElementallis will be available in English, Spanish and Catalan. More languages will be considered later in development.\nThe Elements are the focal point in Elementallis. Each one of them is crafted to serve you in combat, puzzle-solving and exploration. \n\n Fire - Allows you to cast a fireball that ignites flammable environmental objects such as vegetation and torches. Also sets enemies on fire!\nMake your way by burning obstacles and set your enemies on fire! Be careful though, you are also flammable!\nFire can allow you to see in dark places\n Nature - Grow vines that help you climb and access new undiscovered areas or grow plants that drain your enemies' life.\nSome paths are inaccessible until you use the proper Element to overcome them\n Wind - Dash with the wind to move faster, avoid pits and dodge your enemies' attacks.\nUsing the Wind dash, you'll avoid falling into pits\n Earth - Create an area of effect that destroys rocks, opens sealed paths and damages and repels your enemies when you are surrounded.\nEarth makes a small earthquake\n Water - Introduce yourself in a floating bubble that will help you traverse through rivers and lakes. The bubble will protect yourself from enemy attacks until it bursts. You can also extinguish fire with the bubble!\nWater protects you from enemy attacks and slows them down\n Ice - Freeze heavy objects with Ice so they can slide and be moved. Also applies to enemies!\nWhen frozen, enemies can be pushed without you taking damage\n Lightning - Electrocute your enemies and paralyze them with a lightning bolt!\nZap!\n Combine Elements for more powerful effects!\nWater + Lightning / Ice + Earth\nYour Elemental changes depending on the Element you have equipped\n Elementallis will feel very familiar to Zelda-like fans. The main pillars of Elementallis' gameplay are:\n\n Combat: Real-time combat using a weapon, shield and the Elements at your disposal. You'll need to dodge your foes' attacks and strike them taking into account their weaknesses.\nUse every tool in your arsenal to defeat your enemies\n Exploration: The land of Elregir is formed by 8 different biomes (forest, swamp, mountains, volcanoes...) and is full of secrets to discover, treasures, caves, people to meet and challenges to overcome.\n Puzzle-solving: You'll find most of the puzzles in each region's dungeon. You will need to use the right abilities and think laterally to solve them. Solving them will reward you with important items or allow you to progress.\nThe lands of Elregir are formed by 8 different biomes and each one of them is sustained by one of the Elements.\nYou will explore a vast and diverse world where you'll discover towns, caves, secret locations and dungeons.\nEach region has its own dungeon. Complete its challenges to restore the dungeon's Element. When an Element is restored, your Elemental will absorb some of its power and it will grant you the ability to use said Element.\nYou have obtained the Fire Element!\nIn Elementallis, you'll face a very diverse cast of enemies in each of the regions you explore. Some of these enemies will be based around an Element, so they might be weak or strong against some of the Elements you use.\n\nAn example cast of enemies\nYou'll also face some stronger enemies, mini bosses and bosses that will test your combat abilities.\nUse Fire to damage that Candle monster!\nThis Golem is guarding something important...\nFor us, Elementallis is a love letter to the games we used to play when we were kids. But when you remember something, you usually idealize it. With Elementallis we'd like to honor our memories and try to enhance the visuals and music that we remember. That's why we want to go beyond pixel art and chiptune music in order to create something unique.\n\nGraphics\nTaking inspiration from Gameboy and SNES games for the pixel art, we are mixing it with modern effects such as lightning, post-processing, particles and shaders to achieve a unique aesthetic that feels both modern and nostalgic.\nDemonstration of all the effects that are used to achieve our art style\n\nMusic\nWe are approaching music in the same way, using orchestral music but evoking the nostalgia of the old platforms by adding 8 bit sounds.\nClick here to play the demo!\nWe've made some exciting rewards to show our appreciation for our backers! \nWould you like to know more about the Designer! tiers?

Keep in mind that we are showing prototypes and they can be subject to small changes.\n\nCollector's Edition \nEverything is included in the Golden Case\nPlushie\nHand-made plushies made by Boira Plushies with high quality materials and details.\nYou can choose which Elemental do you like as a plushie!\n\n Switch Physical Edition\nSwitch Regular Physical Edition with case, game cartridge and manual (cover design might be subject to change)\n Acrylic Pins of the Elementals\nAcrylic Pins of the Elemental in its different forms\n Acrylic Standee\nAcrylic Standee recreating the protagonist obtaining the Fire Element\nSet of Postcards\nSet of 3 Postcards\nArtbook (also available as digital)\nArtbook (Digital and Physical)\nDouble-sided Poster\nDouble-sided poster\nSoundtrack CD (also available in digital)\nSoundtrack (Digital and Physical)\n When you select your reward, you can also add the following items as add-ons.\nHello everyone! I'm Iv\u00e1n Ruiz Lozano, the designer and programmer of Elementallis.\nMy love for video games began at a very early age and I have very fond memories playing with my friends and family, specially on Gameboy. I've always been interested in computers and coding, and after some years working at an IT company, I decided that I wanted to focus on something more creative and started learning game development. \nAfter saving some money and when I felt comfortable with Unity and game design, I decided to quit my job to build Elementallis, my passion project, intending to deliver the same experience I had playing as a child.\nI'm working alongside Lu\u00e2n and Ra\u00fal, the best partners I could have asked for :)\n\nLu\u00e2n Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u1ecdng - Pixel Artist\nHi everyone! My name is Lu\u00e2n, I have been working with Pixel Art since 2017 and have worked on multiple game projects around the world.  I love working with cute things, cool things and both together are even better!\nMy inspiration to become a pixel artist is the Metal Slug series - the monument to the pixel art game! \n\nRa\u00fal Sangonzalo Terrado - Composer\nHi there! I'm Ra\u00fal, a music composer and guitarist, but also a developer. After many years of studying blues and progressive rock, I got fascinated by the way some music game composers combined them with orchestral and electronic sounds, especially in the realm of the 90s JRPGs, such as Nobuo Uematsu and Yoshinori Mitsuda. I evoke the nostalgia of these old platforms by adding 8 bit sounds to my music.\n\nWe've also worked with incredible talented folks such as Marcel Mosqi (cover art), Nicole Marie T (first songs and main theme for our previous trailer) and S\u00e1ndalo Espino (logo). \nThe project started with my own savings and this allowed me to work full time on the game and hire the necessary work that I couldn't do myself. Now we have the main mechanics of the game and the art and music for some early areas of the game.\nWith this Kickstarter campaign you will help us continue making progress on the game. You will help us achieve our dream: releasing our very own game. We'd like to contribute to the medium with our own entry.\nGame development is our passion and we are enjoying the experience very much, with your help, we can continue doing so and if we can continue working on the game full time, we will be able to release the game sooner.\n\nBudget breakdown\nYour contributions will ensure that I can work full time on the game and pay for the works of our team. The rest will go towards your rewards, shipping, Kickstarter cuts and taxes.\nYou can follow development progress on our social media, pick your preferred platform for updates and behind-the-scenes content!\nWishlist Elementallis on Steam!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have made a planning and roadmap taking into account bug testing and unforeseen events. You will always be updated of the state of the project with the monthly updates.\n\nMost of the groundwork for the game is already done: main mechanics, some abilities, art direction and style, music direction and main story. What's left is to add all the abilities, build more areas of the world and populate them, adding enemies, secrets and characters.\n\nTo ensure that the game is as polished and bug free as possible, we will be testing it thoroughly locally and in beta tests (we hope you can help us with it!).\n\nYour feedback is very valuable to us, with your help we can create something great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Stay updated!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udd14 Exclusive backer updates and videos\n\ud83d\udcac Exclusive Discord role and channel", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["35 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Customize your reward!", "descp": "Customize your own reward and add every physical or digital items you want!

Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions!

If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

Playtesting has been underway for several months. Much of the art for the book has already been completed. \n\nAbsolute Tabletop has developed dozens of RPG products, and managed four successful Kickstarter projects. They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

Their origins long ago lost to time, the valuable and seemingly-magical relics within are an even greater threat to all involved.\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Exploration, cheese, frogs\nDislikes: Being lectured \nGood-natured and energetic, Mirai tries to see the best in everyone. She arrived in New Riverstone a year ago with no memory of her past life. \nAfter finding the Flowstone in an ancient ruin, she can manifest Flow into physical matter, allowing her to build and modify existing structures, so long as she has enough resources. \nAs her story unfolds, she will learn that even with her newfound power, not everything broken in life can be easily put back together.\n\u201cNew Riverstone is our home. With everyone\u2019s help, I\u2019ll build a village we\u2019ll all be proud of!\u201d\nBlood Type: B\nLikes: Cinnamon rolls, Captain Crimm\nDislikes: Bullies\nA young pirate. While hot-headed and stubborn, she is fiercely loyal to those she cares about. \nTreated as disposable deadweight by some of her crew mates, Vivian has been bullied into activities that their captain would not approve of. \nThrough meeting Mirai, Vivian finds the courage to stand up for herself, even if she must stand alone.\n\u201cI won\u2019t be part of a crew that tries to justify robbing from innocent people. I'm better than this. We're better than this.\u201d\nBlood Type: A\nLikes: Word puzzles, being included\nDislikes: Show-offs, muscleheads\nThe military outcast. Marcus has a low-ranked position in the Republic of Byzankar's naval fleet. \nSoft-spoken and reserved, he thinks first before taking action. He joined the military not out of love for country, but for his fascination with Relics, ancient technology excavated from ruins around the world. \nDistrusted by most of New Riverstone, Vivian of all people will reach out to him and help him realize that some risks are worth taking.\n\u201cThese villagers did nothing wrong. There\u2019s no reason to take things this far.\u201d\nBlood Type: O\nLikes: Poetry; hot tea\nDislikes: Anyone threatening his crew\nThe infamous pirate king. As the Scarlet Tusk captain, Borras Crimm is the most wanted man in the world. \nStrong-willed and decisive, he takes any and all measures necessary to secure his crew of people displaced by conflicts around the world. After a Byzankar ambush, his ship finds its way to Ocean's End. \nNormally not one to attack innocents despite his reputation, his desperation to save his starving crew sends him on a collision course with Mirai and New Riverstone.\n\u201cA captain\u2019s first duty is to their crew. Always.\u201d\nBlood Type: AB\nLikes: Training, collecting swords\nDislikes: Beggars, laziness\nThe rising star of the Byzankar fleet. Driven, calculating, and with a strong sense of justice, Cerule quickly reached the rank of Commander at a young age. \nLittle is known about her, besides a reputation as a fierce naval combatant. When she finally corners the elusive Borras Crimm at his most vulnerable, a deeply-sown seed of vengeance begins to bloom, threatening to consume her.\n\u201cI won\u2019t permit anyone to leave this island until I have Borras Crimm locked away in chains.\u201d\nThe town of New Riverstone\nLocated on the largest island of Ocean's End, this young town is comprised of war refugees, explorers, and those curious enough to live on the edge of civilization. Mirai has made her home here for the past year as she tries to recover her memories.\n\nThe Islands of Ocean's End\nWith sandy beaches, wooded foothills, rocky mountains, and extensive caves, Ocean's End is an explorer's paradise. \nMirai's curiosity leads through every nook and cranny of the islands as she gathers materials, evades pursuers, and looks for a way to save New Riverstone.\n\nA long-forgotten civilization\nScattered around the world are mysterious ruins of impossibly advanced technology. \nSome people revere the ruins, some plunder their secrets for their own purposes, but no one knows who the \"Panganeans\" were, or why the facilities were created. After Mirai finds the flowstone, it sets events in motion that reveals how closely she is tied to the ruins, and leaves her with a difficult choice...\n\nThe Harbinger\nThe flagship of the Mighty Byzankar Navy,  this naval destroyer is the pinnacle of Panganean-derived tech and shipbuilding prowess.  On board is a mysterious passenger, guarded by the legendary Commander Cerule, the youngest to ever earn the title. Under her guidance, the Harbinger has cornered the pirate ship \"The Scarlet Tusk\" and is prepared to use it's incredible power to end the pirate king once and for all. \nFlowstone Saga has real-time combat where your party faces off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\nBy clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. \nSome monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Is it worth it to clear some lines to defend against a special attack, or would it be better to continue to build up blocks for an even stronger counter?\nWe want Flowstone Saga to be enjoyable by everyone, not just puzzle experts. So, in addition to game difficulty options, we've created a feature called \"Hold Mode\", which is selectable before starting a new game, and anytime in-game.  \n\nIn \"Hold Mode\", battles are no longer real-time. You still move pieces around, and have access to all the same powers, but there is no 'gravity' pulling pieces down,  and enemies will not move or act in real-time. \n\nYou have total freedom to plan your next move carefully. Then, once you lock a piece in (and only then), the enemy turn gauges will increase slightly.  \n\nEventually, enemies will act, but it will be on your terms, based on the number of moves you've made - and not the passage of real time.  This way, you still have the strategy elements of where to put pieces (and make combos, use powers, clear enemy blocks, etc) and deal with enemies, but with absolutely no time pressure at all!\n\nYou can try \"Hold Mode\" for yourself in the public builds available above, or watch a quick demo in the video below!\nPLAY\n\nThere will be over 100 different foes to defeat over the course of the journey, from the adorable Beewis, to fearsome Thunder Komodos and beyond!\nJust some of the many foes you will face in your adventure\nIn addition to regular attacks, most monsters have attacks that will interact with your puzzle board. Some will drop blocks that will slowly damage Mirai until they are cleared, while others will replace her current piece with something trickier to manage. \n\nThere are dozens of different monster attacks, and each will require it's own strategy to overcome.\n\nMirai can use her powers to create or repair structures. To do this, you must fill in the overall shape of flow energy with set pieces. \nMirai creates a ladder to escape danger\nCreate objects to move to a new area, or collect an out-of-reach treasure.\nForce open locked doors, or hack computer terminals.\nRepair broken walls or barriers to defend against invaders.\nAlso scattered throughout the islands are optional ruins that Mirai can repair for bonus rewards. Maybe something special will happen if all of them are repaired...\nThough these puzzles start out easy, some are quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve! \n\nChoose from several dozen pieces to find your perfect combination\nUnlike other falling block games, you can choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, which have their advantages and disadvantages.\n\nSmall pieces offer flexibility and options - they fit in almost any gap!\nLarge pieces grant speed to fill the board quickly, allowing for frequent power attacks\nAlmost every piece available has link crystals that multiply damage when combined carefully. Some difficult pieces are extra powerful, so if you can use them effectively, you will reap the rewards.\nCreating a balanced loadout to suit your individual style will be the key to victory in battle!\n\n Equipment found or purchased can be enhanced with the \"Dreamcaster\", an ancient relic that allows entry into the item itself, known as an \"Item Dream\".  \nEach Item Dream is a mini-roguelike, with a small but challenging randomly-generated dungeon. The rules are simple: Defeat the boss to remove impurities, and the item grows stronger. Fail and be forcefully ejected back into the real world.\nSome gear that may appear weak initially have great power hidden within, and will require full purification to show their true form. \n\nMirai starts out with only \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage.\nThroughout the game, she will harness other elements to open up new strategies.\n Fire blocks deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears\n Ice blocks freeze an enemies and prevent them from acting\n Lightning blocks have damage that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once\n\nAlso, various barriers exist in the world that call for certain elements...\nNew Riverstone is always growing, and with Mirai's new powers, creating new structures is a snap...or is it?\nVillagers will have a request, and let you know what materials they need for the building to be built.\nMonsters throughout the island have stolen key items in building certain structures. Mirai will need to find the monsters and reclaim the goods!\nOnce everything has been collected, the structure can be built.\nEnjoy deliciously prepared food from Nando, once the campfire has been completed.\nBuilding some structures will provide new services or buffs to Mirai and her party on their adventure.\nSome buildings can be further upgraded to provide stronger bonuses and perks.\n\nTo help get the raw materials she will need to build the town, Mirai can team up with the happy-go-lucky but absentminded Miner, Hagan.\nThis game mode is a race against the clock, as Hagan will throw various materials onto the puzzle field. Any material block Mirai clears, she collects! \nWhen the time is up, Hagan is too sleepy to continue, and it's time to return back to town. Maybe if you can pass him a few coins, he'll extend the timer a bit longer.\nThere are many different areas to mine, each with it's own collection of resources.\nOccasionally, Hagan will find an old treasure chest filled with gold. Clearing this scores Mirai a quick payday!\n\nWhen Mirai builds the garden, it's magic somehow attracts the attention of some nearby Spirit Frogs; friendly ghosts of a legendary troupe of adventuring amphibians. \nBrave adventurer~! I lend you my power!\nFeeding them some delicious food from the garden causes them to bond with Mirai, giving her the ability to select a patron frog, who will instill in her it's Job Class abilities from it's former life.\nThe Flow-infused soil grows fresh crops remarkably fast!\nFreely swap Frog Spirits in the status screen to be able to use their abilities, based on classic Tangledeep job classes such as Brigand, Edge Thane, Paladin, and more!\nGiving Eric seeds and soil found while adventuring, or from collecting with Hagan will grow more food in the garden.\nFeed the Sprit Frogs the collected food to level them up and learn more powerful skills and perks!\nAs you level up the spirit frogs, the job buffs they provide get stronger!\n\nLater in the game, you can test your skills against mighty opponents. Start as an unranked fighter, and smash your way to the top, to claim the GrandMaster title!\nMirai and her friends will start in the Bronze league and fight their way up!\nThere are 4 fights per tier, with a final encounter to test your mettle. Win to be promoted to the next division!  \nThere will be familiar foes in the arena, but some challengers are found nowhere else. The most difficult opponents in the game await you in here.\n\nAs New Riverstone grows, Mirai helps construct a beautiful outdoor bistro! Once this is built, she can have lunch chats with the villagers to learn more about their backstories and personalities. \n\nYou can have a friend come along and endow the party with a unique buff\nFrom Hagan's ability to find extra items after battles, to Alasdair's defensive bonus, each buff is useful!\nAs you level up your friendship with each friend, buffs grow in strength, and can  further enhance your favorite strategy.\nThough many ruins are buried beneath the surface, one stands alone as the most mysterious and labyrinthine. Tangledeep is a dungeon of constantly shifting caverns and underground jungles, with fragments of civilizations nestled within. It has proven impossible to map, as its layout is constantly in flux. \n\nWhat lies at the bottom? It's up to you to find out.\n\nLike Item Dreams, Tangledeep is a roguelike mode, with randomly-generated dungeon floors. While Item dreams are smaller, with only a few floors, Tangledeep is much more extensive, and is considered endgame or post-game content\nMirai starts on the first floor with basic shapes and no gear. Defeat increasingly-difficult enemies as you explore, obtaining new pieces, equipment, perks, and more.\nEarn special items that can be brought to the main adventure, as well as special currency to buy cosmetic items and town upgrades.\n\nFlowstone Saga's soundtrack has the soul of a classic JRPG soundtrack of the 16 and 32bit eras, with the memorable melodies that classic games are known for, brought to life with modern production and performances that the consoles of yesterday could never do. \n\nThe music of a great RPG always lives on in our minds long after the credits have rolled, so we're working hard to ensure the Flowstone Saga soundtrack is perfect.\n\nFrom day 1, we've shared progress, ideas, and plans publicly and transparently, and we plan on maintaining that relationship with the community throughout development. \nWe have a dedicated channel on Discord: #Flowstone_saga.\n\nTalk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes... come on in! \n\nWe're there daily and are happy to talk shop, take suggestions, and give updates on what we're working on. Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\n\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Flowstone Saga. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events\nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\n\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Flowstone Saga.\n\nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. What's not to love about that?\nWe've come a long way, but we have a ways to go! Here is a look at the current state of the game. Some of these bars fill up faster than others, but we are committed to transparency in what we are working on, and keeping the community updated on progress.\nBesides a Kickstarter-exclusive wallpaper, digital copies of the game, soundtrack, and artbook, we've got lots of tempting custom rewards! \n\nGrand Champion Explorer\nGive us a name, and we put it in the game. It could be you, your pet, or your D&D character. Names could be used in special items, locations, NPCs, dungeons, monsters, etc. \nPuzzle Crafter\nPut on your puzzlin' cap! Work with us to turn your puzzle ideas into reality. Show off your cleverness by making an object outline, or make players curse your name by making something brutally difficult. The choice is yours!\n\nArena Master\n\nThe Arena is an endgame gauntlet filled with the baddest bosses around, and you can add your creation to the list of fearsome fighters. It could be a crazy creature, your pet, sky's the limit!\nWork with us to design stats, special attacks, and battle strategy!\n\nHero of Legend \nEach job class in the game will have an ultimate armor that will be obtained after a quest chain. Name and give a backstory of the former owner of one of these elite sets of gear!\nWeapon Master\nThe most powerful weapons are guarded jealously by equally powerful monsters. Work with our artists and designers to create a relic weapon that is one of the most powerful in the game\nWork with us to create a suitably-powerful guardian that must be battled to earn this weapon.\nGeomancer Explorer\nTurn your MSpaint sketch into a beautiful vista!\nWork with us to create your own special place, named after you. Using a sketch and/or description provided, we will build the area, fill it with monsters and treasures, plus a unique landmark that will only appear in your area.\n\nOC-do-not-steal Explorer\nThere are all kinds of beings in our world; bring your very own to life with this reward!\nWork with us to get  your character design in the game with custom sprites, portraits, and a short backstory for the players to learn about as a side quest.\nYour character will be able to join Mirai's party as a friend, giving them a unique buff.\n\nThe adorable plush Goldfrogs\nSmall and soft, these cute croakers are handmade by DragonAvenger Crafts and designed by Flea Circus Designs. They measure 3\" tall, 3.5\" wide, are made of soft minky fabric and feature shiny golden coin embroidery.\nOn May 16th, we reached 100% funding with 3+ weeks left to go! Here are our stretch goals to help keep the hype going and add more cool stuff to the game.\n\n$25,000: Sprig Salon - ACHIEVED!\nMirai's pet fox will be more stylish than ever! Unlock accessories, animations, and palette swaps to customize this cute fella, who is always be visible by your side. And yes, you'll be able to pet him, too.\n\n$30,000: 2nd Player Assist - ACHIEVED!\nA buddy on your couch can help out on the battlefield by providing helpful bonuses, and thwacking enemies! By connecting a second controller, your friend will get their own Mana gauge to use powers and give you an extra edge in difficult battles. \n\n$35,000: Town Planner\nTransform New Riverstone into the town you want it to be! Find or purchase decor items to spruce up and enhance the town, from natural objects like bushes, trees, and flower patches, to statues, fountains, birdhouses, and more. Place each item virtually anywhere in town with free positioning!\n\n$40,000: Battle Jukebox + 6 New Themes\nHot-blooded music for fighting! We'll add six brand-new battle themes to the game, plus a \"Battle Jukebox\" that will play random themes with every encounter.\nThese new tracks will be composed by lead designer & composer Andrew \"OA\" Luers, lead programmer and Tangledeep composer Andrew \"zircon\" Aversa, renowned electronic & soundtrack artist Jimmy \"Big Giant Circles\" Hinson, and epic orchestral composer & OST mixer Nabeel Ansari.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over.\n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over two years into Flowstone Saga already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Katie's Tip Jar", "descp": "Thank you for supporting Flowstone Saga!

Thanks for getting us funded!\nThe most exciting and colorful hand-drawn adventure to ever meet your eyes! Think of it as a combination of the Kirby series colorful charm and variety, mixed with Castlevania game play (both Classic and IGA styles), and with an aesthetic like a Paper Mario title.\n-What is Vivid Spirit?-\nVivid Spirit is an action adventure platformer where you use colors to dictate how you fight. You can jump and stomp on Colored Blocks or enemies to change colors. Then summon forth an arsenal of weapons or powers based on your hue. Use these abilities to solve puzzles or get the upper hand on enemies in combat!\nYou'll play as Vivid, a young girl who makes due despite her unfortunate loss of color. She leads an interesting life in her home land of Paper Craft, whether it's fighting off terrifying, amphibious wizards... or walking her dog, Spirit! Her canine companion isn't shy like she is, and in fact, can be quite mischievous.\nWe take inspiration from 2D platformers of the 90's, but with a modern feel. There is a wide variety in stages as well as open world areas that you can explore to your hearts content! We are hoping to make the game accessible to all sorts of people, like those with color blindness by using shapes to represent colors.\nDid we mention this game was drawn? By hand? ON PAPER?\nOver 3000+ images drawn, with more to go!\n-The Stories-\nThat's right! Vivid Spirit is more than one single adventure! There are over FIVE different adventures awaiting you in the land of Paper Craft, and they all have something different for you to experience! One story you may play as Vivid, but in another, you'll play as Spirit the Dog! And you'll even be able to use both in certain areas!\nWe can't tell you everything, but you'll start off with only two stories you can play through. As you progress, the rest will be unlocked. The first two stories are dedicated solely to Vivid and the other to Spirit.\nIn Vivid's story, she'll have to go on the chase to rescue Spirit \u2013 dog napped by the bully, Slam Jim! You'll go through a linear set of stages all in an effort to defeat the giant punching bag. And in Spirit's, a terrible wind has blown away all of her favorite toys across the land! You'll then have to search through different levels at your leisure to recover them \u2013 some being a bit tougher to find than others!\nThis and many more grander adventures await you, should you be up for the challenge! And perhaps discover the mysteries surrounding Vivid's lack of color and the sudden appearance of the Colored Blocks.\nNot everything in Paper Craft is as colorful as it may appear...\n-The Characters-\nMeet the star of the show, Vivid!\nVivid is an... odd girl to say the least. Although she's happier now, that wasn't always the case. Ever since she could remember, she lacked color. The exception being her blush. This abnormality affects her speech, practically making her mute most of the time. And although she is small, she's actually 17. Whatever ails her has physically malnourished her. Her father is trying to help.. but she rarely sees him these days.\nThen one day, when she missed the bus to school, she tried walking and ended up falling into a river. It was then she met Spirit who saved her life by using a special power. The dog taught her how to manipulate color and create objects like swords! But more importantly, she actually had a friend. And through what she had learned, they would go off on new adventures and make more friends. All despite her disabilities.\nSpirit the Dog!\nSpirit is a mysterious dog, seeming to come out of nowhere at the right moment to rescue Vivid. Perhaps that's why she was named Spirit; cause she was watching out for Vivid. And ever since then, she still does. Though that's not to say Spirit doesn't get herself into trouble, which she often does.\nHer excitement is easy to see in the wag of her tail and in the speed of her run. Unlike Vivid's Color Magic, which summons forth weapons and tools, Spirit uses the elements of nature to help out. From fire, lightning, and even wind, she can manipulate nature to get around. Super useful when playing fetch!\nSlam Jim the Bully!\nOne of the first major foes you'll face, he dog naps Spirit for no good reason! Perhaps it's due to the fact he's not very bright and only knows how to fight. What a jerk! But perhaps all he needs is a friend...\nIt's the Hoppin\u2019 Mad Warlock, the Toadster!\nThis amphibian is easily angered by the exploits of Vivid and Spirit. He owns an entire fortress for various magic research, including the study of the recently appearing Colored Blocks. Regardless, that doesn't stop him from trapping Vivid and Spirit inside his castle, hoping it would teach them a lesson for intruding on his property when they tried to trick-or-treat at his door.\n\u2026.Needless to say it would turn out to be the biggest mistake he ever made.\n-The Game Play-\nVivid is a game that has been in development for a few years now and we've been tweaking the engine little by little, seeing what works and what doesn't. Our hopes is to make one of the best platforming experiences you'll ever encounter and will love to come back to time and time again.\nAs the name suggests, the game is primarily centered around color. Being a certain color gives you advantages and disadvantages to just about any situation. Your attacks, platforming, defense, powers, and puzzles. All of them are affected by your current color; Red, Yellow, or Blue.\nThe Colored Blocks you see lying around can give you color by landing on them with a move called Downward Spiral. Just hold down while in the air and STOMP! Blocks that are transparent can be walked through if your color doesn't match, which means you'll need to switch colors to take advantage of blocks being physical or transparent.\nThen there's S.C.A.B (Same Color Attack Bonus). When you fight enemies, if your attacks share a common color with the foe, you'll do DOUBLE damage! So a Red attack will do double damage to a Red enemy. And Blue and Yellow attacks will do double damage to a GREEN enemy, since Blue and Yellow mix to make Green. But just remember that SCAB also applies to yourself as well. Enemies that hit you with similar colors will do double damage to YOU! So there's a bit of a risk involved; do double damage and risk losing more health? Or halve the damage you take while doing less to enemies?\nIn addition, enemies attacked with similar colors yield Color Energy. You can find these scattered all over levels. Collecting them will fill the Energy Meter, which can be used to activate your Power Pins! You can equip Pins to one of your Color Slots and use them so long as you have energy to do it. There are a variety of Pins you can unlock, ranging from healing, making you faster, or even wiping out the entire screen! Just remember to choose which ones you want when entering a stage. Careful planning leads to success!\nIt's also important to consider the properties of the weapons Vivid uses. Red, Yellow, and Blue Weapons all have abilities to them that are best fit for certain situations. Red ones are typically short ranged but have great control, making them good for movement. Yellow attacks are horizontal projectiles that are good for taking out opponents from afar, though limited vertically. And Blue Weapons are vertical, allowing you to take out pesky enemies you can't reach too well.\nSpirit also has differences, though she is built with speed and platforming in mind more than combat. Her abilities involve getting over hazards quickly or reaching areas you couldn't normally get to easily.\nAnd if that were not enough, your color can also influence many objects you interact with! From wind to jumping up waterfalls, there are many small details like this that you may find while playing. Understanding that your color can influence what you interact with can lead you to many secrets!\nSpeaking of secrets, the reason you'll want to go after them is because of treasure and money! By getting some coin, you can purchase new items at the Shop. These can be new weapons, Power Pins, extensions to life, and so on. There are 18 Weapons total in the game!\nAs for the levels themselves they are formatted differently in each story. Some levels are mostly linear, requiring that you complete it before going to the next stage. But in some stories there are no levels but rather open world areas that you can explore freely. There you'll find Save Stations to save progress and switch out weapons and the like. Beyond that, each story has other differences you'll need to keep in mind to give you an edge while playing. Like whether or not you're using Vivid, Spirit, or both. Some stories you can swap between the two freely, while others you cannot due to plot reasons.\nThese are just some of the things that'll be in the final product. There will be a variety of collectibles, Extra Challenges, Achievements, and unique Bosses to face in the game. We hope to make this one of the best experiences a game can give you... which is to be fun!\n\n-Questions-\nWho is LucasMaxBros?\nThat's me! I also go by Luke or Lucas. Been making games as a hobby for about 10 years now and hoping to finally make a complete product everyone can play. I've been working on Vivid Spirit since late 2014! It's changed over the years but I'm quite dedicated to making it as great as it can be. Other than that, I just like creating stuff; drawing, writing, and of course, coding.\nOn the music side of things, we have two composers: \nForte (Twitter / Bandcamp)\nScooblee (Twitter / Soundcloud / YouTube)\nWhat is the money being used for?\nThe game has been worked on for quite a while, there isn't much left to do. But one big thing missing is the OST! I need to hire composers to make the game sound magical. In addition, I've been having tech issues and had to already use a lot of money to build a new PC. I'll need more hardware to ensure things are stored safely, and to get the game on other platforms.\nIf we go beyond the $6000 goal, I can also hire more artists to do additional work, which can make the game arrive faster and give me more time to program additional features... like a Co-op Mode!\nHow can we trust this game will be delivered?\nI've put quite a few years into this project and have managed to already make some progress into the Beta, so the game is already in a settled place. It's just a matter of taking it all the way. With funding, that can speed things up.\n\nRelease Date?\nOn the backer rewards, you'll note it says May 2022. There currently is no planned release date, but we believe we'll have it ready first quarter 2022. There's always the possibility of setbacks. However, funding can ensure replacements for hardware in case of failure, which actually happened earlier this year! Thankfully nothing was lost. And now that Vivid Spirit is so far along, with over 90% of animations made, it should be reasonable to make the game within a year.\nPlatforms?\nAs it currently stands this game will only be released for Windows PC. That doesn't mean there won't ever be other ports, and we hope to do so! It's just a matter of money and getting the hardware to do it. We will update our page if any ports become a possibility. So make sure to back the game and spread awareness if you want Vivid on other platforms!\n\nLocalization?\nVivid is a game that mainly tells its story through visuals and game play. That being said, there will be dialogue and character bios and stage lore you can learn about. You do not need this to enjoy the game, but we will try our best to get other languages should we have the money necessary.\nCan you pet the dog?\nYes!\nCan you pet the human?\n YES!\n\n-Backer Rewards Explained-\nNote that all the rewards are color coordinated!\nWHITE: We appreciate any form of support!\nRED: When the game is about to be released, we will email all those with a digital poster at full resolution AND a second new wallpaper to celebrate the release of the game! This new poster will include some enemies and bosses that'll appear in the game. So if you don't want to be spoiled, we'll make sure to hide it safely when it's sent!\nThis tier, along with the ones above, will all give you a chance to enter your name or a legal and appropriate pseudonym when the credits pop up at the end! We will contact everyone who's involved if they wish to do this or not have their name in it at all. And all the names will be color coordinated to the color of the tier they backed!\nORANGE: A Digital copy of Vivid for Windows PC! A key will be sent to you upon release. Should other versions of the game be possible before release, we will notify you and ask which version you'd like.\nNOTE: You can offer $26 for an Xbox, Nintendo Switch, or PlayStation digital copy by default once those versions are available. This way we can manage between PC and Console versions easily when we send the codes to backers.\nWhat if I want multiple copies of Vivid Spirit?\nCheck the FAQ!\nYELLOW: Access to the Full Soundtrack to Vivid upon release!\nGREEN: A Digital Artbook and Gallery from the development of Vivid Spirit. It'll contain concept art, various beta designs, and official HQ art of characters! There will be notes and comments explaining how things were made and more!\nAQUA: Beta Access! We will every couple of months send out special copies of Vivid Spirit with some early versions of levels and items for you to try out. This gives you a chance to help us out by testing Vivid Spirit before it ever releases. You may even get to fight special bosses before anyone else sees them! And since you'll be helping test the game, if you happen to use Discord (here's our server: https://discord.gg/GzND9sV  ) you'll get a special role that'll grant you access to special channels. They are used for discussing beta levels and for giving feedback.\nBLUE: Face or Object to represent you in the background of a level! We will contact you after the campaign is over, and you can give us either a picture of your face or an image of an object, such as a basketball, a lemon, or a skull... or you with a basketball, lemon, and skull... etc! So long as it's appropriate and legally possible to show, we'll use it. Then we'll draw it in the style of Vivid and place it some where in the game! Where it'll be is up to you to find out, so keep your eyes open! These background objects you send may even hide a small item inside!\nINDIGO: Design a Cosmetic Weapon! There are 18 weapons in the game, and while playing, you'll get an item that can alter the looks of weapons. Why? Because it's fun! This won't change how the weapons work, but they can lead to cool or funny looking scenarios.\nYou'll get to choose one weapon and either make a design for it or let us draw something based on your description. As long as it's appropriate and legal, we'll do it. That, and it has to work with how the weapon functions. So if it were the Crimson Blade...  it can't be an absurdly long sword! And it have to be primarily red, since that is a red weapon.\nAnd each weapon has FOUR forms since weapons can power up. This means we'll allow up to four designs for that weapon! One for each charge level. Or you can just design for one charge level. It'll be discussed after the Kickstarter has finished.\nPURPLE: Design an Enemy! Specifically, a simple enemy. We won't be making anything that does 10 different moves and has extreme AI planning. But we'll certainly design an enemy of your description and balance it accordingly. We'll discuss it in a meeting on Discord and even draw concept art until we get a desirable design working and implemented! This will happen after the Kickstarter has finished.\nRAINBOW: Design an Optional Boss fight! We already have all the Bosses for Vivid planned out, but we do have room for a few extras. The boss will have little to no story relevance but we'll allow you to custom make a whole fight! The only deal is that it can't be overly flashy, as you'll only have one health bar to work with. We will allow up to two phases for the fight! We'll discuss it on Discord when the time comes to implement your boss into the game, how it'll look, and so forth. We'll discuss this after the Kickstarter is finished. But bare in mind it might be a while before we're ready to start working on such!\nAlso keep in mind we're limiting this tier to 4 entries, cause this game has quite a few bosses in it already. There's only enough room for a few more!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame Development is always a source of unknowns, especially when it comes to polish and technology malfunctioning. We are using most of our free time to make this experience come true, but even so, that alone isn't enough to complete this project. The game will have to go under thousands of tests before we think it's even close to ready. And that sort of polish takes time.\nWith a hardware failure that happened earlier this year, we're being extra cautious with how much time things could take. Especially because progress on Vivid Spirit froze for over two months. But rest assured that won't happen again with the right funding. Beyond completing the OST, our hope is that the money from this project speeds up the final steps of this games completion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe game can be made to play on a variety of platforms.\nReusability and recyclability\nMy game is digital, and so are the rewards.\nSustainable materials\nNone, because it's digital.

Subscribe to our newsletter!\nWant to Wishlist the game on Steam? Do that here!\nYou can also Follow us on Twitter or join our Discord.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nWhisker Squadron is our fresh take on forward scrolling aerial combat, featuring feline heroes, dynamic missions, and procedurally generated bosses and worlds!\nComing to PC and consoles in 2022\n Wishlist on Steam | Website | Twitter | Facebook | \n\nHey everyone! \nWe are Flippfly, the team behind 2013's Race The Sun. We are so excited to let you know about our new project, Whisker Squadron!\nClick banner to wishlist Whisker Squadron right now!\nWhisker Squadron is the culmination of a creative spark that was lit over 20 years ago, and that has burned in us through our careers, and strengthened by modern indie games. When we created Race The Sun in 2013, we took aesthetic cues from classic low-poly games like Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, and created something with a uniquely minimalist feeling that was loved by our fans. Ever since that project shipped, we\u2019ve talked about creating a follow up that was more combat-focused, and that pushed the procedurally-generated elements even further.\n\nWhisker Squadron is that game.\n\nChoose your pilot and fight your way through procedurally-generated worlds and epic, procedurally-generated boss fights. You've got one life, and your tactical upgrade choices will be crucial to your success in this aerial roguelike.\n\nEngage in epic aerial combat with your feline pilot of choice\nTake on a series of epic, procedurally-generated boss fights\nFight your way through dynamic worlds in a mission that's unique every time you play it\nAnd there's more:\nProcedurally generated, rogue-like mission structure that's unique every time you play\nIncredibly dynamic procedurally-generated bosses that make for intense climax to every act\nChoose your pilots from a cast of 3 feline heroes\nDaily challenges and leaderboards\nDon't just take our word for it! Here is what the games press is saying about Whisker Squadron:\n\u201cSome of the bosses look downright inspired\u201d - PC Gamer \n\u201cIf this is where the game is starting in the public eye, I can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\u201d - Polygon \n\u201cIt's early days yet, but yeah, I'd play this\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun \n\u201cWhile on the surface Whisker Squadron looks like Starfox with cats, the addition of Race the Sun\u2019s elements make it a very different game.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201cThe foundation of a tried and true rail shooter mixed with procedurally-generated level design, roguelike gameplay, and striking art design is a solid one for Flippfly.\u201d - Shacknews \nWhisker Squadron is a corridor shooter with procedurally generated worlds, some light roguelike elements, and a cast of cats! Pilot your ship, avoiding obstacles and blasting the autonomous bots built by the sinister PAW Technologies corporation in an effort to save the galaxy from out of control algorithms bent on planetary destruction.\n\nThe game follows an action rogue-like formula: You get a single life to play through a 3-act campaign through several worlds and random space encounters, each with their own looks and threats. Challenge yourself to acquire higher rankings by avoiding damage, blasting all the bots, and keeping your multiplier high to earn the most rewards for beating each world.\nChallenge isn't everything, so we also offer a set of customizable gameplay settings instead of traditional difficulty settings. Start with more shields on your ship? Encounter less enemies? Get health pickups at the end of each world? Go for it!\nAnd if you want a nightmare, the settings will be there for you masochist-cats as well...mewhahaha\nDynamic mission map\n\nPlay as multiple characters, each with their own unique special weapon. Along the way you'll encounter shops and events to acquire a choice of new weapons and items to powerup as you make your way across the galaxy to stop the bots. Each play-through is unique, with each world being procedurally generated from a set of 'pattern' chunks, and a map that presents different connections and choices.\nAnd it's not just the worlds which are generated: each act culminates with an epic battle against a large enemy bot, and the bots are always looking for improvements so you'll have to keep on your toes each play-through because this bot is procedurally generated for a unique battle each time!\nJin is our character artist, and has drawn our wonderful cast of cats. Here's a few of them:\nSean is leading the way on the visual development for the game, using the custom world editor that we\u2019ve built for this game. We\u2019re evolving the minimalist style we developed with Race The Sun, and adding layers of visual flair on top. What you see on this Kickstarter page is a work-in-progress. We\u2019re improving the visuals more every week, and we\u2019re confident that the final look will blow you away.\nWe\u2019re also super excited to be working with Chel Wong on the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Chel has an amazing range of styles and really nailed the feeling that we\u2019re going for with this game. You can hear her work in the trailer above!\n\nHere\u2019s what Chel has to say about working on the Soundtrack:\n\u201cFor the soundtrack I have so many ideas I'm excited to work on! I plan on taking some influence from predecessors in the genre but also going to be putting my own spin on things. And as is my specialty, I can't wait to see what kind of adaptive layers I can put into this soundtrack to react to gameplay!\n\nSOUNDTRACK PREVIEW\nhere's a little preview of what Chel's cooking up for the soundtrack. This is the track for Lunar Canyon, along with the \"boss variant\" that will play at the end level boss fight.\n(Note: this is a work-in progress, Chel is still in the process of adding some sweet guitars!)\nHere are a few of the more unique Kickstarter-exclusive rewards we're offering!\n\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME ($200 and above)\nYou'll send us a photo of yourself, your pet or anything that's age-appropriate, and we'll add it to an object in a special \"Easter egg\" level that players can access in the game itself!\nPut yourself in the secret level, rough concept\nADD YOUR FURRY FRIEND ($500 and above) \nYou'll send us a picture of your pet, or some artwork of your personal animal persona, and we'll add it to the game as a secret playable character, unlocked with a unique cheat code.\nYour furry friend in the game, rough concept\nCUSTOM SHOUT OUT $1000 and above)\nWe'll send you a survey and code up a special conversation with the characters in the game, who will give you a shout-out by name, activated by a special personal cheat code. We'll work with you to make it special!\nCustom shout-out, rough concept\nAaron San Filippo is a co-founder of Flippfly and the company\u2019s lead programmer. He\u2019s overseeing production and code, building new tools to support the design of the game, and coordinating the team. He also built the prototype for the game and helps out with design.\n\nSean Campbell is the designer and creative director. Sean helped Flippfly build Race The Sun\u2019s portal worlds, and has returned as the world creator and Whisker Squadron\u2019s creative director. He\u2019s also leading the efforts on the game\u2019s 3D art. \nAaron, Sean, Chel, Jin, Chris, and Zaire\n\nChel Wong is a seasoned composer with multiple game soundtracks to her name. Chel works in a variety of styles with an incredible range, and she\u2019s creating an awesome original soundtrack for Whisker Squadron.\n\nChris Atkins joined Flippfly recently as a programmer, and is helping flesh out Whisker Squadron\u2019s gameplay.\n\nJin Li is a concept artist and animator from Sydney, Australia. She created and drew all of the characters for Whisker Squadron and contributed concept design.\n\nZaire Lanier is a writer and narrative designer from the Midwestern US. She's creating a comic called The Bone Herder, and will be helping create the WS universe, characters, and in-game dialog.\nJune 2021: beta-level backers and above get early access to the beta on PC\nDecember 2021: game is content-complete and enters final phase of testing\nMay 2022: The game launches and all backers get a PC copy\nJuly 2022: All physical and digital rewards are delivered.\nMost of the funding for Whisker Squadron comes directly from Flippfly. We have been working on this game for about a year, and we are in a fortunate situation where Race The Sun and our other games are providing a steady income stream that\u2019s allowed us to work on the game. However, this Kickstarter will be essential for getting us over the finish line, and if we reach our stretch goals, will allow us to create an even better game, and guarantee an on-time delivery.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested a lot of Flippfly funds in Whisker Squadron already, supporting a small core team to build about 1/3rd of the game so far. We are on Kickstarter to raise funds to help finish the game and expand our team. This money will help us create an original soundtrack, add additional features, and finish the game sooner.\nYour support means the world to us! Our fans have always been central to Flippfly\u2019s success, and you are quite literally making this project possible. Thanks for coming along for the ride and being a part of our dream project!\n\n* Platforms:\nAt this time, we are planning for Steam, Epic Games Store on PC. We're also looking into PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch We will finalize these plans in the coming months and keep you updated!

We've already started experimenting with a few of these; and they're turning out VERY good; we featured a lil bit of Empty Diary's acoustic mix way back in our 2020 trailer, and already have some stuff on the way for Mirror and Forever Now. You can expect way more of it in the final game with this goal met.\nFOR $300,000 (THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS), WE'RE ADDING ONLINE MULTIPLAYER. \nWhile we want to just go, hey, mic drop, no explanation needed, here is some explanation: \nyou will be able to queue in online lobbies and try and get a better score than your friend or enemy, at the same time as them\nyou can use custom beatmap tracks, provided that you and your friend or enemy also has said beatmap tracks\nall of the community features will be linked into it\nit might be post-launch, but it will be added\nNETCODE IS HARD. We already said that. But if we hit this goal, we can absolutely promise this much. We want to do more, but without a lot more funding and a lot of beta-testing, I am legally unable to tell you any other multiplayer features the game may or may not have. Also hey, let's say it again:\nnetcode is hard\nAnyway, what's up? Feeling okay?\nYOU, THE PERSON READING THIS: Hold on wait HOW DID YOU GET FUNDED IN A DAY?\nD-CELL GAMES, EXCEPT PERSONIFIED AS A SINGLE ENTITY: We have no idea! People like this thing! Go figure.\nYOU:  I'm figuring! Also, what's with...the format? \n D: It's just a conceit. I'm meant to represent us, the people who made this dang thing. You represent, well, you, but you're not you, because you're not actually having these thoughts. I mean, it'd be cool if you did. Did you? That would freak me out a bit, if that was me. ANYWAY HERE'S THE GAME:\nunbeatable is a videogame\nY: This tells me nothing. \nD: It tells you tons of things! Look, right there. It says \"unbeatable is a video game\" in casual lowercase. You can see it right there! Levels! Story! Other!\nY: Why\u2019d you make it look like a Dreamcast game? \nD: I already regret doing the interview gimmick. You know what, forget it. Let's start from the top! Again!\nY: Wait, hold on, what are-\nIt's a narratively-hyperfocused dense exploration game where two-button rhythm combat powers more or less everything.\nEXPLORE AND HELP PEOPLE(?)\nOne half is this: you explore the game world, meeting terrible people and building a setlist for your upcoming concerts. Helping strangers, practicing with bandmates, sleeping in all day - it's your funeral, you'll only have so many days before each big event!\n\"street-style taiko\" is what someone has called this, and we're stealing it\nThe other half is this: arcade-flawless rhythm gameplay powered by an entirely original soundtrack. It's simple but frenetic - sure, there's only two buttons, but there's a lot of visual variety to the setpiece-styled battles. Want to groove exclusively to the rhythm gameplay? We'll have an ARCADE MODE available for you to play from the start!\nThe setup: In the world of UNBEATABLE, music has been outlawed For Reasons You'll Find Out.\nThe twist: A small girl has decided to bring it back. \nThe punchline: Beat (that's you, you are her) finds herself tangled up in her plans...and in the crosshairs of both the police and a mysterious new enemy...\nBut enough talk. Want to give the game a shot? We're releasing UNBEATABLE [white label], our episodic side-story demo, on Steam now! SIDE A Track 1, which lets you play 12 songs and learn more about the vibrant world of UNBEATABLE!\nBeat used to try to sing. Now she *sings*. Hopefully she'll be able to figure all of this out before things get worse.\nQuaver's the young, smart, and the tenacious backbone of the band. Even at her lowest moments, you can't tell her to just give up. You couldn't pick a better guitarist for this band!\nThere's more to Treble than his lazy, sleepy attitude - as the keyboardist of the band, Treble's always reliable, even when he would rather be taking a nap.\nIn contrast to her twin brother, Clef is LOUD. Like, loud.\nUNBEATABLE aims to look like a long lost bootleg 90s VHS recording of the newest anime on the block.\nOur touchpoints for this project are numerous, probably way too many to count!  - but also admittedly reductive of what we're setting out to do. We want UNBEATABLE to stand as its own look in terms of art direction and give it a melancholic flair. We're doing more than just taking the classic anime look as our own!\nMusic is an important part of the game, although we're sure that's pretty obvious. You can listen to a preview of the game's soundtrack above. The music is written to accompany important narrative beats and motifs of the game's story, and there's also going to a bevy of B-SIDES (by RJ Lake) and story-exclusive tracks present in the final release.\nI mean, or you could just...listen to it\nPLAY\n\nSo you might be thinking, \"oh god, I have to play a rhythm game? hard pass. i'd rather read the Iliad.\"  And we get it.  The Iliad rules.  But look: if you just wanted to play the game's story mode and vibe to the beat without being frustrated by the beat (or would like to/need to tweak settings to make the game more comfortable to play...or even just wanted to see if a difficulty is right for you?) We'll be implementing several accessibility options for the game, one of which will be the game's \"Assist Mode\".\nThe demo includes one feature from this mode called \"AUTOPLAY\", where Beat will automatically attack even if you provide mis-inputs (although if you do make a timed hit, it will take your accuracy into account). Let us know what you think on the feature, but do note that we will be looking into implementing (across the whole game):\nModifiers that disable health and adjust regen.\nOptions for color-blind users\nVarious options to configure dialogue visibility\nFull controller / keyboard custom bindings\nScreen-Shake Toggle (will be added eventually in [white label]\nIn addition, we currently have the following available in the [white label] demo:\nToggles for both the VHS Filter and Post-Processing\nController Presets\nConfigurable Scrolling Speed for incoming enemy attacks\nConfigurable Game Offset (with an in-game wizard!)\nAdjustable Game Speed ( 0.5x / 2x)\nNo-Fail Mode\nSo, I'm interested...but...who are you?\nI'm glad you asked! Say hi to us:\n\nUNBEATABLE IS A VIDEO GAME WHICH IS BEING... \nANDREW TSAI (@PixelHavokk) loves anime, and will be tried in court over it. He came up with the initial concept for UNBEATABLE fairly soon after making a game where you have to type to stay alive, and then told Jeff about it, and then they told other people, and hey, now you know. He does the art direction, most of the animation, works on some of the code, has a \"story by\" credit, and handles combat design and polish. Lots of hats! More hats than a person usually has space for on their head. He's the reason most of the characters have music names. \nRJ LAKE (@spellbang) has been sort of accidentally-ing his way through the games industry for almost a decade now, bouncing between asset creation, design, biz dev, and Other. Used to work on Homestuck* (listen to volume ten!) and does stuff with Strange Scaffold (dog airport!). Does Not Code, And Is Sorry. He's handling music direction, additional music, narrative design, dialogue, some setpiece design, all the storyboarding Andrew doesn't do, and is in charge of most of the marketing (the trailer was his fault). He's to blame for all the jokes. \n\nTJ Maddux (@respinmusic)is D-CELL's resident composer and musician. His musical journey started by playing drums for rock bands that regularly pushed sound pressure levels far past safe listening limits, but he eventually waned on the aggressive use of volume in order to  study the sorcery that is jazz composition. He's responsible for the live recording that drives UNBEATABLE.\nJack of all cables, mastering of songs; Vasily Nikolaev (@VastonikMusic) makes it his goal to immerse yourself in worlds that sound real, but feel stylish. Music composer and SFX artist, he handles mixing of all the songs in the game and is responsible for most of the synth work and wilder production tricks you'll hear, as well as a huge chunk of the sound design.\nTogether, TJ and Vas work as peak divide and provide the vast majority of the soundtrack for UNBEATABLE.\nMireille Arseneault (@ProgramGamer) is known for being the TIGsource forums admin and is the main programmer on UNBEATABLE. Mireille's role on UNBEATABLE is to implement the game's various systems. These allow the rest of the team to create dialogue, quests, and beatmaps!  They live in Canada, where bagged milk is.\nJeffrey Chiao (@comet_melting) is UNBEATABLE\u2019s producer and beatmap designer and helps out RJ with biz dev stuff! They keep the team in check (by dousing the fiery equivalent of game production havoc) and build  the amazing beatmaps that accompany Peak Divide\u2019s soundtrack. Outside of UNBEATABLE, they also work on several other games as the director of  SKY HOUR WORKS.\nRachel Lake (@rachelklake) is an illustrator and UNBEATABLE's lead vocalist (and the voice actor for Beat). She helps out with PR, community management, and additional art, and supports the team by derailing meetings with Minecraft memes.\nIN ADDITION, we've got:\nMoxie Riles (they/them) helping out D-CELL GAMES with UNBEATABLE as a cleanup artist (and cheerleader).\nand Yumna Taqiyyah (@Taqibunn) is helping out with additional animation! You can see her work on the band up there!\nWe began development of UNBEATABLE in early 2018, going through a long pre-production phase lasting up until mid-2020; we took a long time locking down core gameplay and the game's final narrative. Since then, we've been working part-time on the full production of the game. It's come a long way since people have first gotten to play the game at MAGFest 2019!\nRight now, we're developing the game's vertical slice (which covers the game's second chapter) - and with that almost completed (it's...close), we're looking to head straight to work on developing the rest of the story mode. We expect this is going to be at the minimum a two year effort, based on how long things have taken so far.\nworse than text\nIT'S TIME FOR PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF:\nWe are now switching over to Jeff! That's me. Lemme take you a quick rundown of the financials of this KS and the project. The charts really explain themselves, but let's break it down to everyone's favorite - the pie charts.\nPIE CHART #1 - Our Kickstarter Breakdownnnnnnnnnnn\nAs for what our development breakdown looks like, here you go!\nPIE CHARTS 2 - What all of our development costs are going into!\nUp to this point, we've been running entirely with little to no funds making the game - so having a jumpstart of any kind would help guarantee the game the resources it needs to become a reality! It's no secret that the project will need a lot more than this - funding UNBEATABLE's base goal will help us develop the game's vertical slice and be able to pursue more funding, but the actual development costs for the final project are on estimate to be roughly ten-times our budget floor (games are expensive, guys).\nWithout funding, we still anticipate continue production on the game, but we won't be able to meet our 2023 release window. That's...just how...these things...go\n\n*please don't hold that against us\n\nWanna upgrade the demo(s) with new content? Help us out with some exciting achievement goals!\n\nEvery Kickstarter apparently needs to say \u201cevery Kickstarter needs this\u201d when they add a thing that every Kickstarter has, and since every Kickstarter does this, we\u2019re doing this, and we\u2019re telling you about it. WE GOT ACHIEVEMENT GOALS! Help us build our community (please make us look cool) and we'll upgrade our demo(s) with new songs and surprises! \n\nYou'll get 1 point for each tier passed, and 10 points will unlock a brand new B-SIDE that will come to ARCADE MIX and [white label] - the mysterious FOREVER WHEN!\nMore goals will be added throughout the Kickstarter campaign - letting you unlock even more special rewards!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already elaborated in \"PIE CHARTS WITH JEFF\" that the Kickstarter's base goal will not be enough to bring the game's production to completion by end of 2023. If the Kickstarter is funded, we intend on delivering this game no matter what - but the final amount we get will really play a part in how long we can keep going before its ready to search for partners to help bring the game to completion.\n\nRegarding PHYSICAL MERCH: We have experience producing everything but artbooks, so for the most part, we are confident in delivering and shipping physical goods across the world. We will update on production deliveries, delays, and more throughout the campaign.

Thank you to all those who have pledged at any level, or who have helped spread the word. :)\nStretch Goal status:\n\u2713 12,000: Boss Rush, Challenge Game Mode. [Funded!]\n\u2713 14,000: Seven Sisters, Survival Arena Game Mode. [Funded!]\n\u2713 16,000: Multiple music tracks for each world. [Funded!]\n\u2713 18,000: Sidereal Mode - A \"Newgame +\" Campaign. [Funded!]\n\u2713 20,000: Post-Kickstarter physical item add-ons [Funded!] \n(See the \"Stretch\" section below for more details.) \nThank you all so much. (\u25e0,\u25e0)\n\nVenture into the haunted wilds with Gable, a little owl, as she sets out to rekindle the dormant relics of a land long abandoned to ruin.\nPuzzle, fight, and fly your way through the long lost gauntlets, and spectral denizens of the fearful Deep Wilds.\nFlying is a core feature of traversing the environment in Down Ward. The unique flight system allows unlimited airtime, but requires forward momentum and skillful maneuvering to maintain lift.\nYou can play Down Ward in early access.\n\nPlay on Steam\nPlay on Game Jolt\n\nThis early access version of Down Ward is already playable, and has quite a bit of content. It's a small stand-alone freeware game by itself, rather than a demo, and I will keep this free version available as a free game even after the Kickstarter.\nWith your help, I aim to expand this game into a proper full-length title.  \nLike the physics of real flight, as long as Gable is moving forward, she can gain lift.\nShe can stay in the air as long as she has the room to maneuver around obstacles and maintain forward airspeed. Becoming a proficient flyer is important. Especially when hostile haunts begin showing up!   \nDown Ward is a simple but challenging platformer, where flight is critical to navigating the environment, and airspeed is critical to flight. Specters of the Deep Wilds abound, and obstacles, both puzzly and precisiony await!\nGameplay\nSeek out luminous feathers, collect them, and commit them to the Ward Tower. Along the way, you'll encounter a variety of hazards and haunts.\nGable is not entirely defenseless against the ghostly sentinels of the ruins. Armed with a starlight blade, she can spear nearby haunts, or knock them away.\n\nThe blade can interact with more than the animate dead. The black heart stones and their grooved control mechanisms present another use for the glowing blade. Though the more complex black heart puzzles may require some owly consideration to surmount...\nCombat\nThere are no hit points for you or enemies, so every hit matters.\nMy philosophy for designing the combat elements of Down Ward is that a successful combat action should change what you need to do next, rather than only changing how many times you need to do the same thing to deplete a health pool.\nEven enemies defeated in a single attack can change your options after you land a hit. For instance, you can use the bodies of defeated skelly owls as temporary platforms.\nFacing a mix of enemies with different behavior and defeat criteria, when each action will change the state of things, requires more thinking on the fly. So to Speak. :)\nI want the combat to work more like a kinetic puzzle than a war of hit point attrition.\nAs a result, the ability to weave a blade through larger and more complex hosts of foes will come from your growing skill, rather than a weapon that does more damage.\nColors\nDown Ward's retro hand-held inspired graphics use a 4 color palette.\nThere are well over 100 color palettes to choose from:\nSome mimic the venerable monochrome LCD, from an age before time was time. You can play in the original 160 x 144 Game Boy resolution if you so choose. (Scaled up to fit your monitor of course.)\nThere are even a few palettes for the little known avian holidays of Talontines Day...\n (Wherein your friends very patiently endure your inability to sit still. It's tradition.)\n\n...and of course Owlloween! \n(Pictured below, Owlloween colorized)\n(Note: Birdie Pumpkins do appear in game for the month of October, up to Halloween!)\n\nDisplay support\nDown Ward automatically resizes itself to fit whatever display shape it finds itself in. It should always use all the display area it's given to work with.\nIt will also make sure that it always scales up the game visuals by an integer amount, to keep all the pixel art perfectly sharp.\nSo, 16:9, 16:10, 3:4, Widescreen, even vertical aspect monitors will work.\nSpeedruns, Challenge runs, & Metrics\n\"Hourglass\" is a set of unlockable game modes built around time attack and variants of time attack unique to Down Ward. In the \"Airborne\" game mode, for instance, your timer only runs when you're touching the ground, so limiting time on the ground is how you improve your time-score.\nAlso included are various metrics available in the Stats menu that can be used for devising alternate Speedrun, & Challenge Run goals. These include keeping count of a variety of in-game actions, as well as time spent in levels, best run times, and time in the air or on the ground, among others. Additionally your distance traveled, flown, walked, and others are recorded and can be viewed in Feet, Meters, Miles, or Kilometers.\n\u25c6 12,000: Boss Rush, Challenge Game Mode. \nAn unlockable Boss Rush challenge mode. Fight all the bosses in game in staggered waves, flanked by the various haunts of the deep wilds, and environmental hazards therein!\nFail, and Gable may be required to have a picnic with the boss that defeated her. Such is the fearful custom of the old ways.\n\u25c6 14,000: 7 Sisters, Survival Arena Game Mode. \nAn unlockable challenge. Fight all of the 7 Sisters simultaneously in a large survival level. Don't want to spoil too much, but expect to be at a picnic for 8.\nTesting and feedback will be final arbiter, but to give a bit of a design sketch, my inclination is to structure this challenge as follows:\nUpon entering the arena, you'll face one of the seven, chosen randomly, along with a host of hostile haunts. As the stage progresses, likely by completing side objectives, each successive sister will be summoned into the arena. The sequence of sisters will be shuffled like a deck of cards, making each playthrough different. When all the sisters are summoned, if you survive that long, they become vulnerable and the real fight begins!\n\u25c6 16,000: Multiple music tracks for each world. \nMultiple music tracks for each world, instead of just one major theme per world.\nAnyone donating at a level that receives the Soundtrack reward, will also get all of the additional tracks added by this goal.\n\u25c6 18,000: Sidereal Mode - A \"Newgame +\" Campaign \nA second much harder variant of the main campaign of the game, unlockable by beating the game once.\nOne of the most surprising things to me about working on this game was how much your skill in flying can grow. By the time you complete your first playthrough of the game, you'll be able to fly and fight in ways you'd have thought impossible when you first started your journey.\nRevisit the campaign, but with more hazards, more adversaries, and in more complex and treacherous combinations. This new game mode will stress your improved skills, and test what you've learned in the fire, as you delve into the far more hostile wilds.\n\n\u25c6 20,000: Post-Kickstarter physical item Add-ons\nI've been considering for a while now the possibility of adding a 5th stretch goal. A lot of people have asked about either, physical rewards of some kind, or equivalent post-Kickstarter physical items, to be available after the campaign ends. I think it's a little close to the end to add in physical rewards directly to the Kickstarter, as I worry some people will likely only check back after the campaign ends, and I don't want them to feel left out. \nAt this goal, I will work out how to set up physical Down Ward add-ons that would be available after the Kickstarter, and that way everyone could join in if they wanted. This would likely be shaped in part by backer suggestions and interest. I've had people ask about shirts, posters, ceramic pins, and plenty more. I could make a list of the things that have been suggested to see what people think about the possible options.\nWho is working on this project?\nI'm Fisholith, a solo indie developer. :)\nI program the game & rigorous owl logic\npixel the art\npaint the other art\nanimate the characters\ncompose the music\ndesign the sound\ndevise the mechanics\nconstruct the levels\nwrite the writables\nbusiness the businessy stuff.\nThough being a solo dev does not mean being a creative island, and without the feedback, critique, suggestions, and help offered by many of the wonderful players of Down Ward, it would not have reached the point it has.\nWhat is the funding for?\nIf the Kickstarter succeeds, I'm going to be working as a solo developer, doing all of the things mentioned above, for a little under a year, for the main game, and more than a year when factoring in some of the rewards that require the game to be completed. This funding offsets some of the cost of committing to that. In addition to this funding, I'll be contributing a fair amount myself from personal savings. \nContact\nIf you have any questions, feel free to contact me via any of the following:\n Down Ward contact page (likely the fastest) \nKickstarter's direct message system.\nTwitter @Fisholith\nfi@fisholith.com\nOr even on Game Jolt: Fisholith on Game Jolt \nRewards overview\n\"GG\" is an abbreviation of Grey Garden.\n** The rewards with a double star (**), have a later delivery date than the normal rewards. Check out the \"** Double Star rewards\" section at the end for more info.\nDown Ward game\nA download of the full game upon release!\nI made the below image for fun, I don't have a secret cartridge stockpile.\nbut I can dream... :)\nSoundtrack & Wallpapers\nA download of the entire soundtrack (DRM free), and desktop wallpapers.\nSome little Examples in different styles:\nNote that the Stretch Goal \"Multiple music tracks for each world\" would add several new songs to the soundtrack, and if that Stretch Goal is unlocked you will also get the new additional tracks.\nLikewise any of the higher backer tiers that result in the creation of additional tracks would also add the extra tracks to this reward for everyone. :)\nIf you're curious, this link (Fisholith Soundcloud) will take you to a few of the songs I composed for my prior little freeware game-jam projects. Down Ward is included as it started out as a little game jam project itself. :)\n\nDesign & Artbook PDF\nConcept art, design work, artifacts, locations, and fragments of lore from the world of Down Ward.\nBeta Access\nAccess to the commercial beta, which will be available before the game's final release. You'll be able to play the game as it grows. Your feedback and critique will help me shape and polish Down Ward. I'll also mark your Grey Garden credit to indicate that you participated in the beta. (Note that this commercial beta is different than the currently available freeware beta for the little freeware edition of the game, just in case you were wondering.)\nGrey Garden Credits - Some notes\nWhat is the \"Grey Garden\"? - The Grey Garden is a special in-game location any player will be able to visit in a lucid dream. Credits will be stored in heart stones, or creature statues, and when struck, the name they contain will be shown in a burst of light, then fade away slowly.\nNote: This is an example. The actual Grey Garden environment will be much larger. Also, don't worry, your statue won't be missing it's head. The one on the left is just in considerable disrepair. ;)\nGrey Garden - Shared Name Stone\nYour name, along with up to 4 others, will be stored in a shared heart stone in the Grey Garden. Striking the stone will show your name among those of your fellow stone-mates in a burst of light! You can be credited however you like, within reason. :)\nGrey Garden - Personal Name Stone\nYou'll get your own personal heart stone in the Grey Garden. Striking the stone will show your name above it in a burst of light.\nGrey Garden - Creature Statue\nA credit statue 2 times gable's height.\nYou'll get your own personal creature statue in the Grey Garden. There will be at least 10 different creature statues to choose from, each with at least two variations. They will be various owls, birds, snakes, and fish. Striking the stone statue will show your name above it in a burst of light.\nGrey Garden - Chromatic Creature Statue\nA chromatic credit statue 2 times gable's height.\nAn extension of the \"Creature Statue\" reward. When a chromatic creature statue is struck, In addition to showing your name in a burst of light, it will also transform the game's color palette to a color set of your design, choosing, or vague suggestion. :)\nWhen you leave the Grey Garden, the colors will go with you. For each chromatic creature color palette, there will be an achievement, for completing the game with that color palette.\nThis means you can get an achievement named after you. But more importantly, it means you can make a completionist play the game with four slightly different shades of black, only to (barely) see the name of their tormentor once more in the form of an achievement. (Seriously though, probably don't do 4 shades of black.)\nGrey Garden - Large Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 4 times gable's height. (or that length)\nYou'll get your own personal unique chromatic creature statue in the Grey Garden. Choose a creature from the list below and, describe a pose, submit a reference photo, or even go the concerningly creative route, do the pose yourself and submit a photo. Bonus points for making wings or antlers out of stuff you can find around your house. :)\nAny kind of:\nOwl\nBird\nDeer, (including the Frost-Tails of Down Ward.)\nSnake\nReptile\nFish\n(e.g. A falcon, python, or hog-nose-snake, are all valid options.)\nGrey Garden - Giant Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height. (or that length)\nPoses can be suggested or submitted as described in the \"Large Unique Statue\" reward above.\nAny kind of:\nOwl\nBird\nDeer, (including the Frost-Tails of Down Ward.)\nSnake\nReptile\nFish\nGrey Garden - Outlier Giant Unique Statue\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height, with alternative creatures.\nLike the \"Giant Unique Statue\" reward above, but with a much extended list of animals to choose from. See the \"Large Unique Statue\" reward for info on submitting pose ideas.\nNote: These are creatures I don't currently have a developed style for in Down Ward, so it might take a bit longer to figure out how I want them to look, to fit in with everything else.\nAny kind of:\nWolf or Fox\nCougar, Leopard, or Cheetah\nRabbit\nMouse or Rat\nRaccoon\nFerret or Weasel\nDolphin or Shark\nOctopus or Squid\nInsect or Arachnid\nCrustacean\nBat or other living flying animal\nArchaeopteryx, or other winged animal that is extinct or prehistoric.\nGrey Garden - Giant Statue (Natural/Outlier)\nCommission a unique chromatic credit statue 8 times gable's height, with any listed creature type.\nYou can pick the reward from either \"Custom Giant Statue\" or \"Outlier Custom Giant Statue\" above. This lets you pick from either list, giving you the entire range of natural and outlier animals as options for your giant statue.\nCo-compose a Character painting **\nI'll create a digital painting of a Down Ward character or pair of characters for you.\nPick one or two characters from Down Ward, and a simple scene or action.\nI'll create a painting based on the elements you picked, which I'll send you upon completion. Eventually, after I've completed all the other painting rewards, I'll add them all to a second wallpapers set for the wallpapers reward, so everyone getting the wallpapers including you, can enjoy all the new additions. The painting will include your \"requested by\" credit alongside mine on the final image. :)\nYou don't have to decide right away. As the project progresses, and I'm able to share a bit more of the lore and character details, you'll have more to draw from, when choosing the picture elements.\nWhat are some examples of one or two characters, and a simple-ish background? A portrait of Gable, tucked under Soliel's wing and peeping out, set against a foggy backdrop would work. Or Wisteria coiled up in snakey loops, resting on a heart block, against an out-of-focus green forest backdrop.\nExample of a painting that would work:\n\nCo-compose a Desktop painting **\nI'll create a digital painting of something Down Ward related for you.\nPick one to five characters from Down Ward, a setting or location from the game lore, and a simple scene or action.\nI'll create a painting based on the elements you picked, which I'll send you upon completion. Eventually, after I've completed all the other painting rewards, I'll add them all to a second wallpapers set for the wallpapers reward, so everyone including you, can enjoy all the new additions. The painting will include your \"requested by\" credit along side mine on the final image. :)\nYou don't have to decide right away. As the project progresses, and I'm able to share a bit more of the lore and character details, you'll have more to draw from, when choosing the picture elements.\nWhat are some examples of one to four characters, and a location setting? Gable, Wrenwen, and Ceruleine using Amaranth as a perch, resting in her antlers, in the arched entrance of Castle Gail Hallow. Or Wisteria looped around Kerna, wading into the shallows of the Palace in Reads. \nExample of a painting that would work:\n\n\nCo-design a Challenge level **\nI'll work with you to co-design a unique challenge level. The layout, enemy and hazard composition, emphasis on platforming/combat/exploration/puzzles, architecture and theme, are among the many elements to play with in the design of a level. Co-design a custom color palette for the level, which will also get added to the master palette list. You and other players will be able to warp into your level through your statue in Grey Garden.\nCo-design a 3-level set Challenge + Custom Music **\nMaximum owly peril awaits!\nI'll work with you to co-design a 3 stage sequence of Challenge levels. The layout, enemy and hazard composition, emphasis on platforming/combat/exploration/puzzles, architecture and theme, are among the many elements to play with in the design of a level. And in a level series, there's also the escalation of difficulty to consider. Co-design custom color palettes for each level, which will also get added to the master palette list. You and other players will be able to warp into your level set through your statue in Grey Garden.\nIn addition to the level design, I'll also create a custom music track for the level set, which you can help tailor the mood and tone of. This song will also be added to the Soundtrack reward for everyone. :)\n** Double Star rewards\nThe ETA for all normal (non-double star **) reward items is Dec 2021.\nOnly the reward items with a double star ** on the end will use a later date. This will likely be May 2022, but please check the tier in the rewards side-bar for the official extended date. This is because the double star ** rewards are likely to rely on content that will be more fleshed out by the time the game is nearing completion.\nIt also helps prevent the more involved custom reward work from colliding with the core project work.\nIf you've backed at a level that includes one of these rewards, I'll contact you before the end of Dec 2021 at the latest, but feel free to send me a message whenever you like, to ask questions or if you already have an idea of what you might want, and I'll keep it in mind for later. :)\nYou made it to the bottom!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf successful, this will be my first Kickstarted project, I'm a solo dev, and it's game development.

No matter how long they have been there, everyone will help you to find you way out.\nt. \nWe sometimes explain our game concept by saying it is a mix of fluid platformer Dead Cells and the 2D dungeon crawler Wizard of Legend. This last one was inspirating for its gameplay but also for its fantastic and aerial mood, in particular its original soundtrack composed by Dale North.\nWe are absolutely thrilled he accepted the collaboration as his work perfectly reflects our vision of the game\u2014filled with magic and gusto!\nIn a game like Astral Ascent, sound design is not just a way to make the universe sounds good\u2026 it will flesh out actions, spells, and bosses! We think our project requires an organic and juicy sound design that Romain Rope perfectly understood as you can \u201csee\u201d above.\nAttacks feel impactful and spells sound powerful but the sound design also really adds another dimension to our gorgeous 2D world.\n\nWe want our backers to pay the right price for their shipping costs so we are partnering with Backerkit in order to charge shipping closer to the delivery. This way, with the use of the pledge manager and the add-ons system, backers will pay the lowest shipping costs by grouping their items together and have the shipping fee calculated on the exact weight. Below you can find our current estimates, based on our discussions with our partners:\n Celestial Seeker (Physical edition + Zodiac cards + Genga print) \nEU:14\u20ac | US:10\u20ac | other: 16\u20ac (Add-ons shipping costs not included) \n\n Zodiac Tier (Physical edition + Zodiac cards + Genga print + 4 enamel pin's + Kickstarter Exclusive Ayla figure) \nEU:22\u20ac | US:18\u20ac | other: 24\u20ac (Add-ons shipping costs not included) \nFigure in production by Graphigaut\nAs an indie team trying to self-publish, we are facing major challenges. We know Kickstarter is a direct answer to most of them.\n1 - Get funded! This may be obvious but our main goal is getting enough funds to keep working on this dream project. Obviously, we do not entirely rely on the Kickstarter success as we reinvested all the money we earned from Dark Devotion and secured partnerships that financially helped us. As such, any additional money we make will directly be invested to improve the game's quality.\n2 - Get noticed by the media! Without a publisher behind us, we need to get the media\u2019s attention to be noticed. A successful Kickstarter campaign is a strong message sent to everyone and with your help, we have a better chance of being seen and heard!\n3 -  Get feedbacks! Our goal is to make a tremendously fun game. To do so, we believe we need feedback from players as soon and as much as possible. Demo and early access will be key elements to make the best possible game. We want to iterate in a direction that will satisfy our fan base.\nWe are univocally committed to making Astral Ascent the best possible game we can! For that, we need your support. Help us spread the word and make our first self-published game a true success story!\nWe are highly committed to release Astral Ascent on both PC (also available on Mac & Linux) and console. But as a young indie game studio self-publishing their game, we do not have experience on porting games. So we have made a partnership with MP2 Games: an expert company dedicated to porting games made on our engine (Construct 3).\nMP2 Games successfully ported amazing games such as:  \n Baba is you (Hempuli)\n Iconoclasts (Konjak & Bifrost Entertainment)\nand more recently Cyber Shadow (MekaSkull & Yacht Club Games)\nThis high quality partner will allow us to support all relevant platforms for Astral Ascent\nWe have already overcome the main challenges of the development : localization system, controls remapping, level generation, etc. Yes, it sounds weird, but trust us, these are terribly hard to do! We are now fully working on improving and expanding the game content which makes us relatively safe regarding schedule as we are experienced on these topics. \nSince we are building a rogue-lite game, we think Early Access is our best option to collect players feedback while improving the game. This way we are sure to release a finished product that will satisfy everyone\u2019s expectations.Thus, we cannot know for sure the exact time we will remain in Early Access in order to polish everything. Our estimated current schedule is :\n2022-Q1 - Early Access Release (Steam)\n2023 - Final PC & Console Release\nWhile in Early Access we will make frequent updates of content and also major updates such as releasing new bosses, new worlds to explore, and more!\n\nWe have translated Dark Devotion to a large panel of languages so as many players as possible could enjoy the stories & lore of the game. We made a lot of effort to have rich & fantastic background texts, we want the largest audience to fully appreciate them but localization costs money for such a limited ressources team as ours so we had to make choices that we wish to expend if the campaign is successful. \nCurrently targeted languages\nFrench | English | German | Russian | Brazilian Portuguese | Simplified Chinese | Traditional Chinese Japanese | Korean\nHibernian Workshop is an independent game studio based in France. What makes us special is that our studio has been founded by self-taught game developers and artists and it's your support from our previous successful  Kickstarter campaign that allowed us to create the studio and become professional. \nThanks to the success of Dark Devotion, we had the opportunity to add great talents to our small independent team. We all work remotely from our homes allowing more freedom to everyone. We are doing our best to work without crunch with an humble and positive mindset.\n\n Louis Denizet - Creative Director & Programmer - @DenizetLouis \n Alexandre Magnat - Lead Artist & Pixel Artist -  @Skreed3 \n Renan \"Relixes\" Rodrigues - Gameplay Programmer - @Relixes \n Ga\u00ebl Giudicelli - Concept & Pixel Artist - @444Pixels \n Romain Rope - Sound Designer - @RomainRope \n Anthony Jauneaud - Narrative Designer - @iamleyeti \n Dale North - Music Composer - @DaleNorth \n R\u00e9gion Nouvelle Aquitaine - Financial Support - @NvelleAquitaine \n Maple Whispering - Publisher for Asia - @MapleWhispering \n Limited Run Games - Physical editions - @LimitedRunGames \n MP2 Games - Console Port - @matpow2 \n Tokkun Studio - Animation Studio - @TOKKUNSTUDIO \n ICO Partners - Marketing Agency - @icopartners \n Dan \u2018Mikal\u2019 Shimizu - Effects Consultant - @kindeyegames \n Boell Oyino - Illustrator - @BoellOyino \n Lyne \"Boo\" Hehlen - Cinematic Storyboarder - @ly__Boo \n From The Void - Localization & Proofreading agency - @FromTVoid \n Graphigaut - Figure sculptor -  @Graphigaut \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAstral Ascent is a complex game, it will require a lot of artistic work as well as a lot of systems to create the perfect replayability alchemy we are looking for.\nWe even added local co-op! \n\nEvery Kickstarter campaign comes with a portion of risks but we hope we proved our dedication to put all our heart in our creations despite challenges we could face with the success of our previous game.\n\nWe are not just starting the game, we hired greatly talented people to work with and we took months to set the direction and already made every main systems that we felt were scary to make.\n\nIt is a clear vision that we share and move forward together, we are really close to be able to publish the game by ourselves, without a publisher, we only need your help to make it real!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Astral Supporter", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["23 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Astral Aspirant", "descp": "Get access to the game as soon as possible with Early Access (Steam) + get the final game at a lower price than its release price.\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbe Digital copy + Early Access to the game (Steam)\n\u2b50\ufe0f Your name in the credits (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83c\udf31 Exclusive Discord Role (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83d\udcf1 Exclusive HD Wallpaper (computer & phone)\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["1,015 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac22 or more", "title": "Astral Aspirant (Consoles)", "descp": "Get access to the game on console on day launch at a lower price than its release price.\n\u231b - Select the console platform you prefer in a later survey.\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbe A digital copy for console\n\u2b50\ufe0f Your name in the credits (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83c\udf31 Exclusive Discord Role (as \"Astral backer\")\n\ud83d\udcf1 Exclusive HD Wallpaper (computer & phone)\n\ud83d\udcdd Get project updates\nHelp us to self-publish and reach the stars!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2023"}], "stat": ["356 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Astral Seeker", "descp": "Why choose?

It is heavily inspired by classics such as Zelda and Terranigma, combined with rogue-lite elements. Holomento will release on PC, with console ports being potential Stretch Goals, should the funding goal be reached.\n Explore a hand-crafted open world featuring procedurally generated dungeons!\n Fight your way through Eventide Hollow - again and again!\n Rebuild the Hollow and release it from its ruinous curse!\nEventide Hollow was a lovely kingdom where its people lived in peace. It was once a vast land with free roaming folks and expanding villages, but now it is filled with darkness, strange creatures, and guarded townsfolk. It seems peace doesn't last forever.\nA horrible curse was laid upon the land and Eventide Hollow fell into despair. The source of the curse was also its only protection from it... the Holomento.\nThe Holomento traps the souls of all who possess it, the mysterious book affixes itself to those who seek passage through the Hollow. If the Traveler dies, their soul is also added to the Holomento before it returns to its resting place awaiting the next traveler.\nOnce acquired, the book is tied to the soul of the traveler holding it. The Holomento cannot leave the Eventide Hollow and therefore any Traveler who possesses it cannot leave the land.\nHolomento enables you to write your own story as generations of Travelers pass through a land desperate for help. Open shortcuts, reveal secrets, locate ancient relics, and build improvements to enhance the Hollow for future travels...\n...or just invest into the Hollow's Stonk Market (yes, it's real) to enrich yourself - we won't judge!\nHere's a quick overview of a handful of regions you're going to see during your travels!\nDue to the curse, travelling through Eventide Hollow is quite dangerous, with many enemies that you will have to deal with. Thankfully, Travelers are well versed in handling all kinds of weaponry, from swords and bows to handguns and... grenade launchers?\nDiscover a variety of traditional and nontraditional weapons. Upgrade your stats by collecting hundreds of different items, including special weapons, and utilizing item skills to bring destruction to the dark creatures of the Hollow!\nChoose from a variety of starting classes! Each class begins with a unique set of items and changes how you will fight your way through the Hollow drastically!\nDue to the curse, most towns in Eventide Hollow were destroyed. Now only ruins and corruption indicate what once was a beautiful kingdom. Those that remain are hidden in plain sight. Hope is the only thing left for the surviving inhabitants - but even that is vanishing. \nDuring your journeys, you will have the opportunity to restore the Hollow to its former glory! Upgrading shops and homes, rebuilding towns, and improving the Hollow will help you on your future journeys!\nAll towns are upgradeable via their shops and storefronts. Each town has a number of common amenities that are uniquely essential to it. Upgraded towns will reward you with many benefits and also allow you access to the local Stonk Market! It allows you to invest in local businesses and grow your influence and wealth throughout the Hollow.\nHolomento is currently in a playable Alpha state. While you are able to complete runs at this point, several aspects of gameplay like dungeons, proper town rebuilding and many of the planned items have not been implemented yet. Development progress has been steady and will continue to be thanks to our amazing community of Alpha testers. They have kindly given us plenty of valuable feedback during the ongoing alpha phase!\nYou can also find the full road map right >HERE<!\nThe funding crowdsourced through Kickstarter will allow us to make Holomento something truly special.\n\nThe game so far has been entirely self-funded and has finally arrived at a state where we will need the help of outside contributors and freelancers to give the project the polish it needs! \nFunds will be going towards supporting the game's composer, sound designer, artists and some new artists we will hire for 3D modelling and animation primarily. Some of the funds will be held for software licenses and assets we will need during further development of the game.\n\nIf you want to listen to a few samples of our amazing soundtrack by Adeel Jafree make sure to give the Holomento OST Playlist a listen!

Pick between four difficulty modes or use the accessible Assist Mode! \nYou can try the demo for free on Itch.io or Gamejolt.\nThe game currently runs only on Windows.\nAdditionally, when backing the Game Tester tier, you will be granted full access to the alpha version of the game. This includes all the currently built areas, relics, bosses and content.\nYou'll gain access to the early access version as soon as the Kickstarter ends and will have permanent access throughout the games development with new content updates dropping around every month or two.\nThroughout developing this game I have come to appreciate testers and feedback a lot. I am very much looking forward towards building this game with the people who want to see this game grow into the best it can be!\nThis map is less than 50% of the World!\nThe Demo contains the first area in the game, which has 2 Bosses and a couple of upgrades. It's a small slice of the early part of the game and does not have many upgrades but it lets you try how the game plays.\nThe early access version right now contains 6 explorable areas, some more finished than others. There are 13 fully functional bosses, 13 spells, 59 relics and around 15 abilities. Not all spells and relics can be found in the world right now but they are all fully implemented and can be used (through cheats). The alpha version contains possibly 10+ hours of content and the full game will contain much more and generally be much more polished, hoping to make a 50+ hour game.\nYou will be able to collect a lot of Upgrades!\nCombat is simplistic but precise, our protagonist Greencap uses a sword as his main weapon. Throughout the game you will learn different type of slashes and attacks, your arsenal will grow and the playstyle will change. \nGreencap also has a parry which can negate incoming damage, not only that but you can trigger the successful parry into a dodge-roll for additional protection and mobility! This combined with the dashes and other special moves you have gives Greencap some great mobility!\nSatisfying!\nMy design philosophy behind the combat is to make it as fair as possible, where enemies have distinctive behaviours that are easy to learn and memorize. You will be acquiring new abilities and spells through bosses. \nIt's the same philosophy there where I want boss attacks to be telegraphed clearly and patterns easy to memorize.\nI try to avoid randomness as much as possible and I think bosses are an area where testers will help tremendously with making them feel fun and fair. I am also not afraid of remaking stuff entirely in case a boss turns out not the be fun!\nUse spells in creative ways! You will never get the most out of a spell by just casting it, in Lone Fungus the spells are really an extension of your sword. The spells react to how you swing at them with your sword, each spell reacts differently and this gives combat and platforming some depth because most spells have several uses not just in combat but also in platforming.\nEach spell-type represents a culture of mushrooms that used to live in the kingdom, which powers you will acquire. You will gain one new spell per area and your mushroom cap changes based on which spell you have equipped.\nSome spells are mainly useful in combat while others are also used in traversing the world and unlocking new areas, where striking them with your sword in the right way might bounce you in a direction. Or their effects might be used in puzzles for opening up new areas.\nGet creative with spells!\nLone Fungus is very much a platforming focused Metroidvania, probably more than most other ones.\nIn the beginning my main inspiration for this game was Hollow Knight, but I wanted to expand the sword pogo-mechanic and generally feature more platforming based gameplay. Several people did call my game Hollow Knight + Celeste, at the time I hadn't played Celeste yet, but I got it a short while after and ended up loving it!\nThe hardest platforming sections will be optional and no lore hidden behind a path full of pain!\nI embraced the similarities and got further inspired by that game. I do believe my game brings some new mechanics though, one of these are the mushmovers. These are magical objects placed all over the world which are used for traversal and platforming. They come in various varieties and give the platforming a blend of striking with your sword at the right time and controlling your momentum!\nThe protagonist Greencap has many movement based abilities other than spells too, he can dash forward and up and also has a spinning jump. He can also bounce off surfaces with his sword and accelerate at very high speeds if you combine it with your dash! \nGreencap also has a crouching super-jump and a meteor-strike. All this combined with the mushmovers and spells does make the movement tech in this game quite deep and adds something interesting for people who enjoy complex mechanics. For people who enjoy a more casual or exploration/story based experience, do not worry! There is an assist mode and more on it below.\nHow about you speedrun the game like this?\n I made a video showing off some of the potential speed-runner tech the game has to offer!\nSome people have shown great interest in the game but get concerned about the tough and skill-based platforming aspect of the game and for me it's not just important to make the game feel really responsive and fair, but also accessible! Even though the game is very focused on platforming and designed to be challenging there are options to play the game how you want through an assist-mode! You can pick between minor and major options which make the game easier in different ways. Other than an assist mode the game also features four different difficulty modes which will additionally increase replay value.\nLone Fungus is set in a world built by ancient mushrooms, where you play as the only mushroom left. The setting is very much based on your loneliness in the world and the search for what happened to the Mushrooms who built this world, and what your role is. \nThe storytelling will be told through the environment and through the few entities you can talk to, which are interact-able sculptures that tell you about the past and the present. These are remnants infused with magic that gives them the ability to speak and remember events. They are not merely lore-tablets, instead they react to your progress in the game with their own unique personality based on what kind of mushroom culture who has built them. When you find new abilities and revisit them they will tell you new stories. They also may offer hints on not just story elements but also on secrets and perhaps what you should be doing to progress.\nAs a musician i will be doing the music for the game myself!\nI may not be the best composer that produces the greatest quality tracks but I do feel like i know how i want my game to sound! I also do want to put my own vibe into the soundtrack as this project is very personal to me. I'm aiming for the game to have a SNES era feel to the music while also being modern and punchy, each area will have it's own track where the setting is reflected in the music!\nCheck some of the tunes out below!\n\nColor Caverns \nAcid Dungeon\n Astral Realm\nBlue Palace\nUntil now creating this game has only been a hobby, a hobby which has brought me a great sense of purpose and I truly enjoy working on this project. My dream is to work full-time as a game developer, run my own company and do more games like this in the future. By funding this Kickstarter you are funding me as an individual and my passion for video games and world-crafting.\nWho am i?\nYou can call me Basti and I really love games, music and art. I used to do games as a kid when I was 12-15 but in my adult life spent more time with music and art.\nIn December 2019 I started playing around with game development again just for fun and as I was doing a platformer I almost got struck by a sort of an epiphany. \nI've often wanted to do a full game but I thought it felt too hard or that it was not possible, but now I feel I can really do this. I decided I really wanted to make a Metroidvania game in the style of Hollow Knight but with more platforming and some unique mechanics and I have not stopped since then. I believe I've made great progress and I feel like I know what I want to do with my life now.\nI am a person who has a need to express myself creatively or else I feel like I'm dying inside. Game development gives me so many ways to express myself through art, music or gameplay and I feel like anything is possible. \nI've been told by the Swedish Tax agency that I can expect about 30-50% of the Kickstarter income to go to taxes, this is after Kickstarters cut (around 45% of funding goal max i hope). Even with this in mind the Kickstarter funding will sustain my living costs for a year. Me and my girlfriend recently also moved to a cheaper apartment to reduce our living costs to make this possible. Doing this Kickstarter will fund development time for atleast a year, allowing me to focus on the development of Lone Fungus.\nThere are two exclusive backer skins you can get through the Kickstarter. These are skins you can wear throughout the game and since Greencap can change his cap based on his spells there will also be an option to overwrite the spell-caps with the equipped skin. The plan is to have more unlockable skins in the full game by beating the game in certain ways or finding secrets. The skins will be something you will be able to pick in the main menu of the game and chose and switch when ever you want to as long as you have them unlocked.\n(These skins are subject to change & improvement based on backer feedback)\nAll the Designer rewards will have to be designed with me, it's a process that'll we'll have to go through together. I'll do everything to put your ideas into the game but not everything you suggest might fit. The crazier idea you have the more chance it'll be put in as an end-game secret but I'll truly try to put in whatever you might suggest to the best of my ability. Just keep in mind there might be limitations to what I can put in and that perhaps compromises might have to be made. It's great if you have multiple ideas!\nGet immortalized in the 'Hall of Immortals' as an ancient mushroom statue portraying you as a hero, villain or just a character from the past. Get to decide what the inscription on the statue will say and put your message in the game!\nThe 'Hall of Immortals' will be a secret room in the game.\nDesign your own skin and get to play with it in the game! You will also be able to decide how players will acquire the skin in the game! (you will get the skin unlocked if you want to)\nRelics are equippable upgrades which might do anything from change how a current ability behaves, to give you a totally new one! (Like Charms in Hollow Knight) Decide everything from how it will look to what it will do!\nDecide how an enemy will look and what kind of behaviour it will have! The world of Lone Fungus consists of many strange creatures and monsters, it's not set in a realistic world but a magical one! So this can be any type of fantasy creature you can think of!\nDesign your own Talking Sculpture, this will be an interactable character in the game. You will get to decide it's personality and what kind of things it will tell the player, and also what its appearance will be!\nDesign a full boss battle! This can consist of several stages or behaviours! Decide on how it will look and what type of attacks and weaknesses the boss will have. You will even be able to decide what kind of obstacles there will be in the Room where you fight the boss!\nThis can be any crazy idea you have, well almost. If you are a creative person with many ideas then this tier is for you! You will be able to design whatever you'd like for the game as long as it's doable. It can be anything from a totally new ability to a platforming mechanic and it'll be a design process we will go through together to add something really cool to the game which i have not thought of myself!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks in the development time of the game. I am confident I will finish the game because around 50% is already finished and if this was a shorter Metroidvania it could very well be finished already. In a worst case scenario where I don't manage to get everything done until the deadline, the game might get delayed or parts could get released as free DLC. I'd like to do free DLC either way probably, but I have plans on what I want to be included in the base game when it releases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nIt's a digital product.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge SEK 179 or more", "title": "Play the Full game!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbd Digital Copy of the Full Game (Steam)\n\ud83d\udd14Exclusive backer updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["326 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 290 or more", "title": "Music Lover!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbd Digital Copy of the Full Game (Steam)\n\ud83d\udd14Exclusive backer updates\n\ud83e\ude95Digital Copy of the Original Soundtrack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge SEK 315 or more", "title": "Super Backer!

Maybe it wasn\u2019t always, but it is now. And the world out there is darkening, like the sky before a late-summer storm.\nThese are good people, here in Stonetop. Your kith and your kin.\nIf you don\u2019t step up to protect them, who will?\nStonetop is a \u201chearth fantasy\u201d tabletop RPG set in an Iron Age that never was. The players portray the heroes of an isolated village near the edge of the known world. Their adventures focus on dealing with threats to the village and seizing opportunities. These aren\u2019t rootless mercenaries seeking fortune and glory; they\u2019re exceptional people, taking risks on behalf of their friends, family, and neighbors.\nLike most tabletop RPGs, Stonetop plays out as a conversation between the game master (GM) and the players, with dice being rolled at key moments to determine which direction the story goes. The game can be played in short runs of 2-4 sessions (each about 3-4 hours long), but is best experienced over a dozen or more sessions.\nStonetop is \u201cPowered by the Apocalypse,\u201d using a system and framework similar to games like Apocalypse World, Monster of the Week, or Masks: a New Generation. It started as a setting guide for Dungeon World, but over 5 years of development and playtesting, it\u2019s become a standalone game. Knowledge of Dungeon World may ease your entry into the game, but it's not a prerequisite for play.\nPrintable play aids include all of Stonetop's core \"moves\"\u2014the rules that drive the game.\nFeatures of the system include:\n A rich and well-realized world of gritty Iron Age fantasy adventure, providing enough detail to ground play immediately while leaving plenty of room for the players and GM to make the setting their own.\n 9 distinct types of player-character (see below), each with their own reasons to look out for their community and seek adventure beyond its walls.\n Rules for governing and improving the village itself across the seasons and over the course of years.\n Rules for overland travel that capture the excitement of setting out into the unknown and the relief of returning home after a long time away.\n Hand-drawn maps depicting the village of Stonetop itself, its immediate surroundings, and the extent of the known world.\n An extensive setting almanac covering important regions, points of interest, neighboring settlements, creatures of the wild, and eerie remnants of past civilizations.\n A collection of unique magic items, each with special rules for unlocking its mysteries, powers, and dangers.\n Guidelines and advice for the GM, including step-by-step processes for collaborative customization of the village, adventure creation, and shaping a developing campaign.\n\u201cI had a chance to play this with a small group, including one person who usually didn't enjoy RPGs. We only played one session, and he still talks to me about how special it was to him. I would play it again in a heartbeat.\u201d \u2014William H., Vox Arcana Podcast\nClick through for full-size page spread\nA close-knit community burns bright at the edge of the known world, surrounded by mystery and danger. Rainwater collects in the Cistern; iron is shaped at the forge; magic is rare and fearsome; the will of the gods is discerned from the shapes of the clouds. Only the bravest venture far from the Ringwall, but upon these few the future of the village depends. \nEnough setting detail is provided to start everyone on the same page, but as the players create and introduce their heroes, they begin to shape the world to their personal and collective interests. The game text establishes a foundation upon which each group builds their own unique version of Stonetop.\nAlthough extensive guides to the village, its environs, creatures, and other elements are included, this material is designed less as a \u201csetting bible\u201d and more as a toolkit full of prompts and resources for the players and GM to exploit.\nClick through for full-size page spread\n\"I love the setting, from the ancient ruins and wild places haunted by fae, spirits, and much stranger things (hypnotic baboon-headed snakes!) to the magic that demands sacrifice and promises terrible consequences. Every setting detail is richly evocative and meant to be played, not just read, with countless hooks, prompts, blanks, and questions that have spurred my creativity and my players\u2019 enthusiastic collaboration.\" \u2014Matt Wetherbee, playtester\nAt the start of a new game, each player creates one hero to play. There are nine different archetypes, each with a unique set of possible backgrounds, abilities, and connections to the village, all defined by the player during the first game session: \nEach playbook is designed to hold \"inserts\" for tracking things like inventory, the Marshal's crew, or the Ranger's animal companion:\nClick through for a PDF of the Seeker's playbook.\nInterior of the Seeker's playbook with inventory insert\n\u201cI love it. The character creation is evocative and really feels like play... It creates not only your character\u2019s backstory and relationship to other player characters, but also to Stonetop and the NPCs in Stonetop. When you are done with session zero, not only are you psyched to play your character and interact with the other player characters, but you are attached to the village.\u201d \u2014Christo Meid, playtester\nThe village of Stonetop has its own character sheet, or \u201cplaybook,\u201d with stats, traits, and improvements to be unlocked in play. This playbook drives much of the game. For example, the village\u2019s \"Fortunes\" directly affect what new threats or opportunities each new season brings, and the players must manage the community\u2019s \"Surplus\" to avoid disaster when winter comes. As a game of Stonetop progresses, the village playbook changes in response to the victories and failures of the player-characters. And as the village changes, so do the threats and opportunities that heroes face.\nClick through for a PDF of the steading playbook.\n\"I didn't know how much I needed a game that let me play out Our Town or Main Street or Gilmore Girls in a fantasy setting until I played Stonetop and realized it might be the only game I needed. Stonetop not only helps players create amazing adventures. It also creates a persistent, believable place. Players will come to care about that place and the people who live there deeply.\" \u2014Emily VanDerWerff, Vox\nThe game includes dozens of magic items and locations (\"arcana\") that the heroes can acquire and learn to use. Each has special rules for unlocking its mysteries, tapping its powers, and\u2014for the most powerful items\u2014the consequences of doing so.\nThese arcana are designed to be printed as two-sided cards, to be given to players as handouts.\nClick through for PDF examples of major and minor arcana (spoiler alert!)\n\"Stonetop's unique take on magic items\u2014requiring effort to understand and activate and each coming with their own set of costs and consequences\u2014is fresh, rewarding, and surprisingly intuitive. Each Major and Minor Arcana has a character of its own that drives its story forward, each one naturally forming a story hook that is as unique as the character who wields it.\" \u2014Chris Thompson, playtester\nThe goal of this campaign is to fund the printing of two high-quality hardback books:\n Book I: Stonetop contains the core rules and extensive guidance for the GM. ~400 pages.\n Book II: The Wider World and Other Wonders is a setting almanac that details the regions, sites, monsters, and arcana (magic items) unique to Stonetop. ~250 pages.\nThese books will be 5.5\"x8.5\" (\"digest\" size), hardback, printed offset, and jam-packed with beautiful pen-and-ink illustrations by artist Lucie Arnoux.\nHere's an early mock-up of the books to convey their intended size:\nMock-up for scale (cover designs not final)\nAnd here's a mock-up with a more stone-like feel, showing the stretch-goal slipcase that will be included with every set of books:\nClick through for a higher resolution image.\nAll backers will receive PDFs of both books and additional play aids. The PDFs will be thoroughly bookmarked and hyperlinked to maximize ease of use.\n\"What can I say about Stonetop that hasn\u2019t been said already? I could wax lyrical at length about the wild grandeur of the setting, the clarity of the GMing techniques, the evocative poetry of the playbooks, how well the moves bind the game around the village and its material human concerns, the balance it finds between unique worldbuilding and blank spaces crying out to be made your own.\n\"Instead I\u2019ll just say this: for four years now, this has been the game I come back to time and time again, always bringing new friends with me. I\u2019m playing in a campaign now and still I know that in months to come I\u2019ll hear the call again, pull on my GMing boots, and go wandering once more up to that little village at the top of the world.\" \u2014Luke Jordan, game designer, Games from the Wildwood\nAnyone who backs at the Print + Digital level has the option to select additional rewards, in the form of art prints and/or a custom character illustration by Stonetop's artist, Lucie Arnoux.

Each project has been slightly more ambitious than the last, which has allowed me to gradually improve my knowledge base and set reasonable goals.\n\nContent and art is 75% complete for Stonetop, so the main challenge I see is making sure that the printing and fulfillment of the two books goes smoothly. There may be delays, for instance, if I ask for extensive corrections after seeing the printer's proofs, or if other aspects of production don't meet my expectations. For previous projects I have shipped all rewards myself, so going with third-party fulfillment is also an unknown.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Stonetop - Digital Edition", "descp": "Both books (600+ pages total) and all play aids in PDF form.

London\u2019s deeper secrets will only emerge over multiple playthroughs!\nThe gameplay of Mask of the Rose extends beyond dialogue. You'll open new locations on the map, gather outfits and disguises, work odd jobs and collect resources. Together, this will determine what you can attempt in social situations \u2013 and how much you can get away with!\nMask of the Rose will be coming to console platforms as well as PC, Mac and Linux. We\u2019re offering Steam or GOG keys as backer rewards. Mask of the Rose will also be available on Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X/S. \nMask of the Rose is set in Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a train journey away. \nWe\u2019ve been exploring the Fallen London universe over eleven years and five different games (including Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies). If you\u2019re a newcomer, Mask of the Rose is the perfect jumping-on point. If you\u2019re already a fan, it offers new discoveries and a chance to explore more personal stories, including encounters with favourite characters.\nMask of the Rose begins in 1862, just months after London was stolen by bats and relocated to the Neath: a vast cavern far below the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. And it's rapidly becoming clear that London isn't going to be returning to the Surface any time soon\u2026\n\nWhen you create your character in Mask of the Rose, you\u2019ll choose what your life was like before you were caught in London\u2019s fall. Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or work on the docks? Your choice will determine how you dress, what you know, and where you fit in.\nWhatever your origins, the Fall cut you off from your family and resources. Now, you are beginning a new job for none other than Mr Pages, one of London\u2019s mysterious new Masters...\n\nThe old laws are suddenly in disarray, and London's citizens must make new lives for themselves.\nFor your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall is a liberation \u2013 the chance to be taken seriously in a position that would have been denied her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.\nFor your other housemate Archie, the change is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?\nAnd when Archie is arrested for murder (even though the victim has since returned to life, and is feeling much better now thanks) you may begin to moonlight in detective work. Can you crack the mystery of London's first homicide since the Fall?\nLondon is rather the worse for wear after being dragged below ground. Not everything survived, nothing is the same, and no one can quite explain what has happened.\nIn Mask of the Rose you'll be able to visit a number of different locations in the city, including:\n\nBefore London fell, Horatia\u2019s was your temporary home. Now it\u2019s the only place in the city that feels familiar \u2013 until, that is, one of your own is arrested, and Horatia starts taking in new lodgers \u2013 not all of them human.\n\nAfter surviving the Fall relatively intact, Tentergrounds has become a home to many. Among them is David \u2013 Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim \u2013 as he tries to understand his own death and return.\n\nCrucial secrets are hidden in your own fragmented memories of London's Fall. But are you brave enough to relive them?\n\nA new literary salon is gathering all the brightest stars in London. The host has amber eyes, a scalding handshake, and a previous address in Hell itself, but he\u2019s an excellent listener.\n\nOnce a 40-gun frigate, the HMS Ungulate has been converted into a temporary prison. Unless you can prove his innocence, Archie may be spending a very long time there.\nMask of the Rose is a story about love, in many forms. The choice is yours: will you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached yourself? Or are you looking for lasting love? Or shorter assignations? Or perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way?\nEvery major storyline will be accessible regardless of whether your approach is romantic or platonic \u2013 even if the final endings may vary.\nHere are a few of the characters you'll meet:\n\nRachel was halfway through her latest novel when normal, workaday London ceased to exist \u2013 and her literary inspiration along with it. But meeting Milton has rekindled her passion for writing. He might be her suitor; he might be her Muse; he might be an actual devil, if you believe in that kind of thing. Her brother David hates him, but Rachel isn\u2019t about to let that stand in her way.\n\nHarjit hasn't lived in London long. But when catastrophe struck, he knew someone would need to organise volunteers, dig out basements, and round up the lost. Besides, he had a missing person of his own to find. For lack of other options, he stepped into a constable's uniform \u2013 and into a job that grows daily more unpredictable.\nNow he\u2019s had to arrest Archie for murder. The evidence says Archie did it. Harjit\u2019s intuition points the other way \u2013 but lately, trusting his intuition has led only to heartbreak.\n\nFor a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. But since the Fall, supplies are scarce, and her boarders can't afford their rent. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.\n\nMr Pages runs the Ministry of Accounting and Recounting, which has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting Fallen London\u2019s first census! A lover of the written word, Pages has never struck such a rich vein as London.\nIt does have a lot of questions for you, however. How do people declare their affectioniments, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetistically speaking?\nExpress Yourself through Fashion. In Mask of the Rose you are what you wear. Manage an expanding wardrobe that offers a host of options. Sometimes the right disguise or outfit will get you into a social occasion. Other times, the effect will be more subtle: giving you the confidence to take a reckless action, or provoking the reaction you need from another character.\nExplore widely. Experience the city through three seasons \u2013 the season of confessions, the season of Yule, and the season of the Feast of the Rose. Each day you\u2019ll read the news, learn of any recent events and opportunities, and then turn to the map to choose your next action. Will you find Rachel and interrogate her about the night of the murder? Comfort Archie in prison? Work at one of several jobs to earn money, or use your resources to unlock a new part of the city?\nCollect the stories of Londoners \u2013 and especially their affairs of the heart. You begin as a census-taker with a notebook full of questions. The more you learn, the more it fills up \u2013 and unlocks new lines of inquiry. For some reason, Mr Pages is especially keen for its census-takers to document the \u201cassignations and besotments\u201d of London\u2019s citizens. Why is it that London\u2019s new Masters are so preoccupied with stories of romance\u2026?\nOur digital rewards range from corvid companions to choosing a Fallen London character to feature in Mask of the Rose!  We are delighted to be partnering with Gametee to create and deliver our physical rewards for Mask of the Rose. \nGametee create items that enhance gaming culture - the finest quality, the most environmentally and socially conscious, and above all, the most beautiful. We have a lot in common with Gametee as independent British businesses, and we admire not just their design aesthetic, but their whole approach - from their remuneration of artists to their environmental policies. When looking for a partner, we were especially impressed with the quality of their products and the creativity of their designs.\n\nMilton\u2019s Parlour, the best (and most unholy) literary salon in London. Sweet honey, heady rose, and the traces of ivy. \nMr Pages' Den, where scandalous documents urgently await censorship. Parchment, cypress shelving, and just a hint of ink.\nA twin pack of gloriously fragranced gaming candles themed to Mask of the Rose. Hand-poured, vegan (100% natural soy wax) and handmade in England. They burn for up to 20 hours and come in keepsake tins.\nCrafted using the finest archival quality cardstock, each magnificent city map measures 42cm X 59cm (16.5 X 23.4in) and will help make better sense of life in the Neath. This map captures London as it was at the time of the Fall. Includes a hand-numbered certificate of authenticity commemorating your special investment in the campaign.\nFor illustration only, map image may differ.\nThere are many ways to support this campaign. Our community has been essential to making the world of Fallen London what it is today. Get involved however you can!\nUPDATE: We've achieved ALL 20 social goals and ALL of the social rewards!\nYou've simply bowled us over your romantic poetry, personal ads, Victorian origami, Feast of the Rose celebrations, costumed cats and creatively captured Masters!\nCheck out our Twitter and #MaskoftheRose to see everything shared and submitted so far. Our wonderful Principal QA Specialist continues to collect and showcase your chiropterous felines on this delightful Twitter thread. Pop into our Discord if you haven\u2019t already to chat about the campaign and all things Mask of the Rose.\nYou've only gone and unlocked every single social reward! Good work everyone!\n\nAchieving five goals unlocked an access code that will give your character in our Fallen London browser game a special Poetic Gift \u2014 just click the link to apply it to your account!\nSeven goals unlocked a second Fallen London access code, this time for a mysterious Ministerial Gift. You may want to do so before Monday 22nd February as this gift has a special use during the Feast of the Rose, which you can discover by speaking with Lilac. But don\u2019t worry too much if you miss it \u2013 the option will be available again next year.\n10 Goals unlocked 10% off at Gametee for a limited time and the release of a free selection of Mask of the Rose and Fallen London-universe themed printables. The discount code has now expired but you can still enjoy the printer-friendly downloadables on Gametee\u2019s website! The items can also be accessed via Dropbox if you prefer not to create a Gametee account.\n15 goals unlocked a chance to interview one of the characters from Mask of the Rose! We ran a poll and Milton, he of the amber eyes and scalding handshake, won!\nThank you for the many (184!) questions you submitted for Milton. They have all been received, compiled and submitted for consideration. He answered Mr Pages' approved selection in this update.\n19 goals unlocked a future encounter in Fallen London with Horatia. Your landlady in Mask of the Rose has a heart of gold and a soft spot for the Neath\u2019s more unusual inhabitants \u2013 but how is she doing decades later, in the Fallen London browser game? We will make her current residence open to visitors, creating an opportunity to meet her! This will happen sometime after the campaign, but ahead of the release of Mask of the Rose. In the meantime, Horatia has something for you \u2013 may it keep you company until you meet in Fallen London.\nAll five stretch goals have been unlocked!\nMask of the Rose comes with three initial options to define your protagonist\u2019s background, allowing you to have grown up as a dockside urchin, as a worker in your family\u2019s tailor shop, or among the stifling  pomp and luxury of the aristocracy. Your choice will grant advantages with particular factions in the story, and equip you with some unique clothing options.\nThis is a fourth origin to select when creating your character: the Housebreaker\u2019s Heir, who has a pickpocket\u2019s deftness, several criminal acquaintances, and a fraught relationship to anyone wearing a badge. Each origin grants advantages with certain factions and some unique clothing items!\n Early in Mask of the Rose, your landlady Horatia takes in new lodgers \u2013 some human, some decidedly not. We\u2019ll add one of these lodgers as a new character to Mask of the Rose: a Clay Man, fresh from the living city of Polythreme.\nHe\u2019ll be one of the game\u2019s secondary characters \u2013 not as elaborately woven into the central narrative as the main cast, but an interactive character with his own story to explore. What emotions stir beneath his stony exterior? You\u2019ll be able to get to know him better, and perhaps even learn the secret that brought him to Horatia\u2019s door... \nA fifth potential origin for your protagonist: the Undertaker\u2019s Child! Thanks to your family business, you are acquainted with numberless vicars, solicitors, grave-diggers and hearse-makers. You also know perfectly well how Death is supposed to behave \u2013 even if Fallen London persistently defies your expectations.\nThe deviless Virginia will make an appearance in Mask of the Rose. In the years to come, she will go on to be many things in Fallen London \u2013 including its Lord Mayor \u2013 but she was around long before the city arrived in the Neath. Her story will give us an opportunity to show what she was up to in a newly-arrived, vulnerable London\u2026 \n A sixth protagonist origin will be added to the game: the Scholar of the Occult! The scholar is a historian of esoteric practices ranging from witchcraft to alchemy, and this background gives you an in with academics and the more disreputable sort of artist, and a gift for noticing disturbing things out of the corner of your eye\u2026\nWARNING: while the Neath could broadly be described as very occult indeed, its particular brand of the strange has little to do with alchemy, witchcraft, angelology, or other surface occultisms. A Scholar of the Occult is as likely to be bewildered by London\u2019s new home as anyone else, but perhaps they will be a little more accepting of the eerie and the uncanny.\nOur answer to this might be a little unusual. We're doing okay right now, and can fully fund development of Mask of the Rose (though any pledges we receive will reduce the risk and put us in a better position for the future).\nInstead, we're doing this to find out whether this is a game you want us to make.  We're excited about Mask of the Rose; we hope you are, too. The funding goal is not how much it will cost to make; it's the amount that would convince us Mask of the Rose will appeal to a large enough audience, so that we can safely commit to making it.\nWe won't be making Mask of the Rose available in Early Access, so we're also hoping to learn how you feel about different parts of the game, to help guide development. If you have thoughts to share on any part of the game, please let us know in the comments!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMask of the Rose is in some ways more complex than many visual novels. But it will be smaller and more focused than most of our past games, which can be enormous and \u2013 we confess \u2013 somewhat baroque.\n\nWe're familiar with the technologies we're using to make it, and have already built a vertical slice \u2013 a short, fully playable section of the game. We\u2019ve also had a fair amount of experience fulfilling Kickstarters: we\u2019ve run three successful ones, and delivered on all of them.\n\nFor these reasons, we're confident in our ability to complete Mask of the Rose. We think the biggest risk is instead that it might take longer than estimated. In particular, we have a tendency to delay our games if part of the design isn't working out as well as we'd hoped \u2013 it's more important to us to make good games than to release them quickly. Also, it's very important to us that our team doesn't have to crunch. That means that if some things take longer than we expect, we might have to push back the release (although we\u2019ve included contingency in the schedule to cover a certain amount of this).\n\nIf everything goes to schedule, we expect to be ready to release Mask of the Rose towards the end of 2021, but to account for these risks, the date we\u2019re committing to is June 2022.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nThe scented candles are made with soy wax, a more sustainable alternative to paraffin.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe majority of our rewards are delivered digitally.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "The Citizen", "descp": "Welcome to the Neath!

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

Together with your fellow players and GM, you create the city of Nagara and its unique locations using a tarot deck. Each session your characters inch ever closer to a Doom they\u2019re working tirelessly to prevent, but must inevitably face as the chronicle ends.\nThe game has the dark horror feeling of a dungeon crawl, while focusing on mechanics that drive in-game drama and push personal stories. You\u2019ll get embroiled in the various wars raging between guilds in the city and try to secure a bit of personal peace, before all your efforts crumble around you. You\u2019ll strive to survive in a city that is literally trying to eat you, and siphon off its power to keep the ones you love safe.\nCity of Flesh takes inspiration from grimdark fantasy combining it with a feminine aesthetic to create an immersive gore-splattered roleplay experience where you delve into the dreams of a sleeping colossus and tear through fleshy reality to make your own fate.\nWhat You\u2019ll Get\n\nCity of Flesh is an A5 sized, 50+ page, soft cover zine. We've paid attention to paper quality and the zine will have a glorious hand-feel. PDFs will be distributed through DriveThruRPG and physical zines will be sent through the Dutch national mail service. \nShipping is free, we've calculated the costs into our funding goal.\nWithin the zine is:\nA complete grimdark femmecore setting for you and your friends to build upon\nA full set of unique tarot-based mechanics to run your game\nA guide on how to interpret the cards for your game\nAn immersive safety mechanic to keep the game safe and fun for everyone at the table\nIf you'd like additional physical copies of the game add \u20ac15 to your pledge for each additional copy. We'll send PDF codes along with the additional copies ordered.\nTake a look at the stretch goals we unlocked!\n2,500: UNLOCKED - Monster generator \n3,500: UNLOCKED - Encounter generator\n5,000: UNLOCKED - All Stretch Goals printed and added to physical pledges\n 6,500: UNLOCKED - Proofing\n  Welcome to Nagara\nNagara, the City of Flesh, dominates the Plains of Bone. The world is young, the Age of Titans draws to a close, but the city is ancient. Built in the womb of the slain Colossus, Nagara is both rich and powerful\u2014and already past its prime. A Doom approaches Nagara, as the world rebirths itself into a new, more rational form in which there\u2019s place for neither Titans, nor cities built atop their rotting remains. To facilitate this transition, the city\u2019s dreams birthed the Midwives\u2014people imbued with some of the city\u2019s primordial energy who must guide it to whatever comes next.\nThe Colossus is dead by any measure of human life, and yet she isn\u2019t\u2014 she still undulates with primordial creation, heaving and oozing to form a protective shell around Nagara. The magic of the Sovereigns keeps her dormant, as does the life-leeching magic of lesser citizens and their efforts to keep flesh at bay with fire and blade. Entire city blocks still live under overhangs of flesh as a result of the Years of Suffering, with some citizens carving houses into the red tissue.\nThe need to drive back the Colossus\u2019 flesh becomes more dire as Nagara expands. Sovereign Nemaida offers rewards to explorers who venture in the necrotic parts of the city to slay monsters and burn away the flesh. The Midwives often find themselves called to the danger the endeavor promises, for there is plenty that can go wrong.\nHow It's Played\nNagara is dying and will be reborn. At the start of the game you map the city by performing a three-card reading for each location in the city. You\u2019ll map seven locations and then place a single card on the Blooded Sanctum, the Doom\u2014the end of your story. Each location represents one session (roughly four hours) of your game, therefore you\u2019ll play seven sessions before the eighth final session where you encounter the city\u2019s Doom.\nAt the start of every session players pick a location focus\u2014this is the location the game session is crafted around. The GM crafts the plot of the session based around the conflict and threat of the location.\nDuring the game players perform more readings, drawing a tarot card from the deck, to modify the scenes based on how characters act. Readings help facilitate the drama in your character\u2019s life. Depending on how your Reading turns out, you and/or the GM ascribe meaning to the card drawn.\nExample of Play\nThe Midwives are caught in a waking nightmare of terror and blood where an unhinged Relic stalks and murders people in their sleep. Steffie\u2019s character Torga realizes maybe the Relic can be reasoned with, she asks the Relic if they can help it in some way. Liz, the GM, asks Steffie to make a Pacify reading, because Torga is trying to connect with the Relic.\nSteffie draws the Five of Swords. \nThe Relic explains that it's enraged, not because it can\u2019t fulfill its destiny, but more because it loved Hydrassa deeply and hates seeing her body so defiled.  Torga reveals she knows the sting of unrequited love too and swears to help. Seeing another being who knows its pain, the Relic asks Torga to take action by returning Hydrassa\u2019s body to her burial tomb. \nNice to meet you!\nSteffie de Vaan is a Dutch author and developer of role playing games and short stories.

While is easy to read for people with no sight problems, we realize some of the black pages with thinner white text, or heavily illustrated pages, may cause issues for others.

With Aveliana I want to bring novelty to indie games with fun and original gameplay! Aveliana is an infiltration-action-adventure game!\nJUMP INTO THE ADVENTURE AND PLAY THE DEMO ON Gamejolt!. \nAveliana is a 2.5D game with unique gameplay: based on the detection pattern of enemies, you find your own route through the world. All the enemies can be avoided in the idea of a commandos-like. The gameplay is ultra-dynamic because it is focused on a single character, Aveliana. \n(This trailer was selected as \"best indie game trailer\" by Best Indie Games!)  \nIf you feel one path is too complicated or you want to explore a new route, it is always possible to find a secret path, in which the game smoothly transition from 2.5D to a 2D platformer. And if you are tremendous, you can choose to stand and fight your enemies!\nThe gameplay is constantly renewed in Aveliana thanks to the many enemies that I have crafted for you. Each of them has a different detection and attack pattern. Tall enemies, like robots, can not be directly targeted because they are too tall. However, Aveliana has other tricks in her bag. All along with the game, you will also unlock new abilities to build your character. \n Don't you love hiding in high-grass?\nPLAY\n\nAveliana is also a game with beautiful environments that you will want to explore to discover all the secrets of the game (and you can contribute to it in some rewards!). Each level has a different environment and atmosphere. Sometimes, after an action-packed sequence, you will have the joy to admire the landscape before continuing the adventure! After a long journey in an environment entirely hand-drawn, you will face fierce and unique bosses!\n2.5D / isometric view environments:\n2D environments:\n Note: you don't like too difficult games and you just want to know Aveliana's story and discover the levels? No worries, there will be a \"story mode\" for you! \nThe game will be initially released on Steam and will support Windows, Linux and Mac. Later it could be ported to consoles.\nElevator pitch\nAveliana is an action-infiltration-adventure game recognizable by its art design as well as for its fun and unique gameplay!\nEmbrace Aveliana\u2019s quest to bring back someone she has lost! The game takes place alternatively in an isometric or a 2D point of view and is fast-paced. Guide her through arduous paths watched by monsters, follow the trace of a mysterious fox, and find the powerful artifacts she is looking for at the core of wonderful temples. Will you stealth your way to victory? Seek a forgotten path on the edge of a cliff? Or stand and fight against your enemies? The choice is yours!\n PRESS KIT\nWhat are my inspirations?\nJust before starting the game development, I was playing a series of games that probably initiated the thought process in my mind. I played Zelda Breath of the wild, Celeste, Cuphead, Disco Elysium, and finally Children of Morta. I am also inspired by other games such as Gris, Commandos, Rayman origins, and of course Zelda Ocarina of time! Other arts also inspire me, such as painting or music, but also poetry, and anime (in particular Miyasaki's work that I find unique and so poetic!).\nWhat makes Aveliana unique?\nThe gameplay, the story, and the art style!\n2.5D to 2D smooth transition! You can find hidden 2D passages but if you fall, you may fall onto enemies:\nPLAY\n\nUnique and diverse stealth gameplay\nPrecise and fast gameplay for experts (speedrunners!), and adjustable for occasional gamers\nA recognizable artistic design\nHand-drawn environments with a lot of variety\nA meaningful story with a lot of story twists\nChoose your set of skills for the adventure\nIn Aveliana, at the start of each level, you can reassign your abilities and adapt the set of skills to the upcoming level and to your playstyle. For instance, here the first ability I have chosen (which is the one by default in the demo) is the Dash ability because I like to move quickly, but I could have chosen the Hard skin instead to take less damages. For each slot, you will have to choose between two options! \nFoes in Aveliana \nAll enemies in Aveliana have their own detection and attack pattern! The game already has three \"common\" enemies that detect you with a cone (like the yellow guys in the little video below)! Each of them will be of a different type (melee, zone, ranged)!\nHere you can see the new ranged enemy I have just implemented (quite challenging to fight for me):\nPLAY\n\n It also already has 7 unique and more challenging enemies, like the ones below, that will force you to modify your approach and think about your movements! Look at the rewards because you could participate in the development of more enemies like this!\n (this one below you can only see when you are on specific spots where you can activate your medallion)\n(that one makes a circle around you and you have to stay in it!)\nPLAY\n\nAnd finally, we have already three unique bosses in the game! One more is programmed!\nAll this variety in terms of detection and attack patterns is excellent for renewing the gaming experience all along with the game! The enemies can combine in fun and original ways to surprise you at all moments!\nWhat about the story?\nWhile looking for three artifacts, Aveliana will wander a poetic yet dangerous world and discover about her and her environment! As an indie game developer and following my personal thoughts about our world, I wish to use the videogame as a medium to share and carry meaningful messages. As a scientist, what passionate me the most is how a bunch of atoms can come to live, think, eat, love, etc. Aveliana is a strong and reckless bunch of pixels; she is guided by a fox and she starts to understand who she is thanks to him! The whole artistic design, being minimalistic and poetic, has been thought for you to enter into Aveliana\u2019s story and to live a great experience!\n[Work in progress] In-game, if you want to get more details about the story, you can use your medallion and scan around to find hidden little NPCs that will give you the precious information:\nPLAY\n\n Who is Thefrenchdev? \nI'm Romain, a French man from La Rochelle (France). I'm 32 and I have started this project at the end of February 2020 and I literally fell in love with game development. Since then, I have been working on Aveliana every day during my free time (from 6 pm to midnight). It has become my passion and the development has gone so well that I have quickly been able to share playable demos with people. This has motivated me, even more, to continue working on it and make it as fun, interesting, and enjoyable as possible.\n I jumped into game development suddenly but I have a background in programming since I am a theoretical physicist and I have painted and drawn all my life. This has helped me a lot during the whole journey since I haven't had to remove any good idea for the game because of technical limitations.\nI am doing this project solo but I receive a lot of support and help from my wife, Fanny. We did a lot of brainstorming for the story and we often discuss artistic and gameplay ideas!\nThey loved the game! \nThe Escapist has selected the game for The Escapist Game Showcase!\n Gamejolt has selected Aveliana to be featured as an Indie Gem! \"YOU are an indie gem! Really excited to follow along on your progress!\" \nThe game was selected in a video by Best Indie Games!\nAll these awesome guys including IndieGameiacs!\n Why I am doing this Kickstarter? \nBy backing the project, you can really make it outstanding and support a solo indie dev who put all his heart into it! If the game release is successful, maybe I can make my dream come true and become a game developer! \nFirst, for the game development, I want to invest in a new computer because the one I am currently using has neither a great GPU nor CPU. This would help me to be more efficient in game making and game testing (which is an important upcoming phase). For now, it suffers a bit when I need to test the game having other software opened (Unity3D, Photoshop, etc.)!\nOne big reason to kickstart this project is that I would like to raise funds to attend game events and promote the game. I think many beautiful indie games have been forgotten because no one knew they ever existed. Going to such an event costs about 1-2 K$ for the registration fee, the transportation (when we are able to travel again), and a hotel room.\nThen I would like to be able to afford to pay the people who are gratefully contributing to the game. I am specifically thinking about game music. I think the music is so great that the composer deserves more than what she is asking for.\nI bought a few days ago instruments and tools to make and register music (a workstation, a MIDI controller, a sound card, a DAW software, and an amp)! But who will make this music and why? Well, my wife plays the piano very well and I play guitar so we want to make additional music for the game that will be played procedurally. This means, the current music will be used as intro/outro tracks and for special events in the game and the new music will vary depending on what you do! For instance, if you encounter a lot of enemies, the rhythm and instruments in the track will change. I hope this will create a unique atmosphere and I think I have not seen this kind of thing in a game! I am really excited about it and I will use part of the Kickstarter funds for the things I have bought.\n I really want to make a Switch version for the game, and reaching the main goal and then the stretch goal for it would convince me totally to do it! Plus, I have been accepted (in just 3 days!) as a Switch developer (this means they really loved my project)! I will surely dedicate some funds to the port to this console.\nThe Kickstarter goal of 12K will greatly help me with this project! It will also unlock the Kraken (a unique mini-boss that I will design, draw, and implement in the game!).\nThe two stretch goals are important bonuses! The first one is a totally new world and environment for the game that I will draw, design, and implement! This is a mock-up of an environment that I want to create: \nPLAY\n\n The second stretch goal will unlock the voice-over for the English version! I would love so much to have voices for the game story. \nA new and unique reward!\nI have added a new reward called \"The music lover\" which is unique and is a big support for me! \nFor the game, I want to continue working with Ally, who is making awesome tracks, and I want, with my wife, to create new music that will be used during the levels and will be generated procedurally. This means the music will change accordingly to what is happening with smooth transitions. For this, I borrowed some money to pay for a midi keyboard, a sound card and to pay for the 16-tracks version of Bitwig (it is a DAW, a software to create music). All the funds from this reward will be used used to reimburse the instruments and to pay for the upgraded version of Bitwig (I have found some really awesome sounds that can only be used in the \"studio edition\" and tested (but can't be saved) in the \"demo version\"). This is why this reward is unique and matters so much for me: it will contribute to an extremely important piece of the game! If you love music and game music this one is for you! You will have access to all the soundtracks that we will make thanks to your contribution and we can discuss about game music during a discussion.\n(you can make your design)\nBONUS: The music lover is the only one who will be able to add a bonus to his pledge to order a unique Vinyl of Aveliana's soundtracks! The design isn't definitive and because it will be edited only once, you'll be able to choose your image of the game for the cover and the sticker.\nPhysical rewards! (organic/environment-friendly materials)\nI have prepared rewards with a lot of attention and I hope you will love them!\nFirst of all, all ranks have access to a digital version of the game when it will be released!  \n A reward for everyone: If we reach the first Kickstarter goal, I will implement the Kraken into the game! Alongside much other stuff for which you can contribute!\nDiscover the rewards!\nThe design of the tote bag and Aveliana's portrait illustration has been done in collaboration with LesPetitsMo who is an awesome french artist I've discovered during the game development! \nThe other designs are the artworks I have done for the game. The scene with Aveliana and the fox is my absolute favorite, I have spent 10 hours on it! I also love the T-shirt design with Aveliana surrounded by many little details that correspond to the lore of the game (e.g. the fox, the medaillon). If you choose a reward with an illustration please contact me in order to tell me which one you prefer! (non-definitive designs)\nT-shirt (choose your design)\n\nTote bag (design LesPetitsMo)\nPrints (size approx. 21x31 cm)\nContribute to the game creation! \nI have prepared contributive rewards so you can participate in the game making!\nWrite a piece of text that will be added (on my approval) in the game! \nIt can be a side-story, a joke, a quote, a poem, anything you'd like! People will be able to read it in the game and you will be credited in the game! Characters in the game will talk about your legend, or have a laugh when reading your funny joke. I think this is really a unique way of adding your name to the game!\nDesign a new mini-boss or enemy for the game!\nWe will discuss and collaborate to make a new and awesome new monster for the game. Your contribution can be either sketch, drawings, animations, or just ideas of an awesome monster that would make the quest of Aveliana even more arduous!\n\nWhy doing eco-friendly rewards and at what cost? \nI have decided to make the rewards as respectful as possible of the environment because this is something that matters to me! I also wanted to have good fabric for the T-shirt, tote bag, and high-quality paper and printing for the illustrations. For this, I have decided not to increase the reward prices thus it will slightly reduce the margin I will get from physical rewards. For you, it's all beneficial and I hope you will appreciate it!\n Share the news and join us on social media! \nSince I have started the project, about 7 months ago, I have grown a community of more than 8K followers on Instagram, Twitter, and Discord. This has been an exceptional journey with a lot of awesome feedback. I would love it if you'd like to participate in it, follow me, discuss with me, and make the game even greater than it is right now! And you can find news about the game, about the Kickstarter, about Steam release, etc.\nFor the launch of the Kickstarter, I am going to start a fanart challenge! There is nothing to earn and it is all for fun (to thank all the artists that are following me)! The last events I organized received the participation of over a hundred people (#thefrenchdevDTIYS on Instagram)!  Check for more info on my social media!\nRemember you can wishlist the game on Steam!\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! MERCI!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when doing such a big project alone. However, I have managed to progress a lot already on the game development and there are already many milestones that have been reached (getting a Steam page, making a demo, etc.).\n\nAt which stage am I in the project and what is the plan?\nEven if this is my first game development project, I think I know from the start where I am going and what is the scope of the game. This has helped me to always be on time with my schedule, and even be in advance on many aspects (for instance the IA of the game is already done, the game mechanics and the physics is coded, I have already about 18 levels that are completed and ready for polishing, etc.).\nI have started the game development on the 23rd of February and after about 1 month, I have started to send versions to people on my social media so they could try it and give me feedback. I got a lot of positive feedback and bugs to solve. After 2 months of game development, I have proposed a \"pre-alpha mockup\" on Gamejolt, which has been played more than 250 times! I received a ton of really good feedback and this demo was stable. Then I focused on doing a real demo for the game, the one you can find now on Gamejolt. This version is a glimpse at what will be the game in terms of story, art design, gameplay...\n\nNow for the next 6 months, I want to focus on drawing all the levels of the game (about 25 for about 6-7 hours of estimated gameplay). On the fly, I will of course add new enemies, implement the story, and add features (such as unlocking new abilities for Aveliana). After this, I will enter the final phase of the game development and during the last 6 months, I will focus on polishing everything. Playtest the game a lot and finish the drawings, animations, cutscenes...\n\nI think I can say now that the game will be finished because the project is sufficiently advanced and I see where I am going with it. All the stages have been completed ahead of time until now. \nThe current version of the game is playable and stable, it is just too short and it doesn't carry yet the story I want to tell!

With no memory of this place, you will explore and rediscover the serene and peaceful existence you once had here. Welcome to Everafter Falls.\nWhile you were gone, some things have gone a little astray. Find out why you are needed and what lies in store. Players can complete the game at their own pace and will have an option to continue playing indefinitely even after finishing the core story.\n\nA Pet that will always be by your side...\nYour pet comes with 2 basic abilities - Dig and Water. This design decision reduces the amount of tools cluttering up your inventory and makes possible some other interesting mechanics.\nYour pet can be taught new abilities. Is your inventory full while traversing the dungeons but you don't want to travel back to town? Send your pet to town to sell off its inventory while you continue exploring.\n\nNeed to get out of a tight situation or just reduce travelling time? Yes, Pet teleportation is a thing on Everafter Falls. \nPet Teleportation is a learnable skill\nGrow a huge range of fruits and vegetables\nEverafter Falls host a large variety of crops and plants, with some strange and unique species not found on Earth. Discovering and acquiring some of these may not be easy, but will be a rewarding experience. Below is a preview of what you will find in the game, with plans for more to come. \nHarvestable fruit and vegetables\nAll crops have a good number of visually distinct growth stages so that you know where they are in their growth cycle.\nA preview of crop growth stages\nTrees fruit at different rates and have a different maximum fruit capacity depending on variety. Waiting until they bear the maximum amount of fruit will yield more fruit over time, compared to harvesting as soon as the first fruits emerge. Discover what other methods can be used to increase fruit yields even further!\nMushrooms can be found in the wild or grown with the right equipment\nCraft various drones to help you with farm work, fishing, and general support. Each drone can be enhanced with up to 3 Drone Parts, giving them extra functionality. Support Drones are unique in that they can be equipped and will follow you around.\nA Water Drone automatically waters your crops\nChoose drone parts to modify drones to suit your needs\nA support drone can be equipped to provide extra inventory slots and additional firepower for the Dungeons.\nSomething I have not spent much time on yet are the farm animals. I plan to have around 5-8 different species that can be bred and will produce valuable goods. Some species may not be familiar to ones on Earth.\n\nOne species that has already been decided on is the the Alpaca. I could not resist working on this first. You'll be able to harvest super soft wool from them.\nFarm Alpacas for their soft, soft wool\nA behind-the-scenes look at animating these little fellas.\nWhat are Pixies?\nPixies are tiny little helpers that can be caught. They can then be placed on various things for different effects. You can sustainably harvest stone from rocks and wood from trees without destroying them using Blue Pixies. Green Pixies will help increase the growth rates of any plant or speed up processing times for the machines you craft! Discover what rare Red Pixies can do - if you ever catch one.\nPixies can harvest resources like wood and stone without destroying the tree or rock\n\nHow to catch Pixies\nPixies can be caught by placing edible offerings inside Pixie Shrines. Check back the following day to see if you find a pixie inside it. The quality of the offering and location of the pixie shrine will determine the chances of attracting a Pixie and also type pixie caught. Shrines can be crafted, however, the town center has a Golden Shrine that, once restored, can be used to attract rarer Pixies.\nDiscover what else pixies can do when you discover them\nRestore structures around town and put them to good use\nDiscover Cards along the way and eat them to gain their powers.\nCharacter progression is handled by earning cards either by completing quests or through special events. More often than not, you will be presented with 3 to choose from so you can decide what direction you want to take that best suits your playstyle. Will you choose cards that help you maximize profits from your farm, or strengthen your skills in combat so you can dive deeper into the dungeons?\nCard choices direct character progression\nAfter choosing a card, you'll need to eat it. How else are you going to gain it's powers?\nTastes like cardboard\nExplore the peaceful town and meet its inhabitants. Attend festivals, celebrate special events, find hidden areas and help restore things back to their former glory.\nOne of many areas in town to explore\nPenguin Post\nAll mail in Everafter Falls is delivered through Penguin Post. Pip and Pepper are the penguins that run this service and use carrier Pigeons to do the delivery. Every now and again, you may find a pigeon who has forgotten how to fly. Bring it to the post office where Pip and Pepper (the penguins who run the joint) will give it a job delivering mail.\nMail being delivered by pigeons who have forgotten how to fly\nGradually Changing Seasons\nFor a more immersive experience, trees change at different rates when the season changes. This small touch not only increase diversity in the environment, but provides a visual cue for when a season is ending and a new one starting.\nTrees will change at different rates to indicate the coming of a new season\nPersonalize your experience and create the character you want to play with many options to choose from.\nCharacter Creation\nMake your home yours\nThere are many types of decorations to find and collect to make your home unique. Below are some examples from each category.\nCustomize your home with a huge variety of items\nFine tuned decorations, place anything for display on shelves and tables.\nNot only can you decorate your house with various furniture including floor furniture, rugs and wall items (clocks, windows), you can also choose what to display on all shelves and tables. In addition to this, most furniture can have its color changed using a potion dye crafted from some unique fruit species.\nFishing and The Town Aquarium\nEverafter Falls is a host to many kinds of fish, some you will be unfamiliar with. The Town Aquarium has recently undergone repairs and needs your help to repopulate it. Receive special rewards for collecting as many types as you can.\nFishing is a lucrative business here in Everafter Falls\nThe town aquarium can showcase every type of fish you've caught\nA large number of marine species to discover for those who love to collect!\nCombat in this genre has been the area most lacking and I hope to change that trend. Everafter Falls features a dungeon with many levels and lots of enemies to encounter.\nThe game will have a moderate level of progressing difficulty and will be somewhat challenging if players want to focus solely on traversing the dungeons. For those who prefer a more casual approach, if enough time is spent doing other activities and progressing in other areas of the game, players will acquire items and abilities that can make fighting enemies a breeze.\nTaking down enemies is a breeze with help from your Pet and a Support Drone.\nPreview of some monsters you'll encounter in the dungeons\nItem Drops with random stat generation\nDiscover unique and powerful items that can help you on your adventure. Items can boost combat stats, or increase farm productivity. They can provide bonuses to your card levels, drones, and pet skills. Enjoy the thrill of finding ultra rare and unique items.\nEquipable Items with random stat generation\nOn this adventure, you'll meet a lot of fun and strange characters along the way. Complete fun and wacky quests to uncover their stories and earn items that will help you on your journey. \nMany characters are waiting to share their stories with you.\nEverafter Falls will not have a bachelor/bachelorette system (you are the only human here). Such a system would be difficult to reason for as the intricate relationships between the characters and player is tightly bound to the story. Have fun learning about the characters and their lives and perhaps they may share intimate moments with you if you've earned enough of their trust.\nComplete important quests for great rewards.\nYou\u2019ll be able to make some neat stuff that will help you make other neat stuff! There will be a huge number of items to discover, craft, produce, and refine. Below is a small preview of crafting and equipment processing.\nCraft and create machines to help you process items into other valuable and useful goods.\nA relaxing, fun, and memorable soundtrack\nEverafter Falls will have an Original Soundtrack composed by Tim Carlos. He has already produced some outstanding tracks for the game, please have a listen below. All pledges above the \"Post Pigeon\" tier will receive the Original Soundtrack digitally.\n If you enjoy what you hear, you can find more about Tim through his website  TimCarlos.com or follow him on Twitter  @tflatminor \n\n **Please note that I have mistakenly put \"Digital Copy of the Game\" and then \"Digital Copy of the game at a discounted price\" under Pledge Rewards for the \"Kickstarter Pricing\" tier. Please note only 1 copy of the game is given at this price. \nReference chart for pledge tiers and rewards\nBelow is a preview of the exclusive in-game posters, these can only be redeemed by backers with a provided code and cannot be obtained otherwise. Please visit Penguin Post in-game and submit your code. The item will be sent to you via a delivery pigeon!\nPreview of Excusive in-game Poster Rewards\nThe game will be released for PC/Mac/Linux first via Steam in March 2022, with the Nintendo Switch version following several months later. I would love to release on all platforms/consoles, however, as a solo developer, I need to ensure I don't spread myself too thinly to keep the project manageable. The possibility of Playstation and Xbox releases will likely be considered after the game has been released on the Nintendo Switch.\nBackers can choose to receive their digital copy of the game on for any available platform but please be aware of the different planned release dates. These are fairly conservative dates but are still estimates and may change.\nAlpha testing is planned to start mid 2021, and the Beta testing towards the end of 2021.\nThe Digital Art Book will include exclusive WIP images, character designs and some fantastic artwork commissioned by various artists.\nCommissioned artwork by Daniel Bogni\nCommissioned artwork by Jamsino\nI was raised in Australia, but was born in Cambodia. My family and I were lucky enough to have immigrated to Australia during the Khmer Rouge era. I am very fortunate to have had the education I had in Australia, without it, I wouldn't be in the position I am now.\nI moved back to Cambodia at the age of 32 hoping for a new direction in life. Thanks to the lower cost of living, moving back here has afforded me the opportunity to work almost full time on this game for nearly 3 years now.\nThese last 3 years have been spent juggling game development, freelance design work, and being a father to my now 2 year old son.\nI chose to do this Kickstarter so I can focus on doing what I love, which is working on this game. Additionally, It would help me with funding for the Original  Soundtrack. I am also hoping to create a community of fans that can provide feedback and help shape the game into the best it can be.\nAll the core systems have been completed and are in a playable state, with a decent amount of content complete. Much more content is planned, and a lot more time needs to be spent on the combat/dungeons. \nI set out from the very start to create a game I would enjoy, in a genre that has rekindled my love for gaming. I have poured a lot of love and energy into making it what it is today. A successful campaign will take a load off my shoulders and provide enough funding to last the rest of development.\nI am extremely grateful for anyone backing this project, with your support, I hope to develop a game that will provide you many hours of wholesome fun. Thank you so much!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving poured everything in into this project for nearly 3 years now, I am fully aware of the difficulties and challenges faced with developing and shipping a game alone.\n\nAfter going public with the game a couple of months ago, I've been overwhelmed with the positive response and show of support. I aim to do my best to release a game that will not disappoint.\n\nI originally aimed for a release date at the end of 2021, however, have since pushed it back to mid 2022 to be a little more conservative with timing and to better meet expectations for the launch date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 24 or more", "title": "Kickstarter Pricing", "descp": "- Get the game on release date at a discounted rate here on Kickstarter (Full price US$19.99 / AU$29)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Copy of the game at a Discount", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["764 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 35 or more", "title": "Small Sprout", "descp": "Show extra support for the project by getting the game bundled with the Digital Art Book and an exclusive in-game poster, and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Thank You\" in Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["368 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 65 or more", "title": "Post Penguin", "descp": "Get the game on release, bundled with the digital soundtrack, digital art book, and an exclusive in-game poster and your name under \"Thank you\" in the credits.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nYour name under \"Big Thank You\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["97 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 105 or more", "title": "Beta Bee", "descp": "Get Beta Access to the game, along with the game on release date, digital soundtrack, digital artbook, exclusive in game poster and your name in the credits as a Beta Tester.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of the Game\nBeta Access\nDigital Art Book\nDigital Soundtrack\nExclusive \"Beta Bee\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Post Pigeon\" in-game poster\nExclusive \"Sprout\" in-game poster\nName in Credits as \"Beta Tester\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2022"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 210 or more", "title": "Alpha Alpaca", "descp": "Be one of the first to play the game by becoming an Alpha Tester.

What do you do?\n\u25b6 FIGHT\n\u25b6 ITEM\n\u25b6 RUN\nThe Game\nFight Item Run cover - design is subject to change.\nFight Item Run is a Powered by the Apocalypse game that smashes action-packed combat and magic together with dynamic character and relationship exploration. The dungeon is the structure and sole setting, though \"dungeon\" can be interpreted as anything from cave systems to cloud cities. The party begins in a chamber and there are monsters; once they\u2019ve defeated the monsters, they proceed to the next chamber where there are more monsters. Chambers also have items, treasures, puzzles, and mysteries. When the party has collected the adequate gear to advance to the next level of the dungeon, they come to the chamber with the passage down (or up for a tower or with a portal to some nonlinear other realm) to advance further. The goals for Fight Item Run are the following:\n\u25b6 Fight monsters, collect items, survive the dungeon.\n\u25b6 Tell a collaborative story of mystery and adventure.\n\u25b6 Plant and build upon evocative details at every chance.\n\u25b6 Explore the lives and relationships of characters traveling together.\nCombat & Recovery\nFight Item Run is played in two phases: Combat and Recovery. Combat is forward motion and Recovery is retreating. When there are monsters and danger, the characters are in Combat. If all characters run from Combat, then they are in Recovery until they advance forward again. Each phase has a set of basic moves available to all players, as well as opportunities for players to use moves unique to their character's Class and School of Magic.\nCombat features tactics built around creative interpretations of flavor text\u2014if you think the fire sword you picked up from the last red demon you beat would be good against a tree monster, it is. Combat is also the launching point fo narrative cutscenes and relationship building.\nRecovery is packed with valuable downtime activities, including for the players. In and out of character recaps and safety tools are built in to the entire system and take center stage during Recovery.\nCutscenes\nSeamlessly switch into a cinematic storytelling mode with Cutscenes when certain milestones are met during Combat or Recovery, such as beating a Boss or the party all being knocked down to zero HP. The intro Cutscene is a tutorial to get players having fun with what they want their characters to be able to do, picking the consequences themselves. Explore character backstories and relationships at various checkpoints and give each other credit for a game well played during the final credits Cutscene. Wield minor Cutscenes, in addition to the big ones, as tools to pause, fast forward, skip, or rewind the narrative.\nAffinity\nAction-packed monster battles, bizarre and powerful feats of magic, and delving deep into the secrets of the dungeon are the framework for beautiful relationships to blossom. Unlock little moments throughout play to confide in and learn about these other adventurers you're traveling with. Your fellow party members will grow alongside you as you notice each other in those pivotal situations of danger, daring, and intimacy. There are perks to affinities as well: give minor bonuses to your allies as you bond with them and, when they bond gets stronger, crystallize it into new gear.\nitems & abilities\nFight Item Run blends \"soft\" and \"hard\" mechanics, bringing in special abilities and gear with flavor text that has actual impact during play. Defeat a spiky monster and draw from it a spiked hook sword, which is particularly effective at catching the antlers of the next monster and bringing it down. Defeat a slime monster and draw from it a gooey suit that allows you to slip through cracks. Use your slime suit to slip inside the giant haunted armor and use your hook sword to tear it apart from within. Adapt, grow, collect, and advance. \nEven the most well-equipped adventurers rely on good ol' fashioned consumables: gather single use items, like MegaPotions, Restores, Special Brews, Beast Stones, and ParalyzePlus, to increase your odds, barter with merchants, and mix into alchemical experiments.\nThe Book\nFight Item Run is being offered in three formats: illustrated PDF, accessible plain text, and hardcover. The accessible plain text is designed to be easily readable, with screen readers in mind. All versions have the same content and the PDF and the ePub are included in all tiers starting at the digital-only level. Fight Item Run is 60+ full color pages at 5.5\" x 8.5\".\nThe three illustrated versions are framed by pixel art from different iconic terrain. Below are two digital mockups (not final text or layout!) of example interior pages.\nDigital mockup: not final art or design. The grassland terrain is nice, quaint place to begin an adventure or a reprieve after surfacing from a dungeon.\nWhile these pages don't have final text or layouts, the design intention is present: information is clearly highlighted. Key terms pop out of paragraphs, headings are clear and descriptive, and lists are organized and spaced for quick scanning.\n\nDigital mockup: not final art or design. The desert terrain is hot, dry, and unforgiving, battering adventures just as roughly as the hearty monsters that stalk the sands.\nThe Team\nThe game is written by me, Tay Curreysmith (he/him). I wrote Fight Item Run as a nostalgic love letter to the feeling I had as a little brother watching my older siblings play classic jrpg and metroidvania type games. My oldest brother named Red XIII after me in one of his many playthroughs of Final Fantasy 7 to tease me\u2014haha, he named the dog after me\u2014but I just thought it was so cool to be a part of that world. I was terrible at MegaMan, but I got to be Zero when my brother and I played pretend. These games, at least my idea of them as an observer, would go on to inspire my earliest game designs and motivate me to always continue creating.\nMy editors are Summer (she/her), who consulted on mechanics, and Lauren Bryant-Monk (she/her), who provided safety editing. I'm very thankful to both of them for elevating Fight Item Run beyond my abilities.\nBrittany \"Bri\" Williams (she/her, they/them) is on board as a writer and story lead for the playable campaign/setting modules included in Fight Item Run.\nMia \"Hye\" Mardikian (she/her, they/them) brings Fight Item Run to life with stunning graphic design. Intuitive typography highlights and organizes the text, which is all overlaid unique pixel art backgrounds. Background art is designed by Hye using tilesets by Diego del Solar (he/him) aka Shackhal. Cover pixel art is by Brian Wolf (they/them), who will also provide interior illustrations unlocked by stretch goals, with graphic design by Hye.\nThe Rewards\nIf you're not the type to get a game on launch day, then back at the Supporter level to get your name in the credits and notifications on all the updates. Every contribution is deeply appreciated!\nBack at the Virtual Emulator level to grab the two digital versions and save on shipping. Your name will be added to the credits under your pledge level, including at all the higher pledge levels too.\nThe Cartridge level includes the beautiful digest-sized hardcover copy. At 5.5\" by 8.5\", this full color book is ready to go\u2014you don't even need to blow into it first.\nThe premium tiers start with Build Your Own Mods where you get to hop on an hour call with me to talk hacking, homebrewing, and how you can make your Fight Item Run experience totally unique.\nHave a hand in the game itself with the Choose Your Fighter! pledge. I'll work with you to design a playable Class to be included in the final game. Bring to life your favorite homage!\nAdd-Ons\nThis campaign is part of Kickstater's beta testing of add-ons, which can be added on to any pledge level. These include extra downloads and copies of books, as well a few very special options.\nStarting with Shackhal's tileset, I designed Pixel Art Six-Sided Dice (which is what Fight Item Run uses) that can be added to any pledge, including the digital-only level. These dice hold their details well at 25mm (jumbo size!) and are printed, not just stickers.\nKeep the rules at your fingertips with the Quick Reference Deck add-on: a deck of cards featuring all the moves, as well as other key rule highlights. Each card also includes the page number the move or rule originally appears on for easy reference to the original context.\n25mm pixel art dice sample; design is not final.\n\nStretch Goals\nStretch Goals through $4,000 have been unlocked! Check back soon for more.\n\nWe're knocking out these stretch goals! You've already unlocked 9 additional interior illustrations by Brian Wolf and an additional campaign setting by Bri Williams! Keep checking back for more stretch goals to be announced.We're knocking out these stretch goals! You've already unlocked 9 additional interior illustrations by Brian Wolf and an additional campaign setting by Bri Williams! Additionally, a sticker sheet using art by Brian Wolf will be added to all physical tiers.\nSocial Stretch Goal: Click through to the tweet. 100 retweets unlocks an audiobook version of Fight Item Run available for free to all backers at the Virtual Emulator tier and up.\nThe Process\nWriting is complete and editing is already done and paid for. Design is already underway. The main steps left to complete, that we'll need funding for, includes the extra art and the printing and shipping of the books.\nCost Breakdown: 47.8% for production, 8.8% for fees, 9.0% buffer, 16.9% for design, and 17.5% for shipping.\nDue to the small quantities we're printing at, cost per unit decreases pretty quickly as total units go up. The savings go towards funding interior spot art illustrations by cover artist Brian Wolf (in their illustrative style, not pixel art), which are unlocked at each stretch goal. Everything else scales proportionally: as we get more backers, the higher production costs, shipping, and fees get. These are the only planned stretch goals, but ask me again if this project turns into a giant runaway success.\nA note on shipping: Shipping is really expensive and costs are constantly on the rise. If the cost of shipping is prohibitive for you, especially international backers, please message me directly. I might be able to reduce the cost for you or arrange a bulk shipment to be sent to a local game store. In fact, if you have a local game store, please let them know about this campaign and we might be able to save everyone some money if order direct as a retailer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done a few Kickstarters now, big and small. The last one failed, but I'd like to chalk that up at least in part to it happening during the early phases of a global pandemic\u2014my priorities shifted. I'm keeping this campaign relatively simple, only promising products that are made or are readily manufacturable. I am not offering, nor will I, products that require me to write more. I'm way too slow at it. I'm also not promising commissions, which were difficult to coordinate in the Spell: The RPG campaign. Kickstarter did approve this project for add-ons, which I'm very excited about! I've used add-ons previously with third party providers, so I expect everything to be smoother running through Kickstarter.\n\nI'm being realistic about shipping dates and costs, which is difficult to plan around, but also acknowledges the dire state of the USPS, as well as countless interrupted supply chains.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Just a Taste", "descp": "All backers at $10 and up get immediate access to the fully playable prototype PDF.

Discover different weapons, items, and abilities that will help you progress and discover new areas.\nDesigned and developed by one guy hoping to recreate that special feeling of being dropped into new unexplored territory and setting off on a new adventure.\nComing to Windows, Mac, and Nintendo Switch in October 2021.\n\nFeatures\nClassic side-scrolling action in a modernized retro pixel art style.\nSharp and precise character movement and attack abilities.\nHand-drawn pixel art brought to life with frame-by-frame animation.\n Metroidvania at heart heavily focused on exploring and being rewarded for it.\nA vast interconnected world with secrets, enemies, and quirky little robots.\nSatisfying combat. Slash your way through enemies.\nAbilities\nAll of Haiku's abilities allow for multiple uses, whether it being in combat, quick traversal around the map, or for finding hidden passageways.\nCollect different power-ups and explore new areas.\nSword: Your main weapon to eradicate machines carrying the evil virus.\nDash: Dart skillfully away from attacks and zip past hazards.\nDouble jump: Fly high over enemies and reach new heights as you explore.\nRoll: Speed through corridors and get through tight gaps.\nBomb: Use brute force to get past certain objects and to damage enemies.\nGrapple: Swing between platforms and use the momentum to reach difficult areas.\nCombine abilities to reach extra difficult areas.\n\nUpgrades\nCollect spare parts from enemies and use them in the store to buy upgrades for your abilities. Beware, you won't be able to buy every upgrade from the store, some are scattered across the map so you'll have to go out and find them.\nBuy upgrades from the vending machine character.\nThe world of Haiku is inspired by retro-monochromatic pixel art with a modern twist so you will see only a few colors onscreen at a time. The entire palette is made up of only 16 colors. Each one has been specially picked to offer a surprisingly large range of color combinations.\nEverything is drawn by hand and animated frame-by-frame to achieve that retro look.\nIf you like the look of this tool, then check out Aseprite - it's perfect for pixel art and animation.\n\nInspired by movies like The Matrix and games like The Legend of Zelda: BoTW.\nHaiku wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world where humans no longer exist. After the extinction of the human race, machines were the only intelligent beings left to inhabit the planet. \nFour artificial intelligent beings soon evolved and developed a world of order and stability. Programs and machines lived in peace for many years, until the virus spread.\nIt corrupted the programs first, then after, the machines. The machines could not function without the correct programs and so the world began to break down.\nIt's up to Haiku to restore order!\nThe entire world consists of approximately 8 areas. Here are a few that you'll encounter along your journey to save the world from the evil virus:\nCity: On lockdown to prevent the computer virus from spreading.\nOne of the city entrances can be found at the city's foundations.\n\nGarbage: Waste produced from the city above falls into this area. Due to the poor conditions, the virus spread quickly down here.\nThe conveyor belts that move the garbage stopped working a long time ago.\n\nSewers: What game would be complete without a water level?\nIf there's water that means there could be life, right?\n\nPower source: The heart of Haiku's world, where all power is produced and distributed to different areas. There is a dark history of how this power was first produced.\nSome of the electric pods are broken, and spilling a strange yellow liquid.\n\nForgotten ruins: A safe haven, (almost) untouched by the virus.\nInteract with unique characters as you travel through the lands.\n\nSurface: Expect to find bones, skeletons, and the remains of the human race scattered across the surface of the planet. Access to the special backer area, the Catacombs, can be found around here.\nNever-ending black rain from the radiation.\n\nThe Catacombs (special backer area!): A sanctuary and memorial for the forgotten human race. Get your name and message added to the game as one of the last human survivors before their extinction (see rewards for more info).\nAvailable for Beta tester, Super fan, Collector and Builder backer tiers!\nThe entire world and its enemies are based on one simple theme: machines. Therefore I use everyday objects as inspiration for coming up with enemy concepts. Here are just a few:\nGarbage area: Washing machine, Nokia, trash bin, nut, and bolt.\nPowerhouse area: Electro-magnet, battery, surveillance camera, and light bulbs.\nWhile I don't want to reveal any main storyline bosses, there are plenty of mini-bosses or optional bosses that you will encounter along the way. Each boss has its own back story and is designed around the theme of its area. Here is one sneak-peek:\nGarbage magnet: Residing in the Garbage area, tormented by his own past and by what the virus has brought upon his family.\n<phase one initiated>\n<\u20b1\u2c67\u20b3\u20b4\u0246 \u20ae\u20a9\u00d8 \u0142\u20a6\u0142\u20ae\u0142\u20b3\u20ae\u0246\u0110>\nHi there! I'm Jordan, I love playing games and now I love making them. Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing games with an open-world, where you wanna check out where that path leads to? And the game just lets you! I love that feeling of exploring a world on your own terms and creating your own proper adventure.\nFor the last year, I've spent every day learning about pixel art, animation, and game development to work on my dream project 'Haiku, the Robot'. All while working a full-time job. With this project, I hope to recreate that feeling of being dropped into new unexplored territory and setting off on a new adventure.\nJoin me for behind-the-scenes news on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, or Discord!\nFor the longest time, I have always dreamed of making my very own video game and to be honest, I still can't believe that I'm doing it. From the very first time I jumped into Unity's game engine, I fell in love with game development, and I can truly say that it has changed my life.\nWith this Kickstarter campaign, you can help change my life for good and make this dream a reality. Just like most of you, I currently work a 9-5 job, which doesn\u2019t leave me with as much time as I\u2019d like to create Haiku and his wonderful world. With the funds, I will be able to quit my job and dedicate 100% of my time to the project. For the next year, I want to pour all my passion into building a truly amazing world full of secrets for you guys to explore and uncover.\nBudget breakdown\nYour contributions will ensure that I can devote 100% of my work-week to completing the project. The rest will go towards your rewards and shipping, paying the tax man and giving Kickstarter a little cut! \n'Haiku, the Robot' is planned to release in October 2021 on Steam, and later on Nintendo Switch, if we hit the stretch goal. (Check the Stretch goals section!)\nChoose between a copy on Steam or Nintendo Switch if we meet stretch goals!\nYou can already wishlist the game on Steam!\n\nWhy is Nintendo Switch a stretch goal? As I am self-publishing the game, I plan to release it on Steam first and make sure that everything works correctly on PC & Mac before moving onto the Nintendo Switch launch. This way I can dedicate the necessary time to making sure that players have the best experience across all platforms.\nNintendo has already approved my official Nintendo Switch Developer license!\nPrices in \u20ac and $ are an approximation as exchange rates can vary.\nFree shipping included! All physical rewards will be sent out as soon as possible.\nThis is the same t-shirt that I have on in the video :D\nChoose between a black or white T-shirt. Available sizes: S - 3XL\nOne mug size: 11oz\nAvailable sock sizes: M - XL\n\nWhat is a Haiku poem and how can I write one? More details can be found here: https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/style-and-usage/rules-for-writing-haiku.html\nImportant: the Haiku poem does NOT have to be related to the game!\nSuper important: make sure to use the hashtag #HaikuKickstarter so I can find your poems later! I will announce the winners at the end of the campaign, good luck!\nI am very active on social media, so make sure to drop a follow on your preferred platform for behind-the-scenes and frequent updates!\nYou can already wishlist the game on Steam!\nLastly, I wanted to give out a special thanks to everyone who helped with the Kickstarter page, from people reviewing and giving suggestions, all the way to making translations for the trailer so a wider audience can learn about my story.\nA special thanks to everyone who has followed my progress over the last year, everyone who leaves me nice comments and continuously motivates me to continue moving forward. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for all of you, so thank you! <3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough this is my first commercial game and I am not an experienced game developer, I do have first-hand experience in project planning and project execution from working in an IT software company for 4 years.\n\nMost of the groundwork for the game is done, this includes core mechanics, abilities (except for that darn grapple hook), art direction, art style, the main storyline, and more. What's left is building more of the amazing world, enemies, and background story.\n\nWith that said, I have made good estimates for the project with plenty of wiggle room for bug testing and other things but there is always a strong possibility of running into some unknowns along the way. Not to worry though, I will always keep you in the loop with monthly updates and videos so there will be 100% transparency between the project and you (the backers making this dream a reality)!\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll be testing the game extensively throughout its entire development. Both locally and in beta tests, which I hope some of you will help me out with! Ultimately, this game is for all of YOU, so it's super important for me to get feedback and create something great.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Get the game!", "descp": "ABOUT \u20ac14 / $15 - Get a digital copy of 'Haiku, the Robot' for Steam!

It really does worry too much...what's the worst that could happen with Beatrice by your side? Even a flock of Depraven wouldn't mess with a freshly bloomed Lullabile.\"\n\n .....WHAT IS \"MORTASHEEN???\" \n\nOpticaper, Lagomust and Zeze, monsters that pre-date my shift to digital color\n\nI'm Jonathan Wojcik, creator of multiple online comics, short stories and other media you can enjoy on my website, bogleech.com, one of the most ambitious of which is the world of Mortasheen. Inspired as far back as the early 2000's by the then-recent success of series like Pokemon, Digimon and even Neopets, Mortasheen is my own original monster-training universe with emphasis on crawling parasites, oozing fungi, chattering ghouls and bizarre, uncanny biotechnology.\n\nEledirge, Amoebeyes and Hissbegotten\n\nIn the nearly 20 years (!!!) since I came up with the setting, I've personally created over 700 monsters - and counting! - that you can browse HERE, though a great deal of them warrant updated illustrations and updated descriptions.  Every single monster mashes up a little of everything I love most in the world; the \"bug eyed monsters\" of 50's B-movies, the surreal grisliness of horror manga, monstrous Tokusatsu villains, artists like Beksinski or Giger or Sydney Sime and especially the real, actual biology thriving all around us in the form of incredible insects, worms, slime molds and parasites.\n\n\nToxicoil\n\nTo quote how someone else once put it, the simplest watered-down explanation of Mortasheen would be \"Cronenberg Pokemon,\" except that, despite its motifs of toxic waste and body horror, the world of Mortasheen leans more toward's the Pokemon world's cheerful attitude and cutesy humor, marrying morbidity and optimism in a similar manner to the good old Addams Family.  Mortasheen is not and should never be a bleak, grimdark post-apocalypse.\n\n\"SO WHAT'S THIS ABOUT A ROLEPLAYING GAME?\"\n\nJunjo, Apteros and Scuttlegeist\nSo, it was way, way back in 2009 that I was approached with the idea to develop Mortasheen into an independent tabletop roleplaying game, especially as there had yet to be a successful example of a pen and paper \"mons\" game - still rare to this day! The project wasn't meant to take more than an entire decade, but as entirely the \"art side\" of the project, all gameplay development had to be left up to a tiny circle of people who had to continue ironing out and playtesting their original, trademark battle system in their very, very limited personal time.\nIt's an entirely unpaid development process now lengthy enough that I have been asked about it by cognizant, literate internet users who describe themselves as \"growing up\" with Mortasheen (!!!) and, in some cases, were not actually born yet when I first promised to release something \"soon.\"\n\nEyedra\n\nI myself was in my teens when I drew what would become Mortasheen's first official monsters, I was in my 20's when we started on an RPG concept, and now, I am entering the final years of my 30's. I am not going to let myself wake up at 40 one day with nothing to show for what's basically my life's work, so it's now or never to finally release the game, and I want to be able to make it far, far more worth that wait than it was ever initially going to be, which is where kickstarter comes in.\n\n\"WHAT WILL THE CORE RULEBOOK INCLUDE?\"\n\n\nMortasheen's core rulebook is, like all good rulebooks, much more than play mechanics. For officially the first time, it will flesh out the setting's more unique characters, cultures and environments beyond what you can glean from the existing monster profiles, and will hopefully be an entertaining read even for those who don't actually play tabletop games. It's a world guide and an art book, and we want to release it both digitally and physically with the most polished art and writing we can manage. Contents will include:\n\nPLAYER \"RACES:\"  What peculiar humanoids live in the Mortasheen world, creating all these freaky fiends to battle one another? You either already knew or correctly guessed the answers include things like \"bug people\" and \"gross cyborgs.\"\nCHARACTER CLASSES & SUBCLASSES: everybody's pretty much a \"mad scientist\" in this setting...but what kind? A bonkers botanist? A crackpot chemist? An irrational engineer? The schools of \"science\" in Mortasheen can allow you to customize and boost your monsters in their own strange ways.\nNPC CHARACTERS: famous figures around Mortasheen city, each as peculiar as the monsters they hire to help run their various equally peculiar business endeavors.\nLOCALES: the undulating, undead Corpse Sea. The organic subterranean labyrinth of Axabod. The surreal, twisted forest of the Devil Birds. Sectors of the city and beyond are laid out in detail!\nVILLAINS: what even constitutes an ultimate threat in this setting!? Mortasheen is practically made out of threats! But if it's threats all the way down, there still has to be one at the top.\nTABLES AND LISTS OF ASSORTED WEIRDNESS: what physics-bending nonsense comes of a wormhole experiment? What are the deadliest fungi in the sewers? What can you order at the kind of fast food window that might possibly attempt to eat you first? These and other questions will be answered!\nMORE STUFF: we still haven't covered everything the book will contain!\n\nAt minimum, the final book will be 100-150 pages, full color, probably 8.5x11 inches and available in both soft and hard covers. I intend to try and get the book finished and available for purchase within one year from this campaign's end, coinciding with 2021's Halloween season, but if we finish it sooner, we'll see about releasing it sooner as well!\n\nSanguinettle\n\nWith this campaign's funding and that single extra year of time, I intend to backpay those who have already volunteered hard work on the game and commission a number of additional artists to not only add a more varied, striking range of illustrations but help to improve my own artwork for the book, most of which I completed more than eight years ago and no longer find all that satisfactory. \n\n SOME CONTRIBUTING ARTISTS. AND SAMPLES OF THEIR PREVIOUS WORK:\nBiomechanicalmush!\nArtblog - twitter\n  Laurence Iguanamouth\nArtblog \nFrancine B./Witnesstheabsurd\nArtstation - Twitter - Email\n\n........And hopefully more!\n\n\n\nABOUT THE MORTASHEEN WORLD:\n\nThe titular \"Mortasheen\" itself is the name of an ancient, biomechanical city so improbably vast that light never reaches what used to be \"street level,\" an entire small town could fit on a single factory rooftop and the tallest structures are perpetually snow-capped.\n\nIronically, the sheer scale of this metropolis makes it as lawless and wild as an untamed jungle. It has never been mapped, it seemingly expands by a will of its own, and those powerful enough to seize any kind of leadership role are still lucky to have more than one skyscraper under their jurisdiction. About the only thing remotely centralizing a city \"culture\" is the universal dependency upon bio-engineered monsters for everyday tasks, and the subsequent importance of arcane science as a fundamental life skill. Educational and research institutions reign supreme, with the most prestigious regularly hosting public battle tournaments and handing out all manner of exciting quests as they train students into the next generation of bioengineers.\n\n\nAn entire adventure series could practically be contained in a single \"city block\" of Mortasheen, but its continent-spanning tangle of architecture and machinery has also long transformed the world beyond its borders. There are meat-eating forests, living flesh caverns, a \"sea\" of solid garbage, another \"sea\" of squirming reanimated corpses, a desert of bone-controlling fungus and more. Most wildlife left on the surface has re-evolved from the rats, crows, cockroaches and other urban critters that endured the global contamination of the city's waste processes, and those few normal, natural humans inhabiting the outside world have had to adapt many extreme methods of survival, from living entirely inside of roving war machines to hiding out in orbit.\n...No, honest, it STILL doesn't have an edgy grimdark tone. I promise.\n\n ABOUT THE MONSTERS! \nMortasheen does not have \"elemental types,\" but its monsters are divided into thirteen classes, which are as follows:\nBIOCONSTRUCTS are engineered both for combat and, in many cases, practical everyday uses. This Slurpentine for instance functions as pest control, using its sweet, flypaper-like body to collect and consume the many tiny, swarming things that can not only pose a major nuisance in Mortasheen, but are often weaponized by other monsters. The majority of Mortasheen's monsters are Bioconstructs, in turn divided into Genetizoa (fully organic) and Abiozoa (partially inorganic) creatures, ranging from ancient and terrifying weapons of destruction to dangerously powerful organic washing machines.\nZOMBIE SPAWN are literally born from the bodies of regular zombies, which are more of a \"background presence\" in this setting than a central part of its horror slant. Zombie Spawn typically develop from an egg-like teratoma any zombie may develop with significant age, and despite their pitiful appearances, they are much more dangerous than their shambling \"parents,\" with extreme regenerative powers that can withstand almost anything. This Beeblezug can spew symbiotic maggotoids that could easily reduce someone to gleaming bone in only minutes...though that's just the kind of threat the above  Slurpentine specializes in dealing with.\nWORMBRAINS like this Nemateuthis are monsters under the control of parasites...which are under the control of even smaller parasites. The collective intelligence of their microscopic \"brain flukes\" are essentially their true minds, and the multiple layers of host-organisms are sort of like meaty giant mecha to the tiny worms, which gradually perfected these larger bodies over millenia of evolutionary manipulation. Wormbrains can spread their parasites to temporarily enslave their prey even in the midst of battle, and their flawlessly organized hive minds are very, very difficult to faze.\nECTOSAURS like Eviscergeist are slimy, luminescent monsters that can shift between a solid and semicorporeal state. Like tardigrades, rotifers, ectoprocts and other tiny lifeforms, Ectosaurs can desiccate themselves into seemingly \"immortal\" forms that can be reawakened even centuries later. Often mistaken for fossils, their origins are not entirely understood.\nJOKERS like the legendary and terrifying Harlequeen are stretchy, rubbery monsters filled with psychotropic gases that, somehow, also seem to constitute their brains. Totally alien, unstable and chaotic, they are almost impossible to fully control, and it goes without saying that a whiff of their internal gas will drive almost any creature equally haywire.\n\nARTHROPOIDS like the spider-based Vertigo are complete fusions of human and arthropod into brand new species, and rival bioconstructs in their sheer individual numbers. Highly intelligent, they tend to have a number strange abilities at least loosely derived from their insect, arachnid, crustacean or even lobopod halves. Interestingly enough, insect Arthropoids cannot go through metamorphosis, but a larval insect will produce a completely different Arthropoid species than its adult form.\nFECTOIDS are intelligent viruses infecting specialized bacteria infecting mutated protozoa that can, in turn, fuse together and build larger macroscopic bodies. This Scrabies is seen in its macro phase, but once it grows too large to sustain itself, its body will break back down into a microbial disease, endlessly cycling between the two states. This one is also another monster in symbiosis with swarming pests; unlike other Fectoids, the Scrabies uses mosquitoes, fleas and ticks to further spread its infectious stage.\nBOTANICALS like Lascivenus aren't simply \"plant creatures;\" each is a hybrid of plant, animal and fungus, though one of the three is often subtle enough that some Botanicals can be much more plant-like, more animal-like, or pretty much mushroom people. One thing they are not, however, is photosynthetic; you can't really get healthy sunlight through Mortasheen's smog, so the plant cells of Botanical monsters are universally non-chlorophyllic, and these monsters rely entirely on flesh and blood sustenance. \n(She just wants a hug, though, she already ate)\nVAMPIRES like Vamprey are another, very different product of an intelligent virus, rivaling the one responsible for \"zombies.\" This virus isn't even contagious or dangerous to its hosts, but passed down genetically as it breeds normal organisms into hyper-evolved, staggeringly intelligent super-hosts that never age, require only blood to refuel, defy gravity and read minds.\nAs the virus seemingly originated from the vents of the deep ocean, virtually all vampires are derived from fish, cephalopods or other aquatic organisms. Though we don't yet have fishing mechanics planned, that's something I always wanted to implement as a major means of obtaining the Vampire class.\nWe've even got a vampire clam...and it is indeed called Clampire.\nUNKNOWN such as Vault are a diverse array of entities drawn in from outer dimensional realities. Though most of them originate from many different universes and have no natural relationship to one another, they can be considered a single, cohesive monster class because they all share a form of corruption resulting from interdimensional migration itself; even YOU could become an Unknown-class monster if you slipped into their world! These beings are only *mostly* tangible, they don't interact quite right with the known laws of physics and they're prone to \"glitching\" at any moment.\n\nBIOMECHA like Lazaroid have few extant species, as they are widely considered antiquated and even somewhat \"creepy\" compared to more fully organic monsters. They are, however, still organic enough (despite appearances) that they can self-replicate, sometimes becoming serious pests of themselves as they form what are essentially colonies of \"feral\" cyborgs. As for totally inorganic, fully electronic robots...the very notion of such a thing is downright repulsive to the typical Mortasheen denizen.\nDEVIL BIRDS like Astarath are by far the rarest, possibly oldest, most mysterious and most feared of all monster types. Though no \"magic\" or \"spirits\" exist in this setting, these warped and twisted avians have a mystical, demonic aesthetic and wield strange, terrifying telepathic powers that manipulate the emotional weaknesses and prey upon the vices of their adversaries. \nFinally, we have the GARBAGE class, the most famous of which is the self-devouring Grobbidile. Garbage monsters are entirely accidental by-products of Mortasheen's biochemical waste, and are generally considered almost entirely harmless and useless...though rare individuals can exhibit surprising, deadly powers, and unlike most monsters, some Garbage creatures CAN \"evolve\" into larger, tougher forms.\n...Including Grobbidile!\n\n STRETCH GOALS:\nFULFILLED! We can now pay for even more art and artists! If you're a long-time fan and concerned about the art direction straying too far from Mortasheen's existing style, don't sweat; I'll still be doing character and creature designs, but every artist I bring on board will be able to illustrate something I NEVER could have finished on my own, either because I didn't have the time or there are things I just can't draw! Like machinery and architecture! Every artist will, however, get to design at least something entirely of their own, and the more I can pay them, the more content you'll get of both mine and theirs! More of everything!\n\nFULFILLED!!! Check out Mortasheen Weekly real quick. This artist has made positively FANTASTIC 3-d models of Mortasheen monsters for years now, for relatively little pay, and it's time to put a STOP to that ONCE AND FOR ALL!!!!! By which I mean they should be doing it for a LOT of pay!\nI mean, hokey smokes, look at this Amoebeyes! Now I can start paying this very artist to make monster models compatible with 3-d-print-on-demand services, opening up an official Mortasheen Miniatures Shop! All 3-d models will also be made available to download or purchase for those who already own their own 3-d printer!\nFULFILLED!!! \n\"Wait a minute\" you say...\"why does a tabletop RPG need a sprite project???\"\nMaking an official pixel sprite of EVERY Mortasheen monster has long been on my to-do list, and it's something I'm fully capable of doing myself....or would be, if I didn't have this many monsters to catch up on, many of them already overdue for a design tweak anyway. With enough money to hire STILL MORE indie artists, I can try to get the entire monster archive sprited up in no time, and then we can use those sprites for any number of digital projects, merchandise, and PRINTABLE TOKENS for players to represent any conceivable monster team!\n\nI am adamant, however, that Mortasheen's sprites must bear some resemblance to the visual aesthetic of a certain 1990's gameboy game. In fact, I think this Mumblegog I sprited up myself as an example looks a little too on-model. If you're as charmed as I am by the lopsided Bulbamanders and Squirtasaurs of yesteryear, I hope you'll enjoy what the sprite project will do to these poor fools!\n\nPLUSH DESIGN CHOSEN! For an extra $4,000 we can produce a run of plushes with the help of an excellent manufacturer already lined up! The quote has been based on a medium sized 8-inch plush, the final cost of which should be around $30, plus a little extra shipping.

At the time, the goal is to finish the game and make it available for Steam and Nintendo Switch. However, the possibility of porting Lonesome Village into more consoles has always been our objective.\n You can wishlist Lonesome Village now on Steam:\nWishlist Lonesome Village on Steam now\nLanguages \nThe mechanics of Lonesome Village will be reminiscent of classic RPGs, but our approach to the day-to-day interactions with different villagers and scenarios as well as life sim elements will make the game feel like a brand-new experience altogether.\nAscend the tower and solve your way to the top!\nFind yourself in dungeons that call to mind the atmosphere and quality of the 2D Zelda games.\nSolve tricky dungeon puzzles and save villagers in the tower to advance to the next chamber.  \nYou will find unique puzzles to solve for each animal friend you have to save.   \nHELP THE VILLAGE GROW - Unlock new areas and help Lonesome Village thrive through:\nExploring\nThe Village and its surroundings make up a great area to discover and explore:\nHome Customization\nWes is getting used to his new life in Lonesome, so he needs to make himself comfortable in his new house!

The more happy or comfortable they're about you, they'll give a better price for sale and will pay you more for your items.\nInteracting with the villagers will make your relationship with them even better, which will also make your life in Lonesome easier as they will be nicer with you.\n\nWes is a curious coyote that has always felt a pull towards strange and mysterious things.\nOur little adventurer friend does not live in Lonesome, but he has become involved in the recent odd circumstances surrounding Lonesome and decides to make it his quest to rescue all the villagers that are trapped inside the Tower and save the village from catastrophe.\nThese are normal people (well, not quite like us, but you know) who want to help the village grow again.\nResponsible for Ubhora's disappearance. Will they try to awaken evil again?\nWe have been working really hard to create a unique aesthetic style. We want to show that every single detail of the game represents our commitment to creating a charming adventure like no other.\nThe soundtrack of the game will be created by Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 F\u00e9lix. She is a composer and sound designer that has participated in videogame projects like \"Greak: Memories of Azur\".\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\n*Following assets are representations of what the assets will be like, the final result may vary\n\nVIP Rewards\n*Pay the shipping later!

Our goal is to create fantasy stories in the form of indie video games.\nOur previous game 'Jumper Jon' became the 1st game entirely developed in Mexico for Apple Arcade\u2019s first 100 games release.\nThe experience we have gained from developing all these years has encouraged us to produce a unique experience for PC and Consoles.\nThe development of Lonesome Village has been quite slow, up until this point. Since the beginning of the production process, the game has been developed by a small fraction of the Ogre team. These points combined with a lack of funding has made finishing Lonesome Village quite challenging without support. \nThe current development advance of Lonesome Village is 1/3 of the total development plan.\nHowever, Lonesome Village has seen a lot of positive reactions from the press and on social media, which have praised the art style and the concept of the game, which motivates us to continue developing this project.\nWith your support, we can invest more time and resources into finishing the development of our game. We\u2019re committed to bringing the world of Lonesome Village to life, but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nStay updated with our development! We\u2019ll continue to share important updates on our social media channels:\n  E-mail: ogrepixel@gmail.com\nOur goal is to create a unique experience for those who love to challenge their minds and are always looking for something new to enjoy, that\u2019s why this game needs all of the team\u2019s attention.\nThe development process is complicated, especially for all the features we want to include in the game, which is why the required budget has increased to a point where we need the help of people who want to be part of such a special experience that we know our game can be.\nFortunately, the studio was able to keep operating in spite of the ongoing challenges which came with COVID-19. This allowed us to continue our commitment to finish the development of this charming game.\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter campaign. Even if you decide not to back us, sharing our campaign with your family, friends and social media would be a great help to us :D", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges derived from the development of video games are many.

Take control of Rose, a mysterious amnesic, and explore a world that has fallen into darkness\u2014where only a few precious flickers of light remain. From peaceful grasslands to a long-forgotten mine, Rose will navigate this interconnected 2D world as she gains new abilities and faces off against monstrous creatures, as well as other adventurers with their own hidden plans for the light they all covet.\nPlanning for a launch in the second half of 2022, Chiaroscuro will release on PC and Mac via Steam.\nA riveting and interactive story line.\nAn art style that explores the practice of Chiaroscuro.\nOver a dozen environments to traverse through non-linear exploration.\n Challenging combat and platforming.\n Tight and satisfying gameplay.\nOver two dozen engaging boss battles.\nA plethora of unique characters. \nAdjustable gameplay mechanics through the use of elemental casting.\n Uncover the mysterious history of Chiaroscuro through optional side-quests.\nLooking to get your hands on the game for an early preview?  Here's a short demo of the game to try if you're interested. (Windows and Mac!)\nInterested in following the game's development?  I post frequent updates featuring behind the scenes content on the game's community discord!\nThe region of Chiaroscuro was once overseen by the gods of balance, Yin and Yang, who's coexistence maintained peace throughout the island. However, the world was forever changed when Yang vanished, taking the Lights with him and leaving the land in darkness.  Over time the locals adapted to this new normal, difficult as it was, but when rumors spread of flickering lights in the region\u2014a determined few set off to restore balance to the world.\nThe amnesiac protagonist of Chiaroscuro, Rose. When she first awakens in the Mines little is known about her\u2014but as Rose\u2019s abilities grow and the light scattered throughout the world becomes accessible to her, that forgotten history will begin to resurface.\nEventually, Rose stumbles upon a character known as the Doctor. He introduces himself as a lone agent attempting to cure the world of its imbalance by collecting all of the Lights. Lights are an incredibly powerful element that have been rumored to restore memories, something that is incredibly valuable to Rose.\nAs the name suggests, Bandit is introduced as an outlaw who has been attempting to steal the Lights for self-benefit. However, it turns out he may have entirely different intentions...\nThe region of Chiaroscuro has a plethora of unique environments across its land, the following areas are just a taste of the locations you'll discover in-game.\n The Courtyard may appear to be a peaceful and welcoming grassland, but don't let that lull you into a false sense of security. There are more than a few creatures hiding in the undergrowth just waiting for you to drop your guard.\nThe town of Duskhaven is one of the most notable areas in Chiaroscuro.  Duskhaven was once a bustling mining town\u2014but the miners vanished without a trace the same time the Lights did. This tragic coincidence forced the town to close off the Mines and lean on their ports as their only means of survival.\nThe Ominous Grove is a woodland area filled with an ethereal aura.  Many spirits have made this their home, as the grove was once protected by the Pumpkin King. Unfortunately, the King passed away after the lights faded and this long-standing power vacuum has now attracted the attention of the King's would be heir...\nThe Mines became inaccessible after the disappearance of the town's miners; Duskhaven could not afford anyone else to go missing.  Strangely, one of these mines ran out of ore shortly before the incident, causing some to theorize that the miners did not simply lose their way out due to the lights disappearing.  The Mines are also home to a monstrous beast, which is rumored to eat those who draw too close.\nThe Arctic Cliffs are considered the highest point of elevation in Chiaroscuro. Despite the mountain's visibly icy peaks, the region is actually located on a dormant volcano.  This combination of ice and steam has resulted in the collapse of the mountain's pass, which makes ascending its cliffs much more dangerous.\nThis underground world was once home to an ancient civilization that believed in total isolation from outside influences.  However, over time this cave system, and its inhabitants, became exposed to a dangerous radiation that could not be traced. The impact of which wildly altered the environment and ultimately made the Irradiated Caverns nearly uninhabitable for an age.\nA concept of Rose plasma casting, woah!\nThroughout the game, Rose will come across different elemental fragments. When equipped, these fragments give Rose the ability to manipulate whichever element she is wielding. There are ten elements in the game, each offering the player its own special elemental move and abilities. Additionally, each element offers its own unique playstyle, whether you are one that prioritizes power over caution, speed over health, or vice versa.\nThis is the Spirit Blast, the elemental spell for the Spirit element.\nThere are also many different types of elemental creatures, which will interact with you differently depending on which element you have equipped.\nIn addition to element-specific abilities, Rose has (and will gain) a series of skills that will make up her base skillset regardless of the element being used.\nHop up walls using the jump button!  The longer you hold down the button on a jump, the higher you go.  If you let go early, it stops you mid-fall.\nSlash away at enemies with your blade in order to obtain Lumen.\nSlashing downwards on enemies mid-air causes you to pogo off of them while keeping momentum!  Funny enough, the Chiaroscuro community actually coined this term!\nGet propelled forward in whichever direction you are facing by using the Lumen Dash!  As the name suggests, this costs a small amount of Lumen to use.\nIf your Lumen bar is full you will regenerate health automatically!\nMake use of the Bow, which does not cost Lumen to use and serves as a handy ranged-weapon.\nUse your Lumen to cast a powerful elemental spell that varies in range and power.\nA physical attack that costs Lumen to use, with a utility that varies drastically depending on the element equipped.  For example, the Ruby Strike. A multi-directional dash that enables Rose to charge through, and deal damage to, anything that gets in her path.  This move can also be used for extra mobility when combined with the Lumen Dash as shown in the clip above.\nHey! My name is Joey, also known as BlackberryKin.  I am 20 year old college student studying digital media.  In the future, I aspire to become a full-time indie developer with my own studio working on projects I love.  Chiaroscuro has been the center focus of my life for the past nine months and I hope this passion project continues to point me in the right direction!\n\nI should also mention, while this game development journey started off completely solo, as the game grew more talented individuals began to take notice of its existence.  Since then, I have received tremendous help from the following individuals...\n\"Hey all, I'm Weezlack. I've been writing and recording music for years but recently have been involved in writing music for a few video game projects. I try to focus mainly in synth, ambient and modern cinematic sounds. Chiaroscuro in particular has been a fantastic blend of my love for video games and writing music.\"\n\"Hey, Louvee here, I'm a concept artist that started a year ago to learn and make art. I'm not very experienced but I have a lot of drive and passion to become one of the best and an old master one day. I got interested in Chiaroscuro a couple of months before I contacted Joey to see if I could be a part of it. To be honest I thought I wasn't gonna get in but, surprise surprise I'm here. I'm ready to do my best and deliver a quality and fun game. I'm very excited to bring this project to life and make it into something very special.\"\n\"Hey guys, I'm Alex, 27 years old! I'm a music producer and sound designer. I'm also a session musician!  I'm very excited to be working on some sound design for this project!\"\nThe game's main promotional art is done by Jaya Ply.  He is a fantastic artist and I highly recommend checking out his Twitter page!\nMost of the levels, characters, enemies, and boss concepts originally started on paper.\nHere's an early concept art of Bandit!\nHowever, since the launch of the game's demo I have brought Louvee along to assist with the concept art for the game.\nSome illustrations of Chiaroscuro's main characters by Louvee.\nIf you are interested in checking out some of the game's soundtrack by Weezlack, here are a few 30-second clips for you all!\n Additionally, I am getting the help of Alex Kirrage to design the game's sound effects!  Here is a short demo showcasing an example of some of the updated sound effects for the game.\nPLAY\n\nOkay, it's time to go over the goodies!  If you guys liked the look of the game and think it has potential, why not give it a back?  Here is a list of some exciting backer goodies!\nIf you pledge $15 or more you will receive a digital copy of the game on Steam for Windows or Mac!\nThis will be a digital download sent out a month or two before the release of the game, and will likely have 20 to 30 of our favorite tracks in the game.  This is available for any backer who pledges $30+.\nThe game's beta will be available for anyone who backs $40 or more, which is a sneak peak at part of the real game!  Don't worry, nothing to spoiler-y.  This version will come out a few months before the launch of the game and will have brand new features not showcased in the demo!  Additionally, you will obtain the Beta Tester role on the game's community discord, plus an in-game code for Rose's Flower Girl Skin.\nAnother thing worth mentioning is that I accidentally added the PDF Lore and Concept Art Book to the Beta Tester Early Bird Tier.  That being said, if you are one of the lucky 150 beta tester early birds then you will also get a PDF Lore and Concept Art Book along with it.\nWho doesn't like lore?  If you back $60 or more you will be sent a digital copy of the game's lore book!  This will showcase a visual representation of the game's extensive plot, intriguing characters, interconnected environments, most (if not all) of the game's official concept art, and lastly, old concepts that were scrapped along the way!\n\nI should note that while the previous rewards are stacked depending on how much you pledge, the following are exclusive rewards, which means purchasing the $1,000 tier does not mean you get the $250 or $100 tiers.  That being said, however, the following tiers will include all of the rewards above.\nSince community is important to the game's growth, I want you guys to be a part of the game!  Get your name and a message (keep it appropriate!) in the game by having it engraved in one of the obelisks scattered across the Dreamyard!  This is only available for backers who pledge this specific tier ($100).  You will also receive an extra copy of the game!\nIf you pledge the $150 tier, you will get to design a character!  I will personally help you design said character to represent you in the game.  Have the character say something to the player! You will also receive an extra copy of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $250 tier, you will get to design a character and build that character its own room!  The room's style will vary depending on the location of your character, which I will discuss with you when the time comes.  You will also receive two extra copies of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $500 tier, you will get to design a character and build that character its own room and quest!  The quest can be whatever you wish as long as I give the idea the okay!  You will also obtain the Light role on the game's community discord, along with two extra copies of the game!\nFor those that pledge the $1,000 tier, you will get to design a boss fight for the game!  I will discuss the details regarding designing the boss fight, such as where it will take place, the bosses attack patterns, and the theme of the fight.  The boss should also stick to the scope of the project and should be an appropriate difficulty for whichever point in the game we decide to place it!  You will also obtain the Light role on the game's community discord, along with three extra copies of the game!\nThe game, obviously! I recognize that my ambitions for Chiaroscuro are bigger than just a solo hobby project; I want to dedicate the time that vision demands and hire others to help make it a reality. This Kickstarter campaign will provide the funds to make both of those possible. If the campaign is successful I will be investing the majority of funds into the art, sound design, and animation of Chiaroscuro. The remaining resources will enable me to support myself while I hunker down and focus on developing the game.\nAs a first time developer I want to keep the scope of this project manageable, so that means this Kickstarter campaign is solely focused on the PC/Mac release of Chiaroscuro. Consoles are something I am very interested in bringing Chiaroscuro to in the future though, either following the PC release or through a potential partner. For the moment however, working through the additional requirements (both technical and logistical) that come with releasing on console is something I cannot currently commit to.\nI spent about a week learning the ropes of Game Maker Studio 2 before diving head first into my game development journey.  Chiaroscuro was initially supposed to be a practice project to hone my programming skills.  However, over time I became more invested in the game's development until eventually I decided I wanted to polish it and showcase it on Kickstarter.\nAs of October 23, 2020 I am nine months into the game's development, and I am very satisfied with the progress I have made.   With over 2,000 hours already invested into this project, I am highly confident in my ability to finish it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile Chiaroscuro is my first commercial release, its development is driven by my motivation to grow as a game developer and something I care deeply about. But, as a novice in this space, I fully understand there will be bumps along this road. I know though\u2014that just like the challenges of being a solo developer while creating a demo, building a community, and running a Kickstarter\u2014that I have the drive and passion to overcome those hurdles and see this project to its conclusion.\n\nAlso, as I am a college student there will be times when I need to focus on my studies. I hope that the demo included in this campaign, created over the past 8 months, shows you how I can effectively leverage my time management skills to balance Chiaroscuro's development with my own education.\n\nRegardless if you have the means to support this campaign or not, I want to say thank you for reading this page and for everyone's support throughout these early months of development. You all have been such a supportive group of individuals, and with that support I will continue to tackle this game development journey head on!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Stay in the Loop!", "descp": "Get access to backer-exclusive updates about the game!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Get the Game!", "descp": "Digital download of the game.

We now know it as the ground zero of the parseling phenomenon, the very soil fertile with meaning and words. In the germination stage of the infection, the stench of paranoia and hushed whispers filled the air. I suppose it was only fitting that in such a place every thought and the stray word became enriched with such intensity of significance. Perhaps the most distinctive thing about Nominal City is that large areas of the city were torn from their roots and rose into the air where they have been ever since. The catastrophe of this created many victims and refugees still clustered within the city, to which the rest reacted poorly to. The memory of this event remains a stain in the collective psyche of the people.\n The old city encircled by a new wall, sits quarantined on a peninsula away from the rest of the mainland. Underneath in the craters and shadows, it smells like a dense forest of tall gray buildings with faded and peeling pastel paints. Posters are layered over each other like rings of wood in a tree. Replace the forest animals with people rugged up in their thick coats and scarves becoming anonymous figures. There\u2019s a feeling of oppression in the concrete, the enclosing wall bordering the entirety of Nominal City and the nearby mountain range, the fall of the government, and the rise of large private corporations to take over public interests. It doesn\u2019t help that there\u2019s a new movement, spoken of only in quiet corners. Something that might be a threat. \nParselings, have you heard of them?\nParselings is supported by two distinct systems that have been entwined together to make a complete game. The Choice system covers the rules that represent the thoughts and actions of the characters. While the Parse System dictates how your powers work and how to shape the world. By mastering both parts of this game, your journey will be shaped by your creativity.  However before all of that, in order to enjoy the game of Parselings, you will need to gather a couple of things.\nA Deck of Cards For Each Player\nIn the Choice System, each player controls a single character and a deck constructed out of a set of regular playing cards. The cards you choose will represent your character\u2019s health and mentality. The larger the deck, the more options, and health they have, while in comparison with fewer cards, the more limited their actions are.\nYou will need to make some hard decisions when constructing your deck because of one simple reason: Parselings are not gods, nor are they omnipotent. They will need others to help do what they themselves cannot. As the game progresses your deck can change and twist as your character progresses through different scenarios.\nA Set of Dice For Your Game Master\nThough predominantly a deck-building game, you will still need a set of dice to be shared by your group. When sitting down to play the game, only the GM will actually need these dice. While many NPC actions could be replicated with cards, it is faster for the GM to use dice on lesser challenges.\nA small pool of d6s (six-sided dice) to represent the small enemies and obstacles in the campaign.\nA single d10 (ten-sided dice), d12 (twelve-sided dice), and d20 (twenty-sided dice) to help decide the words a Parseling can use.\nYour Imagination\nAs a roleplaying game, stories are at the heart of these systems and the rules offer a systematic way of translating actions into a format that everyone else agrees upon. We are utilizing our imagination to fuel the game, putting our time and our effort to create our own fun and a story we would want to listen to. For players, this means you\u2019ll need to be able to describe your character and what they want to do. For the GM, you\u2019ll need to create an adventure with your players in a way that everyone enjoys.\nParselings is a game where you get to tell any story that you can imagine.   \nWhether you are undertaking a devious deal or enacting a daring distraction, the circumstances are never the same for any two people. Governing the mechanical side of the game, the Choice System is built to embody the individuality of your own character, to represent how you want to play. By choosing your cards it\u2019s more than just a gamble, your choices are will change fate. \nEach card in your deck tells a story about your character. You\u2019ll know what it feels like to step into their shoes, watching the odds change with every card you spend and every move you make. Whatever happens in your story, the choice is yours.\nPLAY\n\nBy uniting we stand, by dividing you will fall.\nIf the Choice System is the gears directing the fate of your characters, Parses are the heart and soul of the game. The Parse System is where your imagination and will to co-operate with others truly matters. Parsing is the supernatural phenomena or magic that is carried out by two or more Parselings with a simple touch and uttering a small string of words. Through using this power to redefine the world, you\u2019ll be able to achieve amazing feats that would be otherwise impossible.\nA Parseling\u2019s words are determined by their perceived role in the world. These come from anywhere \u2013 from strangers, friends, and even from the Parseling themselves. All players are involved in the process of determining the potential words each character may possess. Dice are used to mix things up and represent the haphazard nature of the Parsecyte they've bonded.\nDo what you will with your gifts, but ask yourselves, how will your words define you?\nAs it stands, the Core Rulebook is already completed, boasting around 220 pages and 100 or so art pieces (some of which you may have already seen). It will be available as both a PDF and a Hard copy. However, you'll also have the chance to pick up a story module and various sets of playing cards themed around the Parselings game. Choose your reward level and back this game to get in on the action!\n\nInfer Memorial station is the perfect introductory module to introduce a table to Parselings, as well as making a tentative foray into a city that is on the cusp of a great change.  Its suitable for up to 6 players, and has a run time of about 1 to 2 hours.  As a bonus, we will be bundling the PDF with some pre-made character sheets so you can jump right in.\nPlaying Cards are also available. Our range of beautiful decks (click here for a better look) which are color coded to make your experience with the game a little easier.\nThe NPC Blank decks are designed for GMs to jot down Quick NPCs on the fly. These usually represent people or creatures that populate the world as the nameless thousands.  Depending on how far we go, we may even include a few examples...\n\nFill up our ink vials by backing Parselings and helping us make the game even better! \nParselings was developed primarily in Australia over 2019-2020 and published by Smunchy Games. \nYou can get in touch with us by joining the Parselings Discord Server, Twitter, and Facebook, or Smunchy Games Discord Server, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs always, there are risks with shipping and production timelines.

Here's what some of the players have been saying about Nocturne: Prelude.\n\"It has an amazing art style and Undertale-like story.\" - SkyKevin \n\"So far I've fell in love with this game. I hope to see it become one of the best rpg games of the year.\" - Billmastoras \n\"The graphics, the combat system, the hidden items, the music, it's all amazing.\" - KawaiiCthulhu \n\"Characters are vivid and I have already found myself smiling and falling in love with them.\" - RazrPredator \n\"I was so engrossed with the music, and the gameplay is really unique! The story had me captivated! Never have I played such a good game in a very long time!\" - Jazmaen \nPlay Nocturne: Prelude right now. The first chapter of Nocturne, available for free on Steam.\n\nNocturne is a story-driven RPG set within a digital afterlife. As you explore a vast and beautiful pixel art world, you'll meet a cast of unique characters who'll challenge what it means to be alive. \nIt features a genre-defying, skill based Rhythm combat system that is suitable for beginners and veterans of the rhythm genre.\n\n\nThe digital afterlife survived humanity's extinction.\nMillennia have passed since humanity's extinction; but somehow you've only just arrived in a digital afterlife. Your conscience was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.\nAs you search for your lost brother, you become entangled in a power struggle between the admins. Doubt is spread about your sudden arrival in this world and the very nature of your existence is questioned.\nNocturne is a story of human identity. What does it mean to be alive in a digital world, where minds are just code running on a machine? Does the life of an individual still have meaning? Should it be protected at all costs? These are the challenges you'll face as a once beautiful world falls apart around you, a world where computational power has become a scarce resource. \nNocturne is inspired by decades of traditional RPGs. \nYou'll find equipment that unlocks powerful combat buffs or special abilities, preparing you for the heart-pumping musical combat that makes Nocturne so unique.\nNocturne's combat is inspired by traditional DDR-style four column rhythm games. It was important that the combat remain fairly true to its roots, while taking advantage of the RPG genre mix where appropriate. You won't need to micro-manage cooldowns & mana in Nocturne, but you'll benefit from various buffs & abilities you acquire through equipment. During the actual battle, you'll focus on hitting notes and being immersed in the music.\n\nNever played a Rhythm game before? No worries, Nocturne has 5 difficulty settings and additional customization that ensures a comfortable experience for everyone. You can even change the difficulty at any save point, so you can always switch things around to keep on track. If you'd like to enjoy the story without any concerns for rhythm, you can always enable Story Mode, which gives you the exact same experience without any fear of failure.\n\"You wish to preserve life, but you fail to understand it. Life is an array of memories, a log of past events. You define yourselves by these memories, but they are nothing more than redundant data.\" - Nocturne\n Unlock Goals\nTrihex will be featured as an NPC in the game if we reach the goal of 200 Retweets for this tweet during the Kickstarter campaign.\nA mystery character will be revealed if we reach 100 Retweets on the announcement Tweet during the Kickstarter campaign.\nAnother mystery character will be revealed if Nocturne: Prelude reaches 500 Reviews on Steam on during the Kickstarter campaign.\nCombat\nYou can equip items which provide combat abilities based on your performance. For example, an item with the Barrier ability will activate after reaching a high enough combo, creating a protective shield that reduces incoming damage. An item with the Restore ability will heal you, but only if you land enough perfect notes. If you're struggling with a fight, then changing your equipment can give you the edge you'll need to overcome a specific encounter.\nYou'll also have to be aware of different note types. Mines will temporarily disable an entire column if you accidentally hit them. Critical notes will cause twice as much damage.\nSilence\nNocturne's puzzles are also rhythmic! Throughout the world you encounter corrupted objects that must be restored through a mechanic called Silence. You'll have to play a sequence of notes while dealing with unusual mechanics, such as the columns moving around, or even going invisible.\nCustomization\nTraditional rhythm games have always provided lots of customization. Every player has preferences, so it's important that Nocturne provides plenty of options. Here's a summary of the customization already available in Nocturne: Prelude.\nSpeed Modifiers (X-Mod/C-Mod)\nNote Speed\nJudgement Text Mode\nJudgement Text Layout\nNote Miss Sounds\nMirror Charts\nNote Colors\nColumn Direction\nLatency Calibration\nKeybindings\nArcade\nThe Arcade is a gamemode that allows you to play any previously beaten enemy or boss.

I'll talk about the many challenges along the way, while providing insight into my working process, my philosophies of design, and the core of what Nocturne is all about. You'll get an in-depth perspective into how Nocturne was made.\nGame Script: The entire script. That's right, the whole thing. Read every single line of dialogue from every cutscene, so you can be sure you've not missed anything.\nDesign Document: Before creating Nocturne: Prelude I wrote a 57 page design document. I'll be expanding this document significantly for the full release. You'll get to read the entire thing. This is the master document that covers everything from the gameplay mechanics, item and ability design, story, characters, combat, music, etc. It's all here.\nCut Content: An important part of design is knowing when to let things go. Sometimes ideas are tested, but never make to release because of technical issues, design conflicts, or perhaps they're just not fun. Learn about some of the content that never made it to release.\nConcept Art: Before any final art assets are made for Nocturne, they'll go through a concept stage where mockups and sketches are created. Often these designs are iterated on many times and can change drastically. You'll get to see early sketches of characters, enemies and locations with notes from myself and the artists about the designs.\n\ud83d\udcd5 Physical Production Book\nA printed & signed physical version of the Production Book.

You can listen to Nocturne: Prelude's soundtrack on YouTube.\nIt was important Nocturne's music was more than just a background track to the gameplay, so the soundtrack was composed to be deeply connected to the characters, creatures and world of Nocturne. You'll not just visually experience the triumphs and tragedies, you'll hear them too. The music provides an emotional core which drives both the story and gameplay.\nAll the combat music in Nocturne was composed with rhythm gameplay in mind. This allows us to create exciting and unexpected twists during boss battles that reflect the intensity of the moment in both the gameplay and music.\nI'm Benjamin Pracy, creator of Nocturne. I've been a professional writer & video editor for almost a decade. Nocturne is my passion project. I hope Prelude speaks for itself to the dedication I've poured into the game over the last few years. I've been blown away by the amazing response (97% positive!) Nocturne has received so far. I'll do my best to beat those high expectations for the full release. I've only just got warmed up.\nNocturne has been self funded for the last few years. I've worked with many talented freelancers, paying for their services out of pocket. Here's a breakdown of the current costs from creating Nocturne: Prelude.\nI've calculated a budget of 140,000 CAD (~$105,000 USD) to complete the rest of the game, with at least half of those funds coming from Kickstarter. Most of the core mechanics are done, so a large part of the work remaining involves producing additional content. That's why I'm expecting the final budget to weigh a little more towards Art & Music over Programming.\nAs the kickstarter budget only represents 50% of the funds needed to finish the game. The remaining $70,000 will be contributed from my own savings over the next few years. I continue to believe in this project enough to put forward my own money, so that together we can make Nocturne the best game it can be.\nWow, you made it all the way to the end.

You're putting up your own money toward the project and the most important concern will be if you'll receive the finished game. I've got two important points to address those concerns.\n\n1) The release of Nocturne: Prelude on Steam is proof of what I'm capable of creating and delivering. It was important to me that I released the first chapter so you have confidence in what you're purchasing and my abilities as a creator.\n\n2) A generous policy on refunds. I'm going above and beyond the typical expectations of a Kickstarter campaign by offering a full refund on any purchase tier, at any time prior to receiving the reward. No questions asked. I'll refund you in full.\n\nThe most likely challenge involved with creating Nocturne will be the timeline. I've given myself a generous time period for release, but like all creative projects, delays can be common. I've learned a lot about managing those timelines during the creation of Prelude, and will apply that knowledge moving forward. I will also keep the community updated about the progress of Nocturne at regular intervals.\n\nIf you ever have questions or concerns, my email is open: hello@pracystudios.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Pracy Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nPracy Studios Ltd.

If you missed the Kickstarter don't worry, you can choose from these three tiers:\nSupport Camomille on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/XavierMoiny \nThe Kind Camomille is a wholesome adventure game about random acts of kindness and the joy of discovery. As Camomille the kind mouse, collect goodies by helping those in need and fill your gift basket for Grandma Rosie's 100th birthday. Relax into this beautiful open-world exploration.\nCurrently being developed for PC Windows and with your help The Kind Camomille can also be released on Nintendo Switch. Scope for the full game is roughly 5 hours of gameplay but I hope to expand this. Play the free Camomille's Playground demo on Steam and Itch.\nCamomille's Playground Demo\nPlay the free demo on Steam\nTwitter / Discord / Press Kit\nReady to take a stroll?\nThis is Camomille! She's a kind, gentle mouse (though a little on the quiet side). She's on her way from the city to The Island for her grandmother's 100th birthday, bringing along a gift basket full of goodies for the special day! \nHowever, misfortune struck! Shortly before arriving on the island, her basket overturned and everything washed out to sea. Now Camomille must do her best to fill it back up again with what goodies she can find.\nThe Island is a beautiful place, full of hidden vistas and little secrets for Camomille to discover.\nFrom the colors, to the design or even the music, everything is crafted with care to lift up the spirit and for you to have a pleasant time on The Island. Every resident on The Island looks out for each other and every creature lives in peace.\nThe Island is an inviting open world for you to discover at your own rhythm. Set forth to discover all the vistas, walk on the beach, run like the breeze through the fields, surprise animals down a path in a forest and search every nook and cranny The Island has to offer.\nHere are a few of areas you'll explore with Camomille:\nCamomille's not the only one on the Island! On her basket-filling quest, she'll encounter all sorts of wild animals, as well as the Island's residents. They could use a bit of help themselves. Here's a few that Camomille can meet...\nMr. Racoon loves painting landscapes, sadly he is all out of a very special type of red that comes from a rare flower.\nMr. Raccoon needs some help with his painting\nMiss. Beaver spends most of her days watching the whales by the cliffs, most of the time she's late for dinner.\nMiss. Beaver has gone exploring and is late for dinner\nMr. Badger enjoys his fly fishing more than anything, but lately the fishes won t bite...\nMr. Badger getting ready to fish\nThe Old Monk tends to his little garden like a mother tends to her kids, his bucket is lost and he is very worried.\nOld Rabbit Monk needs help watering his tomatoes\nThe little kitten just wants a friend...\nTiny fearless kitten will follow Camomille everywhere\nWatch for Camomille's Kickstarter Updates to meet more of the Residents!\nThe more you explore, the more residents you can find to help, and the more items you will discover to fill up the basket. Be rewarded for exploring every nook and cranny of The Island. Some light puzzle solving lies in the way between Camomille and filling her gift basket. Listen carefully to what residents need. \nMr. Pelican needs help getting his boat back\nI want the game to be enjoyable for everyone, including young people, so the puzzles will be more relaxing than challenging. You can finish the game with very little done, or everything done! Being kind is a choice and this wholesome exploration is an invitation to relax and enjoy random acts of kindness.\nCaptain Walrus is very grateful for Camomille's help\nIt all comes down to personal history, it took me years to accept how much I actually cared about people, then I started to witness random acts of kindness when they happened, a concept new to me at that time, believe it or not, and it touched me. Deep. \nThat\u2019s when it changed my life, kindness... and silence, because I finally understood that only silence gives you the opportunity to listen. If you listen, you open yourself to care even about strangers, from that place can be birthed a random act of kindness. \nOriginal concept art\nThat\u2019s why Camomille is quiet, I didn't do it on purpose at first, then it was clear as day. I guess we can say making The Kind Camomille might actually act as a personal therapy of sorts? That would be subconsciously of course!\nConsciously, what I hope for is for my little game to make some people\u2019s day better, and maybe pass along that idea I have about random acts of kindness.\nProduction timeline for The Kind Camomille\nI am mostly finished with the gameplay aspect of The Kind Camomille and it shouldn't change much, unless the demo proves otherwise. The dialogue system and the whole logic behind the residents Camomille meets is built and now needs to be expanded a bit more. \nScale of Islands\nThe wild animals programming is done, now I need to create all the model. The game now needs content: fill up the world, music and sounds, menus, texts and translations. Not to forget all the Steam achievements and lot of polish. \nCustomise your Reward Tier with these extra goodies! Simply add the extra amount onto your pledge and message me the Add-On items you want. \nIs there an Add-On you want but it isn't listed? Tell me in the comments!\nHello there! I'm Xavier, 35 years old game developer from Canada. My love for video games started early with the NES and never stopped since then. After studying in fine arts in Belgium i came to Canada, where i took a program in video games, that was in 2007.\nLife took a different turn and i worked in architectural visualisation, first as a 3D artist, then as an art director and a teacher, it was ok for some time... But that deep need to create something of my own, something to share with you and ultimately, if possible, make your day a bit better, that need never went away. So i decided to jump, and here we are. \nThe Kind Camomille will be my first ever released game, it's a project that will come out, and i will try to make this short game as good as possible. I just need some help to make it even better on release day. \n My big goal is to release The Kind Camomille on Nintendo Switch and complete the loop that started with me discovering the NES 30 years ago! \nMatt is a composer, sound designer, and audio engineer based in sunny Tampa, Florida.  He is the founder of Royal Ruto Studios and creates music and noise for games, films, and podcasts.\n I have been developing Camomille solo, learning a lot through the process. When I found myself too stuck to progress I would reach out to my cousin, a games developer in a big company, for some guidance. I also spend a good amount of time looking through the generous work of many people on Github to help me get there faster. \nWhy I'm choosing Kickstarter:\n Community - The Kind Camomille is a wholesome game for everyone. I want to work closely with you to ensure The Kind Camomille is everything you hope it could be.\n Giving back - Kickstarter rewards means I can give the most back to you. I'm able to provide unique opportunities like having a picture of your pet in The Kind Camomille or a personalised wholesome message written by you, getting you in the game.\n Reputation - The Kickstarter community has helped so many wholesome games like Calico and Snacko. I truly believe Kickstarter will love Camomille.\nNintendo Switch - I will be able to purchase the developer kit needed for Nintendo Switch and can begin porting The Kind Camomille.\nLocalization - I will be able to translate The Kind Camomille into German, Chinese, Japanese, and Russian.\nMusic and sound effects - The Kind Camomille's official composer is Matthew Vaughn from Royal Ruto Studios, and it would benefit greatly from more music and many sound effects.\nSpecialists - As a solo developer it's important to understand the scope of my skills and time available. Hiring other people to help out when needed most will evolve The Kind Camomille into the best version of itself.\nThank you for reading about The Kind Camomille!

If the voice line is realistic it needs to fit the text perfectly, any changes in the text requires a re-recording of the voice acting.\n  2. You would need one voice line per language.\n  3. Recording quality needs to be the same across the audio files.\n\n  As you might know some of the backers have access to recording some audio for a character, how do you go about that when probably most people don\u2019t have the proper recording equipment (or know how) to do it? How do you maintain quality and how do you manage translations? It wouldn\u2019t be fun for my backers and it would be quite the hurdle to make happen.\n\n  The solution? Well, Nintendo!\n  After searching for a while i discovered that Animal Crossing is using a very smart and efficient system to manage custom text to be actually read. The system is simple enough for me to replicate something that works like it.\n\n  While i am not super glad that the sound will end up really close to what they did in Animal Crossing, as i d prefer having something more unique to the game, i have to admit that it\u2019s the ultimate solution for our game, context and budget.\n\n  Here\u2019s how it works :\n\n  You record every phonetic sound of the alphabet, letter by letter and you make a system that can read it (which is surprisingly easy), with some slight randomness to the space between them.\n  Here's a voice reading from A to T in phonetics.\n "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Update #8 - Achievements, Optimizations, Fonts and other things.", "update_content": "Hello everyone! \nI can't believe it's already been over 6 months since TKC has been funded thanks to you all, time goes by so, so, fast. \nAnd as time fly by we are getting closer to release, which is sweet, and stressful at the same time.

We were left with only our sun, our small cluster of planets, and a new, twisted moon. Something, birthed from the sky-eater, fell to our planet and began to twist and warp it.\nIt was the end of our world before anyone living now can remember.\nMany generations later, the remnants of our people wander the twisted land and fight the bioluminescent night-crawling creatures as they search the ruins of our castles and cities for ancient magic and technology to help us survive. The brave and hopeful of us work to keep our pocket-sized towns together and alive.\nNow, so many years after our stars were devoured, you head into the world with a gun at your side.\nI hope you find what you\u2019re looking for.\nWith your friend, a gun, at your side...\nGUN&SLINGER is an RPG about a weapon and a wanderer. A Maestro and two players (Gun and Slinger) set out into a dead planet mutated by a god's forgotten child and hunt strange bounties, investigate the world, and unlock hidden powers. During play, they seek to learn the nature of what\u2019s hunting the Slinger, figure out why the Gun is sentient, and discover how the world died.\nKey Features:\nTell the story of a post-magic world and the people working together to survive.\nExplore the nature of a twisted reality and a force that hunts the players.\nUse Two different playstyles for the Gun and the Slinger with unique capabilities and mechanics.\nAnswer Questions & Prompts at the table to establish a bespoke setting to adventure in.\nYou can be a magical, sentient gun.\n Rewards: \n $12 gets you the final full-color PDF.\n $20 gets you the completed full-color paperback & a digital copy of the PDF.\n $100 gets you all of the above AND an exciting, secret note in your book.\n All backers get their names put in a Special Thanks section in the book.\n All physical tiers get a sticker included in their order!\nbook mockup, final cover may vary. cover art by Sadia Bies\n GUN&SLINGER in podcasts! \nI\u2019ve had the absolute pleasure of guesting on a few awesome podcasts to talk about and play GUN&SLINGER! If you\u2019re lookin\u2019 for a fix of G&S, or some extra info on the design, then check these out!\n Party of One with Jeff Stormer\n Game Closet with Taylor LaBresh\n Rollin\u2019 Bones with Ryan Howard\nGive \u2018em a listen and share with your friends!\nIn GUN&SLINGER, the player-characters are bound together by fate, promises, and magic. One of them fills the role of the Slinger, the other embodies the Gun.\nA Slinger that\u2019s hunted by evil\nThe Slinger is a wanderer, looking for something in this twisted world. They\u2019ve been touched by the Twist and can pull on it for power. They must be careful, though- if they pull on the Twist too much, they\u2019ll lose themselves in it.\nBeing marked, they are hunted by something- a strange, horrifying creature of the Twist\u2019s design. During setup and through play, you decide as a table what this creature is and bring it into scenes using the Maestro\u2019s moves.\nA Gun that\u2019s more than a Gun\nThe Gun may live in a shell of cold steel, but they were not always this way. During setup and through play, you learn about the Gun\u2019s past and how they became trapped in this new body of violence.\nThe Gun may not have arms or legs, but that doesn\u2019t make them unable to affect the world around them. The Gun can use their connection with the remaining elements of Magic in the world to, well, do magic! The runes engraved on their body shape the form of their connection and, in turn, their spells. They can also reach into an ethereal plane of magic that resides alongside the physical realm to move and manipulate things.\nA sample of the Gun\u2019s character sheet\nEach player in GUN&SLINGER interacts with the mechanics differently, all the way down to their stats. Take a look at the section of the Gun\u2019s sheet above. The three starting stats are intentionally a little bit vague for a couple of reasons.\n G&S encourages players to be flexible with stat definitions. The way you approach a situation should dictate what stat it uses, and vise-versa. The Gun could attempt to intimidate people with any of these stats, it\u2019s just up to you to decide how that looks!\n G&S also allows players to, as they progress, create their own stats. In one playtest, a player gave their Slinger the Stat \u201cThe Bigger I Am\u201d and used it as an opposite to \u201cLight On My Toes\u201d. Any time they did something bull-headed or with a physical presence, they\u2019d use this new Stat and force their way through.\nThe way the stats are named in G&S gives you quite a bit of insight into the character they portray all while setting a tone and giving flexibility. You\u2019ve got a 2 in \u201cI've Been Around\u201d. What\u2019s that mean to you? Do you know about the local flora? Can you navigate easily to places you've never been to? That\u2019s up to you, Slinger.\nIn GUN&SLINGER, all conflict is resolved using a deck of playing cards. When a player wants to do something under pressure or with an uncertain outcome, The Maestro presents them with how difficult it'll be to do, and the players need to figure out how best to overcome the challenge.\nIn order to solve the problems they face on their quest to help fix their broken world, they\u2019ll need to tap into the cards they have (through imaginative game-mechanical twists on Go Fish and Blackjack), their stats, and any other tools they happen to have at their disposal.\nAs you venture through the world, tackle problems, and fight monsters, you\u2019ll get to change your stats and rework the game into something that\u2019s truly your own. \nGUN&SLINGER comes with a unique post-post apocalypse setting replete with room to be shaped into something special as your group plays through it. Elements are defined to a certain extent, then ways for you to create specifics or changes are outlined and some examples are given.\nIt\u2019s a world of hope and struggle, mutated by the forgotten child of an unknowable god that ate the stars, leaving behind only your sun, some neighboring planets, and a new moon of strange energy that never leaves the sky. There are aesthetic elements and keystones provided in the book, and some facts about the nature of things like The Twist and Magic are established, then everyone playing is given some prompts and free reign over making this setting something all their own.\nOne playtest took place in a desert land with demons, industry, and gold being key aesthetics. Another was in rolling planes with a never-ending storm, strange new flora, and magic soaking into the planet through the rain.\nA sample of these setting elements: The Twist is a force that mutates the planet for unknown reasons.\nThe Maestro controls the world and works with the players to bring it life. They create challenges, intrigue, and consequences for the players based on their actions. They have the use of a very unique and powerful threat in the form of two Joker cards that can bring an intense sense of pressure and immediacy to any situation. Finally, they also interact with the Go Fish and Pairs mechanics differently and have a unique list of Moves they can make whenever they\u2019re able to afford the cost.\nThere are systems currently in the works to allow GUN&SLINGER to be played without a Maestro.\nCalling The Thing That Hunts using Joker cards\nThe Maestro\u2019s Face Moves\nWhy Kickstarter?\nI want GUN&SLINGER to be the best thing it can be. I\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on the game, and I want to turn it into a physical thing with a level of quality and production that I feel it deserves. I\u2019m here on Kickstarter with this project to raise the money to pay a fantastic team the money they deserve so we can make something kick-ass.\nOur goals & challenges\nOur goal with this Kickstarter is to raise $4,350 to give the product a final physical form, complete with graphic design and art. The final product will be a 40+-page full-color paperback, with professionally-done layout and visceral artwork.\nHere is our estimated budget for creating GUN&SLINGER.\n $1,450 for writing, game design, sensitivity consulting, and editing.\n $1,800 for layout and art (lots of art!)\n $300 for printing from Mixam Press.\n $350 as a just-in-case cash reserve.\n $450 for Kickstarter\u2019s fees and credit card processing.\nThis brings us to $4,350 needed to make this book a reality.\nThe Team\nNevyn Holmes is a game designer based out of central Texas.

[Instagram]\nStretch Goals\nAt $6,350, Viditya Voleti will be writing a new playset, SWORD&BEARER, that will include a new setting, setup section, two new characters, and art by Nadhir Nor!\nHere's the pitch:\nSWORD&BEARER is set within a massive city that shares aesthetics with idealistic European and South-Asian architecture. In this world, magic is relatively commonplace and used in daily life. There\u2019s been an industrial revolution, and many things are powered by a mix of coal and magical energy harnessed from the world. Patrols and the army make use of firearms, and artful melee weapons have become a thing of decoration.\nThe Twist in this setting has taken its place among the ruling classes of the city, driving them to control and capitalize on its people by making them just comfortable enough to be complacent. It is a caste-based capitalistic society where the upper echelons have been infiltrated and manipulated by Magic\u2019s hungry and self-driven sibling, the Twist.\nViditya Voleti (Twitter, Itch). Viditya is a QPoC game designer and writer who loves exploring the medium in several avenues! A true goblin of the community, he wears different hats from making games, consulting, Twitter worldbuilding, streaming live design nights, reading and reviewing games, and really anything he decides will be fun! All of this gets collected on his Patreon.\nNadhir Nor is an illustrator from Malaysia. From folkloric visuals for musicians to cheesy queer romance tucked between his art books, he's very interested in seeing how the modern society can navigate between what's mundane and magical.\nAt $7,250, Adira Slattery will be writing an alternate character for the GUN, the DEMON, to be included in the final book, with fresh art by Josef Rahaman and a sigil by Ezra Rose!\nHere's the pitch:\nTHE DEMON is an optional playbook replacing either the GUN or the SWORD as a companion. Instead of existing as an object, the Demon lives within the arm of the SLINGER or the BEARER. It only remembers how to cause pain, and it doesn't want to let go. \nAdira Slattery is a trans Jewish game designer, poet, and podcast human. Her work spans comedy, horror, and intimacy. Adira has designed a number of amazing projects, and her work in very thoughtful spaces of game design will be sure to make THE DEMON a powerhouse of a character option.\nJosef Rahaman is a concept artist from Arizona with a major passion for games & the creativity that births them. Throughout attaining a degree in Digital Culture, he jumped at every opportunity to expand his expertise knowledge of creative processes.  He aims to imbue that spirit of ingenuity into everything he does with the hope that it will inspire joy and creativity in others. His work and flexibility of styles is a perfect fit to bring THE DEMON to life!\nEzra Rose is an illustrator, zinester & multi-disciplinary creator living on a small farm in Western Massachusetts with queer chosen family.

Play as a MECH excavated from the remnants of a strange past civilization, who reached for the PILOT in its desperation and now finds itself uncovering its memories through experiencing the world with the Pilot. \nExplore a fantasy-like world with fragments of highly advanced magitech societies born from space ships scattering its surface. Some large factions powered by these fragments exist and struggle to keep the rest of the world ignorant of the legacies they are meant to inherit. Mobile Aberrant Geoanimus, corrupted mecha obsessed with non-corrupted mecha and their pilots, wander the lands, corrupting everything they touch.\nPam Punzalan is a queer woman from the Philippines. Her works explore queerness, emotion, memories, violence, reclamation, rebellion, and identity. She's published her own work (Sundo, Asian Acceptance, a lot of micro RPGs), collaborated with others (Maharlika, several Zinequest 2020 entries) and is on a number of major projects (Sina Una, Ancestry & Culture, Five Torches Deep, Spire, Rookwood).\nMisael \"Gio\" Manning is a Filipino Canadian concept artist and illustrator.

Explore the jungles of Amazonia as Marisa, alongside her capybara companion!\nThe Arkanya Team is working alongside Top Hat Studios to bring The Girl from Arkanya to Nintendo Switch, PS4, and Xbox One, as well as Steam and Itch.io. Backers will receive the game on the platform of their choosing, though beta access will be through Steam and Itch only.\nFollow us on Twitter and join our Discord for news and updates! \nClick to go to our Twitter page.\nClick to access our discord server.\nLet's go, Kapi!!!!\nThe Girl from Arkanya is the tale of Marisa, an aspiring young adventurer with her sights set on becoming the world\u2019s greatest treasure hunter! She is accompanied by her capybara companion, and you will need to use both characters together in creative ways to solve puzzles and challenges. But treasure hunting can be a risky business! As Marisa ventures further in to untamed wilds and dark dungeons, you must constantly weigh risk versus reward as one wrong step could mean losing everything.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to popular demand, we now have capybara petting!\n\n\nThe Girl from Arkanya takes a proven formula and expands upon it. The beginning of the game will feel very familiar to fans of the top-down action RPG genre, but the game quickly changes as the player is tasked with controlling not one, but two characters!\nOnce Marisa meets Kapi, he will follow behind Marisa for the rest of her journey, and the player may take control of him at any time! Marisa can also push, pull, carry, and throw her rodent companion, which will help her solve challenges she will face along the way.\nWorking together with your giant rodent is essential to your success!\n\nThe wilds of Amazonia can be cruel and unforgiving, and treasure hunting is a game of risk vs. reward! The player will collect valuable gems and artifacts from the jungle, which can be traded to Renzo de Rocco, Arkanya\u2019s esteemed collector of exotic goods. He will pay you handsomely if you can make it back to the city with treasure in hand, but be warned: If Marisa is defeated, she will drop all of her treasure!\nDon't worry, Kapi will always be there to save you!\nWe designed Arkanya around the idea that the player sets their own difficulty through the choices they make. Going forward, we will continue to find new ways to allow players to avoid risky situations, while also creating even greater rewards for those who run head-first into danger and succeed! Thriving in Amazonia is a matter of preparation, and continuously asking yourself one question: Do I play it safe and turn back, or press forward and risk it all for a chance at even greater fortune?\nKAPI WE GOTTA GO!\n\nThe year is 1167 A.D., and the port city of Arkanya is fast becoming the jewel of the Holy Roman Empire. Seated at the edge of the known world on the most fertile soil ever seen, Arkanya grew into a bustling city within a mere forty years, built by the hands of explorers, farmers, and merchants.\nYet uncertainty haunts the future of Arkanya. The Marajoaran tribe, which once peacefully lived alongside the people of Arkanya, has vanished into the wilds without a word. To the North, the forces of Aztlan wage a desperate war against the conquistadors of Castille, a conflict which has now spilled into Amazonia. And to further complicate matters, the weather has become chaotic and violent, disrupting life within Arkanya\u2019s walls.\nHigh Priest Xolotl, Hero of Aztlan, Scourge of Marajoara, and the world's greatest necromancer.\nThere is little room for debate - The Bierhaus is the cultural center of Arkanya.\n Perhaps the most important tool in Marisa's kit is her Shaman Dances. They allow her to alter the world around her in various ways, such as altering the weather, commanding nature, or unlocking the secrets of Marajoara. \n\nDancing is tied to it's own keybind, meaning the player never has to swap items to activate a dance effect. This was important because of the frequency with which players will have to activate various dances. \nDue to the limit of two equipped items, we didn't want players to feel like they always had to have Marisa's sword equipped. With this in mind, we have designed almost all items to have an offensive use, as well as their utility function. While the sword will always be the best item for raw damage, the player will be able to effectively fight with a variety of tools. \nDon't forget to stock up on cold beverages when going exploring!\n\nMarisa and Ari, Old (left) versus new (right)\nART\nWe went into the project with very little art experience, which meant that early builds were done primarily with modified versions of assets we'd bought. Because we didn't want to be limited to using only art we could find/afford, the game's lead programmer devoted a great deal of time to practicing pixel art. \nArkanya has undergone three identifiable generations of art now, though the transition between each one was gradual. \nEarly builds of Arkanya ran in a 4:3 aspect ratio.\nArt improvement is still an ongoing process, as newer art starts to really outshine older art and makes it look out of place. We predict that there will be at least one more distinct generation, though much of the current art will probably stay as it is. \nImprovements made to not only the sprite itself, but to the fluidity of the animations\nMUSIC\nWe originally planned to have a 16-bit soundtrack using SNES-style sound fonts, but soon abandoned that concept when it became clear that the game was not going to follow SNES limitations. \nWe feel that memorable music is an important part of any game. Robby's sound design philosophy has maintained a short, simple, but memorable style that many would associate with that era of gaming, but using more modern production methods. \n\nThe Girl from Arkanya is expected to sell for 20 USD at the time of launch, so please take advantage of the discounted price during the campaign!\n\n\n\n\nPoster Art of The Girl from Arkanya (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the acrylic standees (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the Arkanya Art Book (Design may be subject to change)\nMockup of the Kapi body pillow\n\n So far, Arkanya has been funded out of our own pockets. This hasn't always been easy, as the team experienced some unexpected expenses not related to Arkanya, and like many others, we were financially impacted by COVID-19. However, we have found ways to stretch our dollars and get the most possible bang for our buck, and we will continue to do so after this campaign. \n So where is this $10,000 going? Here's our budget estimate based on the information we could find. \nPayment Processing and Kickstarter fees: 10% ($1000)\nTaxes: 10% ($1000)\nSoftware Licensing: 12% ($1200)\nCreation of Physical Rewards: 12% ($1200) \nCommissioned Art: 8% ($800)\nBusiness/Legal fees: 2% ($200)\nDevelopment: 46% ($4600)\nThe nice thing about these numbers is that most of the percentages stay the same or even go down if we exceed our funding goal. So the more money we raise, the greater percentage that goes into the development budget. \nMore funding means faster and better development! There are, of course, diminishing returns on this. We could get ten million dollars and Arkanya still would not come out tomorrow. However, each dollar we raise means less time worrying about keeping the lights on, and more time focused on making The Girl from Arkanya the best game it can be. \nClick to go to our Itch.io page!\nA note about the Chapter 1 prototype: Leading up to our Kickstarter launch, we made the decision to work overtime and get many big visual updates ready in time for the trailer. However, we were unable to update Chapter 1 with these visuals. The build you will play is outdated by four months, but we hope you will enjoy it all the same. A newer version will be available for download in the near future!\n Harrison Withrow: Lead Developer and Artist\n  Robby Siva: Sound Designer/Composer, Assistant Developer\nPublishing, marketing assistance, and port development provided by Top Hat Studios, Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough we often receive help from our amazing friends and community, Arkanya is ultimately a two man team working part-time on the project. This brings with it several challenges. One such challenge was that preparing for the Kickstarter campaign brought actual development of the game to a grinding halt. \n\nOnce the campaign is over and this chapter behind us, our very first priority is to polish the Chapter 1 Beta into a full-fledged, stable demo. We give you our word that we will provide frequent updates on development via social media and Kickstarter, not just until the updated demo releases, but through the entirety of development.

It is a game filled with grassy fields, mossy shrines, herds of chubby bumblebees, opossums in sundresses, salamanders with suspenders, starry night skies, and the most beautiful sunsets you can imagine. You might be a tamarin who dances with small and forgotten gods, a leporine mail carrier who relies on moths to get packages where they belong, a little lizard with a big heart and a mysterious past, or a near-endless number of other thrilling possibilities. No matter what, we\u2019re always travelers\u2014animal-folk who go from village to village and get to see the length and breadth of all the world of H\u00e6th. The seasons will change as we play, and we will change with them. But I can\u2019t tell you all that will happen on our journey together, along the winding dirt road and amid the grassy fields. We\u2019re just going to have to find that out together.\nWill you join me?\nThe Journey Ahead\nWanderhome makes use of a unique game system inspired by the No Dice, No Masters engine, developed by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum for Dream Askew and Dream Apart. Each player will make a character with the help of one of fifteen possible playbooks, making choices about their personality, animal-form, look, and passions. Each of these playbooks give you a radically different approach both to navigating the setting and growing over time. From the carefree Ragamuffin to the introverted Poet, from the Guardian and their young ward to the lonely Exile, from the cheerful Dancer to the moody Veteran, there is plenty of space in Wanderhome to imagine every possible world that lives in your heart.\nOnce you\u2019ve created your character, you and your fellow travelers guide them through the dreamlike pastoral world of H\u00e6th. There are no dice in Wanderhome. Instead, you can inconvenience yourself or step outside your comfort zone in order to get tokens, and then turn around and spend those tokens to tackle larger problems and help make the world a better, kinder space.\nQuote from Vincent and Elliot Baker of Lumpley Games\nQuote from Samuel Mui Shen Ern, Babblegumsam\n\nAs you arrive at each new place, you\u2019ll build it together using a combination of thirty-six distinct natures, including farms, fields, lakes, ports, glens, and towers, among many, many more. Each nature gives you the tools you need to imagine and articulate both the literal and metaphorical aspects of the place you find yourself in. These places have kith, ordinary people living ordinary lives, navigating a world that is both peaceful and difficult in its own ways. Each kith is made out of traits that range from crafty and adventurous to many-faced and oracular. These traits give kith things they can do to define their personality, articulate the problems in their life, and push the journey forward (for good or for ill.) Sometimes you\u2019ll be able to help the kith with their problems, but more often than not you\u2019ll just spend time with them and learn more about the world.\nSketches by Kimberli Johnson, Nadhir Nor, and Letty Wilson\nWanderhome is structured with an emphasis on safety and care, built on my own work designing safety mechanics and constructing alternate safety approaches beyond the industry standards. It features a bespoke set of safety mechanics built around empowering players to guide the story however they want, which are used consistently throughout the game. It is also designed to collaboratively set the tone and articulate a version of H\u00e6th that's perfect for your group. \nWanderhome is a GM-agnostic game\u2013while you can play with a Guide facilitating the world, you can also approach it without anyone in charge, where everyone takes equal part in the collaborative conversation. And while you can play Wanderhome in as little as 3-4 hours, the longer you stay with Wanderhome the more the world will grow with you. The months will pass over time and as each season concludes you\u2019ll get to make new choices about your character, advancing them in new directions and helping them grow in ways you didn\u2019t think was possible. If you play long enough, eventually your characters will retire or grow apart, and the journey will continue with brand-new travelers and a vast world ahead of you.\nThe free playkit is available on Itch now! (Art by Letty Wilson)\nThe World of Haeth\nWanderhome is set in the wholly-original fantasy world of H\u00e6th, inspired by the works of Brian Jacques, Tove Jansson, and Hayao Miyazaki. The game hints at and builds a mythological language around forces like the bitter King of the Floating Mountain, the Lily Rebellion, the Slobbering God and the blade that killed her, and the fall of the great dragons of old, but refuses to elaborate or define them\u2014leaving that exercise to the players through the journey itself. Instead, Wanderhome is focused on the lives of ordinary people, and the world that exists for farmers, merchants, and crafts-folk.\nWanderhome is a world filled with animal-folk and their buggy livestock. Unlike many worlds with animal-folk, there is no morality or judgement ascribed to the various animals of H\u00e6th\u2014a snake is just as capable of being a kindly farmer as a rabbit, and you can\u2019t assume much about someone based on what animal they are. You might find a fluffy shepherd with a herd of bumblebees, a shrewish merchant riding a stag beetle the size of a house, a lonely fox riding a grasshopper from place to place, or a praying mantis that hangs out in a gecko\u2019s pocket.\nQuote from Avery Alder, Buried Without Ceremony (Art by Jennie Lindberg)\nWanderhome also features an original calendar of new months and seasons, with its own cycle of holidays and traditions. From flowery Bloommeadow to brisk Firetop to snug and quiet Snowblanket, each month is both rooted in potentially familiar natural cycles but with a unique twist. Each place you travel to has a different expression of the seasons in it - no matter how many times you travel through the year, it will always feel different. If you play Wanderhome long enough, you might even encounter unique phenomena that create a new twist on the calendar. \nThe H\u00e6th is a world full of queer love, hope, happiness, and community. It is a land that was once ravaged by violence, but is putting itself back together again. Wanderhome dares to imagine a better world, one where money and power are distant stories from a bygone age, and we can learn to begin the process of healing.\nThumbnails by Danny Kyobe and Jo Thierolf\nKickstarter\nWanderhome, like all projects, is a dream that can only be created with your help. In an industry dominated by exploitative hiring practices and low wages, I believe it\u2019s possible to release a large-scale high-quality game where everyone is paid what they\u2019re worth. While the funding goal is higher than most Kickstarters, I refuse to get away with underpaying or undervaluing the incredible artists, writers, designers, and creators who are willing to pour their heart and soul into this game. Wanderhome is ambitious, but the hope is to make something unlike anything else in the role-playing game space.\nThe final copy of Wanderhome will exist in two forms\u2014a complete digital PDF copy of the game, and an approximately 150 page 8.5\u201d square softcover in full color, printed by Mixam Press and published by Possum Creek Games. Wanderhome will feature a cover by Sylvia Bi, illustrations by Letty Wilson, and full-page pieces by more than a dozen different artists, each with a unique style and perspective on Wanderhome. These talents are being directed (and the book is being designed) by the one-of-a-kind Ruby Lavin, with editing by Kazumi Chin and Luke Jordan.\nHere is how the budget is being distributed:\n $5,000 for game design and editing.\n $7,000 for layout and all the incredible art.\n $4,000 for printing and production.\n $800 for Backerkit, who will be handling shipping after the Kickstarter.\n $1,800 for Kickstarter and credit card fees\nMockups of the Book (design not final)\nHardcover Now Available!\nPDF Tiers\nSoftcover Tiers\nHardcover Tiers\nMerchant Tiers\nPilgrim Tier\nThe Team\nJay Dragon\nJay is a queer lyrical game designer who lives in the Hudson Valley.

These will probably be available on Backerkit instead of through tiers, but we'll keep you posted!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWanderhome is completely finished, and no additional content needs to be created. However, I can imagine hiccups in production, manufacturing, and distribution. While this is Possum Creek Games' fourth project with Kickstarter, it is on a scale we haven't previously worked with, and there might be issues ensuring a speedy timeline with the many artists. While we've spent the past several months preparing for the larger scale of Wanderhome, we still admit there might be logistical complexities.\n\nAdditionally, we live on a precipice right now. The world is in the midst of a series of enormous crises, and the United States that Wanderhome will be distributed in might be very different than the United States of the summer. Our timeline has already been prepared with the acknowledgement that COVID, the rise of the far right, fallout from the American 2020 election, or goodness knows what else might meaningfully and dangerously impact the project.

I am Stranga, the creator of the games: Just Ignore Them, My Big Sister and Red Bow. I also co-created Mini Thief along with Tommah. \nWelcome to the Kickstarter for my latest game Ashina: The Red Witch. A top-down horror-themed story adventure game.\n\nThe story is about Ash. An ordinary girl who takes a journey through a mysterious spirit world filled with strange creatures. Ash must find her way back home...before something else finds her. This game is a canon prequel to one of my previous games 'My Big Sister' which will tell the story of the events that led to the red witch. \nI also have plans to include some alternate endings to the game as wells as a few secret ones. \n\n\nAll of my games (except Mini Thief) are made in Adventure Game Studio. AGS gives me the flexibility to create something more unique and adventurous than RPG Maker. Most of the engine's functions and systems are already pre-built into the engine, which gives me more time to create my own unique systems and features.  I have more designing freedom with less programming to create it  and I love to design!   \nThe game will feature:\nA unique and thrilling story!\nNew and exciting characters! As well as some returning characters from my previous games.\nAdventure like puzzles throughout the game to help keep your mind at its wits.\nExtra character dialogue options to delve into some of the lore surrounding the game's universe.\nMini-Games!\nAn Original Soundtrack + Remixed Soundtrack.\nAchievements + Trophies! As well as an in-game trophy system.  \n\n\nThe reason I started this kick starter is to help financially support me and my family whilst I develop the project. I'm a full-time game developer and I do absolutely everything myself, from programming and artwork to story and music. I occasionally receive help when it comes to testing or grammar checking (As I tend to miss quite a few things while I program). \nBut my stories are made for the fans and players. I love to share them with everyone! \nWith the extra funding, I will be able to make a longer game with much more content than my previous titles. I also hope to add a few new mechanics as well as some  extensive puzzles \n\nThe game will initially release on PC through Steam and itch.io as early access when available. Once the PC full release has been established, the game will be ported to consoles such as:\nPS4\nXboxOne\nNintendo Switch\n\n\nThe stretch goals will be used to extend the game and add more nifty features.\n + $5,000 - An extra chapter will be added to the game!\n + $10,000 - An extra chapter + Bonus alternate ending!\n +$20,000 - Digital art book!\n  +$50,000 - In game character lore book or collectors cards + Character face portraits to dialog! \n +$100,000 - A defibrillator to revive me  after I pass out seeing so much support!(Just kidding!). Animated intro + a few animated cutscenes throughout the game + Possible IOS and Android ports of the game + I'll think of some more things, don't worry!\nWith your funding, I estimate a full release around early to mid-2021 or even late 2020 (It all depends on the stretch goals). I want to try and make this game as enjoyable as I can with as much content that I can pack into the game add as much content as I can to the game, hence why the stretch goals are important.

There is a full story with lovely sprite and anime-style art, along with a fantastic soundtrack! \nWith multiple difficulty settings, you can choose a more relaxed, story-driven experience OR push your puzzle and tactical skills to the limits.     \nLike what you see? Play the game yourself! We've been releasing public builds for several months now and lots of people are already playing and enjoying the game, even in its pre-alpha state. If you like what you see, remember that we have over 12 months of additional development left, with plenty more story, gameplay, and art to come.\nNote: These are PRE-ALPHA builds and may have bugs, placeholder content, and gameplay balance issues. They're still fun, though!\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Windows\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Mac OSX\nPuzzle Explorers (b43) for Linux\nJoin the Discord Community!\nWe've got a Tangledeep server with a dedicated #puzzle-explorers channel, so if you want to talk to other players, give feedback, report bugs, or share memes, come on in!\nWant to play more throughout development?\nBackers at the $15 tier and above will have access to beta builds, followed by Early Access, and finally the complete game via Steam!  \nPuzzle Explorers has real-time combat where you (and eventually, your party!) face off against up to 3 monsters at once. While monsters and your allies take turns attacking and using special abilities, the main character - Mirai - controls the flow of battle on the puzzle board.\n\n       By clearing lines, you'll deal damage to a monster with a regular attack. Clear multiple lines at once for much more powerful blows. Some monsters may use charge attacks which can be interrupted with your attacks. This makes it important to weigh the state of your puzzle board with the battle scenario. Exciting!   \nThere are plenty of other battle features that become unlocked as you progress in the game. For example, monster attacks often mess with your puzzle board by removing blocks, swapping your tiles, speeding up the game, and more! But you can also strike back harder by connecting link crystals in blocks, which can be cleared for combo multipliers.  \nIn contrast with the high-energy battles, you'll also come across ruins which can be rebuilt for rewards. To do this, you must drop the right blocks in the right locations. Though these puzzles start out easy, they can be quite tricky... and equally satisfying to solve!   \nYour home base in Puzzle Explorers is the town of New Riverstone. Here is where you'll meet a host of charming characters, buy items, and go on quests. A big part of the game is building and upgrading the town, which involves both fighting battles and seeking resources.\n\n       To gather resources, you'll talk to Hagan the Miner and play in Mining Mode. This is an arcade-style, time-attack puzzle where you have 2 minutes to get all the resources you can.  \nTo earn these resources, you must clear lines with those resources. Clearing lines also increases the Resource (blue) gauge. When it fills up, Hagan will throw more resource blocks on to the map. The faster (and more) you clear, the faster you'll find more resources. You might even find some special treasure chests!  \nYou can move freely through town like a 2D side-scroller, talking to townspeople and learning their backstories, as well as helping the town develop.  \nYou'll help the townspeople by completing Town Upgrades. As you gather resources and defeat bosses, you'll collect dozens of resource types and key items which can be used to purchase items or equipment, as well as build up the town and progress the story.\n\n       Several NPCs have their own roles, and by giving them the resources they need, they'll be able to thrive. It's not all about combat!  \nUnlike other falling block-style games, you have the ability to choose what pieces are in your \"bag\" using the power of the Flowstone. You must have 8 different pieces, all of which have their advantages and disadvantages.  \nFor example, small 3-piece blocks may be convenient, but they are slower than larger 5 and 6-piece blocks which may work against you in Battles. Also, some blocks contain link crystals which help you deal huge damage in battle when combined carefully.  \nYou start out by only dropping \"Flow\" blocks, which deal physical damage. You will later find: Fire blocks that deal damage-over-time, and are a better use of small line clears; Ice blocks that freeze an enemy and prevent them from acting; and Lightning blocks that scale even higher with bigger clears, and hit all enemies at once.\n\n       Monsters can also have elemental strengths and weaknesses, so using the right element at the right time is really important. Furthermore, certain elements work best with certain sized pieces. Be sure to experiment to see what works best for you! \nFlow, Fire, Ice, and Lightning are some of the elemental choices you can make\nThe story is a character-driven, three-part epic. Whether it's our hero, NPCs, party members, or antagonists, we want each one to be memorable, expressive, and interesting.\n\n       Picture a lush & verdant world that was lost to time for many millenia and only recently rediscovered by denizens far beneath the surface. New frontiers are being explored every day, but much is still unknown. Without great empires and civilizations, towns, clans, and kinships form in unexpected ways.\n\n       Although some have banded together to live in harmony - like the town of New Riverstone - others prefer to take the fruits of labor by force. Tales of roving pirates and mighty fleets abound. But nothing is as simple as it seems!  \nMirai will meet a ton of interesting and unique characters on her journey\nWe've come up with a grand variety of tempting rewards for backers at all levels! Besides obtaining the game and soundtrack, you'll be able to get your name in the Special Thanks, get a cool digital artbook, or even collaborate with us to create new puzzles, monsters, and characters.\nWhat we're not doing is any kind of physical rewards (except for the highest tiers, and even then, it's a small item.) Our previous experiences with Kickstarter, though all successful, have shown us that manufacturing physical goods adds a lot of time, hassle, and expense to a project. We think you'll agree these resources are much better spent on making the game better.  \nGoldfrogs love cheese almost as much as Mirai! These cute croakers are designed by Flea Circus Designs\nIn 2017, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for our first title, Tangledeep, with a similar purpose: raising money to further polish art and music. We think this same approach makes sense for Puzzle Explorers. While we have invested our own time and money heavily into the game, there is always more we can do to improve the game's presentation, for example:\nMore character portraits with additional moods or expressions\nProfessional mixing and mastering of the soundtrack\nAdditional live musicians to make some tracks sound even better\nA greater variety of particle FX and animations \nMore sound effects to accompany the wide range of abilities and events \nAdditional flavor text and character conversations\n... and much more!\nWe do not need money to finish the core game. We're doing that no matter what! We're fortunate to be in the position where income from our previous game and income from other projects is enough for us to fund the core development of Puzzle Explorers. \nThat means no risk that we'll accidentally burn through our Kickstarter funding and be unable to finish. Instead, this funding will all go to making the game tangibly, materially better-looking and sounding. And what's not to love about that?  \nFor several months now, Puzzle Explorers has been in 'public development', and we intend on keeping it that way! This means you can always:\nChat on Discord - Talk to us and other players about your experiences with the game! Share strategies, tricks, or awesome combos you've pulled off.\nRead the Dev Log - See what goes into the game every build, and contribute your own suggestions or feedback!\nWatch Development Live - We're shooting to stream development a couple times a week, always announced on Twitter (@TangledeepGame)first!\n\n       As mentioned above, public builds will continue to be available through the end of September, 2020. After this, builds will only be available to $15+ backers.  \nWith much of the core gameplay complete, our biggest task is building out the story of the game. While the story outline is complete, the written dialogue has to be input in game-readable dialogue, along with all accompanying cutscenes, animations, and music. These in turn require ongoing art assets for new allies, enemies, and environments.\nOn the programming side, we've established the core gameplay loop already - combat,  unique ruins puzzles, town upgrades, mining - so future tasks are closely tied to story progression as opposed to core engine and mechanics.\nWith that in mind, our broad goals are as follows.\nEnd of Summer 2020: Complete all game UIs (e.g. menus, dialogues, and other user interfaces.) Act 1 story finished and implemented in some form. Bistro conversation system implemented (converse with more NPCs!)\nEnd of Fall 2020: Game launched in Early Access. Act 1 story fully polished. Basic Steam achievements. Nintendo Switch port started. Most Job Spirits implemented.\nEnd of 2020: Full story complete. All jobs implemented.\nQ1 2021: Story fully polished. Nintendo Switch port ready for testing.\nQ2 2021: Ship the final game!\nOngoing: Fixing bugs, adjusting game balance, and making quality-of-life changes to enhance the overall experience. Writing & mixing music, creating SFX, and visual effects also happens parallel to all other development.  \n Andrew Aversa - Lead Programmer & Studio Founder\nComing from a background in music composition and production, game development was a big career change for Aversa in 2016, when he founded Impact Gameworks and began work on Tangledeep. It was also the fulfillment of a lifelong dream of creating video games, taking inspiration from the beloved golden age of RPGs (SNES & PlayStation).\nFor Puzzle Explorers, Aversa is bringing the many lessons learned from his first project to make this game's development easier, faster, and more fun, while also contributing to some of the game's battle and puzzle design.\nAlso, he promises UIManagerScript.cs won't be 20,000 lines this time.\nAndrew Luers - Lead Artist, Lead Designer, Composer\nAs the person responsible for the gorgeous environmental art of Tangledeep, Luers was more than ready to flex his artistic muscles and creativity in a new title. As a long-time puzzle game and JRPG lover, his concept for Puzzle Explorers wasn't totally unexpected: combining two of his passions into a dream project. \nSince he began designing the game in 2018, Luers has been tirelessly leading the project from puzzle design to story outlines and monster encounters. Simultaneously, he's taken his pixel art to a whole new level with stunningly large landscapes and beautifully-animated characters. He only wishes he could escape Bronze in League of Legends.\nFun fact: Luers competed in the finals of the 1990 Nintendo World Championships and was one of just 90 competitors to receive the (now coveted) holy-grail of retro game collecting: the NWC grey cart for NES. \nMolly Heady-Carroll - Animation\nMolly was a Creature Designer and Pixel Artist for Tangledeep\u2019s DLC Legend of Shara and Dawn of Dragons. She makes a return for Puzzle Explorers as an Animator: bringing performances to the characters.  \nMolly graduated from the University of Arts Utrecht, The Netherlands, with a Masters Degree in Game Art in 2014. Since then she has created art for games such as Stranger Things 3: The Game, The Mummy: Dark Universe Stories, Crap! I\u2019m Broke: Out of Pocket and, of course, the Tangledeep series. Molly currently lives in the Netherlands with her husband and two leopard geckos.\nScott Hagelgans - Lead Writer\nA fan of gaming throughout his entire life, Scott (aka 'FenixDown') developed a special affinity for RPGs and other story-centric genres over the years. He acted as a secondary scenario writer for Tangledeep and contributed extensively to its DLC expansions, Legend of Shara and Dawn of Dragons. Also, as a huge fan of video game music, he served as a script writer for the official OverClocked ReMix podcast for over a year.\nScott is currently the reigning champion of the biannual, post-MAGfest Bennett Foddy's Get On Top tournament.\nJames Mello - Sound Designer\nJames has contributed sound design, audio implementation, and music on a variety of projects for VR, mobile games, and any game jam he can find. He has also toured the far corners of the United States as a musician, running two vans into the ground playing shows with artists like Mike Watt, the Lemonheads, and Joe Lally (Fugazi). He also somehow ended up playing a rehearsal show with Jimmy Fallon for the Tonight Show.\nJames can often be spotted in the wild roaming the streets of Seattle with his trusty Zoom H5 recorder, along with his trusty sidekick Bev the dog.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDeveloping a game often involves unexpected bugs and issues which can throw a wrench into even the best plans and schedules. This is especially true when porting to Nintendo Switch, which involves approvals and testing that we have limited control over. \n\nWe have made what we think are reasonable delivery estimations for v1.0 of the game, based on our experience successfully shipping \"Tangledeep\" on PC in 2018 and on Switch in 2019. We also plan on launching in Early Access before the v1.0 release in order to further polish the game based on player feedback.\n\nWe have put over a year of development into Puzzle Explorers already, along with a significant amount of our own money. There is very little we can imagine that would prevent us from finishing and releasing the game, especially given our track record with Tangledeep.\n\nThat said, if any issues arise that might delay the game beyond our planned date, we will communicate this well in advance to backers. The most likely issues would relate to Nintendo Switch approvals, or waiting on third-parties such as localization teams.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "zirconmusic\n4 created \u00b7 11 backed\nAndrew 'zircon' Aversa is a game developer, composer, and sound designer based in Fulton, MD.

Don't let your guard down and use everything you have learned to overcome these skilled fighters! \nFive Gods of Kung Fu will be released on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux.\nI'll be honest, this is my first game and as much as i would love to see it on Xbox, PS4 and Switch, it will require a lot of time and money. I wouldn't be comfortable right now to estimate that, so I am not gonna put it up as a stretch goal. But you have my word, if this kickstarter is successful I will do my absolute best to bring it to consoles in the future. The more money i can raise right now, the more likely console ports will become. \nYou play as Li, who works at his grandfather's small restaurant mainly as a dishwasher. The recent growth of gangs all over the country is making life harder for everyone and when a local gang stirs up trouble in your grandfather's restaurant you seek help from a nearby Kung Fu school.\nAfter learning the basics of self defense, you try to protect the family business the next time the gang arrives, but can do so only with the help of an old man who saw his meal interrupted and helped defend the restaurant.\nThis old man is a true master of Kung Fu and will start your journey to become a legendary Fighter. Someone who might fulfill the prophecy of defeating the mysterious Five Gods of Kung Fu, learn their secrets and unify the land.\nThe game will feature an original soundtrack written by me. I've been playing the piano basically all my life and the guitar half my life. Making music is a big part of me and everything you have heard in the trailer, the demo or what you'll find below is written by me. Have a listen!\nSmash the initial funding goal to reveal stretch goals!\nMany of the features and systems are already developed. The main work left will be content. I plan to work closely with the community to make every part of the game the best it can be. \nThe demo is about 20 minutes of playable content and contains only a small taste of what I want the final game to be. I published it early to gather feedback and I definitely want to continue in that kind of development with lots of community involvement.\nYou can expect a game length of 6-9 hours of story and additional end game features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo game development is always a little risky.

A capital in full decadence, where its glorious past has vanished through the passage of time and it has been painted into forgotten tomes of libraries set on fire. The civil war has come to an end and a fatal disease haunts the city, corrupted to the bone.\nWithin this world, left to its fate lives Eric, a man who remembers nothing and stands in the middle of a conspiracy bigger than himself.\nHidden secrets and tales will bring back an ancestral past created by wars between the messiah and the false prophets. Gods and false gods, spells and alchemies, ancient orders that arise and an evolving race made by unknown creatures called \"the Cold Ones\" lost through legends and songs, which only a few brave souls are not afraid to sing.\nEric will have to subvert the words of the hidden prophecy, the one that haunts him in his nightmares. It\u2019s a continuous obsession, which will force him to venture through dark palaces and mysterious castles populated by nobles corrupted by power, scientists blinded by knowledge, and bloodthirsty mutants.\nIt will be an ongoing challenge against creepy and strange creatures, abominations feeding on blood and human memories, where no one or nothing can be trusted: only rely on one's own strength. \nThe Last Faith is a Metroidvania that promotes a deep exploration style gameplay with non-linear levels. While you travel around the giant map, you have control over the way you want to be next. Every single spot counts, as you can discover new items, new secret areas, particular puzzles to solve and unique enemies.  \nYou have the choice to wield your favourite weapon as the game provides a large number of them, you will be able to power them up with special buffs and mostly you will cast magic spells against your enemies. All of this is wrapped up in a stunning and highly detailed pixel art style. \nWith the stunning visual effects, different combos, special attacks and three types of dodges, The Last Faith provides deep and satisfying reactive action combat. You will be able to switch between a variety numbers of weapons where each of them has different stats and special movesets. Here are some of the melee weapons we implemented on the game. We are constantly thinking and designing new ideas:  \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nAlso you will be able to choose between different distance weapons such as guns and rifles. They possess a unique passive ability, you can get a bonus chance of breaking the defence and stun the enemy. An example can be seen in this demonstration: \nfire guns concept arts\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe dodges are divided in 3 types: back dodge, tactical dodge and evasive dodge:\n Back dodge: simply escapes attacks by sliding back. Can perform special attack right after using the dodge.\n Tactical dodge: It allows you to dodge attacks while sliding behind the enemy for then facing its back. This will open a chance for you to quickly deal a good amount of damage. (Good during duel combats)\n Evasive dodge: Dive roll to avoid specific types of enemies. (Good to avoid large number of enemies at the same time)\nHere is a demonstration of all the three types of dodge: \nWeapons can be buffed by using elemental powders. Those are special items you can collect while playing the game. You will either find them by killing enemies or buying them. Buffing weapon will add an extra bonus damage and some passive ability.  \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Fire Buff Gameplay - Add fire to the main weapon, and add an extra bonus damage. It is very effective against beasts and Cold ones.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Electric Buff Gameplay - By adding electricity to your weapon, you will get an advantage against humanoids and armored enemies. This also increases the chance of stunning them. \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Ice Buff Gameplay - Add Ice effects to the main weapon. This will slow down the enemies plus it will give an extra chance to freeze and execute them by disintegrating them into a thousand pieces.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n Dark Buff Gameplay - Add dark bonuses to the main weapon. The bonus ignores the enemies defence and armour stats plus you absorb mana from them\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nCursed blood Gameplay - This is a special buff. You can acquire the cursed blood automatically, right after executing a specific type of enemy. This will make your weapons turn with blood and adds bonus damage. Very Effective Vs humanoid.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nThe last faith also provides some supportive magic spells to deal extra damage to enemies and bosses. Like the buffs, the game provides 4 types of magic spells: fire, ice, dark, and electric. We are constantly creating new effects and magic spells. Here are few of the magic spell we implemented on the gameplay:\n\nThe Last Faith core is a Gothic-style based around the 19th century, mixed with dark, creepy, and horror feelings. We built a world around those themes; in fact, you will play through giant cathedrals, astonishing palaces, and majestic castles with highly detailed sculptures and decorations.\nThe game is a Metroidvania at the core, which means levels are designed to be non-linear. You are free to explore even the most hidden secret part of the world, you will travel through a giant world connected by different levels and huge environments, it presents a variety of puzzles to unlock different areas and secret areas of the game. You will acquire a large number of abilities, not only to help your combat situations, but mostly needed to progress on new parts of the game. Here are a few examples of what to expect and and we are also excited to work on even more abilities:\n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nAs a player you will be able to interact with several environment items, such as boxes, chairs and more. We are constantly iterating on new ideas. Here is an example of picking up and throwing away a chair:\ninteract with chair\ninteract with corpse\n\n\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nOur plan is to release The Last Faith to as many platforms as possible. The main goal will be Steam (PC/Mac/Linux), Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4, and Xbox One. \n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nThe Last Faith is populated by a variety of creepy creatures. We designed a large number of types at this stage and we are still constantly creating new ideas. Here is an overview of what you will encounter through the gameplay:\nThe Widow\nThe Hollow Hunter\nCathedral Guardian\nVultures of the North\nThe Blood Seeker\nBlind Sinner\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n We also designed stunning giant bosses, as we want to give an extra level of creepiness to the game. There will be more to come!\nLaddak the Cold One\nRuthless Beast\nHorror of the Crypt\nHydra - The Child of the Abyss\n\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nWe would love to introduce some of our concept art made during the early stage of our game design process. We took a large amount of time creating the main character and some of the selected environments. There will be a big collection of art and concept art printed in our upcoming artbook and it will include more deep stories and facts about our universe. \n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\n\n \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \n\n\nWe have been working non-stop on The Last Faith for about two years now and after spending a large amount of time exploring the core themes, concepts, visuals, and combat mechanics, we are finally ready to move at full-speed to the production stage.\nWe are a small team formed by two brothers Duilio and Riccardo Guglielmino. Our goal is to create memorable experiences through building video games. We are very committed to this as we are spending every single seconds of our life in building projects. We have years of experience in both developing and designing video games, mobile games and also web apps.\nThe Last Faith project was born from our passion of gothic architecture and arts. We want to create an experience where people have to feel what means living in an epoch full of mysteries and terrifying environments. For example, living in a gothic city or walking through an ancient street where strange creatures or bad inhuman experiments ambush you.\nWe have been supported by amazing people, and we would love to shout out them for their incredible talent and work!\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \nWe built and delivered Ninja Knight in 2017, our first video game project, a beautiful handcrafted flat design challenging action game for Android. \nGet it on Google Play Store\nAs a small team, we have been working on The Last Faith for about two years now. We spent a lot of time in exploring concepts, themes and ideas around what we have today. We built several prototypes to find out what works best and what doesn't. We have also been funding the game ourselves and while working on our full time jobs, we\u2019ve been putting all of the possible remaining time we had from our lives into the project, including our sleepless nights. With the success of the Kickstarter campaign, you will give us and to The Last Faith an amazing chance to become real! \nThe journey is long, we\u2019ve been working on lots of aspects of the game, such as main feelings, themes and core ideas. We still need to work on some other parts of the game, level design, content, polish and more. We are planning to create lots more enemies, environments, abilities and spells and we want to invest into beautiful concepts in the areas of art and also music and sounds FX as we think they are a critical piece to the overall experience of The Last Faith. \nWith the funding efforts and your support, you will help us in shaping the project and speed up the production and put us in a full time development mode. We can\u2019t wait to share with you our vision!

You juggle enemies, explore mysterious islands on your airship, and fight ruthless bosses, all with a combat system inspired by deep technical actions games like Devil May Cry.\nCurrently, we are aiming to release on Steam and other digital PC platforms supporting Windows, Mac and Linux some time in late 2022 with PS4, XBOX ONE , and Nintendo Switch ports potentially coming in future. We are also open to releasing on the as of now upcoming PS5 and XBOX Series X, but we will adjust our plans with time.\nMade in Game Maker Studio 2.\n Presskit\n Twitter: @HyMyNameIsMatt\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/TgdZcyY \n\nWho is Hello Penguin Team?\nWe're a small group that have has been making games for the past 10 years.  Over time our short little hobby games have grown in scope and in scale leading us to Vernal Edge, our most ambitious project to date!  We've spent years working on mods, creating short games, and freelancing to create art and code for other games.  We're committed to doing things our own way and will make whatever weird creative decisions we want to create our perfect game.\nWe are Matthew Martinez (artist / co-programmer / co-designer)\nand Alex McCaskey (musician / sound / co-programmer / co-designer)\nWhy Kickstarter?\n  To us, Kickstarter is the most honest platform for funding games development.  We love our community and don't want to develop our games apart from them.  To that end Kickstarter is a perfect fit for us, allowing the community to tell us what they think of Vernal Edge for themselves, and receiving the funds we need to develop the game based on merit.\nCombat\nVernal Edge's Features a broad moveset, light resource management, and in depth juggling mechanics inspired by classic action titles like Devil May Cry. The game also features many customization options, giving you the freedom to tune your moves exactly to your playstyle.\nOf course there are still some challenges to overcome in a fight, no enemy worth their salt will let you combo them into oblivion without a fight.  Enemies have a defensive tool we call Poise to prevent you from destroying them completely until you've broken it all down.  You can use your Charged Attacks, Pulse Attacks, and Spells(which we'll get into later) to help you break down an enemy's defenses and perform some mad combos on them.\nPoise: To start, some enemies will have 1 or more blue orbs below their health bar, this being their Poise.  While they have Poise, you can not stun them or knock them around.  Certain abilities and attacks directly deal Poise Damage, offering you different options to deal Poise Damage you can even knock enemies into each other to destroy their Poise.  Once an enemy's Poise is broken, you can begin to combo them freely until they recover from the stun.  You can see this as a blue meter beneath their health bar, so there's no nasty surprises when an enemy recovers.  This back and forth relationship between you and your foes is what makes Vernal Edge tick.\nCharged Attacks: Plain and simple, and usually very good at breaking enemy Poise.  Hold down the attack button and release after the glow to perform a charged attack.  There are different attacks you can do depending on the direction you hold and even whether or not you're in the air!\nPulse Attacks: Since most of our inspirations for Vernal Edge's gameplay are 3d and use lock-on target systems, we wanted an option in combat that lets you perform attacks to specific targets.  Using Vernal's magic sword, you can throw out a Ghost Blade that marks an enemy, and lets you perform attack target to that enemy specifically!  Barrel into them, shred them with a thousand swords, or run up to them and deliver a multi-hit barrage!  You spend Pulse Points to perform these attacks, and the only way to gain them back is to hit more enemies.\nExploration and Platforming\nIn Vernal Edge, you explore the sky in your airship and land on islands in whatever order you want.  While on these islands you can use an array of swift and stylish tools like sliding and air steps.  Using these tools you can make movement or as technical or relaxing as you want, and we fully intend for some of you to sequence break.  Every island contains new environments to navigate, enemies to fight, treasures to uncover, and stories to unravel. In addition there exists a mysterious hidden world that links the islands together with even more secrets to discover.\nUpgrades and Customization\nWhile exploring, you'll find various equipable spells and abilities (called Memories), giving you new combat and platforming options and sometimes expanding the functionality of previously acquired abilities.   Some rare Memories will even give you access to important movement abilities that let you traverse new areas.\nSpells: Secondary and highly specialized abilities that can help you deal more damage under the right situation, or help you break down an enemy's defenses.  You only have 4 slots to equip spells at a time, so you'll have to decide which ones best suit you for any given fight.\nMinor Memories: Lost techniques from other fighters, you can directly assimilate their muscle memory and perform techniques that enhance your core abilities.  Do a rising punch out of your slide attack, catch your sword when it returns to you to perform a deadly spin attack, there are many options to let you build a playstyle you enjoy.  However, you can only equip so many memories at a time, but as you play the game and expand the capabilties of your mind you can equip more and become a lethal force.\nItems:  You'll find consumable items hidden in secret locations and to purchase from shops.  Using these you can restore your health and mana, or take more aggressive items if you're more confident in your abilities and want to use them as a part of your aggressive playstyle.\nOur hero, Vernal, has taken to the skies  of  Haricot, a kingdom that one day mysteriously broke off from the ground and rose into the sky,  to exact revenge on her long lost father. In her search she comes across Chervil, a strange cyborg with the mind of a brilliant scientist but no memory.  Both of them decide to team up and explore the sky in search of answers.  Along the way they clash with monster and the newly risen Church of Aloe, uncover hidden truths about the world, and run into a mysterious and powerful woman named Alstroemeria, who is also searching for Vernal's father.  All while Chervil attempts to keep Vernal out of trouble everywhere they go.\nWhile those two are off on their adventure, things shift and move on the islands.  Unexplained catastrophes have occurred on the islands, monsters are appearing and wreaking havoc, and some mysterious figures have appeared traveling throughout the kingdom.  The struggle for control seems to be fought from many sides, and there is much more going on than there would seem.\n\nVernal\nThe art of the sword is a difficult one to master, taking years of practice until you are truly a proficient killing machine.  Vernal does not actually know how to use a sword, she just hits people with it.\nAge 22, Vernal is on the hunt for her deadbeat father to deliver righteous punishment.  She's recently discovered that he is somewhere in the Kingdom of Haricot, and flung herself up there to find him.  She isn't exactly a bountiful harvest of wisdom or information, being unable to even read.  What she lacks in knowledge she more than makes up for in raw emotional energy.  She gives every attack her all, and won't tolerate anyone standing in her way.\nAlstroemeria\nIn the language of flowers, the Alstroemeria symbolizes devotion and friendship. Unfortunately, neither of these qualities accurately describes Alstroemeria herself.\nAge 19, Alstroemeria is a mysterious woman, appearing time and again seemingly on her own quest, and no vessel around that she would travel with.  Not to be messed with, she seems to have a strong proficiency in channeling magic without a ring-shaped catalyst to do so, and has the strength of 10 men.  She looks down upon the weak and feeble minded that she comes across and treats Vernal with especially nasty disdain.  She's cold, intelligent, and staying out of her way would be the smart thing to do.\nChervil\nMagical energy flows around and inside us constantly like a current.  It is theoretically possible to record one's inner current and make a template with which your very soul could be recreated, or at least that's Chervil's working theory.\nAge unknown, Chervil is a man in a machine, with no memory of who he originally was.  He is seemingly brilliant, quick to learn, and hungry for knowledge, but quite reserved.  He pairs up with Vernal, in the search for answers as to who he is and why the islands rose from the earth.  Being the only one who can pilot the ship (or read), he is a vital part of the duo.\nRings are the means with which we control the magic around us.  Magic flows all around us in a current, and the creation of specialized ring shaped catalysts allows us to shape that energy in a way that's useful to us.  Depending on the catalyst, you can achieve amazing results through your channeling: creating force, illuminating the dark, and even flight.  But using this technology on a sword?  That seems a bit...\nVernal Edge takes place in the Kingdom of Haricot, where the land mysteriously rose from the earth two deades ago ago. The culture and political structure of the lands that rose were completely upended, allowing a once minor religious organization to take power by feeding off of the people's fears. Somehow despite this crisis, the pace of research into Sorcery and \"Memory Storage\" has drastically accelerated, creating a massive technological boom on the islands, the likes of which has never been seen before.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVernal Edge hopes to combine open exploration, a compelling narrative, and stylish action combat. Games with similar combat systems are traditionally structured linearly and don't offer much choice, while it's already a known challenge to create compelling narratives in games that allow the player freedom to openly explore the world, so we will be on our own pioneering this combination of elements. While we've had experience creating small games with this world structure before, performing this task with a larger scale project will test the games content and systems to their limits.\n\nIt is also apparent that Vernal Edge will be a high scope project. with detailed environments and even more detailed character animations. We know that over the time of development life can always strike with setbacks and dilemmas, but we are experienced developers and confident we can manage any unexpected events and bring the game to you in a timely manner.\n\nWe believe Vernal Edge is special, and we will do whatever it takes to see it complete. Your encouragement and support have been extremely special to us, and we promise that the game only gets better from here.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental

Also, in the days following the murder of George Floyd, during the height of discussion on social media, attention was rightfully on larger issues than funding a game on kickstarter. Certainly, we\u2019re happy that people are paying attention to these issues and that they were using their money to donate to relevant charities, but it did put a halt to our funding for a few days; so we have a bit of catching up to do! If you can, please donate or share us around. It will help a ton during this final stretch!\n\nTo everyone who\u2019s backed us, we\u2019re extremely thankful.

They are made for out of the box play, and are perfect to pull out on any occasion.\nLittlebox games are easy to learn and quick to play. Each RPG is a heartfelt, collaborative experience, designed to deliver impactful play in just a few hours. There is no game master, and players tell the story together. It\u2019s different every time!\nEach game comes in a reinforced tarot sized tuckbox (7 x 12 cm), that you can easily throw in your bag and take anywhere. And with dry erasable markers, you can play again and again!\nThis Kickstarter features the first two games in the series:\nVillagesong, a game of leadership and change\nOur Mundane Supernatural Life, a cozy game of extraordinary daily living\nLead your village to strength or ruin, or help your werewolf flatmate face their first full moon, all in a single session. Create characters you care about, and then explore their stories of love, hope, and revenge in just a few hours.\nEmpty the box and find all the components you need to play. No preparation or printing needed, just open the rulebook and get started. Perfect for taking anywhere. Play your first game or teach a friend!\nPlayers work together to tell the story with the help of the cards. Close relationships form the heart of both games. Village bonds are forged and broken, an extraordinary day comes to an end \u2013 how have you changed?\nVillagesong is a fantastical RPG about communities, leadership, and change, inspired by tales from ancient Java. Your decisions will determine the future of your village and the island. What will you sacrifice, and what will you hold dear?\nAs we have reached our stretch goal, we'll expand Villagesong to include solo and two player rules, so you can enjoy the game with any number of players. We'll provide these rules as a PDF you can read on your phone, with no printing or prep required.\nYou play a village leader, responsible for the wellbeing and future of your home.\nAs the game progresses, you will make tough decisions that change your village, and the entire island. Choice by choice, you will shape the song of your village, sung for many years to come.\nDecide the future of your village\nThe tides of change wash over your island. During your turn, you will draw a change card, and reveal a new pressure facing your village.\nEager merchants look for a place to trade. The envoys of the great kingdom arrive in your village. The fanged demon queen offers an elixir of great power.\nDecide, do you accept their offer and take change into your own hands? Or do you resist their influence and send them onwards to another village?\nOnce you\u2019ve made your choice, explore the impact of the change on the villages.\nBonds are forged and broken\nYour village cannot stand alone. It is connected to those that surround it \u2013 by the flowing river or the mountain pass, but also by the bonds of blood or friendship that tie the leaders together.\nBut what is best for your village may not be best for those around you. If the trust between leaders is broken, the bond between your villages breaks too, leaving you to perilously make amends, or face the future alone.\nHow will you be remembered?\nAs you make decisions during the game, change cards are tucked beneath your village, leaving a chronicle of your time as leader. Your villagesong, a melody of life, handed onward for generations to come.\nMuch of Villagesong is inspired by tales from ancient Java. With your help, we will be able to dive further into history and myth, and bring these stories to life in the best way possible. The materials pictured above are not final \u2013 we\u2019re continuing to improve the game as we learn more about ancient Java and how to represent it.\nOur Mundane Supernatural Life is a cozy two player RPG that explores the everyday life of a supernatural person and their loved one. It\u2019s a game about the difficulties of going grocery shopping when you\u2019re partly ethereal, or the importance of finding good child care every full moon.\nSpend an extraordinary day unlike any other.\nYou and your friend play a supernatural person and their loved one. In this game, you will play through a single day of your life together. But life always comes with its problems. Face supernatural and mundane troubles as your day unfolds. \nPlan your day\nPlan your day by writing your daily activities on the cards, and then placing these in chronological order. What's happening today?\nPlay your day \nPlay through a scene for each activity in your day:\nSet the timer: Each scene takes a randomised length, to highlight glimpses of the mundane and the supernatural as your day plays through.\nCheck for a symbol: Turn over the card and check for a symbol to see if the activity goes smoothly, brings you closer, or creates trouble in your day.\nPlay the scene: Play through the scene until the timer runs out! Jump in to play secondary characters as needed. \nWe released a free version of Our Mundane Supernatural Life in 2018. When we heard how much people enjoyed the game, we decided to make a revised and expanded edition. \nGive the game a try! Get the original 2018 version free below:\nThe Littlebox Edition features:\nMulti-day play mode: Play out your mundane supernatural life over three days, instead of one. Roll 1d4 for that element of your day you just can\u2019t control \u2013 the weather!\nTwo new scene symbols: Hearts (\u2661) are scenes of connection between yourself and your loved one, while stars (\u2606) are moments of realisation or awareness about your own life. These new symbols are designed to be used with the multi-day play mode, but can also be used with the standard game.\nTime tokens: Two tokens that allow you to take control of the length of a scene \u2013 but only if you blurt something out!\nWe are not using a pledge manager for this campaign.

Check out our Steam page and add us to your wishlist to get notified upon release! \nWeaving Tides is a charming singleplayer adventure set in a world of magic and textile. Ride on the backs of carpet dragons and explore a stunning textile landscape, as you soar above and dive below the weave.\nCall your Weaver and set out on a journey to explore ancient dungeons, solve puzzles, challenge quirky creatures and unravel the great mysteries of a long forgotten past!\nDive into an enchanting, woven world and reveal secret pathways.\n Stitch and cut your way through the textile landscape and wrap up your foes using your Weaver's unique stitching abilities.\nSolve tricky textile puzzles which are scattered across the world.\nConquer Zelda-like dungeons but beware of their fearsome guardians!\nBefriend three different Weavers, choose the one that fits your playstyle.\nOutfit your Weavers with mystic embroideries to enhance their abilities.\nUncover hidden mysteries packed in a charming story.\nPrologue Download\nWeaving Tides will be available in seven languages: English, German, Russian, French, Spanish, Japanese and Simplified Chinese.  \nWe will also keep our ears open to your requests. If there is enough  interest we will do our best to translate Weaving Tides to even more  languages.\nSome of our biggest influences: The Legend of Zelda Series, Bastion & Tearaway\nWeaving Tides is influenced by a cluster of our combined interests and the things we love, but among our greatest inspirations are the Legend of Zelda series, Bastion and Tearaway. Our takeaways from these games are:\nAn epic adventure filled with challenges like in the Legend of Zelda  \nA beautifully crafted story and lush, vivid environments like in Bastion \nCreative Puzzles and witty interactions with your surroundings like in Tearaway \nAll of the mechanics in Weaving Tides are inspired by textile crafting techniques. The Weaver dragon you ride has a \u201cribbon tail\u201d that flows behind it as you fly. It serves a variety of purposes and is the key to completing the challenges of the woven world.\nUsing the Weaver's ribbon allows you to complete magical stitching patterns, pull down hovering chests, drag heavy rugs, pull open curtains and more. \nSometimes the solution lies hidden somewhere close by, other times you will have to explore the mechanics of the puzzle further in order to solve it. Use your imagination and puzzle-solving skills to overcome these challenges and advance on your journey.\nThe world is filled with secrets and optional puzzles. Find them and your curiosity will be rewarded with new clues revealing the mysteries of the world or useful new items.\nWhile the primary focus of Weaving Tides lies in the narrative, as well as puzzles and exploration, it also offers laid-back, fun combat mechanics. \n Every enemy will require you to adopt a different strategy in order to defeat it.   \n While, for example, the Toothy Yappers have to be flipped onto their backs by resurfacing right beneath them or dashing through them\u2026 \n  ...the moles have to be pulled out of their dens before you can stitch or dash them.\nThe combat in Weaving Tides is challenging, but not overwhelming.  If it turns out to be too easy for you, you will be delighted by the various opt-in modifiers in forms of items which will toughen up your foes.  \nOnce you\u2019ve mastered these skills, explore dungeons to put them to the test! We have three dungeons waiting for you: a forgotten desert temple, a mind tangling forest maze and a dangerous lair which has yet to be unveiled!\nAnd of course at the end of each dungeon a boss is waiting for you! \nExperience a sprawling, strange new world full of adventure and secrets. In this world Tass seems to be the only one of his kind - a human. Accompanied by his foster dad Kilim he sets out to solve the mysteries of his past. But the world he calls home is changing in dark, unexpected ways, and a force that once lay dormant beneath the weave is awakening. \n Weaving Tides is a tale about finding a sense of belonging. The story is told in a light-hearted way sprinkled with charming characters and witty puns, but at its core it is a rich and emotional narrative about family, identity and the blurred lines of morality.\n Travel across the four unique layers of the woven world. Each layer has it\u2019s own culture, aesthetic, puzzles and dangers. This strange world is inhabited by intelligent beings called \"the Mothkin\", moth people with human-like features and a predominantly friendly nature. \nExplore the sun-drenched dunes of the Silken Desert, home to small nomadic villages such as your hometown, Veteri.\nLush, dense & dangerous, the Spun Forests are home to the tribal Mothkin who are strict believers of the great mother Dea.\nThe Mothkin empire is a stronghold of trade and culture. Blessed by a moderate climate the Mothkin of the empire express their love for their land by growing beautiful, well-trimmed gardens.\nSome speak of barren landscapes ravaged by relentless storms and hidden deep beneath the lustrous cities of the empire. Unknown things lurk down there; all we know for certain is they mean us no good.\nThe Weavers are the guardians of the woven world. Even though most Weavers are loners, three of them will join you in your quest and will invite you to ride on their backs. \nEach one of the Weavers behaves slightly different. While Twill has a higher movement speed, Luce can take more hits, for example - but their greatest difference lies in their special stitching abilities. It is up to you to use the Weaver best suited to your current situation, or you could just use whichever Weaver you like best!\nKilim's special move allows him to cover a wide area, perfect for patching up large rips and slowing down groups of enemies.\nTwill spits her ribbon in a straight line and can therefore precisely remove single threats without having to move into dangerous zones herself. \nWhen Luce\u2019s special move is unleashed he rushes forward, stitching and cutting everything in his path. Great for breaking through walls of enemies; not so great at avoiding painful obstacles. \nAlthough you will find some items by simply exploring the world and uncovering secret areas, some of the most sought after ones can only be bought from Salis the flying merchant.  \nYou gain Thread Essence by patching up tears in the world and by unsealing chests. Use the essence to buy magical embroidered patches which will greatly help you on your journey.\nA small selection of the magical emroideries you will find on your journey.\nSome of the items will be opt-in modifiers for folks that want an extra challenge: to give the enemies, say, more health in exchange for larger rewards. \n Sometimes a Mothkin will entrust you with a letter to a loved one, other times you might find a ripped scroll of parchment stuck between the branches of a terry-tree. Collect these writings if you wish to delve deeper into the lore and mysteries of the woven world.\nCapable explorers will find ways to reach even the most remote areas of the woven world. There you will find enchanted ribbons which can be used exclusively in Playground mode. Collect them all to create a stunning masterpiece of digital embroidery!\nWeaving Tides' Playgrounds mode invites you to create your own digital artwork. In this mode you can choose from a variety of ribbons, including those you unlocked in Adventure mode. There are also some helpful special features:\ndifferent camera positions allow perfect framing for your fancywork\nyou can toggle the cutting functionality of the dash ability on or off\nload in custom transparent background images to trace with your stitches\ntake a snapshot of your finished work by using the built-in camera\n The only limit is your imagination! Combine different ribbon styles to create mesmerizing patterns or pay tribute to your favorite game characters by reimagining them through weave. \nThese are just a few of the main characters and along your journey you will receive the help of a wide range of peculiar allies.\nWeaving Tides\u2019 evocative musical score, sound effects and overall audio will be handled by our talented composers Timo Jagersberger & Frank Schlick. Time and time again they have put us in awe with their rich and emotional music, but describing it with words won\u2019t do it justice so we will let these tracks speak for themselves: \nWhat is an Add-on?\nYou can customise your Reward Tier by choosing items to add and increasing your initial pledge by the necessary amount.\nHow do add-ons work?\nPress the \"Manage your pledge\" button on the very top of this page.\n  Shipping is already included in the add-on prices.

Prior to this project we made NIVA, a game where you play as a mighty forest god that can grow or wither plants. We also worked on a bunch of smaller projects, but Weaving Tides is our most ambitious project to date.\nThanks to the Kickstarter community creative, niche projects like this can exist. Weaving Tides began as a small idea about exploring a woven world but as development went forward the project grew and so did our passion for it. \nWe want to make Weaving Tides a game that you will love as much as we do and that is why we want to involve you in the process of bringing it to life! We\u2019re going to be especially interested in your ideas and feedback on:\nProgression & Balancing\nNew items\nPuzzle design\nWeaving Tides has been in development for almost two years now. We have come all this way thanks to our close circle of friends, the support we received from the Vienna Business Agency as well as our own funds and efforts, but for this final spurt we need your help. The funds from Kickstarter will enable us to pour even more polish and love into the game and make Weaving Tides what we know it can be.\n  This is how funds will roughly be split up:\nAfter Kickstarter fees, taxes and fulfilling the Kickstarter rewards all funds will go directly towards the development costs of Weaving Tides, localization as well as paying our composers to whip up even more amazing tracks. \nAbout 75% of the game is done. The core of the game is fully finished and all levels except the ending are fully playable. What remains is a lot of gameplay polish, more art assets, scriptwriting for minor characters and bug squashing. We are therefore confident that we will be able to deliver Weaving Tides in late autumn 2020.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been developing Weaving Tides for more than two years. Most of the difficult work is done and throughout our past five years of working together as a tight-knit team we have learned how to tackle even the most daunting tasks. We give our estimates a lot of thought and factor in technical hurdles as well as polishing, therefore we are confident with the timeline we have laid out. \nOf course no one can predict the future and there is always a chance of unexpected problems to occur which will potentionally delay the project. However even if such a case arises we will finish Weaving Tides without compromise. \nMaking Weaving Tides the best it can be is our main priority and we will always keep you in the loop about the current status of the project.

It's Free, featuring over 20 spells, and the entire Day 1 from the final game! Available for Windows and Mac. \nA young girl named Vasilisa, destined to become a witch, decides to throw her fate away and marry her beloved - but that dream is shattered when her betrothed dies under mysterious circumstances. \nAching for her lost love, Vasilisa seeks out Black Book - a demonic artifact, said to be powerful enough to grant any wish to the one who uncovers all 7 of its seals.\nStep into the shoes of a devil-fighting sorceress, and travel the province of Cherdyn to unseal the Black Book - and solve the plights of people in need.\nThe game takes place in a setting unlike any other - a 19th century countryside, where Slavic myth neighbors reality.\nFantastical creatures, elemental spirits and demons exist alongside ordinary folk. Some of them are evil, some are not. Yet, only a select few are able to perceive, let alone communicate with the otherworldly beings. \nVodyanoy - a male water spirit\nBlack Book features a wide variety of mythological creatures: from some that you may recognize, like Chorts and Drowners - to other, more obscure ones.\nWe took extra effort to achieve authenticity in our portrayal of these creatures - using old texts of classical myths, illustrations from folk tale books, and every other source we could find as reference. \nLeft: Vasilisa the Beautiful, 1899 by Ivan Bilibin\nBlack Book is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the world of Northern Slavic mythology, shaped by its history and tradition. The game was developed by the people who grew up with these folk tales, and consulted with historians and anthropologists to make sure the game\u2019s narrative accurately represents the beliefs of their ancestors.\nEvery Chapter's main goal is for Vasilisa to unlock a Seal of the Black Book - and to do so, she will have to challenge the mysteries of the otherworld.\nBattle demons and other mythological beings, help ordinary townsfolk with their troubles, and solve the mystery of the all-powerful Black Book! \nBattle otherworldly forces using a unique card-based combat system. Each turn, Vasilisa has to compose a spell by putting together multiple cards - each with their own special effect. \nSome cards work better together - so be sure to create a perfect combo for maximum damage!\nThroughout the game, you'll always be adding new cards to your arsenal. There are multiple ways to obtain new cards - from buying them at the shop and getting them as rewards for quest completion, to getting them as drops from enemy encounters.\nCollect different cards and build decks that fit specific situations! \nOn her journey, Vasilisa will meet some people (and not just people), who wish to aid her in her cause - each with their unique backstory and ability, that will definitely be helpful in battle. \nTo grow stronger, Vasilisa sometimes relies on the aid of Demons, whom she sends out to do her bidding. Recruit demons, and pick out ones with the right abilities to get the job done properly.      \nIn Black Book, we do our best to emphasize the dark atmosphere of mythological stories with the help of music and sound effects. In the game we combine electronic music and folk musical instruments. We studied authentic recordings of folk songs - some tunes were recorded hundreds of years ago, and will now be reborn in our game.\nMikhail Shvachko is the composer of the game, breathing life into the world of Black Book with his music. Previously, he did the music for our previous game, The Mooseman - which can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/mikhail-shvachko/sets/themoosemanost\nIf you want to get a taste of what to expect when it comes to the unique sound of Black Book, you can find some of his latest work here: \nAside from Mikhail's work, in Black Book you'll hear live choral music, performed by the student choir of the Perm Regional College of Arts and Culture.\nIn Black Book, you'll unlock new songs as you explore additional locations and do side quests. You will be able to listen to them in a special section in the game menu.\nThanks to reaching the first stretch goal we\u2019ll be doing an english voice over for Black Book \u2014 this was made possible through the support of each backer! \nHere\u2019s the list of voice-over actors we confirmed: \n Sarah Anne Williams as Vasilisa (Jinx \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, Chihaya Mifune \u201cPersona 5\u201d)\n Kyle Hebert as Egor (Ryu \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d, Kamina \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d)\n Daman Mills as Nikolai (Frieza \u201cDragon Ball Super\u201d, Kai \u201cBeastars\u201d) \n Ben Diskin as Proshka (Mega Man \u201cMega Man 11\u201d, Aida \u201cBeastars\u201d)\nIf you feel like helping us grow the community around Black Book, we\u2019ll be happy to reveal some content as milestones are reached. Join us on Discord to enjoy content reveals!\nBlack Book supporters, who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers, will see themselves in the game - or help us design unique in-game content!\nThroughout the world of Black Book, multiple gravestones will be scattered. These are not your regular gravestones - these are a token of our eternal gratitude, in remembrance of those who pitched in to make our dream game a reality!\nEveryone's name from Adept pledge (or limited Backer Relief Plus) and forward will be immortalized in the game in those gravestones, so don't miss out on the exclusive chance to find yourself among the beautiful backdrops of Cherdyn!\nOne of the core features of the game that we're really proud of is the unique visual style of the Black Book. That includes every visual aspect: the locations, character and enemy models and animation, and last, but not least - the character portraits!\nIncluded in the Occultist pledge, you'll get the chance to see your own appearance, drawn in Black Book's artstyle, in the game itself! The development team will contact you and ask for a photo, which the artist will use to commission a portrait (which is also available on its own in the Herald pledge) - and then we'll pick out a place to include it in the world of the game!\nThe entire Black Book's combat system revolves around cards. Each card has a unique property - and if combined with others in the right way, can deal massive damage to the unholy creatures that roam the land. With the Hexer pledge, you'll get to design the look, name and in-game properties of a combat card that Vasilisa will use in her demonic encounters. Still, remember - setting and game balance restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over cards included in the final game. \nThroughout her journey, Vasilisa will find herself in many uncommon situations - from solving domestic disputes to confronting demonic creatures, who are known to terrorize human folk. Black Book will be filled with lots of unique in-game events - and with the Sorcerer pledge, we'll include your own scenario in the game as well!\nLater on in the development cycle we will contact you, and ask you to submit a short scenario - which we will then discuss and edit with you, and include it in the main game. But please keep in mind that setting restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over the events included in the game.\nWant to leave a bigger impact on the events transpiring in Black Book? Then the Warlock pledge is the way to go!\nA side-quest consists of several in-game events, usually ranging from two to three - and tell a bigger, more developed story. As with the previous reward, we'll contact you later on, and after edits and approval from the development team, we will include an entire side-quest of your making in the final product! Be warned, setting restrictions still apply, and the development team still has the final say over in-game content of this calibre.    \nAfter finishing our latest project, The Mooseman, we\u2019ve wanted to return to the idea of making a game based on Slavic mythos - but this time, something much bigger in scale.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Black Book for quite some time. During that time, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to writing the story and developing the proper combat system.. The result of our work so far can be seen in the demo - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is ready for release.\nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game: some of them planned, but scrapped due to time and money constraints, and others completely new.\nAside from gathering the funding required for development, crowdfunding would allow us to directly engage with the gamers all across the world - and, with their help and feedback, make The Black Book the best game it could be.\nWe're aware that the current gaming landscape is about to undergo major changes. With that in mind, we want to make sure that Black Book will be available on PC, as well as current and future consoles - so that all of our audience gets to enjoy the game, no matter what their main gaming destination is.\nWe intend on supporting all current generation platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch. \nOne of Black Book's core features is its rich, text-based narrative - and we believe that we owe it to the players to make sure this narrative is to you in full. We are already working with a professional editor, making sure that the English version of the game meets the high standards that our audience has. And currently, we expect the game to be available in the following languages upon release:\nMorteshka - The Developer\nOur projects are mythology and ethnic-based with the narrative and worlds supported by historical facts and folklore. Our first project, The Mooseman, was released in 2017 on Steam, and in 2018 on AppStore, Google Play, and modern consoles.\nThe name of the studio comes from wordplay of \"Mort\", which is French for \"dead\" and Komi for \"a man\", and \"Matryoshka\", the famous Russian doll.\nHypeTrain Digital - The Publisher\nBlack Book is being published by HypeTrain Digital, an indie game publisher for PC and consoles. They provide initial funding for developing the game and porting it to consoles and helping us with the Kickstarter campaign.\nHypeTrain Digital work side by side with independent teams to successfully ship their masterpieces to a worldwide audience. Their titles include: The Wild Eight, Stoneshard, DESOLATE, Police Stories, 12 is Better Than 6.\n-\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooseman was our first project as a team - and during its development, we learned a lot about what it takes to make a game from start to finish. While we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, Black Book is a project of a bigger scale, compared to Mooseman - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line. \n\nHowever, as we've said before \u2014 making Black Book as great as it can be is our priority number one. Throughout development, we will keep you informed about all updates and issues. \n\nWe thank you for your faith and support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["78 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Reader", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["2,173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["574 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Loyalist", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["514 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Adept", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits -

It is the first time I am developing a game, so all of this is a very exciting process for me.\nThe release is planned for 2021 and I am developing the game with UNITY for PC/MAC at the moment, but I think it would be awesome to see Cleo on the Playstation, Xbox and Switch in the future.\nThe main focus of the game will be the story, which is split into 4 chapters:   \nEach chapter will take about 1-2 hours (main-quest) to finish.\n\"What is the most important part of a story?\"\nCleo is a 14-year-old cynical girl, living a repetitive life with her father in a bar. She knows everything about the epic adventures of pirate legend Captain Cabeca, but in her everyday life, she is just surrounded by boring fishermen and unsuccessful pirates, hanging around at the counter. \nBut when Cleo finds a strange pirate-logbook and sees a ghost, who gives her mysterious hints, her boring life is about to get turned upside down. She is thrown into a dangerous adventure and finds herself in a world of lies, deceive, greed and bad breath - the world of pirates - and most of them are after the same thing:\nTHE TREASURE OF ETERNAL MEMORY.\nMy name is Chris. I am a self-employed media designer from Germany. And since I was a kid, I loved movies and games that tell good stories. I especially loved weird adventure game stories, like Sam & Max, Day Of The Tentacle, Monkey Island 1 & 2 ( and I vividly remember getting and playing Monkey Island 3 on Christmas 1997 - when I was 9 years old). I think it's a great thing, that game development has become more and more affordable and accessible, because of free game engines and the possibility to self publish online. Today we have lots of great indie games and developers out there and I think that is awesome! I am really looking forward to the future of indie gaming.\nIt is so much fun working on this project and I just love seeing the world, that I imagined coming to life piece by piece. But of course, all of this is very time-consuming. This is why I decided to make this Kickstarter campaign. I want to see how much interest is out there for this game and it would be awesome to build a financial buffer to be able to work on this project full time for one year. \n After I paid off the golden jacuzzi for my west wing balcony, the money will be used for the following purposes:\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nfinal design may slightly vary\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOf course any project carries some form of risk. The truth is: I am a self-taught game developer, \u201cCleo\u201d is my very first game and I am working on this project alone. There is always a chance of unexpected problems to occur, which will potentially delay the project.\n\nBut, since I am working on \u201cCleo\u201d alone, I am 100% behind this project and will do my very best to make sure, it will be a game I can be proud of, when it is finished.\n\nFor almost 10 years now, I am self-employed as a media designer, so I know how to work self organized. I will keep you in the loop about the developing process of the game in a monthly update. Those updates will be honest and realistic all the time, so you will always be informed about the current status of \u201cCleo\u201d.\n\nThank you very much for placing your trust in me.

We're overwhelmed by our backers' support and decided to sweeten the deal for some of our reward tiers by including some new stuff - no extra charge, completely free (including for everyone who has already bought these tiers)!\nALL TIERS FROM $150 AND ABOVE (STARTING FROM THE SENIOR DETECTIVE TIER) WILL NOW INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:\nThere was an urgency in his voice. He said he was fine, but his nervous tone gave me an inkling that he was in danger...\nAND BECAUSE OF POPULAR DEMAND, OUR SOLD-OUT TIER, TALKING SUPER SLEUTH, IS BACK IN THE FORM OF A NEW TIER: LOQUACIOUS SUPER SLEUTH! THIS TIER, ALONG WITH ALL HIGHER SUCCEEDING TIERS, WILL ALSO INCLUDE A NEW REWARD:\nDubai, Mexico City, Jakarta... the souvenir magnets on her refrigerator hinted at a life well travelled. I wonder where she disappeared to this time...\nWe can't update the descriptions of the old reward tiers, but rest assured it'll be part of the respective tiers. Please check out the FAQ for more info.\nJust some of the news and content outlets that have covered Chinatown Detective Agency.\nThe world is in flux, as the global economy nears the nadir of its decade-long collapse\nSingapore stands as a last refuge of order but even here the government struggles on the brink of chaos. Private detectives are now the first call for those citizens able to afford a semblance of justice.\nAmira Darma, the game's protagonist, is no thug. But she's no pushover either...\nThat\u2019s where you come in. You are Amira Darma, once a rising star at INTERPOL, now a freshly minted Private Investigator in the heart of Chinatown, and your first client is about to walk through your door...\nOld mentors make great first customers.\nFrom the studio behind indie game Terroir, Chinatown Detective Agency is a cybernoir point and click adventure blending stunning retro design with innovative mechanics. Manage your agency and use real world research to solve cases as you unravel a global conspiracy.\nInspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games of the 80s and 90s, Chinatown Detective Agency is a mystery adventure game that will take you across Singapore and the world in hot pursuit of criminals, witnesses and clues. Solve puzzles and uncover leads using real research and investigation, and manage your time and money to solve cases from clients both well-intentioned and nefarious.\nAlong the way, untangle a web of conspiracies and plots that threaten to push the Lion City over the edge.\nUnravel a global conspiracy\nExplore a rich cybernoir future of mystery and intrigue in a world inspired by Blade Runner, The Da Vinci Code and Black Mirror. Travel the globe from your base in Singapore in search of leads, and talk with dozens of uniquely voiced characters each with their own mysterious agendas. \nSometimes, the clues hide in plain sight.\nNot every door is open to Amira. But that's nothing a little hacking can't solve.\nA story with multiple outcomes depending on which client you decide to help\nNothing\u2019s ever simple in Singapore. What starts as a routine recon job might be the spark that ignites this whole city. Your choices matter: do you side with the shadowy underworld informant, or root out corruption for a junior politician? In Chinatown Detective Agency, the cases you choose will tell a story all their own, for better...or for worse.\nAs a private detective, Amira will need to be ready for any situation - including potentially dangerous ones.\nReal-world research\nLeads and clues are the lifeblood of the detective. In Chinatown Detective Agency, each piece of evidence affects the outcome of your cases, and many puzzles require real investigation through internet research, code breaking and more.\nResearch. Decipher. Uncover truths. Rinse and repeat.\nAlthough most of the main quest can be finished entirely in-game, if you want to earn your stripes, you\u2019ll have to dig a little deeper. Solving side quests will require genuine investigation, from googling clues, checking an encyclopedia or scouring a map, meaning you\u2019re not just playing an investigator, you\u2019ll have to become one yourself. \n Work smart (and never skip a meal) \nFor a P.I., time is a precious resource. The daily grind of the working Joe is a one-way ticket to fatigue, and tasks have a funny way of taking longer as you tire. It's up to you to make good use of the time you have and to keep your agency, and yourself, alive.\nIf Amira forgets to take a break, her energy and focus is going to crash. Luckily, there\u2019s the Endurance meter to help you keep tabs. Go too long without food or rest and watch as everything grinds to a halt, quick as a case without leads.\nEndurance plays an important role in how well Amira can perform her duties.\nReplenish yourself by travelling to the city's best hawkers for a delicious local dish, but remember that nothing in this town is free - some items can turn a budding new detective into a down-on-their-luck bum in the space of a meal.\nRestoring Endurance with a hearty local dish is all part of the game.\nAssemble a team\nYou\u2019re new to the P.I. game, but over time you\u2019re bound to make contacts, build a network, maybe even hire some staff. Part of owning your very own private detective agency is having the right kind of support on deck, whether it's an admin assistant to help organise your bills for you and run the office while you're away, or an eager young researcher trying to make a name for themselves.\nYou never know who you'll meet in Chinatown Detective Agency, so keep an eye out for potentially useful characters.\nChasing down leads and gathering up evidence may pay the bills, but Amira\u2019s not just a detective: she\u2019s a businesswoman. You\u2019ll need to keep your staff happy, and the office running smoothly.\nLose yourself in the future\nNeon lamp-light reflected in pools of rainwater. Anti-government graffiti daubed across aging subways. The encroaching murk of riverside London. Explore 30 stunningly rendered tableaus from artist Ricardo Juchem and immerse yourself in the chaotic future of 2032.\nFollowing leads will take you deep into the underbelly of future Singapore.\nThe game will feature over 30 locations across Singapore and around the world. Travelling is a fundamental part of any detective\u2019s toolkit, so you'll be taking Amira to different cities and locations worldwide.\nIn Singapore itself, you'll travel to various places inspired by real world locations.\nSingapore's Chinatown\nThe historic Civic District of Singapore\nThe side streets of Geylang\nEach main location may have a number of sub-locations within, meaning more people and objects for Amira to investigate.\nThe locations in the game will come alive with NPCs, both human and factory-assembled.\nAmira\u2019s no slouch, but even Singapore can be a big place when you're traveling on foot. Getting around efficiently will mean taking the extensive MRT train system that crisscrosses the island.\nTravel across the island through the rapidly deteriorating but still-functioning MRT system of Singapore.\nMissions will also take you to different locales in every continent around the world. Luckily, the game's HORUS flight booking system is there to make grabbing that last minute red-eye as easy as falling out of bed.\nChinatown Detective Agency is a globe-trotting adventure - and you can't globe-trot without booking your flight tickets. Just keep in mind flights cost money, so make sure you double check your leads to avoid wasted flights.\nInspired by the classic Carmen Sandiego games, you'll be traveling the world as you pursue one lead after another.\nThe blinding lights of Dotonbori, Osaka\nDrones fly past Galata Tower in Istanbul at sundown\nThe Petronas Towers shine like a beacon above downtown Kuala Lumpur\nThe encroaching darkness is kept at bay by the faint light of makeshift bonfires in riverside London\nLike the locations in Singapore, these cities will have sub-locations that Amira can visit in pursuit of a breakthrough in her cases. The cities we'll be featuring in the game include: London, Osaka, Istanbul, Kuala Lumpur, Toronto, Shanghai, Rio de Janeiro, Dubai, Mexico City, Ho Chi Minh City, Kigali, Athens, Hong Kong, Perth (Australia), Manila, Cairo, Seattle, Busan, Lima, Paris, New Delhi and Jakarta.\nChinatown Detective Agency is a narrative-driven game - and that narrative is anchored in a diverse cast of colourful characters. \nMany of the game's important characters are voiced acted, mostly by voice artists from Singapore in order to preserve the nuances of Singapore's own brand of colloquial English (Singlish) and local slang. But the main reason we opted to voice the dialogue is to convey the tension and drama of the story. Here's a sample of an exchange between protagonist, Amira, and one of her most important clients, Rupert Zhou:\nThe whine of a lonely synth. The pulse of an electronic bass line. Music plays a crucial role in establishing the atmosphere of Chinatown Detective Agency.\nWe looked to some of the greatest composers in film for inspiration, with a focus on those who have scored suspense, thriller, mystery and detective movies. Perhaps the most influential were Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, especially their work on The Social Network and Gone Girl. Other influences include the soundtrack of cult classic Twin Peaks, as well as those songs from the 80s that evoke (at least to Mark when he was writing the game's backstory) an image of Tokyo or Hong Kong caught in the lingering glow of neon lights - \"In The Air Tonight\" by Phil Collins, \"Live to Tell\" by Madonna, as well as basically anything by Foreigner.\nThe game's soundtrack is being composed and produced by two different musicians: Sean Kolton and Dmitrii Muchkin. Working independently, Sean creates the more contemplative and ambient tracks used during gameplay, while Dmitrii is working on the upbeat and dynamic tracks that you'll hear in the main menu and transition scenes.\nWe've a selection of varied and rewarding tiers for our backers.\nLet\u2019s be honest: we want to make sure a majority of our funding goes straight to the development of the game. To this end we\u2019ve limited our physical rewards to just a couple of items. But because we also want to give our Kickstarter backers the exclusive opportunity to have a hand in the development of the game, we've got something even better,  the ability to add a city of your choice in the game - or you could even be one of the three backers who'll help write a mission in the game!\nI got to the drop-off early. No sense waiting around.\nThere's...something familiar about this place...\nHey...what's that sound?\nI never was one for art, but I liked what I saw.\nTake this...I'll call you when it's safe.\nSingapore is a fine city. Specially for those who keep a mountain of overdue library books at home...\nThe card was blank...or so I thought.\nThe Triad wore black, you wore white.\nThese pages have a clue on them... someone wants to be found.\nJust try not to make a scene.\nCareful... these walls have ears.\nI was going nowhere fast, I needed a change of pace.\nAs soon as I saw it I knew: this case was the real deal.\nYou can help bring the game to life by buying one of our available tiers, each with different rewards. Some of them are limited in number, so if you like what you, go and grab it! \nGeneral Interactive Co. is an indie game dev collective consisting mainly of Creative Director, Mark Fillon and Lead Programmer, Jenny Hide.

Sean composes the more contemplative, analog, Twin Peaks-inspired tracks, while Dmitrii does the more electro-ambient stuff.\nDmitrii Muchkin, Composer\nMarvin Paule is a programmer that focuses on the game's U.I. mechanics, as well as the team's QA specialist (our official bug hunter, if you will).\nRaf Banzuela is General Interactive Co.'s branding and 2D asset artist.

Charlene, formerly of SEGA Europe, has been helping indie devs build their audience and image for over 5 years.\nHow are we using the funds?\nMost of the base game has already been created, and a majority of the funds will go towards producing and developing more content. By content, we mean things like new character locations and environments, new case missions, new characters, more animations, more voice acting -- basically things that make the game richer, more vibrant and have more play-time. Here is a basic breakdown of where the funds will go if we are successful:\nMore than half will be allocated to programming and art (which includes animation), as these are the essential to content creation, while the next largest share goes to music, audio and voice acting, to give the game a more immersive feel. The rest goes towards marketing the game and the fulfillment of backer rewards.\nThese allocations aren't set in stone - if there's one thing we learned from doing this before, it's that situations change as the development of the game progresses and new challenges are uncovered (including taking into consideration player and fan feedback - something we try our best to incorporate into our decision making). ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done our best to make sure our rewards can be created and fulfilled for our backers as easily as possible. We've limited our physical rewards, and instead, have offered rewards that allow backers to be part of the game and its development. We are committed to the quality of the game, and if successful, the campaign will give us runway for the remainder of the year - which should be enough time to complete the game.\n\nHaving said that, this doesn't account for unforeseeable events that can and will affect any project - changing team members, quality assurance and testing, issues arising from Unity and the other platforms we depend on and, most of all, the global uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic. None of these challenges and risks are unique to us. We prepare for them by keeping the game's scope focused, and having a network of professionals and freelancers available to fill in gaps that my come up during development.\n\nAs a single player game with a semi-linear story, we're confident we can deliver on the game. However, should there be delays, this will affect our release date - and you will be informed beforehand.

Will you find all of them?\nThroughout the campaign we will update the demo with more content, stay tuned!\nIn addition, at your request again, we expanded the rewards tier with new options to actively participate in the development of 'Aeterna Noctis' hand in hand with our team ...\nARE YOU GOING TO MISS IT?!\nNeither too much nor too little. The sense of stretching goals.\nWe want to be transparent with you, because we choose a stretching goal philosophy. We dont want the game to be incomplete or have useless characteristics that would inflate the goals. We firmly believe that the goals that we will propose if we manage to reach the first are essential to make 'Aeterna Noctis' a complete game.\nSteady... ready...  We reveal to you one of the songs from the \"Piano Collections\" version of the OST!\nHere is exclusively the main theme of 'Aeterna Noctis' is its most special version ... Piano Collections.\n Help us achieve the goal and make this dream come true!\n\nThis project will not cease to amaze you, so we need your support. We reveal only a tiny detail of the many that we have in store for you... enjoy it!.\nFollowing the footsteps of the genre's great titles, 'Aeterna Noctis' aims to unite the best of each through a reinvented gameplay packed with original skills and mechanics. At the controls of the 'King of Darkness' you must regain your power exploring the vast lands of the dark and beautiful world of 'Aeterna' anchored between life and death. The intense action of fast and skillful combat together with truly challenging mechanics will join an exciting and deep story in this adventure made frame by frame using traditional 2D animation.\nComing to PC and consoles in late 2021\n'Aeterna Noctis' aims to merge the best combat mechanics with tight platform puzzles through extremely polished and designed gameplay capable of satisfying the most demanding player.\n Mechanics and challenging difficulty: The basis of our development has always revolved around this premise. 'Aeterna Noctis' is a game with an affordable but challenging difficulty from the first level, which increases progressively as the player gains experience in the controls and unlocks new skills, always keeping you alert but making you feel proud at each challenge completed .\n Clean and fluid gameplay: The gaming experience is another of our pillars. The gameplay has been designed and polished until achieving a system that responds to 100% of the actions regardless of the speed and conditions in which they are executed, avoiding the loss of actions involved and giving the player a feeling of satisfaction and total control.\n High Mobility: All our levels are designed to fully exploit the movement skills of our character, opening multiple ways to overcome each challenge and allowing the experienced player to improve their zone completion times.We are also Speedruns Fans!.\n Freedom of decision: Explore the mysterious lands of 'Aeterna' in a non-linear way. Although the main story of the game has a defined path, we want you to be the players who set your pace and ways to continue being able to travel this world of multiple different ways.\n Traditional 2D Art: Our art team has designed Frame by Frame through traditional illustration. Each and every one of the animations that you can enjoy in 'Aeterna Noctis', giving life to beautiful and fluid movements with absolute passion and dedication.\n A beautiful and deep story: it is not only about platforms and enemies! We have accompanied all this with an original, deep and emotional story with epic moments and unexpected twists that will captivate even the most experienced players.\nA PERFECT MIX BETWEEN PLATFORMS, ART AND GAMEPLAY\nYou, the 'King of Darkness', have just been defeated and rush into a relentless fall into the kingdom of 'Aeterna', it is not the first time that you visit it as you live trapped in an endless cycle of death and hatred. You must recover your old power, facing dungeons and enemies increasingly powerful and fearsome.\nFundamental pillar where 'Aeterna Noctis' rests, we have a gameplay system and levels designed and built to the millimeter. Tight jumps, traps with perfectly calculated timings, countdown events, almost impossible obstacles, smooth, clean and fluid controls ...\nEverything to offer you, the player, a complete gaming experience and control!\nThe difficulty level is above average in this genre, but it will always be accessible for players of all levels, managing to constantly maintain tension and pose a challenge even for the most experienced.\nThe response times are designed to react instantly adapting to each type of player, giving them a precise control of the character and offering the most skilled the possibility of moving through the areas in multiple ways searching of maximum speed.\nThe 'King of Darkness' has, among other original mechanics, a bow equipped with different types of arrows and other abilities that will be unlocked throughout the game, each of which has a different mechanic that multiplies and unlocks the possibilities to advance.\nFind your own style of play by advancing and modifying the experience panel to your liking and boosting your skills by equipping legendary items, being able always  to adapt your style to what the situation requires.\nDiscover the huge universe of 'Aeterna' made up of 16 well differentiated and connected areas, explore the secrets of this world in a non-linear way, always keeping control of where to go next.\nEach zone has exclusive graphic art, specific enemies, puzzles and mechanics adapted from its biome, spectacular events and cinematics, as well as hiding hundreds of secrets that are waiting to be found ...\nThrough the teleporter system you can move between the zones quickly, each one of them is full of secrets and ready to be revisited at any time with new challenges that are waiting for you.\nTo regain the power of the 'King of Darkness' it will be necessary for you to visit the 'Temple of the Kings', where there are ten dungeons that hold especially tough challenges, protecting inside the fragments of the soul of the 'Queen of Light '.\nTake her power away and make yours grow to unimaginable limits.\nHidden beneath the wasteland is the 'Pit of the Damned', an area with additional content separate from the game's main story and a place where only the most skilled and brave players dare to enter.\nIt contains the highest challenges of the game, contains mechanics of the highest difficulty and is guarded by the clan of the damned, the world's toughest bosses in 'Aeterna' that no one has yet been able to defeat.\nWill you be the chosen one?\nThe world of 'Aeterna' is populated by enemies, from the dumbest to the most bastards, all of them are equipped with different mechanics and characteristics that will make fighting intense and satisfying.\nHere you will see some examples of enemies that our art team has created for you, and soon they will come more and more impressive!\nNo 'Metroidvania' would be complete without epic boss battles, and of course 'Aeterna Noctis' is no exception. The Bosses will be divided into two groups, 'Mini-bosses' and 'Final bosses'. The former will be the keepers of events and secret zones and the latter will mark the area finals. Both will be accompanied by cinematics, from the beginning to the end, and they will have unique mechanics and high levels of difficulty.\nHere are some sketches and concept art that our team has prepared for you.\nThe NPCs could not be missing! Apart from guiding you through the story, some will offer you special missions that you must complete to get great rewards.\nHere we have 'The Chronicler', in charge of writing all the events of history in his gigantic books, through him we will access the mission that will allow us to obtain the secret stained glass window, great rewards and, for some of you, something very important ... 100% complete game.\nAnother great example is 'The Guardian' mysterious and sinister, oversees guarding the 'Temple of the Kings'. \nChaos, supreme god, creator of the universe and of all that it inhabits, decided at one point in his creation to make the world of 'Aeterna'. He populated it with different races and appointed wise rulers to show the path. Before long, these beings turned against their creator, grouping into two large groups and giving rise to war, death and hatred. This angered Chaos who, in his infinite immortality, took it as an insult to his magnificence and cast a terrible curse on the kings of both factions.\nHe named them 'King of Darkness' and 'Queen of Light' and condemned them to fight each other until the end of days. Cursed, even death could not free them from their destiny since, even if they defeated their opponent, Chaos granted them the gift of immortality and they were reborn again to regain their power and continue their eternal war.\nWe are really proud of our art team, not so much for their achievements in traditional frame-by-frame animation or for their spectacular designs, but for the passion they show day by day in their work and their great dedication that allows us to see little by little how the dream of 'Aeterna Noctis' comes true.\nYou may like our project more or less, but we know we have something in common, all of us love Video Games and Art.\nThat is why we choose different resources, great classic games, best anime in history, a more... to set our unique and defined style, with hints of homage those great works.\nFrom the very beginning we clearly knew what we wanted: Everything illustrated and animated in a traditional way, despite having the big drawback ... high costs, because each animation requires dozens of drawings and therefore hundreds of hours of work. Nevertheless, to make this feat a reality, we decided to ask you for help and support. That is why, showing you what we are capable of with our current resources, instead of designing a 'King of Darkness' out of our possibilities, we designed a sketch of his 'Soul Shell' and turned it into the main character within the DEMO.\nIt is in your hands we carry out this project and that \u201cSoul Shell\u201d become the Real King. Can we count on your help?\nWe are fortunate to have three great awarded musicians, who have built and will build the sound art of this project such as:\n'Juan Ignacio Teruel Torres' is a musician, composer and conductor orchestra. In his role as a composer, he has written songs for pop, rock, chamber and piano groups. He has participated in the composition of the music for the 'Vidas Cruzadas' project against bullying for the 'Educacuentos Foundation', winner of the Google.org Impact Challenge on Safety award in 2019.\n'Alfonso Delgado' is a professional classical pianist. He develops his concert activity in a wide variety of styles, from orchestral, chamber or soloist classical music, to modern groups such as rock or celtic-pop. He has composed and performed the music for the 'Vidas cruzadas' project for the 'Educacuentos Foundation' and arranged our Piano Collection Edition\n'Borja Murel' is a music composer, producer, multi-instrumentalist and sound engineer working in the world of film and music production. He has composed the soundtrack and made the sound of more than thirty cinematographic works. He has produced albums for renowned artists and composed the music for commercials.\nWe have been working on 'Aeterna Noctis' since July 2018, so we will soon complete two years of work dedicated to this great game.\nDuring this time, we have not stopped creating, dedicating ourselves, especially to defining the art, history and gameplay of this project, so that it never loses its essence. Thanks to having completed these milestones we are ready to start the production phase, and it is here and now when we need your support!\nWe firmly believe that your Feedback will be what makes this project really strong and that is why we offer our sponsors from 'Dark Lieutenant' reward tier the following benefits:\nExclusive access to the BETA version of the game\nAccess to our private development channels on Discord\nAccess to development surveys that will decide the course of the game\nWe want 'Aeterna Noctis' to be playable in the maximum amount of languages and with the highest quality. Above all, we want to ensure that all players enjoy history and events with the same level of quality.\nThat's why the key date has arrived, we hope to launch with full support the following language packs:\nWe have the means and sufficient experience to launch simultaneously on the following platforms:\nHow do add-ons work?\nPress the 'Manage your pledge button above. If you have not pledge yet, choose your base pledge first.\nIncrease your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\nAfter the end of the Kickstarter Campaign you will recieve a survey that will ask you how would you like the add-on money assigned.\nIf we were to say that all hopes that this game will see the light depend on Kickstarter it would be suicide. Luckily, our company is supported by the financing of other national and international projects that allow us to dedicate resources to this initiative. The big question, does that economic effort make sense? Kickstarter has the answer. If you make this financing in a massive way, money will not be as important as knowing that it is something that people fall in love with. Does this project make you fall in love?\nOf course, Kickstarter is not only a barometer of the future success of this initiative, it is also a huge loudspeaker to listen to your opinions, with criticism being of the greatest interest. We do not seek praise (which also) as much as advice, changes, challenges or any vision that improves this project.\nWe hope from Kickstarter to give this project a boost in time and from you, to make it possible. Do you accept the challenge? We do.\nIt does not matter if it is the first time you know about us or you are one of our many followers, just getting to these lyrics deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter if you support the project or not, just taking a few minutes to read our proposal and see the work we have done with passion, emotion and with all our soul deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter if you are a collaborator who contributed $ 1 or the most ambitious of our packages because any contribution, however small, deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nIt does not matter how much you like or criticize this game or this initiative, because the most important thing is to exist and the fact of being in your head right now in any of its forms deserves a huge THANK YOU.\nBecause we know that you who read these lines are part of this dream. THANKS.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile the planet trembles with the Coronavirus, fear enters our houses and our minds, we can only draw strength and look to the future with courage. This game is a cry of hope, a cry to all people that despite any eventuality you want to end our way of life, we will be here to overcome them.\nWe trust you, we trust all of you who make it possible on Kickstarter for new projects to see the light. We, as a team, as people, as human beings will be in the trenches proposing a new challenge. We are not afraid that the world will change, because we know that together we will win this battle, we are only afraid to stay still while everything is transformed.\nWe want to take your support for this project as a promise to continue fighting, to continue living, and above all to continue shouting that NOTHING can stop us from being unique in the universe.\nOur team is made up of expert players, programmers with years of experience, artists who make dreams come true with their hands, and people who, although they apparently do not contribute anything, have the ability to make everything around them have magic.\nOur challenge is that a virus like COVID-19 will not stop the world, it will not stop us as a company with dreams to make our followers enjoy ... the question is, is it going to stop you?\nOur promise is that no matter what happens today and now ... this game will see the light of day because our illusion, our effort and our work is stronger than any stone (no matter how big) that gets in our way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Six Station Games\n2 created \u00b7 1 backed\nIndependent video game creation studio that

The aim is to create a fluid battle system, with head-to-head combat as its main focus while leaning on monster summons for special actions and attacks.\n Turn your foes into allies: use the Sword of the Necromancer to revive defeated monsters and make them fight alongside you.\n Gather weapons and relics: each weapon is different from the others thanks to the procedural  weapon generation system, which gives them various effects and  attributes.\n Fight with all your might: defeat your enemies using a variety of weapons and objects and dominating the fluid head-to-head battle system.\n Level up: enhance your character by fighting enemies and upgrade your stats. Improve your summoned monsters by fighting alongside them.\n Death is not the end: Each try gets you closer to the Necromancer. You will lose all your equipped weapons and monsters, but you will retain half the level you achieved in your run. Also, you can choose to exit the dungeon at some moments, losing all your level progress but maintaining all your  equipment.\n Learn the truth: Discover Tama and Koko's past as you advance through the dungeon.\n Local co-op play: Use the Flask of Homunculus to create a copy of the playable character and play with a friend in local co-op game.\n  You will be able to obtain items, weapons and monsters by entering codes in the Inventory screen. Use of these codes is limited to a few per day, so don't abuse them!\nYou can use the IR Codes as a help if you are stuck in the game or as a way to play with a certain starting set so you can challenge your friends.\nTo enter the codes you can use the IR Scanner feature for the Nintendo Switch. Using the IR camera available in the Nintendo Switch Right Joycon you can scan the codes easily, or...\nUse the Joycon camera to read codes. Sword of the Necromancer will be one of the few games on Nintendo Switch to make use of it!\n... you can enter them manually! For non-Switch platforms we are working on a companion app for Smartphone that will let you scan the code using your phone camera, but even if you don't want to use a Smartphone (or don't have one) or have a Nintendo Switch Lite, you will always be able to use the IR Codes regardless of where you play the game!\nCan't scan the code using a camera? Just enter it manually!\nYou can obtain IR Codes by purchasing the physical collectable IR Cards (see the Rewards section below) or by digital distribution via our Social Media Sites and Discord for some special events.\nThe digital distribution event codes will be absolutely free. Just download the code, print it or enter it manually and get your item!\nThanks to all the backers, Sword of the Necromancer will be a reality, but we can make the project even bigger!\nWe have reached all of our goals, thanks to all for your support!\n\"Legend says that, deep within these mountains, a heretic decided to violate the will of the gods in order to achieve eternal life.\nThe heretic succeeded in this aberrant attempt, and created a tool for forbidden rituals that could grant immortality\u2026 and even bring back the dead.\nOver the years and centuries many have tried to get that power for themselves, but all they found in the Necromancer\u2019s crypt was their demise.\nThey say that the tool the Necromancer created is also a weapon\u2026\nThe Sword of the Necromancer\u201d\nTama is a former rogue that is tasked to escort the priestess Koko in her pilgrimage around the continent. During their travel Koko dies, and Tama carries the corpse to the Necromancer's crypt, where legends say there dwells a power that may resurrect the dead.\nFilled with despair, Tama will enter the dungeon with the aim of obtaining the forbidden power of necromancy, ignoring the dangers that lurk in the shadows.\nFruit of the Necromancer's experiments with dark magic, the dungeon is filled with monsters of many types.\nEach monster has its own behaviour and perform different attacks. Some will charge at you on sight, others will keep their distance, some can come in aid of other monsters...\nMeet some of them\nChampimbomb expel stunning spores from time to time, which also produce a little mushroom-bomb that detonates if too close to them\nDollahans are invulnerable when they cover themselves with their giant shield. When they do so, they are also charging a devastating attack, so be careful!\nElusive and very rare to find, Restorebbit will run to its allies to cure them... even at the expense of its own health\nEvery monster that leaves a corpse behind when dead can be resurrected to be made to fight alongside Tama as a summon, but in addition to that, she can use a variety of weapons when fighting by herself.\nTama can also equip objects and relics that boost her stats and attributes. All of these items (monsters, weapons, relics and objects) will take one of the four slots available, each one assigned to a button.\nWith only the press of the assigned button (except for relics, that act passively) you will use the item, which allows for combos.\nYou can even use different weapons mid-combo to get the most of every tool\nIn addition to that, each of the close quarters weapons has a different charge attack: from powerful slashes to throwing your weapon!\nAside from the Sword of the Necromancer you have Gladius, Sabres and Claymores. Each one has a different reach and charged attack, but all swords can perform a 3-hit combo\nSpears are useful to keep the distance from your enemies. Halberds have the longest reach, Lances inflict a powerful stab and Pikes can be thrown (don't forget to pick them up!)\nAxes can deal a lot of damage, and the charged attacks from the Labrys and the Bardiche even have an area of effect, but they leave you open to enemy attacks!\nThese are your long range options. Magic comes in different forms depending on the type of magic tome you use, and casting it drains a little of your Soul meter. Bows don't use Soul but take a little longer to charge!\nBoth weapons and monsters can have elemental and status effects, and relics can grant resistances or weaknesses to them.\nAfter a certain point in the game, you will obtain an item called Flask of the Homunculus. By equipping it, Tama can create a copy of herself if there is a second controller available. This copy can be controlled by a second player, and is able to do all what Tama can except revive or summon monsters\nThe second player has its own 4 slots to equip weapons, items and relics (but not monsters!)\nPlayers can even trade items between them! Just approach the other player and open the trade menu.\nShare items so each player can make the most of their build!\nSword of the Necromancer will use traditional pixel art and frame by frame animation, which has been quite a challenge as we wanted to keep its 8-directional movement. \nThe game has 8-directional movement, and all animations have all 8 directions, which gives it a very good feeling when playing\nFor the flashback and \"cutscene\" segments we have opted for a more \"visual novel-esque\" approach, with hand-drawn CG illustrations (made by CasualMisfit) to better convey the emotions and expressions of the characters.\nFlashbacks will use illustrations like those of VNs\nThe game's music is being composed by In\u00e9s Mir\u00e1s, who has worked previously on several short films and documentaries, as well as in Youtube channels like UHC Espa\u00f1a. Also, she's part of the Galician band \"A Banda da Loba\", as the guitarist.\nShe is working on giving the soundtrack a mysterious and epic feeling, with roots on celtic music.\nSword of the Necromancer is being developed by Grimorio of Games, and produced and published by JanduSoft S.L, both based in Barcelona.\nFunded in 2012 and starting as a mobile game developer, now JanduSoft is focused on console development and has published and ported over 15 games for PC and consoles in the last 3 years. JanduSoft has experience with successful Kickstarter campaigns: Caveman Warriors, released in 2017 on all platforms, and Indiecalypse, to be released this very quarter.\nGrimorio of Games' previous game, Super Hyperactive Ninja, was also published by JanduSoft and sold over 15.000 copies, which supposed a massive hit for a (back then) two-people team.\nOfficial Artbook \nFull color artbook with the concepts and illustrations from our artists, pixel art sprites, developers comments and all the full game's script. Beware of spoilers!\n\nAltar of the Sword figurine\nHand-painted replica of the altar of the Sword of the Necromacer, as it appears in the game. Also doubles as a stand for the Nintendo Switch right Joycon to use it for the IR Camera Scanner feature and read IR Codes.\nThe altar figurine is being designed, modeled, printed and hand-painted by The3DHut.\nTama and Koko plushies\nHand-made plushes made by Boira Plushies with high quality materials and details. Check their Twitter to see examples of their work!\n\nOfficial Soundtrack \nSoundtrack of the game by In\u00e9s Mir\u00e1s in CD format.\n\nIR Cards\nCards to be used with the IR Code Scanner feature. You can get special items or monsters by scanning them to help you in your adventure. The IR Code Scanner feature uses the Nintendo Switch's right Joycon camera. For other platforms, we are working on a smartphone app.\nCheck the FAQs for more info about the IR Card packs\nAs we have reached several stretch goals, every backer with a physical reward will receive free IR Card packs. For the 30000\u20ac stretch goal we added a free IR Card pack with every shipping to choose, and for the 65000\u20ac one, we added a Kickstarter exclusive pack: \"Mixed Pack 2\".\nEvery backer with a physical reward will also receive this Kickstarter exclusive IR Card from the Sword of the Necromancer x 9 Years of Shadows collaboration!\nInstruction Manual\nLike in the old days, a full color instruction manual with explanations about the game, tips and strategies to help you progress through the dungeon. And with a \"Notes\" section at the end!\n\nPhysical Edition\nPhysical copy of the game for Nintendo Switch or PS4. Boxart is subject to change\n\nLost Diary\nBe a part of Sword of the Necromancer's lore! Write a journal entry and name one of the explorers, scavengers or looters that entered into the Necromancer's Crypt before Tama. Players will come across these journals during their gameplay.\n...\nDepending on your pledge tier, you will get different rewards:\nFor example, if you pledge for the Collector's Edition, you get all this plus digital goodies!\nYou can add an amount to your pledge to get more items in addition to the rewards of your tier. For example, you can add 13\u20ac to get an extra digital key or 10\u20ac to get the soundtrack separately so you can share or gift it to a friend.\n1. Select the \"Manage your Pledge\" option. If you have not made your pledge yet, first choose your base pledge.\n2. Increase your pledge amount by the total of add-ons you want to add.\n3. When the campaign ends, you will receive a survey asking for the items you want to assign to the money you added to your pledge.\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer - 13\u20ac (aprox 14 USD)\nPhysical Artbook - 10\u20ac (aprox 11 USD)\nPhysical Soundtrack CD - 10\u20ac (aprox 11 USD)\nPack of IR Cards - 5\u20ac (aprox 5.5 USD)\nPhysical Copy (for PS4 or Switch) - 35\u20ac (aprox 38 USD)\nFigurine - 50\u20ac (aprox 55 USD)\nTama plush - 60\u20ac (aprox 65 USD)\nKoko plush - 60\u20ac (aprox 65 USD)\n  We have been working on Sword of the Necromancer for a little more than year and a half, and while the main mechanics and features of the game are already implemented, we need a little help and feedback from the Kickstarter community. With your help, we can make Sword of the Necromancer the best it can be.\nWe will be extremely thankful for any help you can give us, even just sharing content about our game to your friends or your followers on social media can really make the difference.\nYou can also make a small donation to our project to help us even more and help us make our dream come true to finish and publish this game to as many platforms as possible so you can all enjoy it when it comes out.\nWe will launch Sword of the Necromancer in all current platforms digitally, but we also would like to have a physical release (for Switch and PS4), and our resources are limited.\nHere\u2018s how we intend to spend your donations:\nMost of the budget (69%) will be destined to fund several aspects of the game's development (mainly art and music) and produce the physical rewards.\nThe other 31% will be divided in paying taxes, Kickstarter and other fees.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis would be JanduSoft's fourth Kickstarter, and the previous ones have been successfully delivered. We have always fulfilled our commitments, so you can be 100% certain that we won\u2019t let you down.\n\nSword of the Necromancer's main features are implemented and the game is already perfectly playable in consoles. We need to add more content: monsters, bosses, extra modes, etc. and that is why we need your help.\n\nAs in every project, setbacks may occur, which would lead to delays. We will work hard to prevent that, and if the case there are delays, we will try to minimize them as much as possible.\n\nAnother point of possible delays would be the production of physical goods, like the physical versions, figurines or plushies, depending on the number of items to produce.\n\nThis is a game we are having a great time working on and the team is motivated, so you can count on our best efforts to deliver the best experience we can make.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac14 or more", "title": "Digital Game", "descp": "You get a digital copy of Sword of the Necromancer for your platform of choice (Steam/PS4/Xbox One/Nintendo Switch)\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer\nYour name will appear in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["2,431 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac18 or more", "title": "Digital Game + Soundtrack", "descp": "In addition to the game, you will get a copy of the game's Digital Soundtrack, made by our composer Sinesita, and featuring all the songs from the game\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy of Sword of the Necromancer\nDigital Soundtrack\nYour name will appear in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2020"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Digital Deluxe Edition", "descp": "You will receive a Digital Artbook and Instruction Manual in addition to the previous rewards.

After 9 years of living in the shadows, a brave warrior will rise: Europa. A battle hardened maiden who carries the fate of the world on her shoulders. \nEquipped with little else than her parent\u2019s mementos, her task is daunting - venture inside the missing orphan\u2019s memories to vanquish the curse that has been tormenting the people, and restore peace to the lands.\n\n\n\nA giant mechanical castle was left by an ancient king to protect the country's orphan youth. From time to time, its halls are known to move almost as if they have a life of their own. Now only a shadow of its former glory, the orphanage Talos lies corrupted with darkness..\n\nLose yourself in a dark 2D side-scrolling adventure with an emphasis on emotional storytelling, exploration and combat.\n  Slash your way through the immense mechanical Castle known as Talos and visit exotic places through the memories of its missing orphans.\n  Lift the laments that darken the map by defeating hidden bosses.\n   Transform into different elemental armors that will allow you to experience the game\u2019s design in surprising ways.\nGain power-ups to access varied locations and expand your combat skills to survive.\n  Find collectible secret treasures scattered throughout the castle.\n  Modify the difficulty curve by choosing what challenge you will tackle first.\n  Discover a wide array of references to classic games like Castlevania, Mega Man Zero, Super Metroid and Demon\u2019s Crests.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are pleased to announce that the soundtrack will feature the participation of legendary composers Michiru Yamane and Manami Matsumae, of Castlevania and Mega Man fame respectively.\nBut that\u2019s not all, by request of Ms.Yamane herself, healing music will play a very important role in our game.\nAs big fans of video game music, we have decided to implement a mechanic dedicated to showcasing the nurturing and soothing power of music in the game. By finding music notes scattered around the castle you will be able to visit the Degollado Theater and give those notes to two mystical composers that are said to wander there. In exchange you will get to see the characters perform exclusive melodies tuned to 432Hz designed to soothe your soul (and expand your health and magic meters).\nAnd as an update, we are also pleased to announce that Norihiko Hibino, Metal Gear Solid legend, is joining the A-list of composers in the soundtrack.\nHere are some words from Mr. Hibino himself:\n\"It's great that I can collaborate with  Yamane-san! We're good friends and I know she's quite into healing  music. I'm so glad to find out she can incorporate healing into games.

Prohibition, the Constitutional ban on the sale of alcohol in the United States, comes into effect.... And business couldn't be better at the Little Daisy Cafe.\nBut things aren't what they seem. Atlas May, proprietor, uses the charming little restaurant as a front for his real cash cow; the Lackadaisy speakeasy, where flashing the club symbol from a deck of cards grants everykitty in-the-know access to more moonshine than they could ever drink. Life is good... Until Atlas is murdered in cold blood.\nNow, it's 1927. Mitzi, Atlas' widow, struggles to keep Lackadaisy afloat, as the patrons drift away and a skeleton crew of staff sticks by her side. Scrappy young musician/rum-runner Rocky Rickaby, his wide-eyed but tightly-wound cousin Freckle McMurray, and the endlessly resourceful and sharp-tongued Ivy Pepper, heiress to the quickly-dwindling Lackadaisy fortune, are forced to make do in a world of increasingly unfriendly competition, intent on shooting, smuggling, and conspiring their way back to a successful bar, against all odds. \nLackadaisy Cats has been running online since 2006, immersing its readership in a world of sepia-toned crime, adventure, action, and comedy. And now, it's ready for its next big move... to a screen near you.\nWhy a cartoon? Why now?\nThere's never been more interest in adult animation, with shows like Bojack Horseman, Big Mouth, and Primal capturing the attention and imaginations of millions of viewers. \nLackadaisy is an exceptional webcomic, but in her mind, Tracy has always pictured it as an animated film. It\u2019s a side effect, perhaps, of a childhood nourished on Looney Tunes, Disney, and Don Bluth features; a dream of sharing that living, breathing, musical version of Lackadaisy with its dedicated readership. But the when-and-how something like that could ever be achieved has always lacked an obvious ingress.\nAs the 20s dawn upon us again, with new animation tools and techniques available, with talented and excited artists on deck an raring to get to work, and with the internet eager for more independently-created media, the auspiciousness seems writ-large - splashed across an art deco picture palace marquee, if you will. \nNow\u2019s the time.\nThe Lackadaisy animated short proposes a 10-minute, fun-and-action-filled adventure, full of car chases, shootout, sass, and  un-requested violin solos. And with your help, we can make it happen!\nThe finished short will be available for everyone to watch!\nMeet the people in charge of (and contributing to) the project! \nA former game dev, illustrator and graphic designer, Tracy Butler began Lackadaisy after researching the history of her century-old Saint Louis home, and being inspired by her love of jazz music and 1920s aesthetics. Boasting over 1,600 backers on Patreon, Lackadaisy has been her full-time job for years, garnering a dedicated readership of thousands. As the creator of the comic, Tracy will play a role as co-director on the animated short, as well as overseeing art direction.\nFable Siegel is a veteran animation professional, boasting a resume that includes Titmouse, Starburns, the internet phenomenon Hazbin Hotel, and two Game Grumps Animated shorts, along with storyboard work for Cartoon Network (Ben 10), Stoopid Monkey (Adam Ruins Everything: Reanimated History), Warner Brothers (Wacky Races), Shadow Machine (F is for Family), and more, as well as being a board artist, animator, and designer for Six Point Harness (Like Share Die).  Brought onto the Lackadaisy animated short as a production manager, director, and producer, they'll be overseeing the project utilizing their years of professional experience and skill.\n Our awesome line-up of talent, in no particular order:\n Michael Kovach  (@kovox) as Rocky Rickaby! \n Belsheber Rusape (@BelRusapeVO) as Calvin \"Freckle\" McMurray! \n Lisa Reimold (@lisareimold)  as Ivy Pepper! \n Ashe Wagner (@TheQueenViking)  as Mitzi May! \nand SungWon Cho (@ProZD) as Mordecai Heller! \nCharacter Design\nTai (@corvidmonster)\n3D Modeling\nZachary \"Newt\" Nall (https://www.noneuclideandesigns.com/)\nStoryboard Artist\nAshley \"Kilomonster\" Green (@AshGMonstrology)\nSound Direction\nM.

Look no further!\nLackadaisy Essentials is the primary means by which we intend to fund the animated short, and Iron Circus Comics' part in this incredibly ambitious project! Planned as a hardcover volume of about 100 pages, Lackadaisy Essentials contains never-before-published minicomics, one-offs, sketches, and other creative work by Tracy, delving into the world and details of the Lackadaisy webcomic.\n Lackadaisy Volumes 1 & 2 ebooks are the collected Lackadaisy webcomic! Grab the tiers including this reward to read the comic offline at your leisure, at a beautiful, high resolution!\nWant to see the finished product in its snazziest, most high-quality form? Back a tier that grants access to an HD download of the finished animated short! The Lackadaisy short will be a fully-polished final product, professionally animated, voice-acted, and scored by musical and animation professionals!\n There's so much that goes into making a cartoon. Storyboards, animatics, a soundtrack, 3D models! Back at the Goodie Bag level and higher to grab all these cool bits 'n' pieces. The perfect backer level for folks who wanna see how the sausage is made. Higher levels even grant special thanks in the credits!\n ALL IN! Really wanna become an indispensable part of the project? Maybe even make animation history? The very highest tiers of support grant in-story cameos, personalized Lackadaisy-sona designs, original art from Tracy and the crew, and MORE. \n There's something available at practically every level of support!\n $85,000 is the minimum we would need to make sure this one-of-a-kind project comes to fruition. But in case we overfund, we already have some awesome plans to make this Kickstarter even better.\n\nAnd our final two stretch goals...\n\nWhatever you may decide, thanks for getting this far down the page, and reading all about this new venture! We hope to see you on the other side in 2021, with the very first Iron Circus Animation! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is Iron Circus Comics' TWENTY-FOURTH Kickstarter project.

Two to five players take the roles of various diverse Princesses, working together, for the most part, to deal with issues and concerns in Princess World, while one player takes the role of Weaver, who works with the other players to gather their ideas and choices into a shared narrative, with everyone playing to find out what will happen next.\nThe game provides the players with the rules and framework to create their own worlds, realms and adventures and is designed to act as an introduction to the exciting world of role-playing games, particularly for younger players.  Extensive play testing with both kids and adults has gone into the creation of Princess World.  While it is a game made for kids, it's not a game just for kids; as well, interviews with younger players produced some surprising information about what they're looking for when it comes to gaming experiences!\nPrincess World takes many of its cues from television shows such as My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and She-Ra and the Princesses of Power and books like The Princess in Black and Princeless.\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to generate the funds necessary to pay for art, graphic design, layout, written contributions, and physical production of the book.  We at Princess World believe in paying fairly for all work done and abide by the guidelines set out in the  Unified (QT)PoC Standard Requirements.\nPrincess World also fully endorses the efforts of Kickstarter United.\nThe Space, Shadow, Fairy, and Warrior Princesses dealing with a situation.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSince we have now surpassed our funding goal we are pleased to announce stretch goals to increase the beauty and content of Princess World.\nStretch Goal #1 - More Art - **UNLOCKED** - $15,000\nClarissa and Lauren, our illustrious illustrators, will endeavor to show  even more diverse princesses in many challenging and intriguing  situations.  Since the Princess World rulebook  will also double as a, potential, coloring book, we want something that  can be colored in on every page.  This will help us achieve that goal. \nStretch Goal #2 - The Dark Princesses - **UNLOCKED** - $17,500, Dead Princess Sharang Biswas, Dragon Princess Zaire Lanier, Evil Princess Chase Forrester\nThree more Princesses will be made available, along with real-life stories by members of the gaming community.  Now, these three Princesses may have different views and approaches to Princess World, but they are still members of the Council.\n The Dead Princess \u2013 some might find them haunting, spooky, or ethereal. Sometimes a princess may suffer an unfortunate setback, one that brings their story to an end. This princess was strong enough to overcome that, but she came back different.\n The Dragon Princess \u2013 they are often seen as awesome, fearsome, and mighty. While not always actual monsters, they have monstrous power and focus; if something catches their eye, it may soon belong to them. Still, they are better as an ally than an adversary. Usually.\n The Evil Princess \u2013 they may be found to be devious, malevolent, and sinister, but they are still welcome at the Council, because, out there, there are some things that are worse.\nStretch Goal #3 - Evn More Art - LOCKED - $20,000\nClarissa and Lauren will be joined by other illustrators to show varied visions on what it means to be a Princess in Princess World.\nStretch Goal #4 - The Gemini Princesses - LOCKED - $22,500 - Rebel Princess Sarah Kennedy, Power Princess Shayna Cook, Boy Princess Ennis Bashe\n With this goal, another three Princesses will be added to the Council, along with three more real life stories.  These three all express a literal or metaphorical duality when it comes to being a Princess.\n The Rebel Princess \u2013 they can be seen as defiant, outspoken, and revolutionary. They may be part of the system and can work within it, but they know, whether with words or deeds, sometimes, it\u2019s better just to burn it all down.\n The Power Princess \u2013 they show themselves to be heroic, transforming, and surprising. While they must split their time between two worlds, they are more than the sum of their disparate halves. \n The Boy Princess \u2013 they can be found to be gentle, subversive, and tough. Anyone can be a princess; for some it\u2019s a choice, for others it is what they\u2019ve always been.\nStretch Goal #5 - Tying Up Loose Ends - LOCKED - $25,000, Patchwork Princess Kira Magrann\nReaching this goal will unlock the 16th Princess, and their story, and will also provide a bonus for all the story and art contributors to the project.\n The Patchwork Princess \u2013 they are often considered scrappy, one-of-a-kind, and unseemly. Sometimes the mantle of Princess fits and sometimes it has to be made to fit, and, sometimes, something rips and has to be stitched back into place.\nTHE PRINCESS COUNCIL\nThe members of the Princess Council come from many different realms and may not all fit the usual ideas of what a princess is, but they all have a place at the table.  Each princess is represented by a unique playbook, listing their strengths and weaknesses, abilities, special knowledge and the Truths that give them power.\nThe nine core Princesses are:\n The Proper Princess \u2013 they are often dignified, noble, and elegant. Strong-willed, good with rules and social situations, though they may have a surprising trick or two hidden up their sleeve.\n The Pirate Princess \u2013 they might be adventurous, sharp, and dangerous. Following their own code, they can be a great friend or a dire enemy, depending on which way the wind blows!\n The Fairy Princess \u2013 they usually appear free-spirited, enchanting, and unpredictable. Magic and wonder are part of them and sometimes they share it and sometimes they don\u2019t.  Be careful what your wish for!\n The Space Princess \u2013 they generally show themselves to be capable, knowledgeable, and innovative. Discovering answers, uncovering secrets, and making something new with what they find are where they shine.\n The Skateboard Princess \u2013 they tend to be audacious, ready, and independent. Taking risks, breaking rules, and showing off can sometimes cause trouble, but they are always willing to face danger head on.\n The Knight Princess \u2013 they are considered stalwart, persistent, and honorable. Often accompanied by a trusted steed, they are a boon companion who is as at home on the battlefield as they are in the ballroom or even when it\u2019s both at the same time.\n The Warrior Princess \u2013 they present themselves as brave, tough, and steadfast. Occasionally, words are not enough to sway someone from a bad course of action. Sometimes a sword is needed to change someone\u2019s mind, even if it isn\u2019t drawn; that\u2019s why they\u2019ve got two. Just in case.\n The Shadow Princess \u2013 they are observant, resourceful, and mysterious. Moving like smoke and hard to catch, they might appear as anyone. Or no one. A whispered word might have more influence than a battle cry, when they utter it.\n The Pauper Princess \u2013 they must be versatile, tenacious, and resilient. Not everyone has a realm to belong to; they may have lost almost everything, but they still have themselves and their friends. That is more than enough to be a princess.\nAnyone can be a princess\nHOW TO BE A PRINCESS\nThe game play of Princess World is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse (PbtA) engine, using its core systems, supplemented by unique narrative rules.\nThe Princess you create does not have to be a girl, or a human, or anything you might normally think a Princess might be; it is up to the player creating the character to decide which details are important and which are ephemera and they can stretch their creativity as far as they like.  There have been robot Princesses, business-suit-wearing Princesses, insect Princesses, a Princess that was a composite being made of five individual consciousnesses, boy Princesses, a Princess who was completely virtual, and even one Princess who was a Space Cat!\nTo create your Princess, the first thing you do is pick a favorite color.  Everything you write down in the game that is a Truth, will be written in that color.  A Truth is a narrative statement that can be used by a Princess to give them powers and abilities as they play their story, powers and abilities that others might not share. Sometimes, a Truth might be Unpleasant, and this is written in the color of The Fade, usually black; this is a Truth that, while still powerful, might also cause problems for the Princess it belongs to.  And how do we determine if a Truth is Unpleasant?  Well, we ask the rest of the people we are playing with to tell us!\nZoe, playing Pirate Princess Swann, expresses the following Truth about her weapon:\n\"I have a sword that can cut through anything!\"\nEveryone at the table thinks this is cool, except for one player, who says, \"That sounds dangerous.\"  The Truth is immediately considered to be Unpleasant, but Zoe has two options: 1) Accept that her cool sword is dangerous as well, and write it down in the color of The Fade or, 2) re-express it to account for the possible danger.  She chooses option 2) and says:\n\"I have a sword that can cut through anything except its scabbard!\"\nAnd everyone agrees that this is much safer and she writes it down in her color.\nEach Princess has four essential Truths that are unique to their playbook and all four can be drawn on as the characters' stories unfold.  Expressing them to the table and then writing them down is the main part of character creation in Princess World.  Each Princess also has a list of special moves to choose from and each possess a special Knowledge rule, that allows them to take advantage of their unique perspectives.\nBUILDING PRINCESS WORLD\nPrincess World has no default or pre-made setting; building the world and the challenges the Princess face is part of playing the game.  All the players, both those playing Princesses and those playing the Weaver, work together to craft a world of adventure and excitement, with the Princesses themselves deciding which events are important enough to warrant their attention.  There are three tiers of play in which to make this happen:\n Short Story Mode: This mode is best for teaching the game and for one-shot play.  At this tier of play, each player presents a possible problem for the Princess  Council to face and the group of players decide which to tackle, with the Weaver working to incorporate the other players' ideas with their own, perhaps with surprising tangles and complications!\n Chapter Mode: This mode tells the story of the Princesses in linked episodes of play.  In the first session, the players collaborate to craft a shared world, expressing Truths about it as they did for their characters.  Each player briefly recounts a significant event of that happened \"In last chapter...\" to set the start of the story, even if this is the very first session of play! \n Whole Story Mode: To get the whole story, the players craft the Truths of their Princess World and the Truths of the individual Realms their characters come from.  The provides a vast, collaborative world of adventure for the players to explore which should last many sessions of game play.\nIt is easy to switch between modes for every session of play, to tell quick tales of brave Princesses or to launch long spanning epics of daring deeds and grim peril, all depending on the shared desires of the players.\nThe Space Princess scans for anomolies.\nWEAVING THE STORY\nThe Weaver holds an interesting position in Princess World, they are not in the story, but they are a very big part of making it happen.  It is a role that is similar to that of game master in other role-playing games, but every Weaver must accept the following piece of truth, which some might find unpleasant:\nThis is not your story.\nFrom the text: \"Weaver, you are not here to weave a tale by yourself; creating everything, making every decision, leading the other players through a world you have made on your own. Oh, you will be creating things, making decisions, and weaving a tale, but you\u2019ll be doing it with the help of everyone in the game, because it is their story. They are playing the protagonists, the main characters, the individuals the story is about! You, well, you\u2019ll be playing everything else, but they will all be secondary characters and events there to support the story.\" \nIf you find this daunting, take heart in knowing that being the Weaver is not a permanent position. The game is designed to allow changing and rotating Weaver duties; no one player is forced to remain as the Weaver if they wish to play a Princess instead and each Princess player can feel free to take on the mantle of Weaver if they desire, though, in general, there can only be one Weaver at a time. The only hard restriction is that you can not play the role of Weaver and the role of a Princess at the same time.  If you have a princess in the game and, for the next session, decide you wish to be the Weaver, the game is designed to keep your princess, and their Realm, safe from any happenings in the game they don't appear in.  This same protection is afforded to the princesses of players who might have to miss out on a session from time to time.\nSo, everyone can be a Princess and everyone can be a Weaver.\nWHAT IS THE FADE?\nWe don't know.  There are things wrong or troubling in Princess World; maybe things are fading away, maybe they're fading to black, maybe things are getting worse, maybe there's someone or something behind it all.  We'll all be playing the story to find out and the Princess Council will be there to resist it.\nREAL LIFE PRINCESS STORIES\nPrincess World has been developed to act as in introduction to role-playing and story games.  Included in the book are real life stories of how many players and game designers got into gaming and how it influenced their lives.  Each Princess in the game will have a story to share from an experienced member of the gaming community; this will be a story about them, showing the benefits of role-playing games, a tale from their real lives, not a made up story.\nEach fifty (50) followers who join @PrincessWorldRP on Twitter will help fight the Fade and reveal another contributor.\nRevealed: Fairy Princess Alice Kyra, Pirate Princess Zoe Bloom, Warrior Princess Meghan Dornbrok, Knight Princess Kienna Shaw, Space Princess Amr Ammourazz, Shadow Princess Amber Viescas, Skateboard Princess Lucian Kahn, Pauper Princess Amber Autumn Faebrooke, Proper Princess Alex Roberts\nTHE BOOK\nOne of the core concepts of Princess World is that the players, through their characters, will be making their own marks upon the world.  To align with this concept all interior art will be black-and-white line drawings on, at least, #70 paper for all your coloring needs.  The physical book with be a softcover 8.5\"x11\" in dimension.\nReaching certain stretch goals has the potential to unlock a hardcover edition.\nACTUAL PLAY AND INTERVIEWS\nIf you're curious to understand how the game plays, please check out these actual plays and interviews!\nWeaver Kevin runs some of the Fandible crew through a thunderous adventure.\nWeaver Alice shows the She's a Super Geek players the ropes.

But neither were they disappointed when we finally had to put an end to the fun before the game itself was over\u2014it clearly wasn\u2019t about winning, it was just about having a blast playing. Peter Thompson, parent of Princess Eleanor (Brave Young Princess Society)\nKevin is an insightful game designer. The way he sees to the secret  heart of his own games and builds everything to support that is incredible. I got to play a Princess World game run by Kevin and it was a  blessing. I still want to know what happened to my Space Princess who  was thrown out into space!  Come on Kevin WHERE IS SHE. WHERE DID THAT SPACETOPUS THROW HER. LET ME SKATE OFF THE MOON.         James Malloy, Stop Hack and Roll\nThe Truths seem to be a way to work in aspects (Fate) without trying to slam PbtA and Fate together. Rach Shelkey, +1Forward\nVery accessible to new/young players! Worked very well with a mixed group [of adults and kids]. Truths and Maybes are very cool, especially the Unpleasant aspect.  Colors for each and how these impact the world/Truths/Realms is awesome, not anything I've seen before!  Seann Ives, Playtester\nPrincess World is so great you folks! It's the elegant kid-friendly RPG  my heart needed! It's PbtA in a good way, it has Bondfliction-like Truths, it's not afraid of doubling down on princesses! It really feels like a game that works for the very enthusiastic kid I was. Xavid, Playtester\nI liked the versatility of the game with personalities and setting.  I also loved the idea of being able to shift who the GM [Weaver] is every time - encourages everyone to try GMing.

Backers of $15 or more will be able to choose between a Steam key or a Nintendo eShop code!\nHow all great adventures start...\nGastova is a light-hearted 2D adventure game. As the Witch Guardian of Arkana, embark on a journey to track down and defeat the fellow witches that were once Gastova\u2019s classmates and/or closest friends.\nInspired by classics such as Mega Man and Wonder Boy, we are committed to deliver a satisfying single-player experience for all the fans of the retro platforming genre.\nThis is a passion project of ours and we really need your help to make this a reality. We promise that the end result will absolutely blow your mind! Thank you so much for reading all this!\n\nGastova embraces the most fundamental principle of the platforming genre. You jump, dodge, and shoot. The core gameplay revolves around adventuring through 8 distinct landscapes and overcoming the obstacles presented within them. Every area will be divided into two parts, with a challenging boss waiting for you at the end of each area.\nAlong the way, Gastova may find special currency that she\u2019ll be able to use to enhance her abilities. Other power ups may also be hidden throughout the world for the players to discover.\nAs the current Witch Guardian of Arkana, Gastova is able to utilize the power of all the other witches who finds her worthy. Defeat the other witches to receive their blessing and awaken Gastova\u2019s power to channel her friend\u2019s magic!\n\nThe attack of the Waffos\nThe enemies of Gastova consist primarily of Waffos, mysterious creatures with indiscernible origins. They seem to be well trained and follow a strict military doctrine. Whoever their leader is, they have the Waffos trained into a formidable fighting force. \nThe wildlife of Arkana\nOf course, it wouldn't be an adventure game without a host of other creatures that suit the habitat. Monkeys in forests, spooky spiders, giant fishes in the ocean, we got them all!\n\n\nThe landscapes of Arkana\nThe game features an expansive world for the player to progress and explore. From the scorching desert to the frigid snow lands, the deep caverns to the sky fortress, the size of the game will surely provide a satisfying adventure to those who seeks to explore the world.\nThere are 8 distinct worlds within the game that are all inter-connected. Most of the worlds follow the same principle and setup, with two large, explorable areas and two bosses. \n\nBoss fight against Kirincorn\nThe boss fights in Gastova are designed to present sufficient challenges without being overly frustrating or punishing. There will be a save point right before every boss fight to ensure that any failed attempts at the fight will not result in much wasted time. All of the mini bosses of an area will follow a hard coded set of actions whereas the witches will employ a more dynamic strategy based on various conditions of how the battle is progressing.\n\nBoss fight against Nephelle\nDue to the rather linear nature of our story progression, the witches will be fought in a set order. As Gastova\u2019s abilities and power will scale throughout the game due to power-ups, the later witches will naturally be a lot stronger to keep up with the power increase. This will cause the first witch that is fought to appear like a pushover, which we feel is incredibly unfair for her. As such, once all 8 witches are defeated, the player may challenge them to a rematch where their stats will be scaled to be challenging even to a fully-powered Gastova. However, their stat numbers are not the only thing that we will be increasing. All rematches with the witches will feature brand new mechanics and far more brutal attacks to really push the player to the limit.\n\nGastova has two types of attacks. The first one is her regular magic attack, and the second one is the upgraded version of the attack. In the beginning, she will only be able to use her standard Force element, giving her access to the regular Force Missile and the powered up Force Blast. Throughout the game, Gastova can obtain the power of the Fount Guardians she defeats, giving her more elements to choose from.\n\nThe town of Arkana\nArkana will be accessible at the start of the game and will provide Gastova with access to shops, NPCs and other goodies. Throughout her adventures, Gastova will discover game cartridges that she can turn in at the local arcade in exchange for power-ups!\n\nA save shrine with the statue of the First Witch\nProgresses can be saved with these save statues located throughout the world. They also serve as a point of fast travel, allowing Gastova to instantly revisit any shrines that she has previously visited.\nIngrid losing her patience\nAs the most recent graduate of the Witch Academy of Arkana, Gastova and her Fount Guardian classmates were preparing for a graduation trip to the neighboring city of Roundhouse. However, a dark force swept across the town and turned all the Fount Guardians hostile towards her and the rest of Arkana. Worse, mysterious creatures known as Waffos begin appearing throughout the region, causing havoc and chaos. Now, as the Guardian Witch of Arkana, a title Gastova inherited from her mentor, Gastova must set out and confront her classmates and defeat the Waffos for good.\nGastova is being developed by MechWolf Productions, consisting of Andy and Rayane, with the former handling the programming aspect and the latter taking care of the project\u2019s graphical needs. We also work with Aekashics Librarium for many of our monster designs as well as character portraits. For music, we will be using PeriTune's music library.\nA word from Andy: \nHey! Thanks for checking out our project! I hope you like what you're seeing here. A little about myself, I am from Vancouver, Canada and I dropped out of University a few years back in order to pursue my dream of game making. Helping me achieve my dream is truly something that I can never be grateful enough for and I'll absolutely make sure to deliver an experience that you will all be satisfied with.\nA word from Rayane:\nHello! Rayane here. I'm the lead artist and co-creator of this game. I'm from Brazil, and I've been making art for more than decade now as a freelancer artist. Your support will be the key to make our game come true. From the bottom of my heart, I can't thank you enough for being part of this! We will do our very best as a team to make this a game you'll love to play!\nOur target platform is Windows PC and Nintendo Switch. Backers of $15 or more will be able to choose between a Steam key or a Nintendo eShop code!\nGastova will be shipped in English, Portuguese, Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional) and Japanese. Please let us know if there are any languages you\u2019d like to see the game translated into and we\u2019ll do the best we can to include them.\nUPDATE: We're also adding Spanish to the list of available languages!\n\nThese goals are really \"stretching\" it\nWe believe for a Kickstarter project, a healthy communication goes a long way so we feel that it is important for us to clearly illustrate our plans as well as the things that we promise to do, versus the things that we want to do.\nOur promise is the basic fundamentals. The delivery of a game that is both satisfying and complete. This will include all the things we\u2019ve listed above, as well as ensuring that there are no major game-breaking bugs when the game is finished and released to the public. This is where our priority lies and what we consider the most important part of this campaign.\nOn the other hand, there are things we have ambitions for, but also realize that they might be beyond the scope of this project. As such, we\u2019ll be implementing them as stretch goals, something that will take a significantly more amount of work to implement, and something that we can only get done if we\u2019re able to get more help. After carefully evaluating our options, as well as our ability to fulfill them, we have decided to implement three stretch goals for the Kickstarter campaign.\nAn ominous tower awaits...\nWe\u2019ve always felt that the importance of end-game contents cannot be overstated. While we\u2019ve somewhat addressed this with boss rematches, there is another set of content that we would like to do. It would be a very long set of linear area that is designed to see how far we can push the difficulty of the game to. It will be long and tediousl. We\u2019re talking about lots of enemies, unfavorable environments, different debuffs for different areas, all to challenge the player to see how far they can go. \nFor some reason, the tower  contains mysterious memory fragments of the past, allowing Gastova to glimpse into various events involving Guardians of the past.\nAn area like this would likely utilize many of the same assets in the main game, with some edits and pallet swap to keep things as fresh as possible which would reduce the graphical needs for this stretch goal, although there will still definitely be new graphical assets in here. Most of the effort will therefore be allocated into designing the stage, mapping, enemies and bosses of this area. As such, this is what we consider to be the easiest of the stretch goals and the one we feel the most confident about.\nThe Will of the Guardian Witch\nWhile we cannot go into detail about our current plans for the game after the defeat of the 8  Guardians, we can say that there are already a significant amount of contents that follows in the work. Our second stretch goal, if met, is to further increase the amount of post-Guardian contents to a level that would feel epic including some extra screen time for the Fount Guardians themselves!\nUnfortunately, unlike the first goal, we really can\u2019t go into too much detail with this one. But it will be graphically intensive in terms of required assets and it\u2019ll also need quite a bit of extra programming done to make it happen. But we will say this. If it does happen, then expect the post-Guardian saga to be as lengthy, if not lengthier than the  Guardian saga!\nAlso, if we reach this stretch goal, we'll provide voice acting to all of the main story cutscenes.\nIngrid the Just and her guiding moonlight.\nThroughout the game, Gastova would often receive communications from Ingrid, her childhood friend and a Knight of a neighboring city. While Gastova is taking care of the Fount Guadians, Ingrid is also having an adventure of her own that ties into the overarching story. Our third stretch goal is simple; we\u2019ll make Ingrid fully playable, with a standalone campaign comparable to that of Gastova\u2019s. \nIngrid's story will play slightly differently than that of Gastova's. Whereas Gastova's gameplay revolves heavily on exploration of various areas and traveling between them, Ingrid's story will more closely resemble that of a classic platformer game, where you pick a stage, and advance from one end of the map to the other to fight the stage boss.\nAs Ingrid will not be fighting the Fount Guardians, her story will require a massive amount of additional graphical assets and will no doubt be the hardest stretch goal to pull off.\nHowever, if we actually do reach this milestone, we will absolutely make sure that we fulfill our promise and deliver an experience that you will not easily forget.\n\nGastova, the loafing Guardian Witch of Arkana\nNephelle, the serious Guardian of the Gale Fount\nRosalia, the dignified Guardian of the Nature Fount\nFelicity, the energetic Guardian of the Fire Fount\nSierra, the perpetually frowning Guardian of the Earth Fount\nIsabelle, the shy Guardian of the Spirit Fount\nNanami, the serene Guardian of the Water Fount\nTenebrea, the eccentric Guardian of the Ice Fount\nAldebaran, the mighty Guardian of the Light Fount\nIngrid, the 13th seat of the Oathsworn", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we have some physical goods to be fulfilled, we are confident in our ability to handle it in the schedule we've outlined.

We got you! You can watch this video instead of reading the article. It also has subtitles in case our accents are too much to handle!\n\nVibrant Venture is a singleplayer 2D adventure platformer game mixed with on the fly puzzle solving! The game features four playable characters each with two unique abilities. By switching between these characters, you can combine their abilities for extremely versatile, fluid and fun movement! The main focus of the game is traditional platforming combined with responsive and open-ended controls in a challenging environment which constantly gives the player fun and rewarding experiences. This also means there are often multiple ways to clear different sections!\nThe game also features an in-game level creator to give you the tools to easily create your own custom levels! You can even modify settings for objects such as the speed of enemies, the path of moving platforms, and so on!\nThe game is playable on keyboard/mouse and Xinput devices! It will be available for Mac and Windows at launch on Steam, and with enough support we would love to port it to consoles like the Nintendo Switch! \nThe base game will feature a total of approximately 22 huge levels (including more bonus stages!) split into multiple unique environment with 5 bosses. This is what we call the campaign mode. It will be filled with goofy cutscenes, tons of charm, and a cast of quirky characters helping to save the day! I've also been working on a level creator, which will be part of the first release with a set of tools and features we intend to expand upon in future updates! Custom levels are stored as a single text file for easy sharing and to make it easily intetragable with Steam Workshop in the future!\n\nWe have a ton of ideas for additional content such as levels where you play as the villain, Violastro, a custom hats/accessories creator, more level builder content, more campaign levels/bosses and so on! Regardless of the level of support we receive, we plan on keeping the game fresh with additional content through its lifespan!\n\nSemag Games is actually just a group of friends \"disguised\" as a company! We all enjoy creating different aspects of video games in our spare time and thus we decided to combine our abilities and form this wacky game called Vibrant Venture.\nMy name is Pattrigue and I'm the lead developer for the game, which means I program, design, test, plan... basically everything that isn't drawing! I study software engineering in college and have been programming in my spare time for around 5 years.\nJurl is the game's artist. He does all the really cool pixel graphics for the game! Jurl studies game design and game art in college and is constantly improving in both pixel art, free-form art, 3D modelling and all sorts of other visually pleasing things!\nBumbleGum is the game's designer/sketcher/general man of many ideas. He outlines, sketches and describes all the content in the game like mechanics, enemies, etc. BumbleGum is extremely passionate about game design and a master of unique concepts!\nThe music is composed by Christoph Jakob, a freelance composer. I picked him because his ability to capture the fun and adventurous atmosphere is fantastic!\nBesides the previously listed members, we have a group of friends who voluntarily tests the game in order to minimize the amount of bugs and issues present within, most notably Erion. This mad lad will sometimes dedicate several hours to finding reproduction steps for a single bug and we're extremely lucky to have his help! He also helps us design certain aspects of the game and polish different mechanics.\n\nRoughly 30%-40% of the game has been completed so far in terms of base content all funded by our personal savings. In order to continue creating the game however, we need your help. It's our goal to finish this game no matter how long it takes, but we can't continue keeping it afloat with our own savings. Music, assets and legal necessities (like having an accountant help us not end up in court - which is nice) are all expenses we must pay in order to fulfill our visions for this game. On top of that, we're students trying to live normal lives while working on the game as soon as our otherwise busy schedules allow it. \nThe more financially stable we are, the more motivated we are to dedicating our precious free time to the game without worrying about food, bills and other boring adult things. On a more personal level, I want to compensate everyone who has helped me bring this project to life.\nIf we reach our goal, the base game should hopefully be finished in 2021 as long as a minimal amount of unforeseen events pop up. Any leftover money is going to help us extend the base game, develop future content updates and hopefully more projects in the future!  \n Thank you for your support! This project means a lot to us and we will give it all the care and attention it needs to ensure it's polished and fun to play <3  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team consists of people developing this game as a hobby - we're either enrolled in college or working for a living. The biggest hurdle we have is finding time to commit to the game while balancing our personal lives at the same time. Luckily that's what this Kickstarter is for! With the additional funding we can safely allocate more time out of each of our lives to completing the project and making it the best game we can.\n\nWe have been developing this game for over a year now. During this period, we've constantly been communicating with fans about the development of the game from title screens to core gameplay changes. We have stayed in touch because players and feedback is important to us. Without either, there is no game. \n\nIn terms of technical difficulties, I'm not too worried since we've already fleshed out the majority of the systems like menus, saving and loading, mechanics, core gameplay, etc. So far I've managed to solve even the most challenging technical issues, but from time to time unexpected difficulties will occur which may take a long time to address.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge DKK 68 or more", "title": "Digital copy of the game", "descp": "(Approx. $10 USD, \u20ac9 EUR)\nYou get a digital download of the game when it's released!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["54 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 102 or more", "title": "Discord role and name in credits", "descp": "(Approx. $15 USD, \u20ac13.5 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server and your name in the game's credits!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 169 or more", "title": "Game OST and HD wallpapers", "descp": "(Approx. $25 USD, \u20ac22.5 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download and HD wallpapers!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 270 or more", "title": "Beta Access", "descp": "(Approx. $40 USD, \u20ac36 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers and early access to the game before the public release!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 338 or more", "title": "Stickers", "descp": "(Approx. $50 USD, \u20ac45 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release and a sticker sheet!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 676 or more", "title": "Poster", "descp": "(Approx. $100 USD, \u20ac90 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release and a cool poster!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 812 or more", "title": "Poster + stickers", "descp": "(Approx. $120 USD, \u20ac109 EUR)\nFull digital copy of the game, special \"Supporter\" role in our Discord server, your name in the game's credits, game soundtrack download, HD wallpapers, early access to the game before the public release, sticker sheet and a cool poster!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge DKK 5,046 or more", "title": "Everything + BONUS LEVEL!", "descp": "(Approx. $750 USD, \u20ac675 EUR)\nYou're actually insane!\nYou get to work with us and design A BONUS LEVEL!

Sealed from the world ages before, he unleashed it anew, dabbling in those strange cards he found there.\nAs he did, the magic of the unknown, of possibilities, of chance, returned to the world, clearly opposed to the stable rigidity and orderly harmony the Four Archetypes. The powers-that-be felt this dissonance, seeing this inevitable change to be a threat to the way of life of everyone in the world.\nA crusade from all nations, far and wide, was called. Justified on the writings of an ancient prophecy, the influence of the Stranger must be sealed again as it mustn\u2019t corrupt the order of The World lest it is destroyed. Bold adventurers from all places and walks of life travel to the land in order to raid the Tower of Potential, stop whoever beckoned its wicked force and return it to its ancient prison.\nYou play as one of these adventurers, traveling to the base camp of the crusade, now called Adventurer's Town, in search of fame, justice or just because she was told to\u2026\nAt the start of the game, an adventurer is selected. Each character has a unique starting deck featuring two archetypes and a unique curio, guiding your initial play-style and giving you an extra step towards building those archetypes.\nPlayable Character - Starting Deck: Oracle & Raider\nRegardless of your initial decision, you may branch out and create any deck you want in the game.\nPlayable Character - Starting Deck: Traveler & Warden\nDungeon crawling is a major aspect of Dungeon Drafters, and while on your journey for cards, fame, and loot, you'll encounter five different dungeons, plus the mysterious Tower of Potential for the true adventurers.\nConcept art for Dune Dome - one of the six dungeons\nDifferent dungeons have their own style, featuring monsters that may teleport, heal, absorb damage or cause massive damage. Beating the final boss of each Dungeon will require a lot of effort. Learn the tricks of each dungeon, make adjustments in your deck and dive further!\nEach dungeon has a unique set of monsters. Learn their tricks and abilities to dive further!\nDungeon Drafters has fishing in it. You may be wondering, \"Why?\" Dear adventurer, you know in your heart the answer to that all-important question: You simply cannot make a good RPG without a fishing minigame in it. It's the glue that keeps the game together. Also, it's fun!\n\"JRPG needs fishing.\" - Yoko Taro\nInspired by the great RPG soundtracks from the past, Dungeon Drafters comes filled with chiptune joy.

Do we still remember who we were outside of this dungeon?\nSelf: The Ancient - You have been in this dungeon longer than anyone else, and you know your fate. You have secret agendas in this dungeon.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $1,500: (UNLOCKED!) Brandon Leon-Gambetta\nBrandon Leon-Gambetta (Pasi\u00f3n de las Pasiones) is the screaming voice from deeper down down ever deeper down. Each discarded skull in this dungeon rattles with his podcasts' names, dreadful names that hiss Stop, Hack, & Roll Network & Protean City Comics. If he were to be found and he won't be found so lost is he, it would be at @bleongambetta.\nRoom: The Maw - They feed this dungeon with offerings. You travel ever tiring the sound of your breath heavy. They feed this dungeon with offerings. You know you've lost companions and you aren't the only ones to do so. They feed this dungeon with offerings. Where do the bodies go and why do they feed this dungeon with offerings? The maw takes the offerings.\nSelf: The Hound - They brought you into this dungeon because you can always find things and they thought you could find the exit of this dungeon. You tell them you can but you can never know if you are truly  smelling a trace of clean air in the rot or if you are chasing a trail long gone cold.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $2,000: (UNLOCKED!) Mahar Abrera Mangahas!\nMahar is a queer game designer from the Philippines who currently lives and works in Hong Kong. He tries to make games that are meaningful tools that reflect his cultures and background in music, theatre, and psychology.  He specialises in dramaturgy, or someone who looks at the theory and practice behind a dramatic composition or narrative. When not being a nerd he's otherwise asking people to support Session Zero or crying over people's beautiful games. Mahar's games can be found on http://maharhar.itch.io.\nRoom: The Hearth - Every dungeon has a place that feels warm and safe. That is a lie. Even a dungeon has its respite. That is a lie. Every sanctuary, every campfire, every place you caught your breath; that is a lie.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $2,500: (UNLOCKED!) Samantha Day!\nSamantha Day is a writer and designer from upstate New York. You can find her on Twitter @passerines, and you can find the things she makes at http://passerines.itch.io. She is a threat to her environment and she refuses to go extinct.\nRoom: The Crucible - You may not have done terrible things outside of this dungeon but you have almost certainly done terrible things inside this dungeon to survive this dungeon and before you can escape this dungeon your deeds must be tallied and accounted for. Your soul will be weighed. Will it be found wanting? Does it even matter?\nSelf: The Saint - You came to this dungeon to hear the voice of your Divine in the quiet hollow space of the world. You came to this dungeon to bring a light into dark places and a darkness into the light. You came to this dungeon. You came to this dungeon. There is no escape from this dungeon.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $3,000: (UNLOCKED!) Pamela Punzalan!\nPamela Punzalan (aka Pammu) grew up rolling dice and wanting to design video games, went for teaching and the academe instead, left those fields, stumbled into the legal practices behind real estate brokerage, occupied herself with pushing community spaces for women and LGBTQIA+ folks in her locale, then stumbled into tabletop game design. She's currently based in Manila, and loves to design things that look at the strange, the intimate, and the queer. You can follow her on Twitter @TheDovetailor.\nRoom: The Altar - After a small eternity of deep shadows, terrible odds, and grueling fights, stumbling upon a spot of quiet unspoiled by monsters can be jarring. But this is not a place where mortals can walk free. This is a god's hallow, a resting place of an Other. They watch. They listen. They demand supplication.\nSelf: The Gravedigger - Nothing stays buried for too long in a dungeon that never ends. Bones, bodies, treasure, love and memories are only as heavy as their attachments. You're comfortable in the in-between space of clinging hard to what seems ready to pass, and letting go of that which has no desire to leave.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $3,500: (UNLOCKED!) Natalie The Knife\nNatalie (she/her) is a trans game designer from Minneapolis, Minnesota. She designs and publishes roleplaying games with a focus on novel mechanics and player support. Natalie's other games can be found at rpgnatalie.itch.io.\nRoom: The Mirror - What lives here is a reflection of you yourselves. Perhaps twisted; perhaps true. Whatever it is, watch out.\nSelf: The Naturalist -Everything has a self, but only you know how to speak the hidden tongues.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $4,000: (UNLOCKED!) Jay Dragon\nJay Dragon (Ask me about my pronouns!) is a young queer game designer and summer camp counselor. She writes lyrical games about feelings, friendship, community, and horror.\nRoom: The Meadow - The walls of the room fall away into fields of flowers and a brilliant constant sunrise. The dew is everywhere, and crickets thrive in the grass. You could spend forever here. But where is the door? And why are you so, so tired?\nSelf: The Mote - We all need a light in the darkness, to navigate this Dungeon. It doesn't feel good to be told that that's all we're good for, a whisp on the wind or a lantern hung in the air. But, let's be honest. That's all the Mote really is. A discardable torch.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $4,500: (UNLOCKED!) Viditya Voleti\nViditya Voleti is an interactive artist and game designer who makes great stuff. He\u2019s been described as Prolific, Awe-inspiring, Has Great Hair, Exudes Pure Goblin Energy, and much more. His work and design reflects these, as Viditya has made straight bangers like Space Goblins!, Spellchitects, Space Between Stars, and Apprentice Quest. You can find his work on vidityavoleti.itch.io and follow him on Twitter @vidityavoleti.\nRoom: The Stars - This room tells of legends, long gone. Stories familiar and guiding, tragic and harrowing. What is learned will stick with you.\nSelf: The Goblin - You come from this dungeon, or one just like it. Others do not understand how you work, or are often quick to dismiss or suspect your actions. Only you understand your rules and the rules of this dungeon, because what will kill you is not this dungeon but those you travel with to seek an exit.\nSTRETCH GOAL - $5,000: (UNLOCKED!) Aaron King\nAaron King lives in Minneapolis, petsitting and making zines. They try to stay technically unemployed as much as possible.\nRoom: The Sporatorium - The fungi here want to communicate, but their spore talk hurts those who are unlike them. One of us is harmed on entering. We must decide who. Each painful inhalation brings us closer to understanding. We must decide whether to keep trying or to fight our way free.\nSelf: The Automaton - You awaken. Good. You were created by another. You are filled with coldly distributed elements and magic devices. This is your programming, and we are speaking to you now. D O   N O T   M A K E   M O R E   A U T O M A T O N S .\nSTRETCH GOAL - $5,500: CROWS DANGER\nCROWS DANGER is a swarm of birds haunting downtown Minneapolis. She is the author of Fight Truck and Petals, or when you fall for her, and seeks to create works that celebrate passionate imperfection.\nRoom: The Ceremony - The dungeon demands blood and wine, ash and soil. Follow the patterns on the walls, perform the rituals with your hands, and you will be different. You will leave someone behind, in this dungeon. You will find someone, in this dungeon. You will not be the same and you will be different.\nSelf: The Witch - You came to this dungeon because your skills are desired. You came to this dungeon because your skills are reviled. In this dungeon, you will do the workings no one else will. In this dungeon, you will do the workings you know in your heart. You stand at the edge of rejection and scorn, at the edge of isolation and outrage; they call you wicked, and you laugh.\nThe Treasure At The End Of This Dungeon Is An Escape From This Dungeon And We Will Never Escape From This Dungeon\nWe are bone and feathers and we will never escape and we want to escape. We want to fly. The treasure at the end of the dungeon is an escape from this dungeon. We will never escape from this dungeon. We are bones and feathers and hope and magic and we will never escape from this dungeon. We want to fly out of here on our busted wings and feel the air on our faces turned up towards the sun, but each room of the dungeon is the same and each room of the dungeon brings something new and we will never escape from this dungeon.\nEach room of this dungeon unlocks more of this dungeon. There are five rooms in this dungeon, and there are many rooms more than five in this dungeon. We have each died in one of the rooms in this dungeon, and we will each die many times more in each of the rooms of this dungeon. Each room of this dungeon is different but each room of this dungeon is the same, only growing larger with each time we enter each room of this dungeon. As we crawl we repeat, the cycle is always the same and we have different faces, the guardians are different beasts, the traps are different traps, the deaths are different deaths, and the treasure is always the same. The treasure at the end of this dungeon is an escape from this dungeon and we will never escape from this dungeon.\nAn image of a circus ticket written \"What is this dungeon? It is a kaleidoscopic roguelike dungeon crawl created by Riverhouse Games. There is no way out of here.\"\n\"some of the most beautiful, poetic game design you can get, a super fun looking story game of a roguelike, AND it's freaking gorgeous.\" - Brandon Leon-Gambetta, game designer & podcaster.\nThis is a roleplaying game for four players and no GM. Each room of this dungeon is different and has its own rules. Each of us crawling this dungeon is different and has our own rules. This is a kaleidoscopic game of an increasingly complicated dungeon from which there is no escape, and what happens to us as we die within its walls.\nThe game is meant for one to four players, each playing a Self, representing the four archetypes of dungeon crawl games: The Muscle, The Thief, The Mage, and The Healer. Each Self has special rules that will alter the play of This Dungeon.\nA screenshot of The Mage Self, with rules about how to cast spells, and how your magic becomes more entangled the more you die.\nAs the Selves crawl through This Dungeon, they enter one of five rooms, and one of an infinite number of rooms. Each Room follows a different dungeon crawl trope, like a Gatekeeper, a Trap, a Puzzle, or a Fight. Pretty straightforward, right?\nA screenshot of The Battle Room, with instructions on how to play out the fights that will happen in this Room.\nThe doors to the Rooms are incredibly heavy. So much so that opening more than one takes all your life from you. Your Self will die, and will change, and as you change so will This Dungeon. You will open the doors to each Room many times, each time spiraling off the Room into a kaleidoscope fractal of evolving Dungeon. \nThis is a Dungeon Crawl Horror Game where the monster is the Dungeon Crawl Genre.\nA fantasy ticket with two wood-cut style knights. The text reads \"What is being funded? A print run of zines and shipping to backers plus any back-stock to sell at conventions. The game is finished already, totally done!\"\nThe game is completely finished! The funds from the Kickstarter will go to producing the copies that will be sent to backers, and cover the shipping costs. Any left over funds will help me pay off student loans, car payments, and credit debt. \nA spread of printed zines, looking gorgeous and ready to ship", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game is finished, with completed art & layout.

Expect to get a couple hours out of it on the first play through! This is an early alpha build of the game so you may run into some issues but otherwise I hope you like it! Controller is HIGHLY recommended!\nConsider following my social media! I HIGHLY recommend my Twitter and Discord!\n Twitter / Discord / Facebook / YouTube \nFunded! - $6500 (REACHED!)\n Nintendo Switch Version - Rose of Starcross has made its initial funding goal which was primarily to support Nintendo Switch development costs! THANK YOU! You're awesome!\n\nStretch Goal 1 - $10,000 (REACHED!)\nMore DCTV Archive footage like this interview with the Father of Starcross Himself!  These will be short videos that can be anything! They can be interviews, sketches, teasers, music oriented, or whatever! These will be great because they won't eat dev time since many of them will be put INTO the game as optional fun content, they will be made using assets from the game, and I can make them pretty fast! I'm not planning to do Early Access or a major Beta test for the game so these would be a cool way to keep giving you guys stuff to chew on and enjoy! I'd like to do one every month or so!\n Wallpapers, Stickers, and Pins! - A $40 tier will be added that will include a sticker sheet with 4 stickers and a pin! These rewards will also be added to all higher tiers! Digital wallpapers will be added to the $25 tier and above. (Shipping only available in the United States)\n\nStretch Goal 2 - PS4 version - $15,000\n PS4 Version! Pretty self explanatory! The game will be released on PS4 too! If this goal is met, any copy of the game can be redeemed as any available option (PC, Switch, PS4) but that won't really matter because...\n Extra copy of the game! Anyone who has pledged at least enough to get a copy of the game, will get another extra copy of the game! Use it for whatever you like! So if you want to, consider upgrading to the OST tier or the new merch tier to get us closer to this goal!\n\nWhat the heck is this??\nIt's an RPG! Rose of Starcross takes inspiration from stuff like The Legend of Zelda, Mario, the MOTHER series, tons of modern indies, Golden Sun, Punch-Out!!, the Souls series, old anime, Scott Pilgrim, Steven Universe, moody lo-fi garbage, modern prog, and about a BILLION other things! Really it's everything I care about put together (which is pretty much just music, video games, and atmospheric stuff)!\nThe Story\n300 years ago, a being known as the Beast appeared and began to tear Starcross apart with cataclysmic magic. This event resulted in the death of almost all of the humans and set in motion the rise of the Undead, the creation of the Anims, and the birth of the Demons... As the world was about to see its absolute end, a being known as the Heavenly Queen rose up to challenge the Beast and the magic it was using to attack Starcross. After their battle, the Heavenly Queen was left mortally wounded and the Beast was destroyed. However, its magic was not gone, and the Heavenly Queen chose to seal herself in the Door locked behind the Rose so that she may one day return with her strength recovered to heal Starcross. Only a single sword was left as the key to re-opening the door and ending her slumber... but again, that was 300 years ago!\nThings might not be so awful now! Or they might be! Depends on who you ask but honestly things have gotten along pretty well thanks to the leadership of some really impressive individuals! A notable feat is that Demons, Anims, and humans live very much in harmony. The Door locked behind the Rose, the Sword, and Mt. Starcross itself are also pretty fun tourist attractions now! So whether or not you even believe that stuff about the Beast and the Heavenly Queen and blahblahblah, you gotta admit that a lot of people seem happy enough!\nNow who knows what would happen if some unknown, idiot kid just came along and actually pulled the sword up. But I doubt we'll ever have to worry about that! Schools out! Summer just started! A perfect time to take a vacation! Go have fun!\nCharacters\nViscera and Annie\nViscera (\"Pronounced 'Viss-air-uh!'\") is normally running her Cafe on the top of Mt. Starcross, and when she's not, she's probably trying to pull the sword, running errands, or spending time with Annie! Annie (short for Anacrusis) is normally at school, and when she's not, she's probably in her room or spending time with Viscera! Viscera and Annie also happen to be witches! Well, mostly Viscera. They are pretty well known in Starcross as the only known humans that are able to use magic! Again, mostly Viscera!\n\n **If some of the GIFs on this page aren't animating (like the one below), playing the video should help them load properly after a couple seconds!**\nA regular occurrence\nDjinn (the Demon) and Tonic (the pumpkin child)\n Djinn and Tonic - a Demon and an Anim pumpkin. Entrepreneurs, purveyors of fine food and drink, handsome, and Long time friends to Viscera and Annie!\nA fateful encounter\nThere will be a large cast of major characters, minor characters, and one-off NPCs, but this is all I can give you right now! We'll see who else we can get on here during the campaign, if they're not too busy with other interviews, of course.\n\nEXPLORATION\nRose of Starcross has been designed to have a pseudo 3D environment meaning... PLATFORMING! I put a lot of work into this since platforming and more interesting movement mechanics in the overworld can be used to create challenges on their own, complement puzzle mechanics, and REALLY enhance exploration and secrets!\nUse magic in the overworld to explore, interact, and solve puzzles in interesting and different ways!\n4 large main areas each with a \"dungeon\" (Not including the first area and dungeon in the Demo)\nOpen design for the main areas and dungeons\nTons of optional things to do in the overworld! Some will be small challenges with little rewards, some will have stories, and some will be full on optional side quests!\nLearning about the world itself will be a matter of you going out and learning about it, picking up on context clues in the environment, and speaking to NPCs. The main story of the game is largely focused on the characters and the scenarios you find yourself in.\n**If some of the GIFs on this page aren't animating, playing the video should help them load properly after a couple seconds!**\nPlatforming and challenges! (If you think something looks too tough OR too boring - don't worry there will be difficulty settings for this stuff too!)\nUse the \"Rose\" ability on magic pads to activate a variety of context specific abilities in the overworld!\nUse the \"Leaf\" magic for stuff like this!\nUse the \"Arrow\" ability for stuff like this!\nBATTLE SYSTEM\n Defending - Enemy attacks can come from above, the left, the right, the ground, or multiple directions at once! All damage can be avoided through blocking, jumping, and \u201cLeaf\u201d dodging!\n Attacking - Mini-game based attacks determine how much damage you do and/or how many successive hits you do. The mini-games are balanced differently or changed based on which enemies you are fighting or what location you\u2019re fighting in!\n Enemy Stats - Enemy defensive stats and abilities are balanced so they could be anywhere from extremely weak to certain attacks to completely immune to them!\n Enemy Emotional Status - Enemies' emotional status can further alter their stats!\n Taunting - Taunts replace a standard DEFEND/FLEE option and can have a variety of different effects on yourself, the enemies, or both! (And maybe some environments?)\n Fleeing battle - There is no RNG-based fleeing option, instead the \"Dispel Rocks\" item can get you out of any battle that you CAN flee! (Can't be used in Boss battles/etc)\n Scoring System - A scoring system will take into account things like efficiency (turns taken), final HP, item use, number of successful perfect blocks, etc to yield higher rewards in battle! (The current version in the demo is pretty basic but will be improved in the final game!)\nDefense!\nSpecial Attacks!\nRose Magic - Play a randomized mini-game to use a powerful AoE attack that does a single strong blast of damage to every enemy! As you get further into the game, more mini-games will be thrown into the mix to keep it more engaging and a bit more tense!\nArrow Magic - Fire multiple arrows at any target(s). Enemy targets are based on their battle positions. Targets can also be blocked by others depending on their position!\nRPG AND PROGRESSION ELEMENTS\n Leveling - Max HP, max MP, max RP (Ring Points), and max Leaf Meter can all be increased by using items like the \"Star Pop\" in the demo! Level up items can be found in different ways by exploring, doing optional mini-dungeons/tasks, or buying them! This is a Zelda thing that I really love and I've always preferred to experience points!\n Rings - Equipping rings can give you new attacks, new taunts, HP/MP/Leaf Meter regeneration, faster battle speed, better stealth in the overworld, more rewards from battle, higher encounter meter, specialized overworld effects, etc! Every ring has its own RP cost so your max RP will determine how many ring combinations you can do!\nDIFFICULTY AND SPECIAL GAME MODES\nDifficulty - The current goal is to keep the normal game fairly challenging so you can feel accomplished when you overcome tough moments! However, I really like having options and everyone's needs are different. I'm going to put as much effort as I can into the alternate difficulties with things as far as alternate enemy animations (especially bosses), revised encounters, and an altered overworld. Lots of individual settings can be customized as well, even down to how tight the window for perfect blocking is! I'm doing my best to make fun alternate difficulties.\nSpecial Modes - I have some fun ideas for more fundamental game altering settings aimed to make repeat playthroughs different. The \"Traditional Mode\" below is an example! (This mode is definitely getting into the game, another mode is a secret, and I have some other ideas that I don't want to commit to yet so this is all you get here!)\nTraditional Mode - Okay blocking and perfect blocking reduce damage to 66% and 33% respectively instead of 50% and 0%. This means your reaction skill will still be tested, but item management and battle optimization will be much more necessary and interwoven into the challenge like more traditional RPGs. ~This mode is actually mostly for me since I know every enemy animation and attack better than the back of my hand but I'm sure there's someone out there who will get familiar enough with the game to really appreciate this mode!~ \nStarcross is a colorful, complex, and surreal place! It's also made up of some of my favorite types of places to explore in games! Like most adventurous RPGs there's a healthy balance between small-scale cozy areas and large-scale set pieces, all of which I do my best to fill with detail, story-telling, and secrets!\nThe Moving Fair that's on Mt. Starcross for the weekend!\nBlue Apartment\nA beach side Resort\nRooftop view of the Demon City Plaza\nMountain Fog\nView from a quieter place\n\nMUSIC\nRose of Starcross will have a fully original Soundtrack done by me! This entire project started a long time ago with JUST music, so it's extremely important to me that I give you some cool sounds. I like to write music with whatever I think works best for that song or moment in the game so I'm not trying to make the whole OST sound like an NES or SNES soundtrack or anything like that, but I love the way that stuff sounds so a lot of the music is meant to mimic those eras! But if I feel like throwing in some Queen guitars I probably will! Here are some examples of stuff I'm putting effort in to!\nDifferent battle themes for each major area and dungeon\nExtended cutscenes and events that are timed to the music\nCompletely unique boss and mini-boss tracks\nSoundscape and atmospheric tracks\nDynamic track shifting and layering for certain moments\nAnd here are a couple tracks taken right out of the Demo and some links to the full Demo OST!\n Bandcamp (Full OST + Quality Download) \n Soundcloud (Full OST) \n Youtube (Full OST) \nArea Battle Theme (with intro): \nCute short one:\nArea Theme: \nBoss Theme (if you're planning on playing the demo and haven't yet, please don't spoil yourself!): \n\nCONCEPTS AND SCREENSHOTS\n\nWho is making this garbage?\nMe! My name is Peyton Burnham and everything in Rose of Starcross has been completely done by me, as evidenced by the fact that there was no one else here to tell me it's not a good idea to refer to my own game as garbage. In all seriousness I love everything about making this game. My absolute favorite things in the world are writing music, writing stories, playing video games, game design, and animation! Specifically the art form of animation. Not the process of animation. The process of animation often makes me want to die. But FINISHING a good animation makes me feel like the absolute coolest kid on the block so it balances out! ANYWAYS if you play the demo of this game you probably have a pretty good idea of who I am!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe main reason I'm doing a Kickstarter is so I can cover the cost for Nintendo Switch development! I would love more than anything to be able to release this game on a console! And as previously mentioned, I really care about the music. Some of the money will be going to improving the soundtrack with some really interesting plugins and instruments! Likewise there will be CD manufacturing costs for the physical OST tier. I have a lot of other things in mind that could really improve my work but I've set the base goal to mostly account for that stuff and Kickstarter's fees!\nProgress\nThat's a tough one since this is my first game! It took a while to make a few of these systems and to get them working properly so the demo took a good while with revisions. However, I've been working on the next area of the game and it's going smoothly! I'd say the Demo is maybe 1/8th or less of the final game (Including the planned optional content), but like I said it's been going much faster than putting the demo together took and pretty much all of the major systems are in now! I suspect I have around 2 years left before I finish the game.\nTHANK YOU!\nIf you got to the bottom of this giant page then thank you for checking out my game and giving me a little bit of your time!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOn the technical side I've already tackled pretty much all of the big hurdles. All of the major systems have been implemented and while they will require more testing and polish, I'm completely confident that I can execute on this vision! As I mentioned, this is still my first game so I have a hard time gauging how long certain tasks will take. The biggest risk is that the game will take longer to finish than I expect. I'm currently expecting the game should take about 2 more years to finish, it'll most likely be a fairly large game but now that all of the systems are in place, the process should move a good bit faster.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Cool Kid", "descp": "Support the game, keep track of the campaign, and get your name in the credits!\nINCLUDES:\nBacker-exclusive updates\nPride\nName in the Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2022"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Get the Game", "descp": "Get a copy of the game!

Forced to eject from her malfunctioning starcraft, The Seeker is marooned on a tiny island surrounded by an endless alien ocean, with nothing but her amphibious survival pod. Throughout her underwater journey to reach her crashed starcraft, she'll uncover the lost history of this planet reclaimed by the elements, and learn the true nature of why she ended up here.\nA small-scale, story-driven game inspired largely by the psychedelic sci-fi of the '70s and '80s, Aquamarine combines old-school roguelikes and the survival genre with the exploration and puzzle solving of classic point-and-click adventures.\nAquamarine is the first title developed by international collective Moebial Studios, and is planned for release on PC, Linux, and Mac in Q4 2020.\nCheck out the intricate alien world Team Moebial has been building in Aquamarine's pre-alpha demo. This unfinished sneak-peek of the game will be regularly updated with bug fixes and optimizations, and can be download for free on Itch and Game Jolt.\nLearn more about what all of our stretch goals entail, and how exactly they'll expand the development of Aquamarine, in this campaign update.\n\"What I have seen so far is eye-catching, and I keep finding myself returning to see if I can find a way to deeper waters.\" - PC Gamer Magazine\n\"I\u2019m glad that weird underwater planets are in vogue. Nothing brims with possibility like a good alien ocean, and if the Aquamarine Kickstarter succeeds then I\u2019ll get to explore one more.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"Along similar lines as last year\u2019s smash hit hand-drawn game Cuphead, Aquamarine wears its influences on its sleeve and brings a uniqueness that can\u2019t be matched by triple-A level games.\" - Comics Beat\n\"The beautiful underwater world of Aquamarine is a fascinating place to explore. The artwork is superb, the creature design is excellent and it\u2019s great fun discovering the secrets the world has to offer.\" - Alpha Beta Gamer\nREAD AN INTERVIEW WITH MOEBIAL STUDIOS DIRECTOR PATRIC FALLON ABOUT THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE OF AQUAMARINE.\n \u25c8HAND-DRAWN WORLD INSPIRED BY PSYCHEDELIC SCI-FI\u25c8 \nFrom the comics of French artist Moebius, to the animated films of Ren\u00e9 Laloux and Studio Ghibli, to the outsider art featured in issues of Heavy Metal magazine--the mind-bending sci-fi of the '70s and '80s has majorly influenced the aesthetic and world-building of Aquamarine. Staying true to that golden era, every visual element has been hand-drawn, hand-colored, and hand-animated, giving our world the feeling of a comic book come to life. \n \u25c8STORY-DRIVEN JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY AND SELF-REALIZATION\u25c8 \nAquamarine may be packed with obscure mechanics, interlocking systems, and survival resources, but it's all in service to the central story. As you discover new abilities and push your exploration into deeper waters, more and more elements of the story are revealed, both narratively and environmentally. What exactly happened to this strange aquaplanet, why was The Seeker intercepted and marooned here, and how will she escape once she reaches her crashed starcraft? All will be answered.\n \u25c8DYNAMIC ECOSYSTEM ALTERING EACH PLAYTHROUGH\u25c8 \nThe world of Aquamarine behaves according to its own rules, and each of those rules changes the gameplay. With a full day-and-night cycle, persistent weather effects, oceanic tidal patterns, and creatures that respond to their environment, no individual dive or full playthrough is ever the same. \n \u25c8STRATEGIC SURVIVAL: WILL YOU CULTIVATE OR CONQUER?\u25c8 \nSurviving long enough to find and recover your crashed starcraft is the ultimate goal of Aquamarine, but how you do it is left entirely up to you. Can you figure out how to peacefully co-exist with the alien wildlife, growing new life to aid your survival? Maybe you'd rather blaze a more ruthless trail as you find new abilities for your pod, leaving a wake of destruction behind? No matter the strategy you choose, preparation and perception are the only way to keep yourself alive.\n \u25c8AQUAPLANET RIDDLED WITH FORGOTTEN SECRETS\u25c8 \nOne of Aquamarine's core design pillars is to reward patience and keen observation, and there's no better way to do that than to fill this alien waterworld with secrets. For those who love to poke at the edges of a game, test the limits of the mechanics, and swap stories and tips with friends, we've got loads of special surprises waiting for you to discover, if you can figure out how. But remember: Not everything hidden was meant to be found.\n \u25c8RELAXED TURN-BASED EXPLORATION\u25c8 \nFor all the weirdness and uncertainty lurking in these unexplored waters, Aquamarine is ultimately a quiet and relaxed experience. One major aspect of this feeling is our turn-based exploration system, allowing you to assess a situation and make your move whenever you want. Nothing happens around you until your turn is over--except for the relentless passage of time. Not even turn-based movement can stop that.\n \u25c8PERSISTENT ENVIRONMENTS THAT CHANGE BASED ON YOUR CHOICES\u25c8 \nAs you play through Aquamarine and explore its environments, everything you do will permanently impact the world around you. Your presence alone has altered the behavior of the underwater exo-fauna and flora, and the longer you stay, the larger effect you'll have. Because your progress saves automatically, you must be sure you're ready to live with the consequences of your actions.\nAquamarine is a turn-based adventure game emphasizing strategic survival, perceptive exploration, resource management, defensive tactics, and environmental puzzle solving. Your ultimate goal is to reach your crashed starcraft, but only if you can stay alive long enough find a way there.\nWhen it comes to alien aquaplanets, food is an especially scarce resource. And it's the most important one. Your first priority is to find a way to eat, whether it be foraging the ocean floor, growing your own garden, or even scavenging corpses for meat. Your little survival pod can take a beating and regenerate, but starvation means the end.\nEvery move, every action, and every moment you're alive costs you something--fuel, food, visibility, health, knowledge, time. In order to survive, you must learn to adapt to your surroundings and keep yourself open to new information. Contemplate your decisions: the consequences are permanent.\nWhenever you dive into the ocean, you're looking for resources. Gems to power your pod or craft a new upgrade, food to eat, plants to grow, and other items are out there in the water. Get them, bring them back to your island, and use them to help you reach your crashed starcraft.\nAs you progress through each area, you'll find new upgrades for your survival pod. Harness those special abilities to expand you exploration, and tap into the planet's natural elements to dive deeper into the alien ocean.\nJEAN \"MOEBIUS\" GIRAUD\nA prolific French artist, writer, and illustrator who specialized in sci-fi and fantasy comics, Jean \"Moebius\" Giraud is the most important inspiration behind Aquamarine. Buying a copy of his incredible, decade-spanning graphic novel anthology, The World of Edena, was the catalyst for creating this game. We wanted so much to follow the path of his work that we even named our studio after him: Moebial.\nFANTASTIC PLANET & TIME MASTERS BY RENE LALOUX\nAnother French artist whose influence can't be overstated is filmmaker Ren\u00e9 Laloux. His groundbreaking animated masterpiece Fantastic Planet set the precedent for psychedelic sci-fi in 1973, and his collaboration with Moebius, the 1982 animated film Time Masters, continues to inspire with its gorgeous design and unique world-building.\nNAUSICA\u00c4 OF THE VALLEY OF THE WIND & PRINCESS MONONOKE\nJapanese animated films are also a core inspiration for the world and story of Aquamarine, especially these two by Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. The ways that Nausica\u00e4 and Princess Monoke confront environmental destruction, show how we can learn to understand and embrace the unknown, and celebrate the power of one determined spirit have massively impacted us. Plus, their shared visual style is utterly timeless.\nMYST & RIVEN\nMoebial Studios wouldn't exist were it not for these two iconic adventure games from the '90s. Both Myst and its sequel Riven showed us just how immersive computer games could be, and how it's never wrong to trust the player to decipher the strange, awe-inspiring worlds you build for them.\nDON'T STARVE\nPerhaps our favorite survival game, Don't Starve takes a page out of the Myst book, confidently dropping the player into an unknown wilderness and telling them to figure out how not to die. Aquamarine wants to balance that focus on discovery and open-ended play with a compelling story that inspires you to take risks in order to see what happens next.\nHOLLOW KNIGHT & HYPER LIGHT DRIFTER\nFew games in recent memory have made such a deep impression on us as Hollow Knight's living bug kingdom and Hyper Light Drifter's gorgeous, desolate world. Though Aquamarine is by no means an action, sword-fighting game, it is very much inspired by the likes of Metroid, Castlevania, and Dark Souls. Plus, how these two games create a lush and captivating world with simple animation and an immersive soundtrack is a standard we aspire to.\n \u25c8ONE DIGITAL COPY OF AQUAMARINE (PC/LINUX/MAC)\u25c8 \nOur dream game simply won't exist without your support, and we'll never be able to thank you enough for helping us make it a reality.

You'll be given a special standalone shout-out in the credits of Aquamarine, which we'll work with you to conceptualize and perfect.\nAVAILABLE IN \"THE OMNIPRESENCE\" ($750)\nMoebial Studios began as a way for writer/game designer Patric Fallon, based in Northern California, to make games collaboratively. Having released a few of his own scrappy solo titles, he knew that bringing in outside talents would only elevate and enrich the experiences he wanted to create. After prototyping for Aquamarine finished in early 2018, he began slowly assembling a collective of artists from around the world.\nOur first recruit was Drew Brouillette, from Ontario, Canada, who Patric found on Reddit while hunting for talented animators with a knack for hand-drawn illustrations. Leonardo d'Almeida, from Salvador, Brazil, actually reached out to us on Instagram, asking if we had any need for an artist. Almost a year later, we had an opening and basically hired him as our lead illustrator on the spot. The last and most recent addition to Team Moebial was musician/composer Thomas Hoey, from Bristol, England. He was recommended to us by a friend of a friend, and we count ourselves lucky we discovered his inspiring work.\nWe want you to know exactly how we're using the funds raised during this campaign, so we broke it down in this chart. As you can see, Aquamarine is a very visually demanding game, so a sizable sum of our resources will go towards making sure the environments are lush and the sprites are gorgeously detailed. Hand-drawn animation is also important to our vision, with a good portion of our budget going towards bringing this strange waterworld to life. Music and sound design are a core part of the Aquamarine experience, too, though the number of audio assets needed just don't compare to the sheer amount of visuals we're creating.\nYou may also notice we don't budget for things like programming, project management, or an office. The reasons for this are simple. Moebial founder Patric Fallon wears many hats--including director, designer, programmer, marketing manager, and so on--and our entire team works remotely in their own studios. But that little pie slice marked \"Miscellaneous\" represents the costs of launching this Kickstarter and making it successful. With your help, of course.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we're a tiny team of newcomers spread around the globe, we're sure to run into obstacles and will need to overcome unexpected setbacks. But by communicating openly with our backers, and remaining transparent with our development plans and progress, you'll always be up to date on the current state of Aquamarine no matter what. Follow along by becoming part of our community on Discord, joining our mailing list, or just keeping an eye out for regular Kickstarter updates.\n\nWhen the Kickstarter ends, and after all necessary rewards have been shipped, our team goes straight into full-time production. Because no one is earning a livable wage from this campaign, some of our team members will have to juggle Aquamarine and another job. This has always been part of how we work, though, and we've managed to accomplish quite a lot in just a few months. The key is to know each team members monthly availability, and for our director to plan out the dev schedule accordingly.\n\nThough time constraints may appear, by planning around them we can ensure they don't interfere with our intended release period. Aquamarine is a small-scale project, so it can morph and evolve to fit our needs and the amount of support we receive. Having a small, flexible, close-knit dev team help makes this possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Casual Ally", "descp": "You're here to show a little love and follow Aquamarine's development.

We\u2019re Liz and Steffie. Thank you for checking out our Kickstarter page. In 2019 we set ourselves the goal of creating twelve unique roleplay games in the space of twelve months via our Patreon and we succeeded! Now we are looking to raise money via Kickstarter to get these games printed as an anthology.\nOur games range from a twisted journey into Lewis Carroll\u2019s Wonderland to a colouring game about magical unicorns. Our brand is the macabre, the weird, and very often the cute. Each game comes with its own set of rules and setting information, which will provide you and your friends hours of fun.\n*Cover art not final\nThe anthology will be a roughly 200 page, a5 sized, soft cover book with a colour cover and a black & white interior. The inside of the book will be comprised of a thick, high quality paper to prevent bleed from the front to the back of the page, with a matte finish for legibility.\nThe book will include all 12 games we created last year ordered by the month we released them in. Each game is its own separate chapter and includes all the mechanics and setting information you need to play. The games are complete so all we need to do is a final editing pass and layout!\nMake/100: 100 copies of our anthology will have a unique cover compared to the retail version of the book. If you missed the Make/100 version you can pledge for a normal retail version!\nAdd-ons: Any person who pledged for a physical copy of the book may add additional copies of the retail version of the book to their pledge for an additional 25euro per book. Shipping is covered by your original pledge.\nStretch goals: We'll announce all new stretch goals through our updates and once they are unlocked place them below for all to see! \n 5k - UNLOCKED - Inside cover printed\n 6k - UNLOCKED  -  New chapter art\n8k - UNLOCKED - UV spot coating on the cover\n\u201cLiz and Steffie's Patreon is the most reliable source of brilliant storytelling and game design that I've found so far. Bloody Demon Slayers alone was worth my support over the last year and I've gotten so much more.\u201d - Camdon Wright, creator of One Child\u2019s Heart\n\"Not only are Steffie and Liz two of the best and freshest voices in roleplaying games, but the fact that they are able to understand and evoke such a range of emotion and experience with these games is nothing short of a monument to their talent.\" - Alan Bahr, Gallant Knight Games\n\u201cReturn to Wonderland\u2019s tyrants are vivid, whimsical, and macabre, exactly what\u2019s needed for a setting that foregrounds the absurd and the sinister in equal measure.\u201d - Rose Bailey, Fantasy Heartbreaker\n\u201cNo other game I have played has captured the feeling of being in a Stephen King novel better than We Die Here. The tools Steffie provides help your table build a small town that feels real and populate it with strange characters that would feel at home in Twin Peaks. I truly love this game!\u201d  - Kent Blue, Roll to Play Podcast\n\"Bloody Demon Slayers is as empowering as it is entertaining. I expected to feel embarrassed talking about my or my character's menstruation, but the game is set up to tell those stories positively and powerfully. If periods giving Buffy or Sailor Moon their powers sounds fun, give BDS a try!\" - Andi, She's a Super Geek Podcast\nThis anthology collects 12 games designed, written, and developed over the course of 2019. Check out their information below!\nJanuary: Return to Wonderland\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nReturn to Wonderland takes Alice back to Wonderland, now a dark place under tyrant rule. It\u2019s a game about struggling to make ends meet in 1879\u2019s industrial London, while fighting off the Red Queen\u2019s assassins. Players take on the role of Alice and such companions as the Cheshire Cat and White Knight. The GM chooses from any of the six tyrants presented\u2014Queens and Jabberwockies alike\u2014and creates their own story around that. Return to Wonderland uses a deck of playing cards to resolve conflicts and keep the narrative going.\nFebruary: Bloody Demon Slayers\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nBloody Demon Slayers is a game about magical warriors blessed by the moon with powers when they menstruate. They use these powers to fight corruption wherever it roams, and beat back the foul forces of evil who lurk in the dark. The night is blessed by the moon and her children protect it. Each Demon Slayer has four stats\u2014Soul, Tempest, Blood and Moon\u2014based on their menstrual cycle, and this game uses D6\u2019s as conflict resolution. Bloody Demon Slayers is a game about periods, for everyone. So enjoy the night, slayers!\nMarch: Keepers of Antarra\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nAntarra is a continent of wonder and terror. Crystal veins travel under Antarra\u2019s wartorn surface and carry magic within them. Antarra\u2019s rivers and roads run along these crystal lines, and great city-states rise where lines meet. Towers sit atop the greatest crossroads of crystal, controlled by warlocks and demigods who seek to shape Antarra in their own image. Keepers of Antarra is a narrative game where players create a map of Antarra together. Only one can prevail, seize control of the crystal lines, and become the new Keeper of Antarra.\nApril: Guardians of Aimsir\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nGuardians of Aimsir is a diceless, colouring role play game. Characters are steeds of the majestic Unicorn Guardians, in service to the great Unicorn Queen, who are charged with the protection of all Aimsir. While the Queen slumbers it is their job to protect Aimsir from all threats no matter what the cost. Character creation is based on coloring a unicorn, and then conflict resolution is settled through colouring in storybook pages together. Guardians of Aimsir is a whimsical game for all ages.\nMay: Het Tijdschrift\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nHet Tijdschrift is about the descendants of Dutch WW2 resistance heroines. After the war these heroines were not honoured, given no medal and afforded no celebration, but their spirits live on in the people they saved and in their journals. Players craft the stories of these heroines together, and end the game by reading these memoirs. Het Tijdschrift is a poignant game about bravery, doing the right thing without reward or witness, and a legacy that lives on.\nJune: We Die Here\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nWe Die Here explores the lives and secrets of a small, isolated town. It was inspired by stories like Twin Peaks, Stephen King\u2019s It, and Netflix\u2019 Dark, where the town is as much a character in the story as its inhabitants. Isolated and more than a little creepy, the town is the monster in this tale. We Die Here uses an easy D6 mechanic centered around the character\u2019s Need, Want and Secret. Beware though, for the town has its own drives and doesn\u2019t want to let the characters go.\nJuly: The Wicked Sisters\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nThe Wicked Sisters is a story of prehistoric women from when the world was new and myths were formed. The Sisters flee from their birth place and are plunged into a strange new land from which they must escape. At least one Sister must make across the land, to sing her stories to the stars and ensure the Sisters\u2019 legacies live on. The Wicked Sisters uses a tarot deck to provide and resolve a dramatic narrative. All the information players need to perform these tarot readings is included in the game.\nAugust: Kitten Witches\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nThe kitten witches are a litter born to a witch\u2019s familiar. Their butt wiggles and tail calibrations are magical\u2014and so are they. They\u2019re good kittens, because their witch is good\u2014the kind that protects children from the Tooth Fairy and chases hobgoblins back to the Nightmare Lands. So when trouble comes calling as the witch is off to the Sabbath, the kittens must save the night. Kitten Witches uses a deck of playing cards to provide narrative conflict resolution, with the four suits representing Purrs, Whiskers, Toebeans and Hairballs.\nSeptember: The Everlasting\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nThe Everlasting is a GMless roleplaying game about the Everlasting, the immortal guardians of their familial lines. The Everlasting navigate a treacherous immortal society to keep their family safe. They politik, backstab, seduce, and do anything in their power to make sure the family survives. Players weave the story together, making and breaking character alliances as they go. The Everlasting uses 2D6s as well as character\u2019s Rage, Civility and Stratagem to determine the result of these conflicts.\nOctober: Camp Pleasant\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nCamp Pleasant is about nights spent with friends, the end of the holidays, new beginnings, secrets and murder. It\u2019s inspired by old campy slasher movies and season two of Slasher (Guilty Party). The characters are camp counselors, getting together for one last campfire hangout before heading to their separate lives again. They can share memories, air grievances, or poke at secrets. It\u2019s been a long, hard vacation with just a spot of murder. Camp Pleasant is a cooperative game where players take turns crafting a shared story.\nNovember: You and I at the End of the World\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nThe world ended, but at least one person survived. They haven\u2019t spoken to another human in years when they find a letter, a desperate call into the void. They write back and thus begins a chain of events that will turn their life upside down. After a series of letters the two characters decide if they take the risk and meet each other. You & I is a letter writing game about human connections. There are no winners or losers in this game, just two souls looking for a friend at the end of the world.\nDecember: Haven AE\nFind this game on DriveThruRPG\nThe year is 2250, two centuries after humanity scrambled for survival in Earth\u2019s dying days. People exist as avatars in the digital realm. Even here though, capitalism survives. Players take on the role of Breakers rebelling against the system that governs Haven. The ruling elite seeks to destroy them for their failure to comply. The Code, the engine which built reality, seeks to destroy them for breaking the rules. It\u2019s fight or die. Haven AE uses a simple D6 mechanic as characters explore the full range of cyberpunk apocalyptica.\nWe are both roleplay industry professionals living in the Netherlands.

Steffie worked on the Changeling the Lost 2nd Edition Corebook, The Fall of London and Cults of the Blood Gods for Vampire the Masquerade 5th Edition, and the Cavaliers of Mars Corebook.\nWant to get a feeling for our games?\nListen to the She\u2019s a Super Geek podcast, where Liz runs Bloody Demon Slayers for the show\u2019s hosts Andi and Senda.\nListen to the We Die Here campaign by Roll To Play Podcast.\nThe money we raise through Kickstarter will go to printing the games, which are already written, and paying for proofing to make sure the text is the best version of itself. Printing will be done through a local printer here in the Netherlands, which Liz has worked with multiple times before. PDFs will be distributed via DriveThruRPG.\nIf we manage to get over funded we have a few stretch goals in mind including getting more illustrations and paying for a deeper edit of the text by someone other than ourselves. We\u2019ll reveal these stretch goals once the Kickstarter is funded. We\u2019re keeping stretch goals to a minimum to ensure we get our book out on time and all goals will go towards improving the overall quality of the book.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs Liz owns her own RPG company and we\u2019re fulfilling the Kickstarter through Angry Hamster Publishing. Angry Hamster Publishing has run and successfully fulfilled four Kickstarters, including a Make 100 project!

For a time, life flourished and grew to every corner of the world.\nThe Mira continued to build on this power. Great civilizations grew unchecked, until the power began to dim. The planet was at its limit, the ancient power bestowed by the Progenitors had reached its bound, but the Mira refused to accept their fate, and continued to draw on the last reserves of Casimir.\nA great ruin washed across the lands. Ash and Dust stripped bare the once verdant landscape, and all of life retreated into what refuge it could find. Now searching for answers before all is lost, the Mira face a difficult future.\nIn Rubi, the dying fantasy world of Casimir and the world of near-future Earth fuse violently as the Large Hadron Collider's secret experiments force the two realities to entangle. What is a calamity for Earth is salvation for Casimir, or so it seems at first.\nYou play as Rubi, a Mira unable to use magic, suddenly thrust into a world with an overabundance of it. What grants her strength overwhelms the other Mira, driving them mad with power at first, eventually falling feral.  Rubi's driving goal is to reunite with her family on Casimir by restarting the Large Hadron Collider, but the Feral Mira have other plans... \nRubi's attacks as well as the obstacles she faces are inspired by the particle physics experiments that merged Casimir and Earth.\n Beam Weapon: Particle - Alpha, Beta, and Gamma particles are basic upgrades to your beam weapon, increasing range, damage, and allow charge.\nAlpha, Beta, and Gamma Beam attacks.\n Neutrino Phase: - A dash option that can be used to bypass thin terrain, dodge incoming hazards, or increase jump length. Chained phases are possible by upgrading your mana capacity\nUsing Double Jump + Neutrino Phase + downward Charge Beam to cross the gap.\n Beam Sword: - Rubi lets a concentrated version of her particle beam out of her manaclasts for high power at a close range. Ground combos and aerial strikes make this a go to for up close threats.\nBeam Sword used with the help of a few Muons.\n Beam Weapon: Graviton - A slow moving projectile that deals damage over time. Can be activated a second time to dash to its current location!\nUsing the Graviton Beam to reach new heights.\n Optional Powerups: - Find enhancements to Rubi's abilities hidden within the game. Upgrade the Particle Beam with splash damage, or power up your melee attack to cleave through enemy projectiles.\n Ability Tree: - Collect 'Strings', the building blocks of all things. Spend these as materials to synthesize permanent upgrades for Rubi along Mana, Health, and Attack paths.\nAbility Tree offers player customization\nEnjoy Non-Linear gameplay. Explore an interconnected world in your quest to save two worlds.\nGrow with Rubi as you level up, enhancing your playstyle. to increase your survivability and dive in with hard hitting melee slashes, or pepper the enemy from afar with ranged attacks.\nAccumulate skills and enhance your offensive and defensive maneuverability. Phase through hazards, double jump, and gravity-fling yourself across the terrain.\nBunches of Collectibles. Some are optional. Some are hidden. All are shiny.\nYou can pet the dog!\n And many more, to name a few:\n Evi and Mira Children - Evi and her friends are all without parents, but Rubi takes care of them at a makeshift orphanage. Rubi scavanges the tombs for artifacts, providing them sustenance in a world devoid of it. Evi  seems to take a bit too much after Rubi.\n Professor Einhoff and CERN Scientists - CERN was conducting experiments far beyond its means, relying on borrowed Casimiran Tech found crashed onto earth millenia ago. The two worlds are now entangled\n A sample of some of the creatures you'll encounter in your quest:\nCasimiran Bugs\nCasimirian Bugs are quickly populating Earth. Taking out their queen will limit their numbers.\n\nMuons\nA spectral presence made of pure mana formed around the elementary muon particle, it's attracted to machinery. They are able to form together as well as fuse with other objects.\n Casimiran Angler Toad\nOn Casimir, aquatic life has grown blind searching for Mana in dark caverns beneath the crust. This particular Angler has gorged himself on Earth's bounty and gotten stuck.\nFeral Humans\nHumans exposed to the Mana of Casimir. Corpses exposed to this energy gain life once more, but awakened to dormant DNA from millenia prior.\nCasimiran Defense Sentry\nIts circuits overloaded with unfamiliar Earth Mana, once a guardian of Casimir's last scientific stronghold, it now roams the giant chambers below the Large Hadron Collider.\nCore\nAmong the experiments conducted at CERN, one of the most important was harnessing mana as a power source. However, Life itself can't be contained\n And many more...\nWe've made some exciting rewards to show our appreciation for our backers!\nKey Art poster of Rubi (Design not final)\nCombination art book and game guide.

And, welcome!\nMy name is Jenna Moran, author and creator of Nobilis, the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG, and much of the Weapons of the Gods RPG, as well as a major contributor to a number of products for Exalted, Trinity, In Nomine, and other well-regarded RPG lines. You can generally find me on tumblr, where I'll be posting a bit of extra content now and then during the course of this kickstarter; I'm also on twitter, and my webpage is \"A Far and a Sunless Land.\"\nI'm here today because I want to give you something beautiful; something affirming. I want to give you something that can make you laugh and smile in the moment, something you can also carry with you into the more painful moments later on. I want to give you something to make your life better, if I can; ... if ... you'd like that?\nI want to give you the roleplaying game called Glitch.\nPLAY\n\n[transcript: \"What is a Roleplaying Game?\"]\nGlitch is a game about living in a broken world. A game about hope and struggle.\nIt's a game about people, people like you and me, more or less, people who were like you and me, until they stumbled on a \u201cglitch\u201d\u2014a lesion, a crack, an unfixable and irredeemable break in the fabric of reality; and that glitch broke them, in turn. And for a while, infected by the malice of the endless void beyond the world; for a while, their eyes made open to the true nature of the world, they thought that the answer, the best answer, the only answer, to that break was to end the world itself ...\n... until they realized that was dumb.\nNow, they solve mysteries!\nListen.\nYou can play Glitch for light fun and laughs. You can play it for an experience that'll get under your skin. (It's honestly like most RPGs in that way.)\nWhat the game's tuned for is mostly \"light-hearted fun, that can sometimes get quite real.\"\nIt's a game of stories, like most roleplaying games; a game of you crafting a story; so all that \"something beautiful\" stuff, all that \"something to make your life better\" stuff I wrote earlier: that isn't anything to do with whether you're having light fun or a deeply gripping experience; it's in the kinds of stories I want to help you to tell.\nIf any of that sounds like your kind of thing, just sign up for \"Electronic Fulfillment\" or \"Material Fulfillment\" (or, of course, for whatever you like) over to the right!\n\"If one genius exists and creates in the field of tabletop roleplaying game design, Jenna Katerin Moran is that genius. Her original RPGs NOBILIS and CHUUBO'S MARVELOUS WISH-GRANTING ENGINE glimmer like mirages high over the edge of the state of the art. Add to that her sparkling, even diamantine writing style, and the whole beautiful enterprise begins to seem kind of unfair ...\" \n-- Kenneth Hite, designer (NIGHT'S BLACK AGENTS, VAMPIRE: THE MASQUERADE 5e)\nSo, let's say you're interested in getting a new RPG today. And that's great, because I want to give you an RPG! \n... except, first, you might want to ask, why get mine?\nPLAY\n\n[transcript: \"Why buy my RPG? part 1\"]\nHere's my pitch:\nI've been writing RPGs professionally for twenty years, and I write my books for the purpose of delighting you. I'll do my best to produce good games, too, to build solid, innovative, and well-explained rules structures, but, from the beginning, I am here to delight you. To connect to you. To stir up something bright inside of you.\nThis particular book is based heavily on the work of mine that, pound for pound, seems to have brought the most of that delight into the world: \"Nobilis: the Game of Sovereign Powers.\" If you're not up for spending $120+ on eBay for a copy, a copy that will be physically beautiful but will have a rules set a decade and a half behind the times, you might want to get in on Glitch here, instead!\nAnd what'll you be getting if you do?\nYou'll be getting a book of a thousand stories that'll help you tell ten thousand more, a sweeping metaphorical tapestry of fictional setting, a heavily refined version of Nobilis' time-tested rules ... and a book that is itself a work of art. The kind of book you won't feel embarrassed reading on the bus. The kind of book you can leave out on your coffee table when there's company.\nThat's what I want to bring you, here, today.\nSupport my kickstarter. Let's make a miracle or two.\n\u201c\u2026 This is a roleplaying game. It is possibly the roleplaying game.  It is genius. It is horrifying. It is a beautiful balance of everything that would drive a story forward \u2026\"\n-- from the \"Kill Ten Rats\" blog review of my previous work, the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG.\nI'd like to tell you a bit about how the game works, now. \n... you in?\nFunctionally, Glitch is a \"diceless\" RPG. That means its rules system focuses more on resource allocation than on randomized results. That doesn't mean that it's predictable or mechanical or even particularly deterministic; it just means that it gets its unpredictability, not from dice, but from the players ... from the stew of collaborating and conflicting perspectives that you all playing it will bring unto both the story and the game.\nWhen you play Glitch, you'll be taking on the role of a character of your own creation. As you play them, you'll take actions premised on one of their five basic traits. On one of their four divine abilities, one of their four expressions of elegant and supernatural inhumanity...\nOr on their fifth attribute, which could be loosely understood as \"cope.\"\nWhen you take action within your character's means, it will be \"free.\" When you go beyond those means, there is a Cost. It's not a very big Cost, to be clear; pushing one's limits is sometimes healthy and sometimes unhealthy, but, just like people in the real world, characters will probably push themselves in healthy and unhealthy ways all the bloody time. The effects aren't bad at first, and they do have ways to deal with them.\nBut enough Cost\u2014piled up, with time\u2014can bring even the strongest person tumbling down.\nYou can think of this basic system, if you're familiar with it, as an improved and polished version of the system found in Nobilis.\nPLAY\n\n[transcript: \"Why buy my RPG? part 2\"]\nPhysically, the book is pretty much a pure homage to \"Nobilis: the Game of Sovereign Powers.\" That's the game that I mentioned before! I've been cribbing heavily from Carol Johnson and James Wallis' old layout for it, although I'm not in a position to go with the 11x11\" format they used; other than that, though! ... to the extent that this kickstarter supports it? \nI'm hoping to get as close to that book's somewhat legendary art and production values as I possibly can. That'll depend on all of you!\nIf you want that to happen, please back this kickstarter\u2014but more importantly, please spread the word to all of your friends!\n\"Jenna Moran's writings explore new perspectives on both the real and the unreal, resulting in enchanting and truly fascinating games. [...] Delightful and addictive.\" \n-- Genevieve Cogman, author of the \"Invisible Library\" series\nPLAY\n\n[transcript: \"What's the deal with the art in these video previews?\"]\nAs you've probably noticed if you clicked into any of the videos above (or, for that matter, below), I've gone ahead and done the layout and design work for this book in advance, including putting an awful lot of hours into the temporary art.\nI've done this because I want this kickstarter to offer a pre-release PDF that's already a cool thing on its own. I want interested sponsors to be able to order a print-on-demand copy almost immediately instead of waiting on the final art and the print run. I don't want the game that you're getting here to be a hypothetical or a printed-out Word .doc; I want you to be able to just sit down and play.\n... does that sound good to you too?\nAs a side benefit, if you're curious about what it'll look like, or what an RPG looks like, or what kind of thing this \"Glitch\" game will be ...\nAs of this writing, I'm still deciding between a couple of different cover formats, still deciding on the page background I want, and still finishing up the index; also, OK, I've already finished up a few things (page references and some minor fixes) since the proof I used in a few of these videos ... but mostly, you can just go take a look!\nPLAY\n\n[transcript: \"A Preview of Glitch\"]\nIf you want the pre-release PDF, here's what you do: just back at any pledge level except the $20 level ... or at any level at all, if the kickstarter's hit $50k!\nIf you want a print-on-demand copy of the pre-release book, that's easy too: just back at the \"Immediate Gratification\" ($50) level or higher! Also please, please make sure to read the details for Immediate Gratification when you are doing that so you don't miss that you'll be paying roughly an additional $28 plus shipping when the on-demand printing is done.\nSo, anyway: here's what this kickstarter's for.\nI want to do a limited edition print run of Glitch with quality paper stock, strengthened binding, and a bookmark ribbon! Tentatively I'm looking at 80# glossy white paper, Smythe-sewn binding with added joint glue, and a .25\" satin ribbon; these details may change if they don't work out very well. Or, if I learn about something that might work out better!\nI want to replace the art shown in the previews with bespoke art.\nAnd finally, I'd like to sell enough copies of Glitch to buy some new socks and glasses and, I dunno, a small landmass? Whatever?\nI'm not very particular.\nDo you want to help me get all of this done?\n\nOh! P.S., International Customers\nInternational customers should note that DriveThruRPG, my traditional distributor, has access to high-quality print-on-demand services on multiple continents, which can potentially save everybody a huge chunk of change on the shipping; as nice as I want the limited edition to be, please take a serious look at the print-on-demand option, \"Instant Gratification,\" as well!\nThat said:\nUPDATE! International shipping is now available for the limited edition.\n\"Jenna's [writing has] always been a masterful work of mythic prose. [...]\" \n-- Elizabeth McCoy, editor and writer for Steve Jackson Games\nStretch Goals\nSo the base kickstarter will allow for a print run. Here's the things that I'm hoping to add!\nA Bit of Polish - ACHIEVED!: at $30,000, I can start replacing some of the art in the pre-release and otherwise seeing what I can do to make things a little nicer before moving on to the print run.\nSharing the Wealth - ACHIEVED!: at $50,000, I feel like I can give the hardship level the final PDF and the \"show of support\" level the full pre-release PDF without hurting the kickstarter's momentum. That'll make me happy, and hopefully people at those levels as well! What do you think?\nArt Replacement - ACHIEVED!: at $84,000, I feel comfortable planning to replace all of the current art with high-quality bespoke art, completing an important goal for the book. (I will reserve the option to keep around 1-6 of the current pieces if that turns out to be the best choice, but I don't expect that I'll need it!)\nA Bit of a Pick Me Up: at $102,000, I'll add electronic versions of my novels An Unclean Legacy, Fable of the Swan, Stomping the World Round, The Storm that Saw Itself, and Vidar's Boot to the $30+ pledge level, as well as sending an electronic version of my short story collection The Island of Evil Chair (not otherwise currently available!) to sponsors at all pledge levels.\nBonus PDF: at $130,000, I'll add a PDF guide to Ninuanni naming customs to the $30+ pledge level (and make it available, at least to those sponsors, in print-on-demand.)\nSoundtrack: at $180,000, I'll get a soundtrack made for the game and distribute it to kickstarter sponsors. (Estimated $10-15k expenditure; my preferred composer was charging roughly $10k six years ago, but his prices may have changed or he may be too busy.)\nA Project History: At $225,000, I'll put together a video discussing the project's history and the construction of its traits.\nRenewal; Rebirth!: And, at $280,000, I'll get \"Nobilis: the Game of Sovereign Powers\" updated into a more practical 8.5x11 format that can be printed on demand; sponsors at the $40+ pledge level will get its new PDF and a voucher for an at-cost print-on-demand copy! ETA 2Q2022. ^_^\n\u201cThere is beauty here. Share it.\u201d\n-- from the \"Step into RPGs\" blog review of my previous games, Nobilis and the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG. \nPledge Levels\nAnyway, here's the list of things you can do to take action!\nThings Suck Right Now ($8): I want people who are in a tough place right now to be able to afford Glitch anyway. Is that you? This pledge level offers the ePub and the pre-release PDF\u2014basically, the PDF version of the book shown in the videos. If the kickstarter does really well, I can give you the final PDF too! If you're interested, click on \"Things Suck Right Now\" over to the right. (And, I hope they get better!)\nSupporter ($20): I want people to be able to test the waters of this kickstarter without going in for a full pledge of $30. Is that you? You can hang out, read the backer updates, pick up the ePub and (if the kickstarter does quite well) the pre-release PDF, and upgrade to $30 if you get caught up in the flow! Just click on \"Supporter\" over there on the right.\nElectronic Fulfillment ($30): I want to give people the PDF version of Glitch. A lot of people get the most value out of 8.5x11 books when they're in PDF form! Are you one of them? Then I have a beautiful ~420-page PDF for you, plus\u2014if we do well enough to replace some or all of the art\u2014another one, when the book is complete! Just click on \"Electronic Fulfillment,\" over there on the right. This level comes with an ePub as well!\nA Historical View ($40): I really loved Nobilis. I think that may have come through up above? I think you might love it too. Would you like to check the game itself out? At this pledge level, in addition to your copies of Glitch, I'm offering PDFs of \"Nobilis: the Game of Sovereign Powers\" and its first major supplement\u2014incidentally, available online for the very first time! I want to warn you that this edition of Nobilis is 11x11, which makes for a really awkward PDF, you probably can't curl up with it and adore it the way I do sometimes with my physical copies ... but it's the only version I have to give out at this time. Anyway, you can check it out now! Just click on \"A Historical View,\" over there to the right.\nInstant Gratification ($50+): RPG projects come with a built-in delay. Even when things go well, there's a gap between pledging and getting your game; when the art process or layout process goes wrong, it can take a lot longer! I want you to be able to start playing, with a physical book, in the first part of this year, so I've been working hard to build a print-on-demand pre-release. Interested? What I can offer you is two print-on-demand vouchers, one for the pre-release and one for the final book. Each of these will let you print a copy of the book, like the copies you see floating around on my table in the various videos, at cost\u2014that is, at around $28 over the pledge level, plus shipping. As for that shipping, it's likely that DriveThruRPG has a print-on-demand site relatively near you, wherever you are in the world, to make that shipping cost fairly reasonable, although if you're in the Antarctic or majestically circling the world on the back of a giant bird or whatever I cannot make guarantees. Anyway, if you're interested, just click on \"Instant Gratification\" over there to the right!\n(International customers take note! If you're looking for a print copy, this is probably the level you want; the final print-on-demand will likely be ready at around the same time as the limited edition, or even sooner, and shipping it to you is likely far cheaper. Again, just click on \"Instant Gratification!\")\nA Wish Come True ($75): Thank you for helping me make my wishes come true! If you're feeling generous enough to go this far\u2014are you?\u2014I'm up for throwing in electronic copies of my other major RPG, the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG, and four of its supplements (Fortitude: by the Docks of Big Lake; Fortitude: the Glass-Maker's Dragon; Fortitude: the Legendary 139; and \"Finding Home\") on top of the benefits of \"Instant Gratification.\" Just click on \"A Wish Come True\" over there on the right!\nMaterial Fulfillment ($75): I want to put a physical book in people's hands here. Something pretty. Something graced. A book we can be proud to own. Would you like to have a copy when I'm done? I think glossy paper, strengthened binding, and a bookmark ribbon are what the book needs to complete its general aesthetic. Now, I'm not planning to go over the top here, so this book won't be as unique for today (when there are a lot more genuinely gorgeous RPGs out there) as Nobilis was for its time ... but I think I can make something nice. Just click on \"Material Fulfillment\" over there to the right!\n(P.S. Material Fulfillment also includes the benefits of \"A Historical View,\" a print-on-demand voucher for the pre-release version, and free shipping within the U.S.!)\n**NEW!** International shipping is also available for Material Fulfillment, even though the immutable reward text that I can't change says that it isn't! It's +$45 to Canada and +$75 to everywhere else. If you're an international customer, and you want the limited edition, just click on \"Material Fulfillment\" and select shipping to your desired international destination, over there to the right!\nSpiritual Fulfillment ($90): Again, I'm going to have to stop and thank you, here, for helping to make my wishes come true. If you're feeling generous enough to go this far\u2014what d'you think?\u2014I'm willing to throw in electronic copies of the Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG and four of its supplements (Fortitude: by the Docks of Big Lake; Fortitude: the Glass-Maker's Dragon; Fortitude: the Legendary 139; and \"Finding Home\") on top of the benefits of \"Material Fulfillment.\" If you're up for it, just click on \"Spiritual Fulfillment' over there to the right!\nOut of This World ($108): I want to throw in something fun on top of all that to help hit a cooler-looking number than $90. \"108\" is a big number in both world mysticism and the rules of the game, so ... do you want a little fun thing, as well? I can give you everything from \"Spiritual Fulfillment,\" plus! a custom-built Ninuanni name for you\u2014\"Ninuanni\" being the language spoken in the void beyond the world, according to the mythos of the game\u2014based on (your interpretation of) the meaning of your own. Just click on \"Out of this World\" over to your right!\n(P.S. Sponsors are lower levels who really want a Ninuanni name can get one for +$18 too, if they like!)\nRetail Fulfillment ($180): NEW! I want to support brick & mortar retailers. Physical stores are an important part of the hobby, right? I also want to support the international retailer who contacted me who has a better way of shipping books overseas than I do, even though I don't know for sure whether they have a physical storefront. So I've decided to offer the standard retailer discount for a relatively small 4-book purchase, including all the kickstarter rewards from \"Material Fulfillment.\" Are you a retailer? Do you want to stock your shelves with a few copies of Glitch, complete with kickstarter rewards to hand out to anybody who buys one? Just click on \"Retail Fulfillment,\" over there to your right! (You can also add +50% or +100% to the cost and shipping of this pledge for a 6- or 8-book bundle, respectively.)\nCollector's Item ($225): So, I know some of you want unique things, things you just can't get outside of this kickstarter. Things that are rare and special. Is that what you're looking for? I can give you the pre-release book, of course; I'm not sure it's going to be available to anyone but my backers here once the art's been replaced. But I've also got something to give you that's a bit more unique. Over the course of building the pre-release version of this book, I've accumulated a small pile of proofs, each one a unique and strictly speaking irreplaceable artifact. Would you like one? In addition to the benefits of \"Instant Gratification,\" I can send a signed and unique proof your way! There are 8 of these available, and I can ship them to the U.S. or to Canada without additional charge. Just (while available) click on \"Collector's Item,\" over there to your right! Optionally, you can contact me and add additional funding to upgrade from the benefits of \"Instant Gratification\" to a base of some other level.\n(And, oh! Full disclosure: 8 aren't all that exist, I'm just scared something will happen to a few of them if I try to sell every last one. ^_^)\nDedicated Friend ($333): I want to give people the opportunity to play a bigger role, a more personal role, in making this project succeed. Is that something you want to invest in? I figure, if that's the case, I can certainly give you some behind-the-scenes access to the history of the project; I can cover any international shipping; and, in case what you're looking for here is the personal connection, I can get you a signed signature plate to put in the frontispiece of the book\u2014and, of course, sign the book itself if it passes through my hands! I'm hoping to get it straight from publisher to fulfillment to customers without having it pass through the bottleneck of my house and my hands, though, so that might not happen. Mostly, anyway, this is just the level to pick if you want to be a key part of making this happen, of helping me fund the project, hit the stretch goals ahead, and feel happy about the years I've poured into this book. You'll also get all the benefits of \"Out of this World.\" If that's what you're looking for; if a dedicated friend to the project is what you want to be ... just click on \"Dedicated Friend\" over there to the right!\nVIP ($1200): What if you want to go even further? What I'd like to offer here is a special mention in the book itself, a handwritten note of thanks, and a chance to talk with me about the game in (e.g.) email or in slack. If we're doing well enough ($50k+) that the concept of \"artists for the game\" is well-defined, I'd also like to commission a picture of your character by one of those artists, in the book's style, either to appear in the book, or in some later work, or as a promotional piece! (depending on the needs of the book and how the piece feels, itself). Of course, you'd get the Dedicated Friend perks as well! Now, it's still definitely the case that you'd be choosing this level to support the project and not for the benefits, but most of them are pretty hard to get in other ways! If this is what you're looking for, just click on the \"VIP\" section to the right!\nPublicizing this Kickstarter (Priceless): If you like the look of Glitch, if you think Glitch might be for you, if you aren't interested in Glitch but think someone you know maybe just might be, or if you think Glitch is just the most interesting thing that you've ever seen, please make sure to let people know about this project ... regardless of which level you pledge at yourself! \nIt matters, a lot!\n\nCredits\nThe music in the videos is by Damiano Baldoni:\n Andante in re minore (used in \"What is a Roleplaying Game?\")\n A Ghr\u00e0 (used in \"Why buy my RPG?

Alternate Payment Page\nIf you don't have kickstarter access, or showed up just a little too late, you can back this project at its alternate payment page for a limited time via paypal!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time working with a printer directly! Can you believe it? I've always had a publisher to intercede for me before. Here's what I'm doing to address my utter contextual naivete: I'm not trying to cut corners or margins, I've picked a reputable printer and a fulfillment house that a friend has had positive experiences with and I've basically doubled my budgets to account for disasters. I am honestly still expecting things to go terribly wrong but I am not sure how they can go so badly wrong that you won't get your books. It *looks* from the numbers like the absolute worst possible outcome was that I fund but make nothing, and that that's quite hard to do. Please feel free to cheer me on or send apropos advice!\n\nThe pre-release version is just a step or two from completion ... but did you know it takes 2-4 weeks to do a round of proofing, from the time I upload a new version to the time the book shows up in cardboard and plastic at my door? I think that I can probably just put in the index, make my final call on the background and cover, and upload it, and then the print-on-demand will be ready, but IN FACT, if something comes up and completing the pre-release PoD takes a few extra cycles, it might not be ready when the kickstarter's done. I still think 1Q2020 is an absolute lock in, but again, please feel free to cheer me on!\n\nIf the kickstarter does well, I'd like to include work by 10-12 artists. That's pushing the upper limit of my rolodex! Do you have any that you'd like to recommend? I haven't had a chance to pursue this actively yet, my process has been writing=>layout=>videos=>this, talking to artists only on those rare occasions when I've surfaced for air ... but getting 10-12 will definitely be a bit rough. If I wind up working with a smaller artistic team, that's ultimately fine, and in some ways beneficial; only, then, the art replacement process will take longer, and might go a bit beyond the projections above. Anyway, if you have any thoughts, please feel free to point me to available artists that you think would work well!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "Things Suck Right Now", "descp": "Things suck right now, and you can't afford the minimum buy-in.

Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!\nPetal Crash is a game by Tim Ashley Jenkins, creator of Grapple Force Rena, and features music by Michael Staple and dialogue written by Zack Morrison! If it's successfully funded, the game will be sold by GalaxyTrail, through Steam and the Google Play store!\nThe Game\nPetal Crash features a variety of game modes to suit the tastes and whims of a wide variety of puzzle game fans!\nSolo Play challenges you to score as high as possible within certain limits - Time Trial gives you a few minutes to make as many clears as you can, or Turn Trial challenges you to score well with a limited number of moves. Challenge yourself to set a new personal best and get the highest ranking you can! Each game mode is highly customizable, including a mini board option which is great for beginners, and a turbo mode to meet the needs of the twitchiest action puzzle pros.\nVersus Mode pits you against a CPU opponent or another player, racing to make clears and score hits in a tug-of-war battle. In this mode, building chain reactions will slam your opponent's board with garbage - nasty blocks which can't be pushed, and can only be destroyed by clearing blocks next to them. The rules are simple, but the strategy runs deep - do you make rapid clears to pull ahead, or take the time to set up chains to gain a persistent advantage?\nPuzzle Mode presents you with a pre-set game board, challenging you to meet a specific clear goal with a limited number of moves. Each character has their own 5x5 grid of puzzles for you to solve - start with the easy puzzles in the middle, working your way out to the tough ones at the edges and corners! If those puzzles aren't enough for you, a built-in Puzzle Editor lets you and your friends try to stump each other with puzzles of your own making, condensed into easily-shareable codes!\nStory Mode sees you through choosing one character to challenge each of the others in a series of increasingly difficult Versus matches. Each match is preceded by a dialog scene, and every character's story is unique. Winning a match increases the difficulty, while losing lowers it - challenge yourself to get the intensity as high as you can!\nThe Story\nPetal Crash takes place in the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire.\nEons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual:\nLilibri is a fairy who works as an independent scholar and historian, and keeps her own library - she bears the Sacred Blossom Lily, found in a hollowed out old journal, which she now keeps in a scroll case slung over her shoulder. She is cheerful and passionate about her work, if occasionally a little bit scatter-brained.\nStrelitz is a tiefling child and self-made delinquent who constantly strives to live up to his demonic heritage, in contrast to his laid-back tiefling parents. He holds the Sacred Blossom Bird of Paradise, his village's treasure, which he swiped for his own purposes.\nPenny & Deony are human twins who live on their own, practicing their trade as tailors. Not knowing their birth parents, they were left on a seamstress's doorstep along with the Sacred Blossom Peony. The energetic sister Penny has an eye for business and fashion, always trying promotional stunts to attract customers, while the demure brother Deony has great talent and patience for sewing, but is fairly shy and withdrawn.\nOre Kid is a free spirited dwarven treasure hunter who discovered the Sacred Blossom Orchid locked away in an abandoned mine. Unlike other dwarves, who tend to be insular and community-focused, Ore Kid is an independent wanderer, following her whims and little else. (Despite her name, she's actually a young adult - Ore Kid is a nickname which stuck.)\nDaize is a beastkin freelancer who ekes out a precious living, doing odd jobs in a city-state with a sharp wealth divide ruled by an aloof gentry class. His lapel pin is the Sacred Blossom Daisy, which he won in a bet. Despite suffering constant indignities, he always keeps a smile and hopes for the best, and is quick to help others in need.\nYosoti is a legendary centaur dancer, the latest in a long line of performers - all of whom shared the name Yosoti and wore the Sacred Blossom Forget-me-not during their performances. Confident and kind-hearted, Yosoti is adept at capturing eyes and hearts, but secretly harbors complicated feelings about their legacy.\nRosalia is an elven knight who gave an arm and an eye to protect a human kingdom. Though she was rewarded the Sacred Blossom Rose for her bravery, the kingdom she served slowly dissolved over the centuries, and is now a mere footnote in history, leaving her to contemplate her purpose alone.\nThe game's story mode will see your choice of character seeking out the rest of the Sacred Blossoms so that they might receive their wish, meeting and challenging each of the other characters in turn. The dialogue is all written by Zack Morrison, author of the webcomic Paranatural and various other short stories - check out their work! It's good!!\nFunding Goal\nPetal Crash is already very far along, with many of the modes fully playable! But it needs a bit of help to make it across the finish line.\nMusic - 50%: The biggest portion of the funding goal will be to commission music - the soundtrack is set to be composed by Michael Staple, who worked on Grapple Force Rena, along with other great indie game projects - check out his work here!\nOther Collaborators - 20%: This includes things like Zack Morrison's incredible character writing, Ruby T.'s gorgeous cover art, and funds to reward my puzzle-proffering pals for contributing to the game's built-in puzzle boards! (Special thanks to my pals Taxiderby, Will, Strife, Jill, and Heather for helping make example puzzles!)\nRewards & Buffer Zone - 15%: This includes the funds needed to print and ship the Kickstarter rewards - any money left over in this segment will help account for unforeseen costs and help support the game's development overall.\nFees - 15%: This includes Kickstarter's cut and other fees and taxes.\nStretch Goals\nNow that the project is funded, it's time to look forward - that means stretch goals! We hit the first few, and there's a couple more we can still reach!\n$10,000 - Unlockable Bonus Character - REACHED!\nIf we reach $10,000, I'll be able to put in the work needed to get an extra character put into the game - this character can appear in Story Mode as an opponent under special circumstances, and once unlocked (either by encountering and defeating them or by clearing the Story Mode with all other characters) can play through their own Story Mode quest as well!\n$11,500 - Extra Stickers by kokuhaku - REACHED!\nThe wonderful artist who drew my current profile picture, kokuhaku (who is @kokuuhakuu on Twitter) has offered to draw all the characters for a new sticker sheet!\nStill a work in progress, but they're looking good!\nIf we reach the $11,500 level, an extra sticker sheet featuring these adorable new drawings will be added for everyone who backed at the $40 level or higher!\n$13,000 - Mac & iOS Compatibility  - REACHED!\nIf the campaign raises $13,000, I'll have the resources I need to get my hands on all the hardware and licensing required to publish the game for Mac systems and for iOS devices via the App Store!\n$14,500 - More Music\nThe music budget currently accounts for a minimum of 15 tracks across the entire OST - if we hit $14,500, I can increase the music budget, bringing the number of tracks up to 20! This will mean more variety in the background music among the different game modes!\n$16,000 - Play as Penny or Deony individually\nIn the Story mode, Penny & Deony will always act together as one - but if we reach this goal, you'll have the option of playing as just Penny or Deony separately in the other modes, like Solo Play & Versus Mode! Each twin will be selectable individually as alternate costumes, getting their own set of unique animations for when they're on their own. This means two more playable characters!\n$30,000 - Nintendo Switch port\nThis lofty goal would remove the funding obstacle to a Nintendo Switch version - it's a long shot, but if there's a chance, might as well shoot for the stars!\nRewards\nIf you're up to help get Petal Crash ready to play, there's lots in store to reward your contributions! In addition to getting game codes for both the PC and mobile versions of Petal Crash, you can also get:\nEarly Access! The game's already in a perfectly playable state, and if you pledge $25 or more, you'll be invited to the game's closed beta to play the in-progress version of the game as it's being worked on! There's already tons to do, and you'll be in the best place to get your feedback and suggestions heard!\nPhysical goodies, including an 11\" x 17\" poster and a sticker sheet! The poster features all the game's characters in a sky-sea of blocks, and is drawn by the wonderfully talented Ruby T.! The sticker sheet features each character's portrait and a wide smattering of colorful flower blocks you can use to decorate to your heart's content!\nPledge even more and there's lots more rewards - including an original sketch of the Petal Crash character of your choice, an animated sprite cameo in the game's credits, and even the chance to have your own secret character playable in the game!\nThank you so much for visiting and reading - with your help, let's make a beautiful new game blossom together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFinishing the game is mostly a matter of getting assets done at this point - music, writing, character animations, backgrounds, puzzles, etc. - the base gameplay itself is basically finished and is a blast to play, so I have every reason to believe things will go smoothly!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Pre-order", "descp": "You'll get codes for both the PC and mobile versions of Petal Crash on release!\nINCLUDES:\nPC game code\nAndroid game code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["117 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "You get the game, and you'll be featured in the game's credits as a backer!\nINCLUDES:\nPC game code\nAndroid game code\nName in credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["136 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Closed Beta Access", "descp": "You'll be able to play the in-progress version of the game, starting shortly after the campaign concludes!

Another note about the console versions - Petal Crash's Puzzle Editor has a system for compressing puzzles into shareable codes, which was designed while the game was still PC and mobile only - but this method doesn't really work on consoles, so rather than delay the game further while we work on a cross-platform solution (and get the platform holders to approve it), the console versions aren't going to launch with puzzle sharing, though they'll still have the Puzzle Editor fully functional otherwise."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Petal Crash is coming in August - and for consoles too!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Reward surveys sent!

By upgrading your magic, any way forward is right in this non-linear adventure game full of exploration.\nCustomize how you play - With our upgrade system you can choose how you want to play - Explorative, offensive or strategic. It\u2019s your choice! \nExploration is rewarded - Don\u2019t leave any stone unturned, the world of Alwa is filled with secrets and finding them requires you to explore and solve puzzles \nA non-linear experience - Combining exploration and different item upgrades allows you to find your own way through this adventure \nLooks and sounds amazing - Enjoy crisp pixel-art combined with modern effects as well as a soundtrack made by chiptune extraordinaire RushJet1 \nA challenge awaits - Quick reflexes are needed to navigate through the many challenging rooms and with easy-to-change settings anyone can enjoy Alwa\u2019s Legacy \n An interconnected world with many branching paths (We guess some would call it a Metroidvania)\n Massive background parallax artwork by pixel artist Vierbit \n Many dungeons that each has a unique look and design and of course lots of bosses (attack their weak spots)\n A skill tree that would put any RPG to shame (Not really, but we have 16 upgrades)\n Chip music soundtrack with 25 tracks made by chip artist RushJet1(1001 Spikes and PewDiePie\u2019s Legend of the Brofist etc.)\n Modern sound design by Joel Bille (Ghost Giant and Fe by Zoink Games/Electronic Arts)\n Full controller support and layout for all common controllers\n Accessibility and gameplay settings to easily change up the difficulty level\n A talking pig NPC (pettable of course)  \nExplore a large interconnected world in any way you want\nAlwa's Legacy is set in the world of Alwa and the game will start with the heroine Zoe waking up in a strange land. She doesn't know where she is and she doesn't know what land this is but for some strange reason everyone and everything seems very familiar. It's like she's been here before, but can't remember. Why is this?\nSuddenly a figure appears, an old lady almost struggling to walk comes up and talks to Zoe. Her voice is strong and she says: \"Zoe, you have been sent here to save us. You might not yet realize it but you are strong and you'll grow to be the hero we need. Quickly, make your way to the Town of Westwood and come find me. There I'll share more\u2026\"\nThe heroine Zoe has been sent to the land of Alwa\nIn Alwa's Legacy you use your magic staff to move across the land, you'll solve puzzles, traverse through dangerous dungeons and defeat many enemies along your journey to save the land of Alwa. We have striven to create a main protagonist that's relatable, strong and with great movement skills. It's a breeze to swiftly make your way through the game. Exploration and freedom are other design pillars we had and in Alwa's Legacy you'll find an adventure that's fun to play, exciting to explore and discoverable in your own way! \nZoe is fast, versatile and can use her staff for both fighting and to solve puzzles\nAlwa's Awakening\nEverything started about two years ago with the release of Alwa's Awakening. An 8-bit adventure that was extremely well received and resulted in us being adventurous enough to do this indie development as a full-time job. There's no need to have played Alwa's Awakening in order to enjoy Alwa's Legacy. They are both standalone experiences and can be enjoyed separately (although we'd be absolutely stoked if you get both) \nOur first game, Alwa's Awakening was met with a lot of praise\n Check out our website to find out more about Alwa's Awakening. \nThe story of Elden Pixels started in 2014 when lead designer Mikael was hanging out with a bunch of friends and after a whole night of drinking beer and playing video games he blurted out \"I should make my own game! How hard can it be?!\". Turns out, pretty hard but it was all worth it because in 2017 our team of four launched Alwa's Awakening which turned out to be a small indie success and has since been ported to Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In early 2018 we thought to ourselves \"Let's quit our day jobs and make a living making indie games, how hard can it be?\" Turns out it was quite hard but almost a 1,5 year later we're almost finished with our second game Alwa's Legacy. \nWe did actually show the game to two different publishers last year but our heart wasn't really into it and inside we thought to ourselves \"Let's fund the game ourselves, how hard can it be?\" Well, turns out it was really hard and now we have an almost finished game but we're lacking the final resources to finish and release it so that's why we're turning to Kickstarter and our community to help us push the game over the finish line! \nHow we looked when we started making indie games\nHow we looked when we realized there was no more money\nCheck out more hot developer pics on our website https://eldenpixels.com/ \nAlwa's Legacy is a collaboration between a bunch of talented people. And that's how we think game development should be, a bunch of creative minds that work together to create something magical. Here's the Elden Pixels core team. \nMikael Forslind - Game Designer and all around idea guy for Alwa's Legacy. Has released a bunch of games during his years at Image & Form and Zoink Games but he still feels uncomfortable to refer to himself as a game developer. Secretly dreams of being able to speed run Battle Kid 2 and Dark Souls. @MikaelForslind\nIsac Degerborg - Programmer that started out as an intern but we quickly understood he knew a lot more than all of us so we quickly hired him before any other company could. Spends his days programming but does occasionally dabble in the art of design as well. @IsacDee\nAlexander \"BG\" Berggren - Our pixel artist who spends hours after hours putting all the pixels together into cool art. Lives in the rainy city of Bor\u00e5s and sports a wicked beard and old man\u2019s cap which makes him look smart and sophisticated. If you rub his forehead you'll be granted a wish. @BG_Pixlarn\nRobert Kreese - Kreese dabbles in different areas of game development and mostly helps us with QA and business stuff. Loves to get way too technical with details about fps, pixels scaling and player movement. Has a ridiculously expensive monitor and each week he gives us a report about how the latest build performed. @RobertKreese\nExternal Team\nThe Elden Pixels core team is the lovely folks that primarily will be working on finishing Alwa's Legacy but a game the size of this requires a bigger team than we've had on our previous game so we hire these talented people to work with us.  \nOnly sent out 32 tweets but managed to gather over 5500 followers all due to his amazing pixel art. For Alwa's Legacy he'll be creating all the background art as well as the bosses. @vierbit \nThe Town of Westwood is one of the first places you'll visit in Alwa's Legacy\nCentral Alwa is the hub that connects the entire world of Alwa\nMonk's Mire - All good games should have a murky swamp area\nChiptune artist that's been making sweet tracks for ages. Previous games worked on are 1001 Spikes, PewDiePie\u2019s Tuber Simulator and Legend of the Brofist and many more. For Alwa's Legacy he has composed a soundtrack with over 25 chipmusic tracks. Take a listen to a few of the tracks down below. @RushJet1 \nA modern retro game requires some modern sound design. His latest contribution to the arts of video games was his work with award-winning game Ghost Giant as well as Fe published by Electronic Arts. @JoelBulle\nWe worked with Manuel for our previous game and he's not only a genuine nice person, he's a very talented artist who just recently worked with renowned studio WayForward. For Alwa's Legacy he'll be responsible for the cover art as well as the limited art prints available for in some of the tiers. @samoloinc \nManuel Samolo is responsible for the key art for Alwa's Legacy\nWe'll also have some good help from our current intern Markus Frykberg who's been helping us a bunch with a number of different tasks including making our sweet announcement trailer! We've been working on Alwa's Legacy for 1,5 years and we also wanted to give a proper shout-out to Kevin Andersson who was the lead programmer for the project from start up until August this year. Give him a follow on Twitter to follow his new developer adventures! \nWe've previously released games on all bigger platforms - Steam, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 so that\u2019s something we\u2019re planning for Alwa\u2019s Legacy as well. We\u2019re already approved as developers for Valve, Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony and ever since the first day we ever wrote a line of code we planned for different version so the porting process should be as smooth as it can be. Just recently, we approached GOG and our goal is to release there as well. \nWe aim to have Alwa's Legacy on all these platforms\nLaunch Platforms\nRight now we're focusing on finishing the game and making sure it runs beautifully on both Steam (PC/Mac/Linux) and Nintendo Switch since we\u2019ll be launching there first. Since we\u2019re a small team we feel that launching on too many platforms can be too complex so we want to focus our strength on the platforms we know best - Steam and Switch.   \nAlwa's Legacy already runs beautifully in 60 FPS on Switch both handheld and docked\nHere are descriptions of all the rewards we can offer. Besides the obvious Digital key to Alwa's Legacy you can also get our previous game Alwa's Awakening, some Kickstarter exclusive signed art prints, a t-shirt and a bunch of other digital rewards!\n March 2018 - We started building the prototype for Windows/Mac\n May 2018 - Vertical slice was ready and we had a good understanding of how the game was going to be. Game also worked on Switch\n March 2019 - Basically everything we wanted for the game was implemented and you could play the game from start to finish (very rough though)\n August 2019 - Reached a proper alpha and all levels, bosses, enemies, rooms and functionality was in the game\n November 2019 - Kickstarter launches \n Spring 2020 - Game launches on Steam (PC/Mac/Linux) and Nintendo Switch \nCreating a room requires a lot of work and styling\nAlwa's Legacy is almost completely done but we need YOUR help to make it a reality and raise the last money we need to get us across the finish line and release the game into the wild. We can't stress enough how much we need your help to make this happen! We also think it seems like a great way to work really close with the community which is something we've also done the past and we'd love to do even more going forward.\nWe\u2019ve always been firm believers of paying people properly, and that\u2019s why everyone working on this project has a proper salary and everyone that ever contributed to the project in any way is credited. Salaries are by far our biggest expense and that\u2019s where the Kickstarter money will primarily be going.\nHere's a breakdown of what we're going to spend the money on: \nEveryone on Kickstarter loves pie charts\nStretch goals are something we'd love to do and we'll announce them as we progress further into the campaign. We have some really cool things lined up and we're excited to hear what our community wants us to do! Further ports? More content? A pirate ship DLC? What you can do now is help us reach our campaign goal, as soon as we're about to reach that we'll announce our news! \nThis GIF has nothing to do with any stretch goal. We just think it looks cool\nAre you just like us and you spend your days anxiously scrolling through social media in an everlasting search for something new and exciting? Then you should give us a follow! We'll post about game updates, office pics and cat videos. Just like social media was meant to be! Give us a follow now.  \nAll the cool kids nowadays are using Discord and so are we. On Discord is also where you can find the Beta Backer channel so if you want to have a chance at having your input on how the game will come out, grab that Beta Backer tier and join the discussion today! But whatever tier you grab or if you just want to hang out, our Discord is open for everyone so come by and say hi! \nWe don't have a cool URL for our Discord so we're hiding that with this cool banner\nSince we're into stuff that are retro we also have a good ol' fashioned email newsletter. Head over to our website to subscribe! Make sure you're not missing out on any of the upcoming news!\nAre you press and want to cover Alwa's Legacy? You can download the press kit, which has pretty much everything you need. Or you can head over to our website and check out the sweet press page we set up. We're also available for interviews and follow-up questions if you reach out to our lead designer and marketing person Mikael Forslind either via email or Twitter. He's quite a talker so don't be afraid to shoot him some questions. \nBefore you leave, we wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for visiting our Kickstarter page, hopefully we peaked your interest enough to support us but if not, we still think you're great! Feel free to mention us to a friend or a co-worker and share our Kickstarter in social media! That would mean a lot. Thank you for being awesome! \nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter page! If you can support we'd be so thankful!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking video games is always risky but we're certain we\u2019ll finish and release Alwa\u2019s Legacy.

This isn\u2019t the first game we\u2019re releasing and our team consists of members that have released games on all bigger platforms before.\n\nOur first game was quite a success and we\u2019re committed to making Elden Pixels an indie game company that\u2019ll be around for many, many years to come.

Switch and Mac versions will be available on 2020 when the game releases.\n Twitter/Discord/Steam/Presskit \nOur project has been fully-funded!  That's awesome! but we still have some cool and dreamy Stretch Goals that we would love to archive. Check them out below!\nEndless Memories is an epic 2D action-adventure set in the magical world of dreams. Within each dream, you'll explore incredible scenarios with its own story full of challenges, monsters, and mysteries to solve.  \nSet in the world of dreams, Endless Memories takes you on a journey through an interconnected world in which we blend the Metroidvania aspect and RPG systems of \u201cCastlevania\u201d games such as \u201cSymphony of the Night\u201d combined with a loot system out of a rogue-lite game and a fast and responsive combat seen in action games like \u201cDead Cells\u201d.\nYou can explore the mind of the dreamers and discover new different worlds. With these new worlds come different societies with their own culture and lifestyle, new power-ups that will open up your path through the different dreams.\nFeatures\nTightly tuned controls. We put a lot of dedication into controls and platforming parts of the game so you can jump, dash and slash your way through even the most deadly challenges.\nExplore a vast interconnected world within each dream: from a dark cave to a killer toy factory. Each dream is different from the other, with their own story, characters, and mysteries to solve that will help you get into the core of the dream and save the minds of the Dreamers.\nOpen up your path with the help of Ancient Glyphs. These Glyphs will help you traverse the world of dreams with ease, improving your mobility and combat abilities; become a lighting bolt and travel through electricity; increase your energy to stomp the floor, and break through the ground and enemies.\nFind your own style by combining magic, long-range, and melee weapons with a unique system of Memory Runes. These runes help you evolve your play-style further by providing passive abilities that can improve or completely change your desired play-style. Mix and match your runes to improve stuff like your magic abilities, increase the number of kunai you can shoot, get extra defense with a magic shield, and many more crazy combinations. \nRPG Elements. To make Endless Memories feel and play like the RPGs we love, we added a level and stats system, loot with random rarities, side-quests, crafting, cooking, all sorts of debuffs like freeze and poison, and of course flying numbers! \nThe main feature of Endless Memories is its fast-paced and satisfying combat. We have put a lot of effort into this part of the game, not only for it to look and feel great but also for it to be fun. \nYou can dash into melee action combat with swords, axes, daggers, and many more. Control your enemies from a distance using long-range attacks like bows and arrows, cast an explosive meteor from the sky to destroy your enemies with magic, or you can combine all of them into your unique style of combat. \nExplore all the different dreams and get deep into the core of them to confront the Dreamers face to face in Epic boss battles to free them from their own minds. \nIn the Laboratory of Dreams all minds, ideas, dreams, and memories are connected. You are Rem, an adventurer that lost all his memories and is trapped in the Laboratory of Dreams, where the only way out is inside the mind of the sleeping Dreamers. \nIn the search for of all your lost memories, you will find that you are part of a greater mission to free the minds of all the sleeping consciences. You will have to delve deep into the Dreamers' minds to find answers for yourself and free them from their deep sleep state.\nEndless Memories is composed of 8 completely different dreams interconnected through the Laboratory of Dreams. Within the lab, we can go into each of them. The deeper you get into each of the dreams, the more they connect. \nInside these dreams you will find many friends and others not so friendly. These characters can help you with some helpful advises, rune crafting, forging new weapons or enchanting your favorite ones with some element or random properties. \n\nThe Rune Master\nMemories Runes are his thing, he is fascinated by them. Bring him the ones that you don't like and he will make you new ones. He also likes gold so he will sure have some special runes on sale for you.\n\nThe Enchantress\nIf you are more into magic and elements, this is your person. She can boost your magic abilities, enchant your weapons with elements or give you a whole new set of properties to your weapons. \n\nThe Dreamsmith\nHe has hands made of steel, and he doesn't like using hammers at all. If you are looking for some damage boost or a shiny brand new weapon, make sure you visit his workshop and he will make that dream come true. \nDreamsmith forging a new weapon\n\nTemple of Memories\nFighting Captain Croig inside his lair\nToy factory\nApocalyptic Future\nWe have a vast cast of enemies that will challenge you through your journey into the dream world. We took advantage of how different the dream worlds are to come up with exciting and unique enemies.\nHere are some of the bosses you'll encounter!\nCaptain Croig\nRuler of the frogs. Croig is not like any other frog, he is a captain but also a king. He controls the thunder and has the simple task of stopping you. He know what Rem is capable of becoming and he will make sure you don't get pass him.\n\nN-28\nShe is the leader and one of the last members of the infamous  D.H. mercenaries. She is renowned for her great revolver skills. It is said that she has never failed a shot.\nN-28 became the leader of the mercenary group after the nano war ended. They specialize on robbery and all kinds of misdeeds. \nQueen of Cwenburg\nShe is a queen and a warlord. She has control over the kingdom of Cwenburg and most of the surrounding forest. Her kingdom has been in conflict with the creatures of the forest for many years. \nThe Queen possess the power of the sacred essences. These essences grants her the ability to control the elemental spirits of the forest.\nEndless Memories has been in the works for around 3 years but the idea started way earlier than that. It has always been our dream to develop a game that people can enjoy!\nWe are a team of two: an artist and a programmer, but we also do music, write the story and make our own effects at home, but all this takes time that can be used mainly on game development.\nThat\u2019s why we need the Kickstarter and your support! We know US$12,000.00 is not enough to develop a project this big but it is the minimum amount needed to give us the push to keep working on the game.\nWith the extra funds, we can hire musicians, voice actors, include new exciting features and boost the development time by working on the game full time. Also, Kickstarter is an awesome place to build a community for Endless Memories and, to get feedback and suggestions to improve the game.\nWe want to make Endless Memories the best game ever and we know that with your support and input, we can make it possible.\nThank you in advance for your support!\nHomunculus Games is a two brothers' studio of Robert and Hamilton Rufino. We have been making games since we were kids, from mobile to small ones just for fun to play with friends. We always had the vision of creating a big game like Endless Memories in which we can portray all our ideas and knowledge gathered from a lifetime of loving and playing video games. \nInteractive statue in-game", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games takes time and a lot of work plus, we are a small team of two and that alone is a big challenge!\n\nBefore bringing the game to the community, we spent a significant amount of time working on the game's most risky and challenging parts to have the majority of the game working. Endless Memories is a big game, and we hope that the small demo we put together serves as proof that we are working really hard on this dream of ours!\n\nThis campaign means a lot to us! It will not only ensure stability to finish the game but will also give us a push to continue putting energy and love into this dream of creating a game that everyone can enjoy.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Dreamer", "descp": "Get a digital copy of \u2018Endless Memories \u2018 the game, a digital illustrated manual, and, for showing your amazing support, your name in the credits!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital copy of the game (PC / Switch).\nDigital game manual on PDF.\nYour name in the credits!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2020"}], "stat": ["152 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Ascended Dreamer", "descp": "Get all the previous rewards, plus access to the beta, a map of the Dream World and a copy of the soundtrack!

Once you have succeeded, creatures will join your battles as you explore the far reaches of the world. \nFeeding favored foods fosters fruitful future friendships\n        Each creature you add to your team brings their own strengths. With 50 to choose from, how will you build your dream team of creatures? A balanced and deliberate group? A single overpowered bat? Or how about an army of loyal BEES?\nThe bees have been released\n         The number of creatures you can have at one time depends on their strength, your skill in handling them, and how strong you yourself are. Here's a small sample of your future companions!\n        The Amphibole is a giant frog usually found lazing around cool water sources. A fully mature Amphibole has mastery of controlling its body; it will not hesitate to crush its foes with its massive size.\n        This flying creature, although weak and cowardly by itself, becomes more and more dangerous as others of its kind join the fight. Weak as it may be, it has a lot of potential and can stand up to many great foes with proper training and diet.\n        The Nokobo is a creature of resilience. Stories are told of how in exchange for being stripped of flight, the Nokobo was given legs that could tear through the thick hide of a fearsome Pelliat.\n        No stranger to the dry deserts of the world, the Canvulf circles around its prey and when it finds an opportunity it lunges in for quite a nasty bite.\n        The Bep is a giant insect that wanders around looking for food sources. Its strength lies in its small size and agility, effortlessly dodging attacks.\n         Befriending creatures is all fun and games until you run into chaotic forces like the infected, deadly constructs, hostile elementals, and the undead which will attack you on sight. Fight back with your combination of befriended creatures, arsenal of weapons, and weapon skills.\nWho doesn't love a good shield reflect?\n         All creatures have strengths and weaknesses that will test your ability to adapt and prepare. Skeletons for example are weak to blunt damage, like your fists, and resistant to piercing damage, like a spear. Use the strength of stinging bees, crushing frogs, and slashing birds to help customize the way you play!\nSlash, pierce, and blunt damage have different effects on creatures\n        With many combinations of creatures testing both your preparedness and adaptability, the fast paced nature of combat will make it important for you to change strategies on the fly. Using the item ring, you can quickly use items and change which weapons are equipped to your three weapon slots.\nTry not to enjoy the slow-mo too much\n        You can learn weapon skills by training with creatures, which allows you to use your weapons in unique ways. Access a shield dash, shield throw or all its other skills using a combination of moving forward, a modifier button, and the assigned button for the shield.\n        Yes, you can farm for food to prepare for your creatures, but what is unique to Creature Keeper is the Pocket Garden, a portable 5x5 magical grid which you can use to plant seed tiles that you find on your adventures. Seed tiles come in many sizes and shapes and grow into not only food ingredients, but also buffs, equipment, items, consumables, creature parts and more!  \nI wonder what this seed tile will grow into?\n        No need to go back to town to manage your crops in the middle of a quest - your pocket garden is always by your side. With limited space and many options to choose from, what will you grow in your pocket garden?\n        Each creature has their tastes in food and finding out what they like makes it easier for you to befriend and raise them. Cooking brings out the raw potential in your ingredients while letting you combine flavors to match the tastes of your creatures. Eating cooked foods yourself gives you some nice healing and buffs too.\n        Start cooking with basic lv1 recipes to level up cooking skills like meat, vegetables, oven, glaze, sauce and more. Cooking enough with the same recipe unlocks more complex lv2+ versions. Learn more recipes by eating new foods and becoming inspired from mastery in certain combinations of cooking skills.\n        In Creature Keeper, you become stronger by learning about new creatures and logging them in your Bestiary. Raising or fighting creatures earn you unlock points to level up their Bestiary Entries. Points can be spent to unlock that creature's descriptions, resistances, drop rates, and more, including player stat upgrades and weapon skills!\nMake sure you get his good side\n Creatures of the land are suffering from a strange sickness, going berserk, attacking people and other creatures alike. For many years, stories linked the cause to curses, the wrath of gods, war, and even cautionary children's tales. From these stories, one stands out of a hero who traveled the world with creatures by his side. The hero was able to talk to creatures and even stood before mighty dragons.\n        Many adventurers have been inspired by tales like this, including yourself currently on the road of a dark rainy night. Your story starts as an unknown form with a vicious aura slowly emerges from the shadows. Just before you can ready your sword to parry, a wicked force destroys it, turning your feet to run for your life. As the shadow closes in on you, a glint emerges ahead from the thick curtain of rain.\n        You chase the light and as you reach out to grab it, the earth disappears from under your feet. The warm brightness turns to sunshine revealing a towering tree bursting with pink flowers; rock sculptures; and sounds of calm flowing water. A ragged scarecrow with a giant pumpkin head perks up, fumbles around putting on a welcoming face, \"Welcome to- Wait... Where are we?\" \n        A warm pulse pulls your attention to a mesmerizing pink crystal in your hand, brimming with unknown energy. Who is this talking scarecrow? Why are creatures going berserk? Does the hero that speaks with creatures really exist? Answers to these questions and many more wait for you in the world of Creature Keeper.\n          Hey everyone, Fervir here (@blankthevidya). Seven years ago I first got interested in gamedev, starting with a distant ancestor prototype to Creature Keeper. I didn't know how to program, draw, compose, and design, but now I do all of those things, and more. My bread and butter is pixel art and animation and I helped ship my first game, Tangledeep, crafted with love, early last year.\n        I love every aspect of game development and I'm proud to show off Creature Keeper to the world. I've always been interested in mechanics, combat especially, and Creature Keeper is the result of many \"Holy S***\" moments, polished to create maximum fun. I always strive to learn and improve, and hope to create a beautiful game that feels great to play!\n        As a one person team, a successful Kickstarter gives me the option to work on my game Full-Time from now until its completion; otherwise, I'd have to find part time gigs, setting back the release.

You can read more about that here!\n> Press & Streamer Demo Access <\nChicory: A Colorful Tale is an adventure game about a dog wielding a magic paintbrush! Use the power of art to explore, solve puzzles, help your animal friends and restore color to the world. \nThe Brush is a one-of-a-kind artifact that can color the world. Naturally, it needs a wielder, a master artist responsible for all colors and for passing the brush down. The current wielder, Chicory, is immensely talented and beloved by all... until all the color in the land vanishes, and her with it! I guess that leaves it up to you, her number one fan, to take up the brush and fill in for her. Hmm... good luck!\nExplore the Picnic Province, and draw on anything! \nManipulate the environment with your paint and solve puzzles! \nUnlock new paint abilities and use them to reach new places!\n Collectible clothes, plants and furniture to dress your character and the world how you want! \n  \"Between the gorgeous pastel artwork, cheeky dialogue, unique gameplay  mechanics, and the way that everything blends and works together to form  a distinct experience, I\u2019m inclined to believe that Chicory just might be something truly f*cking special.\" - Destructoid\n\"Chicory might be the next big indie title to shake the scene and I say  this because the final moments of the preview surprised me in a way that  I haven\u2019t felt like since Undertale.\" - COGConnected\n\"I was delighted to see that Chicory has the same level of charm and technical quality that Wandersong had while still being very distinct. It felt as if I were moving around  a coloring book... from the slushing sound of the paint to the woodwind  instrumentation of the musical score, Chicory felt fully artistically realized.\" - DualShockers\n\"[I] have no way to pretend I didn\u2019t love it to bits.  There\u2019s a sense of playfulness running through every line of dialogue...\" - Hardcore Gamer\nIn the game you explore freely from screen to screen and use your magic brush to draw on anything and color the world as you see fit!\nBut it's not all fun and games. A dark forest is growing at the edges of the realm, sapping color from the land and causing all kinds of problems for the populace of the Picnic Province. As the new wielder, you're unfortunately responsible to handle that too. You'll have to venture into dark places, and confront what lies within...\n???\nOn the plus side, these tribulations will strengthen your bond with the brush, granting you new paint abilities! These abilities will let you explore to farther and newer places--think like a Metroid-style powerup. The first ability you get will make your paint glow in the dark, allowing you to explore dark places like caves!\nSome creatures find your paint quite tasty!\nThe world and the things that live in it will respond to your paint in all kinds of unique and unexpected ways! You can expect to encounter many playful interactions and little puzzles as you explore from place to place.\nThere are many secrets to uncover...\nAs you explore, you'll meet many characters who might need your help or want you to draw things for them! Most of these little requests are completely optional, but helping characters might unlock more opportunities later, or net you sweet new clothes.\nThanks, whoever left this!\nFor players who want to go the extra mile exploring secret areas and helping characters, there are many clothes to find and collect! You can customize your character's clothes, colors and hair to look exactly how you want. \nA small sample of the different styles you'll find!\nAnd for players who REALLY go the extra mile secret-hunting, you'll find brush styles! Brush styles are like extra tools, shapes and styles your painting can take to create new effects and expressions. Some work like stamps, placing a pre-made shape on the screen. Others add new texture or flavor to your drawings. There are even rumors that somewhere out there, there are people who will help you design your own brush styles...\n[WARNING: EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE!]\nLater on, you'll also be able to exchange certain collectibles for furniture and plants! Of course you can put them in your character's house, but you could also choose to place them anywhere in the world! Start your own little camp or garden in your favorite places. Who knows... if you make a spot that's nice enough, other characters might appear there too!\nThere are all kinds of things to find and fun side-quests to do! We're enjoying hiding secrets everywhere to reward players who want to poke into every nook and cranny. :) \nChicory is a hugely popular, charming and talented artist beloved by just about everyone (but especially you). Her artwork is ostentatious and captivating... but she put so much focus into it, she didn't leave much time for making friends. Equal parts magical and mysterious... wherever she's disappeared to, hopefully she's OK.\nYou play as Pizza! You can name, dress, color and gender yourself however you like, but your character comes with a bit of a personality. You're Chicory's number one fan, and devote yourself as a loyal custodian in Chicory's tower. Until Chicory disappears, leaving you to take up her brush and fill in! Despite your lack of confidence, you do your best to make things right for everyone!\n Blackberry was the wielder before Chicory, and essentially her teacher. She is excellent at everything she does, and has little patience for people who can't keep up. Where most wielders only hold the title for a few years, Blackberry did it for decades without choosing a successor. She's a little bit scary.\nPlus many more characters to discover! We can't wait to introduce you to everyone you'll meet on your adventure!\nPS- if you want to make your own card, here's a blank template: https://imgur.com/a/SNVDeVS\n The original soundtrack is going to be composed by Lena Raine, acclaimed composer on Celeste and Guild Wars 2, among many more! She's approaching Chicory with a style that mixes classical-sounding instruments with modern-feeling structure. She's already released a preview album of the soundtrack! \n> Listen to Chicory: An Afternoon in Luncheon here! < \n (Or check out the sweet samples below!)\nThe land where the game takes place! Picnic has a lot of unique customs. Everyone is an animal named after food.Foods in Picnic are all known by different names--coffee is \"joe,\" donuts are \"holeys,\" pizza is \"slice,\" etc. It's also common to hide your old clothes in gifts for others to find, rather than throwing them out--so if you go exploring, you're likely to find clothes everywhere. Don't worry, it's sanitary! And more importantly, it's a keen way to recycle.\nA map of Picnic! Of course, you can draw on this, too.\nIt's a colorful province (or it was, anyway)... bustling with towns and cities like Luncheon, Potluck and Dinners. There's also lots of natural beauty to appreciate, like the Sips River, the Teatime Meadows, Gulp Swamp, and, uh... hmm. Some kind of spooky haunted forest? That wasn't here before. Let's try to ignore that.\nThis is fine.\nHere are some of the cool things we're making as part of this campaign!\n\"Sketch Artist\" and Above:\nThe original sketch of our key art! For everything you see here, there were tons of process sketches and drawings like this to make it.\nA Digital Art Book, full of promo art, sketches, concepts, unused characters, notes, and other loose ends from our creative process! We LOVE collections like these and are  excited to put one together ourselves! :) \n\n\"Bedazzler\" and above:\nThis is a digital proof, so final product may vary\nThis backer-exclusive enamel pin, designed by game artist Alexis Dean-Jones and produced + shipped with the help of the Yetee! There are 2 points for this pin to fasten with so it's extra-stable, and so you can angle it any way you like! Put the brush next to a stain on your clothes... it's an amazing cover-up!\n\n\"Screen Printer\" and above:\n A sticker sheet of in-game characters designed by game artist Alexis! They're black and white and bold as heck, so they'll look great on any surface!\nThis is a digital proof, so final colors + design may vary slightly once printed!\nA backer-exclusive t-shirt, designed by game artist Madeline Berger! \n\n\"Graffiti Artist\" or \"Virtuoso\":\n Your art in the game! Your black-and-white drawing or writing could appear in an art gallery, scratched on a tree, as graffiti on a wall, a picture in someone's house, or somewhere else! We're excited to fill Picnic with your drawings, messages and ideas =)\n\n\"Portrait Painter\" or \"Virtuoso\":\nWe'll draw you an animal portrait! Immortalize yourself, your friend, your pet or your OC as a character in the style of the game. Makes a great avatar!\n\n\"Fashion Designer\" or \"Virtuoso\":\nYou can design a piece of clothing that can be collected and worn in-game! Make your mark in Picnic's fashion world and show off your style! Your clothing item could be in a common, easy-to-find gift, or it could be a deeply hidden secret item... \n\n\"Fan Artist\" or \"Virtuoso\":\nYour character will appear in-game! We'll make an animal character based on you, a friend, a pet, or something original... and place them in the world of Picnic as a character you can meet! We'll work with you to make someone who fits into the world & that players will remember.\nGreg Lobanov (@theBanov) Director, designer, programmer, writer. Greg has made a myriad of indie games over the last decade or so, including Wandersong, Coin Crypt, Phantasmaburbia, and many others. He really likes making things that are silly and colorful and story-driven, and one time he rode his bicycle all the way across America. In Picnic, he would be a dog named Curry with a goofy style.\nLena Raine (@kuraine) Composer. Lena is best known for her award-winning composition in Celeste and Guild Wars 2. She's also a talented designer in her own right; she self-published the interactive novel ESC, worked as a designer at Ubisoft, and has written several novels. In Picnic, she'd be a red panda named Marzipan with a soft style.\nEm Halberstadt (@emaudible) Sound Designer. Em has been the visionary (audionary?) sound designer behind a number of high-profile indie games including Night in the Woods, Wandersong, Untitled Goose Game, Ikenfell, and many more. She brings a totally unique voice, texture and joy to her audio, all of which set her projects apart from the crowd. In her free time she really enjoys camping and nature walks. In Picnic she'd be a flying squirrel named Egg with a wild style.\nAlexis Dean-Jones (@musclewing) Character artist, animator. Chicory is Alexis' first game project! Previously she's worked on designs and storyboards at Slap Happy Cartoons in Canada, as well as freelancing for years before that in Australia, where she grew up. Alexis is experienced at animating for short films and deeply loves animals, especially birds. In Picnic she'd be a hyena named Biscuit with a friendly style.\nMadeline Berger (@fungalmatters) Environment artist. Madeline has worked mostly in comics, making a name for themself with their unique wobbly linework and dreamlike writing. They're a big fan of plants and the natural world. In Picnic, they'd be a shrew named Shroom with a wiggly style.\nWe already have a lot of progress on the game and are confident that the idea will work, is fun, and can grow into something special. To get a picture of where we're at, refer to the progress report below!\nThe game is currently playable for many hours... the story is planned out and progress has been consistent for quite some time. Everything we've shown publicly and in the trailer is playable in the game right now, and there's a quite a bit more than we haven't shown yet, including some of the most exciting parts. We can't wait to show you more!!!\nSo much hard work and talent brought together so you could do this\nWhile we do have a lot done, we have even bigger ideas about what we want to do with the rest of the game! Here's a few things we can do with funding.\nMost of the team worked up until now as a contractor, and/or as a side project to their day job. With more funding we can focus on the game full-time together!\nMore platforms! Taking the game to consoles and other devices takes a lot of time, effort and money which we simply couldn't afford all on our own. \n Chicory is a game all about art, so we'd be excited to collaborate with more artists! We already have a some ideas for this which we don't want to spoil :)\nLive music performance! We've been working with Kristin Naigus, who performed recorder and english horn on the tracks in the EP. We think these performances add a LOT to the songs, and we want to expand on that!\nAs an open exploration game full of characters, we inevitably are going to have a substantial wordcount... and a substantial number of people who want to see it translated! We'd love to translate the game to other languages with your help!\nWe had a really positive Kickstarter experience with our previous game, Wandersong. Talking directly to backers is really energizing for us, and we enjoyed getting to build that relationship over the course of development--it can be hard when you're making a story game, which doesn't otherwise lend itself well to Early Access or extended beta testing. With Chicory, and a larger art team, we're even more excited to collaborate with backers and fill the game up with your ideas and creativity! (In other words: Alexis is REALLY excited to draw you all as animals).\nFinally, we really wanted to make some cool merchandise with the Yetee, and a Kickstarter was the perfect opportunity to produce some and collect pre-orders. :) \nIf you're excited about the game but don't have the means to back us right now, that's OK! Our favorite thing you can do to support us is to wishlist us on Steam!  \nPhew.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks! Especially when it comes to games, nobody's mastered the art of knowing when a project will be done--there are SO many moving parts, and therefore so many ways things can go wrong. Unexpected delays and obstacles will certainly come, especially when you're trying to push your own creative boundaries (which we are).\n\nThat said: We're a team of award-winning developers with a number of successful games already released, including two titles that were Kickstarted (Wandersong and Phantasmaburbia) to satisfied audiences. We feel we have a good understanding of this project's scope, and production is already very far along.

Extra funds are needed to do more ports and languages! \nVivid! Twitter for various Vivid updates!\nJoin the Vivid Discord! (be respectful) \nVivid Demo! (Windows Only) \nLucasMaxBros Website! \n\n-What is Vivid?- \n\n             Vivid is an action adventure platformer where you use colors to dictate how you fight. You can jump and stomp on Colored Blocks or enemies to change colors. Then summon forth an arsenal of weapons or powers based on your hue. Use these abilities to solve puzzles or get the upper hand on enemies in combat! You'll play as Vivid, a young girl who unfortunately lost her color. Nevertheless she leads an interesting life in her home land of Paper Craft, whether it's fighting off terrifying and amphibious wizards... or walking her dog, Spirit! And most importantly, she doesn't let the fact that she's different and doesn't have color get to her. \nWe take inspiration from series like Kirby, Castlevania (Classic and IGA), Paper Mario, The Mighty Switch Force, and many more. There is a wide variety in stages as well as open world areas that you can explore to your hearts content! We are hoping to make the game accessible to all sorts of play styles. From slow methodical approaches or speed running.   \n  We even have an early build you can play right now on Windows:  Vivid! Demo \n\n-The Stories- \n\n             That's right! Vivid is more than one single adventure! There are over FIVE different adventures awaiting you in the land of Paper Craft, and they all have something different for you to experience! One story you may play as Vivid, but in another, you'll play as Spirit the Dog! And you'll even be able to use both in certain adventures! We can't tell you everything, but you'll start off with only two stories you can play through. As you progress, the rest will be unlocked. The first two stories are dedicated solely to Vivid and the other to Spirit. This way you can learn how to play as both at a good pace! \nIn Vivid's story, she'll have to go on the chase to rescue Spirit \u2013 dog napped by the bully, Slam Jim! You'll go through a linear set of stages all in an effort to defeat the giant punching bag. \nAnd in Spirit's, a terrible wind has blown away all of her favorite toys across the land! You'll have to search through different levels at your leisure to recover them \u2013 some being a bit tougher to find than others! \nThis and many more grander adventures await you, should you be up for the challenge! And perhaps discover the mysteries surrounding Vivid's lack of color and the sudden appearance of the Colored Blocks...\n\n-The Characters- \n\n            Meet the star of the show, Vivid! \n \n             Since she was very young, Vivid has had no color. For years, the only colorful things about her have been her cheeks and charming personality. But that wasn't always the case. Due to her colorlessness, she's had issues making friends and even developing physically. At only 14 years old, she's short for her age, terrified of deep water, barely says a word, and is very shy. It wasn't until a special dog entered her life that things began to change. During an accident where Vivid fell into river rapids, a white dog appeared and rescued her. Following her ever since, she named the dog Spirit. The two became the best of friends, and over time they both discovered a secret power within them; Color Magic! A power that lets them manipulate color into tools or forces of nature. Together the two have gone on countless adventures exploring their home land. Whether it's for buried treasure, hijacking ice cream trucks, or finding a nice spot to cool off in the blistering summer heat.   \n\nSpirit the Dog! \n \n             Spirit is a mysterious dog, seeming to come out of nowhere at the right moment to rescue Vivid. Perhaps that's why she was named Spirit; cause she was watching out for Vivid. And ever since then, she still does. Though that's not to say Spirit doesn't get herself into trouble, which is often. Her excitement is easy to see in the wag of her tail and in the speed of her run. Unlike Vivid's Color Magic, which summons forth weapons and tools, Spirit uses the elements of nature to help out. From fire, lightning, and even wind, she can manipulate nature to get around. Super useful when playing fetch!   \n\nSlam Jim the Bully! \n \n             One of the first major foes you'll face, he dog naps Spirit for no good reason! Perhaps it's due to the fact he's not very bright and only knows how to fight. What a jerk! But perhaps all he needs is a friend... \n\n\n            It's the Hoppin\u2019 Mad Warlock, the Toadster! \n \n             This amphibian is easily angered by the exploits of Vivid and Spirit. He owns an entire fortress for various magic research, including the study of the recently appearing Colored Blocks. Regardless, that doesn't stop him from trapping Vivid and Spirit inside his castle, hoping it would teach them a lesson for intruding on his property when they tried to trick-or-treat at his door.\n             \u2026.Needless to say it would turn out to be the biggest mistake he ever made. \n\n\n-The Game Play- \n \n             Vivid is a game that has been in development for a few years now and we've been tweaking the engine little by little, seeing what works and what doesn't. Our hope is to make one of the best platforming experiences you'll ever encounter and love to come back to time and time again. There is still a lot that needs to be implemented that we are excited to include. \n             As the name suggests, the game is primarily centered around color. Being a certain color gives you advantages and disadvantages to just about any situation. Attacks, Platforming, Defense, Powers, and Puzzles. All of them are affected by your current color; Red, Yellow, or Blue. The Colored Blocks you see lying around can give you color by landing on them with a move called Downward Spiral. Just hold DOWN while in the air and STOMP! Blocks that are transparent can be walked through if your color doesn't match, which means you'll need to switch colors to take advantage of blocks being physical or transparent. \n \n             Then there's S.C.A.B (Same Color Attack Bonus). When you fight enemies, if your attacks share a common color with the foe, you'll do DOUBLE damage! So a Red attack will do double damage to a Red enemy. And Blue and Yellow attacks will do double damage to a GREEN enemy, since Blue and Yellow mix to make Green. But just remember that SCAB also applies to yourself. Enemies that hit you with similar colors will do double damage to YOU! So there's a bit of a risk involved; do double damage and risk losing more health? Or halve the damage you take while doing less to enemies? \n\n             In addition, enemies attacked with similar colors yield Color Energy. You can find these scattered all over levels too. Collecting them will fill your Color Boost Meter, which can be used to activate your Power Pins! You can equip Pins to one of your Color Slots and activate one depending on what color you are, so long as you have CB energy to do it. There are a variety of Pins you can unlock, ranging from healing, making you faster, or even wiping out the entire screen of enemies! Just remember to choose which ones you want when entering a stage. Careful planning leads to success! \n\n             It's also important to consider the properties of the weapons Vivid uses. Red, Yellow, and Blue Weapons all have abilities to them that are best fit for certain situations. Red ones are typically short ranged but have great control, making them good for movement. Yellow attacks are horizontal projectiles that are good for taking out opponents from afar, though limited vertically. And Blue Weapons are vertical, allowing you to take out pesky enemies you can't reach too well. Spirit also has differences, though she is built with speed and platforming in mind more than combat. Her abilities involve getting over hazards quickly or reaching areas you couldn't normally get to easily. \n \n             And if that were not enough, your color can also influence many objects you interact with! From riding red wind to jumping up blue waterfalls, there are many small details like this that you may find while playing. Understanding that your color can influence what you interact with can lead you to many secrets! \n\n             There's also a Score System that's used to give you a Rank at the end of a stage, alongside how fast you clear it. Ranks, besides being a flashy keepsake, are valuable because they act as a multiplier for the money you earn at the end of a stage! Bronze, Silver, Gold, and even a really hard to get Platinum Rank can be achieved to earn you extra Money. Said earnings can be spent at the shop to buy Weapons, Balloons, Power Pins, and even Health or CB Upgrades! Getting good ranks early can be excellent if you want to buy certain items earlier than normal. \n\n             As for the levels themselves they are formatted differently in each story. Some levels are mostly linear, requiring that you complete it before going to the next stage. In other stories there are no levels but rather open world areas that you can explore freely. There you'll find Save Stations to save progress and switch out weapons and the like. Beyond that, each story has differences you'll need to keep in mind to give you an edge while playing. Like whether or not you're using Vivid, Spirit, or both. Some stories you can swap between the two freely, while others you cannot due to plot reasons. \n\n             Finally, there are Balloons. You can choose to equip one at the beginning of a level. Having one gives you small perks, like doing extra damage, doing a lot more damage but only while a certain color, making certain Power Pins cost less, etc. There will be a wide variety of Balloons you can buy throughout the game to compliment your play style! Or perhaps you just like the design of the Balloon and having it float around. \n\n             These are just some of the things that'll be in the final product. There will be a great range of collectibles, Extra Challenges, Achievements, and unique Bosses to find. We hope to make this one of the best experiences a game can give you... which is to be fun!\n             We also understand that there's quite a bit to this game. Don't worry! It won't all be introduced at once. New elements will be brought in as you play so you can learn and grasp the various mechanics. By the end you'll have full mastery of Color Swapping! \n Backer Rewards Explained:\n  Note that all the rewards are color coordinated! Grey, Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. \n\n GREY: We appreciate any form of support! \n\nPURPLE: When the game is about to be released, we will email all those with a digital poster at full resolution AND a second new wallpaper to celebrate the release of the game! This new poster will include some enemies and bosses that'll appear in the game. So if you don't want to be spoiled, we'll make sure to hide it safely when it's sent! This tier, along with higher ones, will all give you a chance to enter your name or a legal and appropriate pseudonym when the credits pop up at the end! We will contact everyone who's involved if they wish to do this or not have their name in it at all. And all the names will be color coordinated to the color of the tier they backed!   \n\nBLUE: A Digital copy of Vivid for Windows PC! A key will be sent to you upon release. Should other versions of the game be possible before release, we will notify you and ask which version you'd like. We will also update the page should you wish to back more money and get extra copies of the game! \n\nGREEN: Access to the Full Soundtrack to Vivid upon release! Provided to you all by the three star composers:  ForteFortissimo, MelonadeM, and Scooblee! With over 50+ tracks planned and a mix of old-classic 16-bit with modern tastes, it'll be a must have for anyone who loves video game soundtracks!\n\nYELLOW: A PDF Instruction Manual for Vivid! A short guide on how to play the game along with some secrets and tips, all hand drawn and illustrated by the creator, Luke! \nRough Example:\n\nORANGE: Beta Access! Every couple of months we'll send out special copies of Vivid with some early versions of levels and items for you to try out, giving you a chance to help us by testing Vivid before it ever releases. You may even get to fight special bosses before anyone else sees them! \n\nRED: Face or Object to represent you in the background of a level! We will contact you not too long after the campaign is over, and you can give us either a picture of your face or an image of an object, such as a basketball, a lemon, or a skull, etc. So long as it's appropriate and legally possible to show, we'll use it. Then we'll draw it in the style of Vivid and place it some where in the story! Where it'll be is up to you to find out, so keep your eyes open! These background objects you send may even hide a small item inside! \nRough Example:\n\nSILVER: Design a Balloon! Shortly after the campaign we'll contact you and ask what the Balloon will look like and if it has any sort of perk to it. The Balloon must be appropriate and legal, and the perk it gives will have to be balanced for the game (So no +10000 attack Balloons). Once that's discussed and an agreement is settled, the Balloon will be drawn and put into the game as an item you can unlock! \n\nGOLD: Design an Enemy! Specifically, a simple enemy. We won't be making anything that does 10 different moves and has extreme AI planning. But we'll certainly design an enemy of your description and balance it accordingly. We'll discuss it in a meeting on Discord and even draw concept art until we get a desirable design working and implemented! \n\nPLATINUM: Design an Optional Boss fight! We already have all the Bosses for Vivid planned out, but we do have room for a few extras. The boss will have no story relevance most likely but we'll allow you to custom make a whole fight! The only deal is that it can't be overly flashy, as you'll only have one health bar to work with. We will allow up to two phases for the fight! We'll discuss it on Discord when the time comes to implement your boss into the game, how it'll look, and so forth. \n\n\n-Questions- \n\nWho are the LucasMaxBros?\n             LucasMaxBros formed in 2018, but the actual name and group has been around for years. We're just some folks who love video games ever since we first picked them up. Now that we've grown up into adults, we're finally getting a chance to show our passion for game creation. \n\nLuke Rossback \u2013 The Founder of LMB and Creator of Vivid! He's responsible for a large chunk of the development of the game. Programming, Art, Design, etc. He is passionate about game design and just wants to make unforgettable experiences and stories for the world to see.

The money will be used to cover the costs for music and getting new hardware and software to help with sound design or replacing equipment that's beginning to break down. Just to reiterate: The goal of $8500 USD is what is needed for completing the game on the Windows platform in English. But we are more than willing to make the game for other platforms and languages if we get more money! Just understand that doing so also takes time and has its own risks involved. \n\nHow can we trust this game will be delivered?\n             LMB believes that Vivid is a game worth making and is pouring all of their effort into it. It will take time and there will undeniably be some bumps on the road for us. We have no reason to waste our efforts on something other than our project, especially since we want to do nothing but create experiences for people to enjoy. Even without the funding, we hope to find a way to make the game a reality! \n\nRelease Date?\n             Currently, it'll take less than a year before the game is finished. We have an engine built and have had many people test it. Even so, completing the rest of the assets alone will take some time. But more importantly, we wish to polish this game into a gem. It will take a significant amount of time to make sure the game is balanced into a near-perfect platformer that we wish to deliver. If it takes longer than expected, we will inform you and make sure to keep everyone updated on the situation. \n\nPlatforms?\n             As it currently stands this game will only be released for Windows PC. That doesn't mean there won't ever be other ports, and we hope to do so! It's just a matter of money and getting the hardware to do it. We will update our page if the potential for ports such as Mac/Linux/PS4/XboxOne/Switch is within the realms of possibility. So make sure to back the game and spread awareness if you want Vivid on other platforms! \n But do note: even if we did receive money to make a port, that doesn't instantly guarantee it can be made. If for some reason we are declined from making a port for a system, we will let everyone know. And assume any ports will come after the PC version unless we say otherwise. \n\nLocalization?\n             Vivid is a game that mainly tells its story through visuals and game play. That being said, there will be dialogue and character bios and stage lore you can learn about. You do not need this to enjoy the game, but we will try our best to get other languages should we have the money necessary. Our ultimate goal though, is to just get the game made at the very least.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame Development is always a source of unknowns, especially when it comes to polish and technology malfunctioning. We are using most of our free time to make this experience come true, but even so, that alone isn't enough to complete this project. The game will have to go under thousands of tests before we think it's even close to ready. And that sort of polish takes time. We are going to do our best to deliver this game by Fall 2020, but snags happen all the time. That is why we've come to KickStarter to obtain funds; so we can finish Vivid faster. We have an entire list of people helping us throughout the world, talking to them just a few clicks away. It is only due to this that Vivid is where it's at and how it's going to get finished.

Dive into her subconscious to take on the surreal nightmares she wrestles with. \n\nWe're three game developers that left behind traditional development to make a game that is fun, deeply replayable and has emotional resonance. We find the games we gravitate to the most strike a chord on multiple levels, interconnected in both gameplay and storytelling, and that\u2019s what we plan for Dreamscaper. \n\nPLATFORMS\nAs we're a small team, we're focusing our efforts on a PC release first. We're also targeting additional platforms down the road (Nintendo Switch is planned and hopefully PS4, and Xbox One at a later date). With your help, those can be a reality much sooner! \nAdventure through haunting dreams to discover secrets, vanquish nightmares, and upgrade your gear all while uncovering Cassidy\u2019s story.\nBattle nightmares and make the rush of permadeath your ally as a multitude of surreal items, and an ever-changing world make Dreamscaper replayable over and over again. \nLive Cassidy's waking life - forge friendships, build relationships and learn more about the world around her to bring new hopes and memories into her next dream.\n\nYou'll explore both the waking and dreaming worlds  - your actions in one affect the other.\nWaking\n Build Relationships -  Meet the people around Cassidy and empower her with their hopes and memories to dispel the darkness of her nightmares. \n Unlock Stories -  The further you make it into your dreams, the more you'll learn about Cassidy and her story. Choices you make as the story progresses influence your dreams. \n Earn Upgrades - Progress in the Dreamscape allows you to forge friendships, unlock new weapons, items and powers that will help you once you fall back asleep.\nDreaming\n Confront Nightmares - Face Cassidy's nightmares to help her see the dawn.\n Explore the Dreamscape - Gear up and build your dream powers as you see more of Cassidy's subconscious.\nDreamscaper features a rich combat system that rewards skilled play. Use careful positioning, exact timing and quick reflexes to defeat foes with an abundance of combat options.  \n\nGET UP CLOSE\nEach weapon class in Dreamscaper is unique, from rending the earth below your nightmares to whipping a yo-yo into their faces. You'll have a myriad of options to approach combat.  \nUse devastating primary and alternate attacks to dispatch nightmares - send them flying up into the air, careening into a wall, or slam them into the ground. \nPut on some boxing gloves and weave through attacks as you drop her nightmares to the mat\nCassidy grew up on a steady diet of games, action movies, and comic books.\nAs you explore you'll encounter weaponry (and not-so-weaponry) from her life that's been pulled into the dream.\nCassidy was pretty big into Yo-Yos in middle school\n\nKEEP YOUR DISTANCE\nDon't like it up-close and personal? Ranged weapons allow you more freedom to overcome the nightmares.\nBlast enemies away with finger guns, fry nightmares with laser eye beams, and rattle skulls with soccer balls. Cassidy has an arsenal to discover in her dreams. \nHARNESS DREAM POWERS\nCassidy uses Frost Fracture to put her nightmares on ice, and with a snap of her finger, shatters them and freezes the playing field\nWarp the Dreamscape around you with \"Lucid Powers\" - surreal dream attacks and abilities that manipulate the elements, warp space, and even control time itself.\nDream Rush - slow time to give yourself the edge\nEVADE AND DEFLECT\nCassidy's nightmares are vicious, so you're armed with all the tools to handle them. Shields and footwear allow you to dodge, weave and deflect enemy attacks. \n\nWAKING\nHOME\nCassidy\u2019s apartment is the player\u2019s home base, a reprieve from the intensity of the dreams and a space to dive deeper into the narrative.\nAs players progress and as Cassidy's character grows, this space evolves with them.\nREDHAVEN\nVenture through the town Cassidy lives in, Redhaven. You'll find locals to make friends with at bars, parks, gyms and more. \n\nDREAMING\nHOMETOWN\nThis is where Cassidy grew up, she often dreams of the home she left.\nAs players learn mechanics, they\u2019ll explore some of Cassidy\u2019s most cherished memories and learn why it meant so much for her to have left it.\nCITY\nCassidy's new home. The adjustment for her has been challenging. \nShe feels isolated and lost amidst a very different world than she's used to. Her dreams become a reflection and amplification of this.\n\nCAMPGROUND\nThe calm before the storm.  \nThis memory of her childhood spent adventuring in the woods with her family lets players look into Cassidy\u2019s world and history before everything is upended as her dreams begin to take on a more nightmarish form.\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVER A HIDDEN WORLD\nExplore ever changing Dreamscapes and discover lost memories, surreal scenery and a multitude of unique events, challenges and puzzles.\nAs you venture through the Dreamscape, you'll find:\nChallenge Rooms\nPuzzle Rooms\nEmpowering Shrines\nRestorative Ruins\nStory Vignettes\nMerchants\nChallenging bosses\n\nGEAR UP\nIt's dangerous to go alone.\nDreamscaper features a plethora of weaponry, abilities and items to give you the edge you need to take on Cassidy's nightmares.\nSpecial modifiers and rare items add depth and variety as you plunder through the dreams, allowing you to create unique character builds that encourage strong synergies.\nAs you make progress in the Dreamscape, you'll earn Sand and Glass to unlock powerful upgrades, new weapons, items and more. \n\nDiscover and do battle with the deadly shades and bosses that invade Cassidy\u2019s dreams, clearing the dark miasma that surrounds her.\nChallenging foes will push your skills to the limit as you learn their patterns and unravel the mystery behind their appearance.\nEach shade represents a different emotion that Cassidy is struggling with. From anger to anxiety to hopelessness, her feelings take form as deadly nightmares that overrun her once peaceful Dreamscape.\nEach boss in Dreamscaper is a representation of one of Cassidy's most negative emotions that she struggles with throughout the game.\nBosses not only have emotion dependent looks, but unique attack patterns that are also fashioned after these feelings.\nInsidious and cunning, Isolation exists between dreamspaces, waiting for the moment that Cassidy can be totally separated from all that comforts her\nPLAY\n\nMysterious, hulking, and inescapable, Fear follows Cassidy through the Dreamscape, dwelling just below the surface, ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm her\n\nA dark, malevolent force, Loss rips apart her memories in the dream world - \u201cI will take away everything you hold dear\u201d\n\n\nPlay as Cassidy, a quiet, young woman lost in her own daydreams.\nShe struggles with a move to a new city away from her support network; she feels more lost than ever. Even her dreams have changed.\nA chronic underachiever, Cassidy is witty, sardonic, and opinionated with a strong moral compass. A natural introvert, she enjoys time on her own - anything that can take her to another world. Now shiftless and indecisive, Cassidy is dissatisfied with the direction she's heading - a malaise hangs about her life lately and she feels more lost than ever.\nShe used to love dreaming, escaping to far away lands and fond memories. Now something feels strained - dark thoughts have been invading her sleep. Although concerned and anxious about it, she doesn't know who to reach out to or how to talk about it.\nAn unexpected tragedy sends her tumbling down a dark hole that she struggles to get out of.\nUnravel Cassidy\u2019s story as you plunge through her subconscious, meet people in the real world and discover dream vignettes. \n\n\n\nWe would not be able to deliver the experience we wanted players to have without the help of an incredibly talented musician. \nWe got Dale North involved very early on in production - as fans of his fantastic work on Wizard of Legend, we're thrilled to be working together to make sure Dreamscaper is as fully-realized as possible. \n\nDYNAMIC SOUNDTRACK  \nAll music in the dreams have a duality to them. While exploring, players can expect a more thoughtful, introspective experience - allowing them to fully take in the Dreamscape. \nWhen confronted by nightmares, the music ratchets up to a pulse-pounding crescendo, complementing the intensity of combat. \n\nUNREAL BOSS TRACKS\nDreamscaper features killer boss tracks - befitting of the haunting emotions that Cassidy is struggling with. As the bosses are manifestations of Cassidy's mental state, each boss track is inspired by one of Cassidy's own emotions.\n\n\nAFTERBURNER STUDIOS\nFeeling burned out in traditional game development, Rob, Ian, and Paul left it behind in the summer of 2018 to follow their dreams and build an indie title they could call their own. Through this, the idea for Dreamscaper was born; a very personal project, drawing inspiration from childhood favorites and focusing on an emotional through line confronting depression and mental health. Afterburner Studios was then formed in the summer of 2018.\nPRESS\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/18/dream-diving-roguelite-dreamscaper-enters-open-alpha/ \nhttps://www.alphabetagamer.com/dreamscaper-alpha-sign-up/ \nhttps://80.lv/articles/dreamscraper-game-dev-in-ue4-shaders-and-animation/ \nhttps://www.indiegraze.com/2019/06/19/interview-dreamscaper-dev-team/ \n\nBecause we need you! \nAs a team of veteran developers, we are confident we can make a great game.

Stories, watched actual play videos, or just think roleplaying games sound like a lot of fun and you want to give them a try, Magical Kitties can be your first step into a larger world.\n\n\nMake Magical Kitties a rock star on social media and help people discover the amazing world of roleplaying games! When we reach ANY of the milestones listed above, we'll unlock the next Social Stretch Goal. We've already unlocked upgraded character sheets and a digital wallpaper pack for all backers! Go here for detailed instructions on how you can join the team!\nThe $25 STANDARD EDITION is the version of Magical Kitties Save the Day you\u2019ll find in retail stores next year. It includes everything you need to play the game. \nThe $50 DELUXE EDITION is packed full of high quality component upgrades (wooden tokens, custom dice) and a bunch of bonus content, including the Power Cards. Most of the physical rewards from stretch goals unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign will be exclusive to the Kickstarter Kitties receiving the Deluxe Edition.\n\nPlaying Magical Kitties is easy. When your kitty is trying to do something difficult, you\u2019ll build a pool of six-sided dice with:\nA number of dice equal to the attribute you\u2019re using (Cute, Cunning, or Fierce)\nAn extra die if you\u2019re using your Talent\nTwo extra dice if you\u2019re using your Power\nThe Game Master sets a difficulty (a number from 3 to 6) and then you roll your dice pool. Each die that rolls equal to or higher than the difficulty is a success. The number of successes you rolled determines the outcome:\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, it\u2019s not just a question of whether or not you succeed: It\u2019s about how you succeed. The complications and bonuses generated by most outcomes will drive the action forward in unexpected and exciting ways! You and your friends will be discovering the story together!\nThe core story of Magical Kitties Save the Day is right in the name: You are magical kitties. You have humans. The humans have problems. You need to use your magical powers to solve their problems and save the day!\nWhen you open your copy of Magical Kitties Save the Day, sitting right on top will be a copy of Magical Kitties & The Big Adventure, a solo-play graphic novel adventure illustrated by Garth Graham. This action-packed comic book is also a full scenario! Within moments of opening the box, you\u2019ll be able to create your magical kitty and go on an amazing adventure that will also teach readers of all ages how to play the full game!\nIn Magical Kitties Save the Day, one player \u2014 known as the Game Master (GM) \u2014 has a very special role. They describe the world in which the magical kitties live to the other players and, when the kitties take action, they use the rules of the game to figure out what happens next. Magical Kitties also includes \u201cMagical Kitties & The Game Master\u2019s First Adventure.\u201d Just as The Big Adventure will walk new players through how to play the game, \u201cThe Game Master\u2019s First Adventure\u201d will walk first-time Game Masters through how to run the game for their friends and family.\nIf you\u2019re a roleplayer with years of experience, Magical Kitties makes it easy to introduce your friends and family your favorite hobby. But if you\u2019ve never played a roleplaying game before, Magical Kitties Save the Day makes it easy to try something new! Between The Big Adventure, \u201cThe Game Master\u2019s First Adventure,\u201d and the Kitty Tips! you\u2019ll find throughout every book, it\u2019ll be like we\u2019re right there by your side the whole time.\nTablestory purr-sents Magical Kitties Save the Day.

While designed to evoke the 90's JRPG flavor, we have incorporated adventure and platforming inspirations as well as modern design innovations to the genre.\nThe King of Garbagia has been trashpicked! Disgraced squire Dustin Binsley is blamed for the kidnapping and must embark on a mission to clear his name. Cross the Lands of Fill, uncover hidden secrets in the trash, and expose the evil organization trying to destroy the Kingdoms of the Dump!   \nA narrative based game with a quick moving story and interesting world \nJumping, climbing and other on-field skills to add to exploration and navigation\nNo random encounters\n Turn based combat with a tileboard grid encouraging placement and movement \n Timed hits! (Press a key during the peak of attack animation for a critical strike)\n Quickly toggle between main characters to make use of their field moves\nA large Mode-7 inspired World Map. (Travel by land, sea, and air)\n SNES-inspired visual aesthetic with detailed environments and expressive sprites.\nToo often RPG environments seem to become mazes of hallways, forked paths and dead ends. We aim to bring some more fun to navigating the dungeons and areas themselves with the following elements:\nYou can jump freely, up ledges, ontop of NPCs and over enemies, on trampolines and moving platforms. You can fall/drop off of things. (No paths being blocked by a single rock that your character could easily hop right over.) \nNot only does this add more expressive movement, but allows for all kinds of secrets and fun environmental elements. It's not a full-on platformer by any means, but adding a nice bit of verticality gives depth to the level design. \nQuickly and painlessly toggle between the characters to change who you are controlling on the field. Every character can jump, but each will have their own unique on-field ability that will aid in exploration and navigation.\nSCRAP (Dustin)\nOn the field you will see certain glowing trash which Dustin can Scrap to collect Metals.  The Metals are a shared resource the entire party can pull from that is used in combat for special skills. No carrying 99 Ethers around here -Using Dustin to scrap as you travel through areas will be your primary source for replenishing this pool, but not the only way. \nThe amounts of Scrap Metals in later areas as you travel through and around the dump may vary, presenting different challenges and force you to change up how you manage your skill uses.\nDustin's Scrap power will also have other on field uses - like breaking open rusty locks and even obliterating pure metal enemies before they even initate an encounter.\n\n CLIMB (Ratavia) \nAnyone can climb a ladder, sure, but Ratavia's claws can scale certain walls, vines, fences and slippery ropes. She can even climb horizontally across telephone wires and more.\nAreas will have multiple paths to get through, and climbing is a great way to find alternate routes and secret areas. \n SHOOT (Walker Jacket)\nWalker's gun can fire scrap bullets that hit targets, switches, and bust holes in cracked walls. If you're quick enough on the draw you can also stun enemies on the field before they even initiate you in combat.\n\n(The other 3 playable characters will have unique abilities as well )\nTurn based combat takes place on the Tileboard. These Tiles connect to all the elements of the battle system, aiming to provide a simple twist that offers a lot of complexity. \n \u21f3  MOVEMENT AND PLACEMENT \nBefore battle you can set your character formation in the main menu, but you likely will have to change up position based on the enemy, environment and what's happening in battle. Your damage calculation is based on your location and any tile effects on the board are factored in as well. \nMoving doesn't take up your turn, so optimizing your characters position is important to winning battles efficiently. Some characters may deal extra damage from different placements on the board. (Walker's gun gets a boost from distance)\n \ud83d\uddf7 TILE EFFECTS \n All Status Effects are tied to the Tile itself, not a character. (A fire tile, a regen tile, a poisoned tile)  \nSet up traps behind an enemy tile, use knockback skills to push opponents around the board\n Objects like Rocks and Trees can take up Tiles as well, position yourself behind them to have the object absorb certain incoming attacks.\n \ud83d\udd59 TIMED CRITICALS\nIt's a critical hit if you learn your characters attack animation and are skilled enough to nail the timing. Timed blocks will work similarly although some attacks will be unblockable.\nEach character will have slightly different timing to get criticals. \nFor those seeking a more challenging experience, you'll be able to disable the timed critical hits as well.\n DUSTIN BINSLEY \nDustin is an orphan can from Tin Alley with big dreams of being a world-famous knight... but this young squire still has a long ways to go. Reading comics, drinking curdled milk, and oversleeping are not exactly traits of knighthood, even in Garbagia. \nWhen the kingdoms are thrown into chaos, Dustin finds himself in way over his lid. Now hunted by trash assassins, secret organizations, and an evil Magic 8-Ball, he must fight his way to the very edges of the Dump... Saving the world can be a grimy job, but someone's gotta do it.\n\nRATAVIA \nDustin's best friend and older-sister figure. She moved to Garbagia after leaving her home kingdom of Mammalon a few years ago... She wanted a quiet place to live a simple life in... too bad keeping Dustin out of trouble is a full time job.\n\n WALKER JACKET \nA member of the Order of Book's End and arguably the most feared librarian in all of the Lands of Fill. He spent years chasing down overdue books and lost library cards, but now must lend his service to a greater cause...\n\n   LUTE\nYoung Lute is just starting out at The Order of Books End as an understudy of Walker Jacket. After months of stocking shelves and studying scrolls, he is now ready to begin earning his Bookmark.\nCERULEAN  \nA Wizard of the Wash - also known as a Laundromancer. Upon graduating The School of Sanitary Arts, Cerulean received the rare honor of The Star Print- a fated sign from the Fairy Washmother of future importance.\n\n MUSK \nThe mysterious stinkbug has been involved with the Buggarian underworld for many years. He is a master of disguise and infiltration thanks to his power called Fumeshaping - an ability to control the very stinkcloud that surrounds him.\n Current Ruler:  King Globespin\n Locations:  Tin Alley,  Hoardinghall, Cardboard Cape\n Export: Moldy Vegetables, Cardboard, Scrap Metals\nGarbagia is one of the oldest Dump Kingdoms in the Lands of Fill. It's rolling junk hills stretch all across this western continent, from Sogshire to the Rubberlands.  After a terrible natural disaster a century ago, nearly half the kingdom was lost. Garbagia has recovered and prospered for the last hundred years all to the work of King Garbamesh the Great.\n Current Ruler:  Queen Drikleen III\n Locations:  Needlepoint, The Laundry Forest, Faucet Falls\n Export: Fabrics, Perfumes, Potions\nThese lavish lands of laundry make up an exotic and mysterious nation to the north. The Junkstorms that roam through the Dump barely graze this kingdom's southern edge, where the Laundromancers help keep the seas free of plastic and the air clean and crisp. While they remain very removed from the other kingdoms of the Dump, they still participate in the annual Kingscon and maintain good relations with the other members of the treaty to this day. \n Current Ruler:  Queen Highwing\n Locations:  Castle Highwing, Bug City, The Anthills, Club Web\n Export: Silks, Honey, \n\"Before the Trash woke, they were already here.. \"\nThe Book Keepers say that the Bugs are the oldest of the inhabitants of the Lands of Fill. They once had an empire that stretched halfway across the Dump... After the time of the Scrap Iron Kings, the bugs fled to the southlands that now make up modern Buggaria. \nThe southern bug lands consist of vast canyons, a sprawling desert, and rocky mountains littered with windblown trash. Buggaria is a kingdom teetering on the edge of civil war between two great houses: The Highwings of the west and the Crawlbottoms of the east.\n Current Ruler:  King Cello \n Locations:  Tabletop, Valley of Fallen Nails, Book's End\n Export: Lumber, Saps, Vintage Laquers\nCousins of the Trashborn, the Woodkin like to think themselves more refined than their Garbagian relatives- at least the nobles up on Tabletop say as much. They place craftmanship above all else, which has resulted in a rather superficial society. \n Current Ruler:  The Great Dane\n Locations:  Northfang, Southpaw, Biscuit Mountain\n Export: Furs, Bones, Precious Metals\nThe distant northlands of the Mammals were once the most remote and self-sufficient kingdom in the Dump. The last of the races to appear in the Lands of Fill - the animals initially were met with much conflict (Their habit of chewing up furniture legs did not sit well with the neighboring Carpentry kingdom.) Several wars and centuries later, the Mammals are now part of the Kingscon Alliance and even have a train that runs through their capital city and connects them to the rest of the Dump.\nA concept dreamed up by two janitors : A world of living trash known as The Lands of Fill. A unique fantasy setting of Garbage Knights, Laundromancers, Toxic Grimelins and giant talking Bugs. \nYes, we are real janitors and have been mopping floors and scrubbing desk tops to support ourselves while we chase our dream. We put together a small team to help us on this journey and we've been working toward this moment ever since.  We are aware of the muck, the mire, the vast garbage ocean that is game development.  With that in mind, the team has spent a good long while making sure our foundation was solid, and getting the systems built and in place so, with your help, we can hit the ground running.  \nWe love this project, it's been our dream to bring this idea to life, and we want nothing more than to pack this trashcan full of heart and soul and to tie the bag tight - we just need your help to carry us to the curb. <3\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoach Games \n Creator/Designer/Janitor: Roach \n\n Creator/Writer/Janitor: Everdredd \n\n Programmer: Solar Mongoose \n\n Environment art: DM404 \n\n Character Illustration and concept art: D Jeffrey   \n Original Soundtrack: Bobby Ghostly \n Guest Composer: William Kage  \n\n Landscape Illustrations: Shemmet\n Additional Enemy and Boss sprites: Francis Coulombe  \n Additional Character sprites: Tebited15 \n Additional Character sprites: Marcus Dewdney \n Extra sprites/animation: DE, Roden \n\n Website + Game Fonts: brains \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy kickstarter? Why now? We have been planning seeking the help of a kickstarter for a while- however, before we wanted to ask for a single crowd funded cent - we wanted to get the framework of the game established and invest our own time and money upfront to show something we thought was worth supporting.  \n BREAKDOWN\nDevelopment: 50%\nDevelopment funds will allow our programmer the ability to work on the game full time. We have planned for a two year development, and then added an entire extra year to account for delays and other issues that may arise. The rest of the team will continue to scrub and mop floors while working on the project.\nArt and Music: 30%\nWe will be using the art budget for our excellent environment artist DM404 and some other great artists like the awesome Francis Coulombe and our guest composer, William Kage. We have mapped out what we need, but additional funds will allow them to make even more awesome stuff!\nRewards and Shipping: 10%\nThe shirts will go out shortly after the Kickstarter but the collector's SNES box won't ship until the game is complete. \nFees and Other: 10% \nKickstarter fees and other expenses must be accounted for. \n\nREWARDS\nLAUNDROMANCER - KINGDOMS OF THE DUMP SHIRT \n\"Take out the trash like your life depends on it!\"\nSCRAPMASTER - COLLECTOR'S EDITION SNES BOX\n The Collector's edition contains:\nSNES-styled Box\nAn instruction manual with art and game information (remember those?)\nFake SNES cartride that opens up with USB inside\nAll digital rewards including the PDF of the Player's Guide\nStickers\nKingdoms of the Dump Bookmark\nT-Shirt\nAccess to early tech demo and act 1 demo\nPLAY\n\nAny old game can make a mockup of a SNES box in photoshop...but can they pull a physical prototype out of a rubbish bin?\n\nLORD OF LITTER AND ABOVE - GAME DEVELOPMENT TRASH + FUTURE BETA ACCESS\nAll tiers above the 150 mark will receive access to upcoming builds of the game including a beta test. They will also receive exclusive trash from the game development process. It may look like regular litter to the untrained eye, but you know better. We have hundreds of pages of notes, level sketches, maps, character designs and mechanics details - and we will include one of these with your collector's package. These tiers also will include collaborating with Roach Games designing certain elements. You must work with the team to create something that fits the world and lore of the Dump.\nGOLDEN JANITOR\nThis is our most ridiculous reward. Come to New Jersey (travel not included) and help clean up some litter with us around town and we'll talk video game design, and will provide food and a special shirt for the occasion. If you don't feel like coming we will still do the litter clean up regardless. : )\nAll backers that backed the Scrapmaster Tier and above will have access to two upcoming demos. One in 2020, the other in 2021. The Lord of Litter tier and above will have access to an expanded BETA test. Then we plan to release the game in 2022. \n2019- Development Begins\n2020- Demo 1 - Battle System and Field Mechanics\n2021-  Demo 2 - Act 1 Demo, Lord of Litter Beta test\n2022- Polishing/Release\nThe game will be released on Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can either get a steam copy of the game or a DRM-free version. If more platforms are available at release, backers can request those versions as well.\n\nWe are super excited to have William Kage as our guest composer. Check out some of his work below.\n$65,000 - Special Guest track from Hiroki Kikuta\nIf Kingdoms of the Dump exceeds funding and hits our first stretchgoal we will be getting a very special guest track from the legendary Secret of Mana composer Hiroki Kikuta! This would be an incredible honor and an excellent fit for a SNES-styled game.\n$80,000 - Console Ports\nWant to see Kingdoms of the Dump on the Nintendo Switch? So do we! That will be our first choice if we hit this level of funding. If we hit this tier, we will also work towards porting to  other consoles if possible.\n$100,000 - Locked\n$150,000 - Locked\nSOCIALS\nRoach Games \nTwitter\nInstagram\nYoutube", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs new developers, we wanted to invest a lot of our own time and money up front to deliver to you a certain degree of polish.

The lack of dialogue and text creates challenges for us and opens up possibilities for creative solutions, such as providing hints to the player, relying heavily on animations and visual cues. \nYou know how in most adventure games, the action is only in the form of a cutscene? How about playing those cool action moments in your adventure game?\nWe won\u2019t lie, it is a tricky balance to maintain as designers due to changing the pace in a puzzle game, yet we are positive that it can work. How do we know it will work? Because we have you amazing folks to guide us and give your feedback during playtesting!\nWe are HUGE fans of science fiction. As if humans and dinosaurs coexisting wasn\u2019t enough, technology, space suits, pods and energy crystals are the perfect fit to shake up our prehistoric world!  \nIn a small prehistoric village lives a peaceful tribe in a land of huge carnivores.  For generations humans have hunted them for food and utilised their bones and skins to build structures, weapons and clothing.  \nThe young hunter holds an important position within the village as the Chief\u2019s daughter and she cares a lot about her little community.\nDespite living in a land where everything wants to eat you, she is a happy person that loves nothing more than hanging out with her fellow villagers and hunting with them. \nWhen her village gets attacked, the young hunter will not only have to face dinosaurs and barbarians, but will have to overcome her own fears.\nThis mysterious traveller in a futuristic suit has fallen from the skies onto this strange planet. \nWhat are his intentions, where does he come from and why is he so technologically advanced? \nIs he alien?\nIs he human?\nIs he a robot?\nIs he a dinosaur in a suit? (We will answer that now... no)\nThe land may be inhabited by dinosaurs as the apex predators, for our peaceful tribe however there is an extra danger and it is other humans.  \nBasing their survival not on foraging but on conquering, a tribe of hardened savages who kill and take what they want has reached the peaceful village. \nA planet in prehistoric times. The land is full of lush jungles, steep rocky canyons and wild rivers. A place very dangerous to be in unless you are high in the food chain, which is highly unlikely if you are a human, considering the land is full of hungry dinosaurs.  \nWhether you find yourself in a crystal lake filled with colossal aquatic dinosaurs lurking in the depths or a rocky mountain inhabited by nesting pterodactyls who will protect their eggs at all costs, survival will be tough. \nHello! We are Kostas and Sarah! We are filmmakers and animators who love nothing more than telling stories! \nBack in 2015, wanting nothing more than to make an adventure game, we participated in Adventure Game Jam, a competition where you have to create an adventure game within two weeks. Fast Forward two weeks later and Theropods was born! \nGame play from the 2015 Adventure Game Jam version of Theropods\nThe response blew us away as we got tons of positive feedback and the folks playing the game seemed to be wanting more, so that was pretty much all the excuse we needed to keep drawing pixelated dinosaurs and challenging our red-headed hunter with more puzzles.  \nShowcasing Theropods at Athens Games Festival 2018\nA team is as good as its members and we are extremely proud to be collaborating with some amazing artists that will join forces to make your adventure game the best it can be! \nWhere are we from? All over the world! We are spread from the Netherlands to the UK and the US.\nOver the past few years in our own, self-funded time, we have created this demo as a proof of concept,exploring and testing our ideas, playtesting and collecting feedback from players.  \nShowcasing and playtesting the demo at AdventureX and Athens Games Festival was an invaluable experience, where we interacted with enthusiastic adventure game fans and met a lot of awesome game devs with invaluable advice.\nWe plan to release the game for PC and Mac in 2021 (estimated date).\nProvided we pass our funding goal, we would love to port to more platforms like the Switch and localise the game in more languages. \nThis all started as a passion project that we\u2019ve poured our love into it, but now it\u2019s time to go all the way in. \nWe know there are passionate gamers out there like us, who thirst for immersive and personal narrative experiences that bigger studios won\u2019t touch since it is a niche market that only tiny creative teams can provide. Kickstarter is perfect for giving a voice to the fans of adventure games and is one of the few ways that help these games exist. \nBudget subject to change.\nThe majority of our funding will go towards Art and Programming to allow our team to work full time on Theropods without resorting to \u2018second jobs\u2019 to pay for bills and thus, get the game to you as fast as we can. One of the main reasons for this Kickstarter is to be able to hire a talented programmer to work with us full time on the game. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOk let\u2019s face it, adventure games had some flaws. Puzzles with lack of logic, pixel hunting and try-every-item-with-everything solutions were present in this genre\u2019s early games (I am looking at you goat from Broken Sword).\n\nSo one of our goals is to avoid falling into these pitfalls.\n\nSecond design challenge will be the incorporation of action in a point and click adventure game. There needs to be a certain balance that will avoid destroying the pacing or frustrating you with quick-time-event mechanics.\n\nFinally, everyone on our team is a seasoned professional who has worked on a number of different projects, from feature films to tv series and tons of smaller games. That said, this will be our first ambitious commercial game and hence, we may underestimate the time this process will take. What we can promise is transparency. We will update you on our progress whether it is good or bad. As backers ourselves, we know that long radio silence can be frustrating so we will be very dedicated to providing you with updates throughout the process of bringing Theropods to life.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Friendly Villager", "descp": "A HUGE THANK YOU for supporting us! \u2764\nYou receive an exclusive backer wallpaper and our gratitude for being awesome!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcbb Kickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "Dinosaur Hunter", "descp": "Receive a DIGITAL COPY of the GAME!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83c\udfae Theropods Digital Copy (Steam)\n\ud83d\udcbb Kickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["232 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Velociraptor", "descp": "You receive not only the GAME but also a DIGITAL COPY of the atmospheric SOUNDTRACK along with a ton of pretty pixels within the digital ART BOOK of the game!\nINCLUDES:\n\ud83c\udfae Theropods Digital Copy (Steam)\n\ud83c\udfb5 Official Soundtrack\n\ud83c\udfa8 Digital High Res Art Book\n\ud83d\udcbb Kickstarter-Exclusive Digital Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["40 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "Pterodactyl", "descp": "Be one of the first to receive a DIGITAL COPY of the GAME and experience it two weeks prior to release!

You may see shades of Zelda, Megaman, Metroid and many more. We want to make an adventure that takes you to a world you love coming back to and truly earn the title of \"Hero\". We also wanted to make sure the game has plenty of reasons to keep you playing, even after you think you've beaten it. \nA memorable adventure leaves one constantly curious for what will be around the next corner. Will it be a mysterious puzzle, dangerous monsters, or a character with their own story to tell? It should make you laugh, cry and challenge what you know. Finally, your villain has to be compelling and worthy of the title \"Boss\".\nSo how do we do it?\nNo hand-holding\nNon-linear design\nAI is 100% non-random\nDynamic dungeons and bosses  \nQuick and responsive combat that requires every weapon at your disposal\nQuests and Characters you remember\nUnforgettable music that oozes personality\nToadally awesome puns\nYou play as a scrappy young knight with the default name of Andi. Your love and best friend happens to be a spunky and adventurous princess named Lily. Sadly, a figure wearing a mysterious mask appears, kidnaps Lily and curses the land transforming everyone into beasts.\nUsually this kind of thing would be handled by the 4 Legendary Heroes, fighters who wield powerful ancient artifacts that protect the land. The Masked Figure has somehow brought them under their control leaving the land with no one powerful enough to defend it.\nYou are tasked with defeating each of the 4 Heroes and gaining their power. Hopefully those ancient weapons will be enough to take down this Masked Figure.\nRibbiting Saga is your adventure. That's why you can go where you want, when you want. It wouldn't be an adventure if we simply gave you a list of instructions and clapped when you completed it.\nThe game world is split into multiple areas with some very unique themes and you can explore each of these areas in whatever order you choose. You'll need to revisit every area when you have more abilities to complete quests and get powerful upgrades so let loose and run in whatever direction you like.\nThe combat is at the very core of Ribbiting Saga. It's fast-paced and thoughtful. When you first start the game, you can roll and cancel it into a rolling slash attack that can change your direction. This bit of movement alone allows us to create fast-paced encounters that become crazy when you start adding in special weapons. We also added a layer of puzzle-solving to the combat.The weapons you find are always equipped to your controller. You will never pause the game to equip a weapon and every weapon can chain into every weapon which makes combat and puzzles require some experimentation.  Even enemies can be used to solve puzzles or even be the puzzle themselves.\nDespite all the abilities at your disposal, you will CROAK. It's OK. We all do. The enemies are fast and designed to challenge your ability to experiment and learn their tricks. Helping people and buying Charms will help you survive. Don't worry though. You don't drop anything when you do croak and you won't be spending 10 minutes running back to a boss when you mess up. \nWe chose to find a middle-ground between random and single linear dungeons. Instead you, the hero, are free to explore the entire game's map and dungeons in whatever order you like. The order you choose will have a big impact on the rest of your game.\nThere are 4 major dungeons in the game. Each one contains a special item that allows you to interact with more puzzle elements in the world. They also contain a super tough boss that rewards you with a copy of their signature weapon.\nThe dungeon length and boss fights will change depending on the order you choose. For example, our boss demo  contains a fight with Captain Blu who resides in the floating dungeon known as Gunslinger's Galleon. This dungeon can be completed with no other items required and the boss will be a challenging 1-on-1 duel between you and Captain Blu. If you chose to enter Gunslinger's Galleon second, you would have a totally different experience with Captain Blu.  His size, art, arena and abilities will all change. The later you visit a dungeon in your journey, the more difficult it will become.\nThis means your adventure is always getting tougher. If you take a different path, you will get new boss fights and dungeon experiences whether you've watched a streamer play the entire game, or you've beaten it already yourself.\nThe OST for Ribbiting Saga is composed entirely by Ryan. We gave him the vague task of making us something that sounds reminiscent of the Super Nintendo and makes the player feel like they are on an epic journey. He somehow translated that into these really awesome tunes that we just can't get out of our heads. If you like these, be sure to check out our tier that includes the OST.\nWe are a team of passionate indie developers that just want to make the games we've always wanted to play. We love the feeling of booting up a new game and getting lost in its world. Now, we want to give that feeling to you.\nHappy Ogre was initially just a couple that happened to be a professional software engineer and a hilarious artist. We started making Ribbiting Saga in our spare time about a year ago. Pretty early on, we realized we needed a composer to help tie it all together, and luckily we knew just who to ask.\n Charlie - Designer, Programmer, Artist\nHe started learning C++ when he was 12 and never stopped making small game engines. At the same time, he's obsessed with game design and is known to be super picky. He worked for the past 7 years as a professional Software Engineer while still making games on the weekends. He's also known to talk at great length about literally anything.\nSusan - Writer & Artist\nShe started drawing and writing from the moment she could hold a pencil and playing video games for almost as long. A lifetime love of art bred an appreciation towards all art forms. That made it easy to fall in love with pixel art which she learned specifically to bring Ribbiting Saga to life. Whether they're groaning from a pun, laughing from a visual gag, or holding back tears, she just wants to make people feel.\n Ryan - Composer & Sound Designer\nWith 13 years of making music under his belt, he began his musical endeavors as a bit of a metal-head back in 2006. Then studied music production, performance and audio engineering for 6 years across college and university, worked on various fan projects and now joined the ranks to break into the Games Industry to play a part in creating unforgettable experiences!\nWe have been working on Ribbiting Saga in our spare time as a passion project for the last year. However, at some point we needed to focus on the game full time. Charlie recently quit his full time job and has invested $20k of his own money to support him and Susan for a while, but it's not nearly enough to survive long enough to complete the game. That's why we are asking for $50k to help fund our survival, legal fees, etc. Here's a breakdown of where money will go.\nBefore anyone asks, yes there are no physical reward tiers. We made this decision so we could be confident in our funding goal. Time and again, teams get far too much money from physical reward tiers and end up not actually having enough money to complete their project. Instead, we decided to focus entirely on making the game and letting our community help.\nFrog Pun\nWe appreciate any amount of support someone can give. In return we will send you an email containing a painstakingly crafted frog pun.\nDigital Game Key + Digital Manual\nGet a copy of Ribbiting Saga on the platform of your choice. Our plan is to launch on PC/Mac/Linux and Nintendo Switch.\nBehind-the-Scenes Bundle\nGet access to backer-exclusive discord channels. Come get early looks at what we are working on, give valuable feedback, and get your questions answered in monthly Q&A sessions. We want to include our community in every way possible.\nSoundtrack Bundle\nGet a digital copy of the fantastic SNES-inspired soundtrack composed by Ryan. Like any good SNES soundtrack, you won't want to stop whistling these songs any time soon.\nBeta Bundle\nGet access to early builds of Ribbiting Saga to help test and interact directly with the team. Give us your feedback, suggestions, or a GIF of that hilarious bug you found. We can hang out in our exclusive discord channel and talk about all the cool secrets no one knows about yet. You may even see some really old cool secrets like our first ever attempt at making a frog hero.\nGet In the Game Bundle\nWe will put you or your pet's likeness in the game somewhere. Send us a photo and as long as we approve the image that image will be forever immortalized.\nCostume Designer Bundle\nDon't ask us why, but it's come to our attention that some people may want to be something other than a frog. Seems crazy, but we decided to add a costume system. With this reward, you can design one of them! Work with us via a discord call to design the name, art and unlock requirements for your very own costume.\nGuest Designer Bundle\nGet to really experience designing a character from scratch. Work with us to design your choice of an Enemy or NPC that fits into Ribbiting Saga. We will communicate via multiple discord calls to bring this character to life.\nTop Secret Room Bundle\nGet your own secret special room in the game. Work with us to design the room and make it unique to you. Make a cool hideout for your NPC, a room full of puns, deathtraps, free money, whatever you want so long as we approve it.

Thank you so much for stopping by our Kickstarter page!\nThis Kickstarter is being held to fund the production of our game, Lunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak.\nLunafon is a narrative-driven 2D adventure game that is hand-painted and traditionally animated, and features a sterling all-star cast including Bryan Dechart, Amelia Rose Blaire-Dechart, Roger Clark and Irish YouTuber Jacksepticeye!\n\u2605 PRE-ORDER THE FULL GAME ON THE \u00a315 TIER \u2605 \nCheck out the HD version of our trailer on YouTube HERE\nCheck out our FAQ's here\nUpdate #1: Thank you so much!\nUpdate #2: 100 Backers! (Backers Only Update)\nUpdate #3: New Kickstarter Update!\nUpdate #4: Asset Creation Process \nUpdate #5: New pins and new voice actors\n \u2605  NEW REWARD TIER DESCRIPTIONS + REWARDS \u2605  \n- Please be sure to check out the reward tier images at the bottom of this description rather than the ones on the side for all the new elements on each tier - \nThe game takes place across two lands; Lunafon, the land of the Moon, and Annwn, the land of the Sun. It follows the journey of our main character, Lunie, through these lands after the magic of Lunafon starts to die. An army of deadly Broga have swept through Lunafon and stolen the Moon Lantern, taking it back to Annwn to the Withered King, Arawn.\nLunie must travel through her land to the sunken Halls of Cynddylan, where the barrier between the two worlds opens. When she arrives in Annwn however, she discovers that not all is as it seems. Before she can get to the Lantern, she must first get past the three beasts of Annwn; the deadly Widemaw, the Ridge Serpent, and the Goliath Broga, and then she must come face to face with Arawn himself.\nLunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak is a 2D platformer that utilises multiple aspects of gameplay.\nINTERACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT\nFrom pushing boulders to reach high up places, to knocking light out of lanterns to create steps, Lunie can interact with the game environment in many ways to solve puzzles and unlock new areas all across Lunafon and Annwn.\nLunie can run, jump, swim, dive, climb, leaf glide, push and pull objects and even ice skate to navigate through the lands!\nLook at Lunie go!\nWATCH OUT FOR ENEMIES\nOver the course of Lunie's adventures in Lunafon and Annwn, she has to face off against swathes of the deadly Broga and their other tar-monster minions.\nLunie has a range of attacks, which include jumping on certain enemies, using the light from her lantern to attack others, and utilising her powerful Starburst attack, which players can upgrade over time to become more powerful and hit more enemies at once. \nCHAT WITH THE LOCALS\nLunie will come across many different creatures on her travels, so be sure to stop and have a chat with them! Some will offer valuable pieces of information, while others may have some goodies hidden away for you - for a price.\nOthers will send you on side quests, and some locals may end up going off on a tangent about their life story. \nMaybe avoid those ones. You may be there a while.\nA 3D SPACE IN A 2D GAME\nWhen we were developing ideas for how we could present Lunafon at it's very best, we wanted a way to be able to allow players to have a deeper exploration of the levels. We felt that being limited to the 2D platformer space made Lunie feel like she was moving in an ant tank, so we wanted to come up with a way to get around that.\nWe came up with a solution that would not only allow players to move left to right and up and down, but also move backwards and forwards through the different layers in each of the areas.\n\nConcept art showing how Lunie can jump between different layers in each of the worlds to explore further\nIt's a very subtle movement, interspaced with an adorable butt-wiggle animation from Lunie when she jumps backwards and forwards through the environment. The camera creates the illusion of depth as it pulls through the different asset layers, and players will see a little signpost on the areas where they can move through these layers to explore new places.\nImagine the game is like a giant pop-up book, but instead of sticking to left/right/up/down, you can also go forwards and backwards through each layer of assets\nThe camera works in a similar way to a multiplane camera in animation, where the layers seem to move apart as you travel further into the scene, and the result gives us a multidimensional feeling to the game, while still retaining that familiar 2D platformer environment.\n\n\u2605 NEW ANNOUNCEMENT \u2605\nWe are now developing Lunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak for multiple platforms, including PC/Mac/Linux, XBox One, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch!\nWe have had some wonderful feedback from supporters, backers and people who are interested in the game, and we have made the decision to develop this game across the multiple platforms right from the start. Once we reach our funding goal, we will be developing the game for desktop platforms, as well as the three major consoles.\nIf you have pledged to the \u00a315 DAISY SAPLING tier, you are now able to choose which platform you would like to receive your copy of the game on, and are no longer limited to just PC/Mac/Linux.\n \u2605 NEW GAME RELEASE FORMAT \u2605\nLunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak is divided into 12 Chapters of gameplay, with each one equating to roughly 1-1.5 Hours worth of gameplay, with it's own smaller story arc and set of quests and tasks, each contributing to the main story arc and journey.\nEach Chapter will be developed and released to an Early-Access stream, with the first Chapter due to be available between December 2019 and May 2020 (to allow for additional console releases, bug fixes, animation, etc.)\nThis allows us to get the game to you sooner, on more consoles, and with a strong format that lets you dive deep into the lands of Lunafon.\nAll backers from the \u00a315 DAISY SAPLING tier upwards will receive all 12 Chapters as they become available, a week ahead of non-Kickstarter releases.\nEverything you see in the environment of Lunafon is hand painted traditionally on paper. All of the game environments, assets and animation backgrounds have all been lovingly (and painstakingly, in some cases) painted by hand by our artists, Ella and Mary.\n We use a mix of Nicker Poster Colour and Schmincke Horadam Watercolour to bring the lands of Lunafon and Annwn to life, before scanning each of them into Photoshop to be cleaned up and coverted into PNG files, ready for Unity.\nOriginal paintings now digitised with lighting added\nThe final assets in place\nAll of the animation in this game is done using frame-by-frame animation, exactly the same way paper animation is done, using a programme called TVPaint. Many traditional animators now use this software due to it's similarity to traditional animation, combined with it's phenomenal tools and a highly intuitive workspace.\nPLAY\n\n\nThere are many reasons why we chose to use TVPaint over paper; one factor was time - animation is a long enough process without adding the multiple redraws, scanning, clean up, reconstructing and testing involved with paper animation, but the biggest reason was dictated by storage, and how much paper we would end up using. We just don't have the space to store reams and reams of paper animation, which would get scanned, inked and painted digitally anyway.\nIt also meant that we were able to work with animators all over the world. In the game announcement trailer alone, we had the absolute privilege of working with Jason Ryan (Monsters Versus Aliens, Shrek 4, Megamind, Kung Fu Panda 2, Madagascar 3, The Croods and Turbo), Jeff Bastida (The Princess and the Frog, My Little Pony Movie) and James Farr (Xombie series, Jacksepticeye animated series), and we continue to foster relationships with both experienced and renowned animators, and upcoming talent.\nElla's rough animation for Lunie's climb cycle\nAll of Lunie's animation cycles are created by Ella, frame-by-frame. Lunie currently has over 25 animation cycles for different move sets, including unique underwater and in-air cycles.\nThe final horizontal jump animation\nAlongside our team of amazing artists, dazzling devs and magnificent musicians (yes, I really did just write that) we also have a singularly wonderful and incredibly talented cast of voice actors, that are an honour and absolute privilege to work with.\nStarting off our cast list is our lead actress, Viki Owen, who voices Lunie. Viki is a talented Welsh actress and voice-actress, and delightfully captures Lunie's enthusiastic and determined personality. Lunie is a young spirit with a lot to learn, but despite her differences from the rest of her kind, she doesn't let it slow her down or hold her back.\nNoone the Moon Oak is voiced by the wonderfully talented Bryan Dechart! Noone was born at the same time as Lunie, and is her best friend. He doesn't see the differences between himself and Lunie, he only sees Lunie's kindness and enthusiastic spirit. He is always there to pick Lunie up when she's down, and gives her important advice at the start of the game. Bryan is also voicing our band of skeletal rat pirates, who have a very special Queen.\nThe ruler of Annwn is voiced by none other than Se\u00e1n McLoughlin, who many know as the fantastic Irish YouTuber, Jacksepticeye! Se\u00e1n is well known for his upbeat, energetic personality, and can pull off a whole range of different voices, including the deep, haunted voice just perfect for Arawn, our game's primary antagonist. \nGranny Elder is the mother spirit and ruler of Lunafon, and is voiced by the wonderful Ffion Jolly, whose credits include Stan Lee's Lucky Man with James Nesbitt, Requiem, McMafia and Mission Impossible: Fallout. This mother spirit would do anything to keep her subjects from harm, and has been overly protective of Lunie since the day she was born.\nThe shapeshifter Dogfeilion is voiced by the amazing Roger Clark, who most recently provided both the motion capture and voice for Arthur Morgan, the lead protagonist of Rockstar's phenomenal hit game, Red Dead Redemption 2. Dogfeilion was once a human-shaped spirit, similar to Arawn and Granny Elder, until cursed by Arawn before the start of the game. He is now stuck in the single form of a hare, and no longer able to swim beneath the waters of his home, the Halls of Cynddylan.\nThe Queen of the Rat Pirates is voiced by the incredibly talented Amelia Rose Blaire-Dechart! Residing in M\u00f4r-Ladron Harbour upon a throne made from the open skull of a giant owl, The Pirate Queen gives Lunie a very special ability that allows her to get access to previously locked and hidden areas throughout the game.\nThis adorable Rose Sapling appears in a special level called Tallgarden, and is voiced by the magnificent voice acting talent that is Bryce Papenbrook! Tallgarden is the last level in the area of Lunafon before Lunie leaves her known world behind, and is given that extra boost of courage she needs from Rosaroar before stepping into the unknown.\nAnd finally, the last, but most definitely not the least, is the tremendously talented Sean Chiplock! Sean is voicing a character named Raggety; a humanoid mushroom spirit who accidentally gets turned into a bug so he can travel with Lunie on her journey. Sean's numerous credits include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, where he not only voiced the Rito Champion, Revali, but also Teba and the Great Deku Tree, as well as other video games including Fire Emblem: Echoes, Valkyria: Azure Revolution and Persona 5, as well as animes such as Hunter x Hunter, One Punch Man and Sword Art Online.\nTwo other characters who appear in the trailer are Rhiannon the Heron, and Cwn the Doberdane. \nRhiannon is a drifting spirit; she belongs to none of the worlds and travels between all of them, offering Lunie guidance and encouragement when she needs it the most, and is voiced by Ella.\nCwn is Arawn's faithful hound, based on and named after the Welsh myth of the Cwn Annwn - the hellhounds of the land of Annwn. Ever faithful to his master, Cwn remains by Arawn's side, no matter the cost. (As a side note - \"cwn\" is the Welsh word for \"dogs\". Yes, we have a dog named Dog.) \nTwo gaming nerds, two tiny gaming nerds, two owls, one dog and 50 bazillion cats.\nGadget's really perfected her \"How Dare You.\" face.\nOkay, so maybe 50 bazillion is a slight exaggeration, but we do have 6. Together, we all make up the founding part of Ddraig House Game Studio.\nDdraig House, (pronounced Th-r-eye-g House) was founded by Ella Kingstone in 2016, and shortly after, husband Bob was encouraged (or coerced, depending on which version you hear) into joining as he knows how to write code sometimes (and makes amazing cups of tea).\nFast forward to two and a half years later, and we now currently have an ever-growing team of 4 animators, 2 artists, 2 devs, a wonderful composer and his team and a phenomenal voice acting cast, all working on our very first game, Lunafon: Tales of the Moon Oak.\nThe soundtrack for Lunafon is being written by the amazingly talented team at Game Music Town.\nGame Music Town is a multi-award winning team of composers, sound designers and audio engineers, who specialise in creating original custom made music and sound design for games.\nTheir phenomenal array of credits include working on titles for names such as Capcom, iNK Stories, Sony Computer Entertainment, Quantic Dream, Rockstar Games, Fire Falcom, as well as multiple Film studios and TV networks such as 20th Century Fox, Sony Pictures, Syfy, Bravo, Lifetime, National Geographic Kids, and even a contender\u2019s selection for the 2018 Oscars!\nSo now you've read all about our game, who we are and what we're doing, it's time to get to the good bit - the reward tiers!

This includes extra features such as:\nHaving the soundtrack recorded with a full orchestra\nExtra animated scenes that uncover more of the story of Lunafon\nExtra merchandise\nExpanded levels\nExtra powers for Lunie\nOther playable characters, such as Bug-Raggety\nAnd much, much more!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've chosen to use Kickstarter to fund the actual game development stage of this process, as the game has already gone through the full pre-development stage for the past two years. This has involved an ever-evolving process of refining the story line, carefully crafting each character and their back stories, generating concept art for the levels and environments and making the project as good as it possibly can be.\n\nAs with any project, however, there are always risks. Animation is not a fast process, nor is game development. There will inevitably be set-backs, software issues, team members not always being available, and so on. However, both Ella and Bob are both experienced project managers, and whatever we face, it is always approached with our experience behind us to be able to handle and adapt to the situation. It's because of this, that our scheduled release date of August 20th, 2021 is only a 'soft' release date, rather than one we want to advertise as locked in at this stage.\n\nAll Kickstarter backers, regardless of reward tiers, will receive a monthly behind-the-scenes newsletter. This isn't just to give you fun and awesome updates of what's happening - it's to keep you constantly updated on the progress of the game and what we are doing, so you are never out of the loop. If there are delays, we will tell you all about them, and why they've happened. If something isn't working out the way we want it to, we will tell you why.\n\nHonesty is always the best policy, and when you put your faith in a project like this on Kickstarter, the least we can do to repay that faith is to always be transparent with what's going on as soon as we know about it. No project is ever without it's hiccups, but you can be sure that we're going to give it everything we've got to bring you a unique and stunning final game that'll be one to remember.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ddraig House Game Studio\nFirst created \u00b7 7 backed\nDdraig House is an independant game studio from Wales, UK.

I hope this clears it up a little bit more.\nSo what's happened is we have received external investment through a private company for the full amount needed to build Lunafon. Kickstarter is all-or-nothing funding, so any pledges that were made would not have been charged unless we reached our goal, which was extremely unlikely - when Kickstarter says you've been refunded, it's a little misleading because no money had left your account, nor would it have left your account, until we had reached full funding via Kickstarter.

It's 3-games-in-1. Because we weren't sure which kind of vacations to take, we chose 3: Summer Camp, Winter Retreat and Roadtrip. So each game is smaller than the original one, but they're the same size when put together. And each time you play, you can choose which game suits you better that time. \n Follow us! There's secret rewards if we hit bigger followings... check this! \nNOTE: (we will update with the rewards soon)\n\n\nBefore going in depth on each one of the games, let's see some key aspects of them first: \nOne of the most exciting things about the Kickstarter campaign is that we want to create a system that lets fans have a voice within the game's creation. Because of that we've created many rewards that will allow backers to affect how the game will shape, from voting on content to private Discords to propose and comment your own ideas!\nLet us show you how this collaborative approach affected the original Monster Prom: \nSo now you have many ways to get deeper into Monster Prom 2's creation: \nDo you want to BE A PART of Monster Prom? ;) \nMonster Camp is the closest to Monster Prom in the sense it's also a dating sim. You have so many turns to seduce one of your camp friends in order to score a summer date!\nBut as similar as it is, it presents some key differences that should surprise and please you.\nLook at 5 things that define Monster Camp: \nA NEW EXCITING SETUP: Summer Camp is synonym for love, and also for five new locations. They are perfect for lots of new events, from scary misadventures at the Haunted Manor to wacky ribbons to get at the Monster Scouts' HQ. \n4 LOVE INTERESTS: there will be 4 love interests for you to choose from. Are they the 4 in this GIF? Who knows! That's the beauty of it: the love interests of Monster Camp will be selected with the help of you, our fans. Using content polls (from the 50\u20ac Reward Tier), we will prepare a selection of potential love interests, and then give them to the backers to let them to choose 1 or 2 who will appear in the game. Then we will choose the rest.\nAlso, if we hit some sweet stretch goals, we can have up to 5 and then even 6 love interests (at which point Monster Camp will become as big as Monster Prom). \nTONS OF MINOR NPCs: we're creating a bunch of new minor NPCs to populate Monster Camp. And some of them will be created and chosen through the Exclusive Discord Channels built to start conversations with fans. Will this sexy mothman be one of the new minor NPCs? We have no f*ckin' idea! Let's use the exclusive Discord channels and find out! \nCAMPFIRE MECHANICS: the Campfire will be the Cafeteria of Monster Camp. Some logs will include 2 chars for you to sit with, very similar to the tables of the Cafeteria. But there won't be a shop table or a minor NPC table. Instead, we're introducing 3 new mechanics: rumors, stories,and the smooching log. \nStories resembles the minor NPC table in that it allows you to raise your stats; but it also has a fun twist closer to Monster Prom's cafeteria challenges. It will let you be creative and have fun with it. \nRumors will be similar, with the difference that it will be like Weekend Events, in which you can either help or sabotage other players (while also being creative and having fun). \nThe Smooching Log is something entirely new we're experimenting with. We suspect you will like it!  \nMAGIC MIXED DRINKS!: we changed the shop into a bar. It will work differently than the shop, though, as money won't be a stat here in Monster Camp. Magic Mixed Drinks will activate Special Plotlines, like items did. This time we're thinking about allowing only these kinds of special plotlines, since the no-item ones were too random to control. Also, some other magic mixed drinks will have wild effects on the players. Wait and see! \nMonster Retreat starts by being very similar to Monster Prom: it's all about the humor, the charming characters, and choosing between 2 options. But this time will be different, as events won't get you closer to get a date, but help you grow stronger to face what awaits for you at the end of the game: a strategy minigame in the form of a snowball fight. \nLook at 5 things that define Monster Retreat: \nVISIT THE WINTER LOCATIONS: Monster Retreat takes you to some sick snowy mountains with 5 unique locations. But this time it will be kinda different, as during each turn locations will include little icons to show you which type of event will happen there. There will be 5 types of events, giving you room to be more strategic about it: do you want to learn a new technique,or maybe recruit an ally? It's up to you! \nCHOOSE A SIDE: The main plot of Monster Retreat is that Vera and Miranda have beef over something stupid and now a big snowball fight will take place in some days. You must take a side on this and prepare for the war. We're studying mechanics to add some flavor to it, giving you room to interact with your friends and even betray them last minute when you choose a side.\nSo what are you? Team Vera or Team Miranda? \nRECRUIT ALLIES: Some events will make you encounter wacky minor NPCs and if you play your cards right, you may be able to convince them to join your team. Potential recruits will include characters from Monster Prom you love and even some new ones. \nOnce again, who these characters are will be decided by both us and the you, the backers. We have some ideas, but we want to know: who do you think would make a great addition to your team?\nLEARN TECHNIQUES: Some events will give you the chance to learn one of many wacky techniques. Techniques will be assigned to one of the characters on your team and they will give you an edge during the snowball fight. They can be either active or passive abilities. \nDuring the first matches you will be surprised by new techniques: it's like a new thingie to collect! And once you know all of 'em, you can use them strategically to win the snowball fight.\nSTRATEGIC SNOWBALL FIGHT: Yes, at the end of the match the snowball fight will commence. First you will have to choose your team and build your team using the allies you recruited. Then, you will assign the techniques you've learned to  various members of your team. Finally, you'll position your team members on the board however you see fit . \nAfter that, players will have a series of turns to beat the other team. You will have to program moves and abilities that will take place during the turn. It'll be chaotic and fun! \n\nMonster Roadtrip is the last of the 3 adventures we've prepared for the sequel. You will join Polly and Scott on a trip with an uncertain end. And you know that if you join the Prank Masterz anything can happen... anything but boredom!\nLook at 5 things that define Monster Roadtrip: \nA NEW TYPE OF SETUP: The map on Monster Roadtrip works differently than the others, as it is not static. You drive along the road and the player must choose between different stops. You must play smartly to ensure that you take the roads that won\u2019t leave you stranded in the middle of nowhere. \nSTRANGE STOPS: We're preparing different types of stops for you to encounter along the way. Some will be more common, like the Diner or the Gas Station, while others will be unexpected and harder to find. When hitting a stop, you will be offered different actions to take, each one with different risks and gains. It's up to you to decide what's the smartest choice of 'em all (or you can choose whatever you feel like choosing, of course). \nSTRANGER HITCHHIKERS: Also, during your trip you will encounter different hitchhikers. They will make the trip way stranger; and you may pick them as they might be useful later. Once again, some of these hitchhikers will be beloved NPCs from the original game while others ones will be entirely new. And we will want to discuss with our backers on the Exclusive Discord Channels to decide who these hitchhikers could be. \nSECRET DESTINATIONS: You might end up nowhere... but you may also reach some juicy destinations. Destinations not only entail the end to your trip ,but they also present a different type of mechanic to decide if you \"succeed\" at \"fail\" at unlocking the secret ending of the destination\nSURVIVAL CO-OP MECHANICS: To be completely honest... this is the aspect of Monster Roadtrip that's the most raw. But we know we want to include some sort of survival mechanics in the game that force you to be smart if you want to get somewhere. \nAlso, this allows us to create some tension by giving different responsibilities to each player and forcing them to make choices with their own risks and gains. If Monster Retreat is more competitive than Monster Prom, we want to make Monster Roadtrip more of a co-op.\nLet's talk a bit about the rewards!\nWe of course have the game. No need to explain this one, right?\nThen we have the DLC including new outfits. As we said before, we are planning to do 2 DLCs: One will be larger and will eventually be up for sale. The other will be smaller but it will contain outfits that will be forever exclusive and never for sale, only for backers of this KS (and for some special situations, like promotional giveaways or prizes for contests).\nNOTE: The outfits displayed in the IMG are just to illustrate the reward and are NOT necessarily the outfits that will be included in the DLC. \nThere's the beta access to the game, which is pretty self-explanatory. \nThere's also the chance to be in the 1st wave of recipients for the upcoming modtool for Monster Prom (the original game). Note this does NOT include Monster Prom. You can get the game as an add-on by adding 10\u20ac to your pledge. \nAt the 50\u20ac reward tier we a DLC offering something COMPLETELY NEW. We're working on including alternative playable characters, as we've seen you asking for that A LOT! We will keep our 4 beloved PCs as the most official ones... but we're ready to include other options for you!  Some of these new additions will be forever exclusive to this Kickstarter (plus some special situations, just as with the other one).  \n NOTE: the monster in the image below is NOT final; just an example.\nThere's also the Game Content Polls. There's a ton of content we want to discuss with our audience, so lots of choices will be held as polls: characters to appear in the different games, secret endings, items, etc. \nAt the 80\u20ac reward tier the co-designer rewards start, and so you get to appear in the credits as a co-designer! At these tiers you will be participating actively on the creative side of the game, so we want to reward you by including you in our credits!\nAnd so you have 3 co-design rewards at 80\u20ac, 120\u20ac and 180\u20ac. These include access to 3 Exclusive Discord Channels where fans will be able of proposing and discussing potential content for the game with our backers. The 1st level is for events and outfits. The 2nd level is for items and endings. The 3rd level is for NPCs! \nBe a part of Monster Prom 2!\nAlso, at the same time, those 3 reward tiers (80\u20ac, 120\u20ac and 180\u20ac) will include juicy physical rewards. The first will include an exclusive sequel polaroid that won't be ever up for sale. This is your ONLY chance to get it! \nThen there will be 6 additional sequel polaroids. Finally, we will send you 50 polaroids (the 6 sequel ones will be included there). This will include lots of new physical polaroids: the ones from the DLC, the ones from the seasonal updates, and even NEW ones! \nAt 250\u20ac it's time to get your own body pillow. We will have 3 versions: Polly, Damien and the 3rd option wich will be proposed, chosen and voted (with us moderating the process) by the backers themselves. The pillowcases will include 2 sides: cozy and sexy. You choose! ;)\nNOTE: we've seen some people confused on the standard of this type of products. This is the pillowcase: NOT the whole pillow. You have to acquire that separatedly. \nWe also have 3 NEW REWARDS: a Damien figurine, a Dahlia figurine... or both! It can be acquired by pledging at their ownreward tiers or as add-ons. It requires extra shipping costs as we have no idea how shipping might work. We're studying it right now. \nSame with size: we don't want to make promises right now, but we're looking most likely at around 6 inches for the figurine. \nThen we have the 4 Custom Reward Tiers. All of these include you giving us a reference picture (either yourself, an acquaintance of yours, or a character you made up) for us to create a monstersona for custom art done by the official artists, all for your own personal use. \nFirst we have an avatar (there are 2 different versions for you to choose). \nSecond we have a monstersona. This will be a prom model of the monstersona next to a game character, similar to the prom endings. \nThird we have a modtool kit. This includes an icon of the monstersona and their model, with different facial expressions. It's ready for you to make mods using the character, done in the official artstyle of the game. \nFinally we have the date polaroid, like the ones you get to see by the end of the game! It'll be done in the official artstyle and it'll include a game's character and the monstersona, both together doing something of your choice. We will print 20 copies & send them to you. The back will include a text of your choice. All within reason! \nNOTE: in the example below image the polaroid includes more than 2 characters but keep in mind the reward allows only 2. \nANOTHER NOTE: I apologize for the excess of myself, but we needed someone to act as an example for this :c\nAnd that leads us to the next 4 reward tiers: THE CO-CREATION REWARD TIERS. These ones are BIG. You will create your own content for the game! We will go all the way with you, giving you feedback and helping you so your creation will fit within the Monster Prom guidelines. We hope it also helps you to become a better creator! \n1st tier includes creating AN OUTFIT. Alternatively, you can choose to create 3 normal events. 2nd tier includes creating AN ITEM. This would be (for now) either a Magic Mixed Drink for Monster Camp or a Technique for Monster Retreat. 3rd tier includes creating a SECRET ENDING. Did you know a backer co-created the Orgy Ending with us? 4th tier includes creating a MINOR NPC. Did you know a backer co-created Coach with us?  \nWith this you can be 100% sure your creation will be in the game.\nAnd finally, we have the LAST REWARD TIER. It's a bit absurd; but we wanted to know if there was someone out there willing to give us THE ULTIMATE SUPPORT. Fly to sunny Barcelona, work with us on some of your rewards, learn how making content for a game like this works... and have a great time! We are down to have fancy dinners and party together. Just in case, you must be +21 (to avoid issues with flying you to Barcelona and such). \nMonster Prom succeeded thanks to its unique formula. The 3 games from the sequel will twist the formula in many different ways... but be sure they will keep some of the original's pillars: \nThe Beautiful Glitch team is comprised of many talented individuals, whether they're part of the core team or collaborators on minor stuff. \nSome of the people on the core team of collaborators would be...\n Juli\u00e1n Quijano(Creative Director and Project Manager) \n El\u00edas Pereiras(Lead Programmer)\n Paco Luque (Creative Assistant)\n Cory O'Brien(Lead Writer) \n Maggie Herskowitz, Karlee Esmaili & Julian Quijano (Writers) \n Arthur Tien(Associate Artist)\n Viper& Doktor(Artists).\n Shae Humphries(Map Artist) \nAlso, Jesse Cox helps and supports us as producer, giving us advice and championing for us in many ways. And we still receive the amazing help of Adam Tierney to search for the most kick-ass voice actors & actresses ever. \nWe also want to mention some of the people that have helped us during this Kickstarter campaign: \n Bernat Udina& Jose Luis Espinosa(Video Editors)\n Honk Fu& Anna Cattish(Illustration and Animation of the Roadtrip Loop)\n Sonia Fern\u00e1ndez(Graphic Designer)\n Cristina Vee (Voice Actress)\n Claudi Martinez(Composer)\n Quinn Titus(Proofreader)\nWe want also to say thanks to many people that helped, supported and adviced us about this Kickstarter. Special mention to Anya Combs (sorry for asking you too many questions!), Chris Wulf (from our publishing team, Those Awesome Guys) and Victoria Tran(sharing KS tips within the \"weird yet charming dating sims\" community).\nAnd -of course- thanks to all the fans that have been spreading the love about Monster Prom so far. We love you! \n Also...\nSome people have asked us why we're doing a Kickstarter campaign after Monster Prom's success. It's true that 32.230\u20ac is just a symbolic number (it's what we made on MonProm's 1st KS campaign!); but we have some good reasons for this Kickstarter to be.

That way, we introduce our main features:\nA creative interpretation of a large documentation on Titan's environment -bringing a dreamy and beautiful setting.\nAn emotional insight into mental disorders, not focused on the clich\u00e9 aspects, but to talk about their consequences in relationships and personal growth.\nCarefully crafted animations to tell from gestures and little details. \n Vast possibilities in puzzles by getting to control giant robots. \n Our interpretation of the dense environment of Titan provides Afterlight with an expressive color grading and lighting.\n That way, we link our themes through visual symbolism to improve the environmental narrative.\n Afterlight tells a story about friendship, trust and personal growth by overcoming psychological traumas when the odds are against you. \nWe\u2019ve worked hand in hand with medical and psychological experts to talk respectfully about disorders -and bring an emotional insight about these conditions. \n Due the emotional nature of the story -based on the relationship between Xin and her medical drone, C.O.G. - we are focusing most of our work into animation, to reach the player's empathy.\nThat way, we can convey emotions deeply enough to share our concerns about the game's main themes: trust, emotional support and personal growth. \n To talk about those themes, we fill Afterlight with references from works of other creators. \nLebbeus Woods\u2019 architecture inspires us to talk about the matter and effect of conflict.\nFrom Andrei Tarkovski\u2019 films, we've taken the ontology of humanism and the power of nostalgia through pictoric photography in motion.  \nFurthermore, we are taking his concept of illumination by natural means -that leads us to an expressive and symbolic mood through color and texture.\nAnd finally, from great games like Journey and Inside, we incorporate the importance of collaboration and the emotional bounds from the former; and the introspective insights from the latter.\n Our principal concern in design terms is to make puzzles based on a balance between logic and physics. \n By doing this, we've focused the experience in the environmental aspect of the puzzles -making them truly unique.\n As an adventure game based on physics puzzles, both controller and interaction must be perfect. That is the reason that our focus is on the agility (fast response to input) and feedback (animations) to make the gameplay precise and satisfying.\n You can command the C.O.G. to take control of some of the building robots!\n One of our strengths is the relationship of our protagonist with her partner \u2018C.O.G.\u2019, which has an AI specialized in medical and psychological evaluation. \nThat way, some of its narrative features become a game mechanic as a representation of cognitive and operational extensions.\nTitan is a vast and puzzling world where you have to improve your senses and use your brain. \nYou must climb to explore the Kraken Sea; pull and push objects to make your way; and interact with devices in order to establish control of the facilities.\nWhile landing, most of the crew died in an odd accident: the facility's AI attacked their ship. After a few weeks, only Xin survived thanks to a medical drone: 'C.O.G.'. Since then, she is forced to update the mission\u2019s AI with the drone\u2019s assistance and company.\n To top it all off and after all the horrible things she had to deal with, she started to believe she was another person. As Xin, you must remember and get over the emotional trauma -while discovering disturbing events that will question your perception of reality.\nHowever, was it indeed an accident? Were they alone in Titan? Or was there something else? What happened to the mission's AI to become highly hostile? A reboot is necessary!\n After the accident Xin had to face a lot of pain by seeing her partners perishing. But her 'C.O.G.' was there to help her, to make her mind stay sharp and focus on survival -finally, keeping her sane.\n'C.O.G.' is a treasure -and not a simple drone pet! Besides cute, it's an empathic friend full of joy! \n Every single 'Overview Initiative' astronaut has a 'C.O.G' to ensure the mission success. To sum it up, the 'C.O.G.' drones help them with medical supervision as well as operative functions.\nTheir AI 'Mnemosyne' is programmed to help astronauts remember their training, remain calm and test the operative's psychomotor and cognitive functions before tasks. Without them, some missions would be a failure.\n In the XXII century, humanity has begun its expansion by the Solar System. Governments have unified their space programs under the name of \u2018The Overview Initiative\u2019 with the philosophy that \u2018the unity of mankind will extend us all along the space\u2019.\n The initiative\u2019s main objective is to build a titanic infrastructure to connect the colonies that will be established along The Solar System. This project is known as \u2018The Big Road\u2019.\n In order to build 'The Big Road', they need to research first how to live and operate beyond the asteroid\u2019s belt: radiation remains the greatest problem of space exploration . \nThus Titan, a moon with a dense atmosphere, is the perfect enclave to settle down the largest colony without risks. Also, they found they could farm there thanks to the nitrous-rich soil; and extract water -and then oxygen- from the vast icy rocks.\n This epic space feat is codenamed by the initiative as the \u2018Argus\u2019 mission.\n The operation started 30 years ago, shipping a large deployment of infrastructures to Titan. To make it possible, the initiative programmed an artificial intelligence known as \u2018Demiurge\u2019 to build the facilities autonomously.\nHowever, after an emergency call from Demiurge, the initiative had to precipitate to the next phase and send a human crew to investigate the events. \nThis was known as the \u2018Prometheus Phase\u2019, the final step of the Argus\u2019 mission.\n Prometheus\u2019 main objective was to update Demiurge\u2019s protocols in order to establish contact with the mission control and begin with field experimentation.\n But when arriving at Titan, Demiurge's building robots attacked the spaceship before landing, resulting in the death of most of the crew.\n How was it possible? Demiurge was not programmed nor equipped with defensive protocols -so apparently, something hostile had corrupted it before they arrived.\n Xin and other crew partners survived the crash, but it did not take long for them to die one after another.\n Although she managed to survive, it was at the cost of her mental health: she started to believe that she was another person -to get over that she had seen her friends die.\n Now, her assistant C.O.G. -loaded with a medical AI known as \u2018Mnemosyne\u2019- tries to help her to remember what happened as a therapy. \nThis is the only way to advance through the hostile and puzzling lands of Titan in the search of updating Demiurge... and most importantly: to survive.\n Prices of physical rewards (Artbook, Mission Patches, Signed Prints and Posters) include shipping.\n To purchase you must:\n Enter the quantity of the item desired into the \u201cadd what you want\u201d pledge' writing field.\nThen, when the campaign is over, you\u2018ll receive a survey where you must introduce the quantity you paid.\nThat\u2019s it!\nInitially we will support the following languages:  \nHelp us unlock new languages! We will unlock these when we have at least 50 backers coming from these countries. \n Our main platform is PC (Windows, Mac & Linux) via Steam, but also, if we achieve some stretch goals, we will port to Play Station 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. \nHelp us reach other platforms! Spread the word!\nAlso, we count with two collaborators: Jorge Deebrol (programming) and Jesus \"Nerkin\" Campos (2D Art).\n We work hand by hand with two talented audio technicians and composers who are involved in the game development since the beginning. \nThat way they know how the story and the gameplay work together, giving their insights into making the game a coherent and holistic being. \n  After a year of work we have accomplished about 30% of the development. We hope to raise enough money with this Kickstarter to be able to bring all of you the best game we could make!\nIn adittion we are in talks with a publishing partner in order to secure a quality console port and a professional marketing campaign upon release. \n We believe that crowdfounding platforms pack creators and users in a unique way into the development, and allow all of us to be part of the emotion of creation. \nFor that reason, we\u2019ve been active backers to other campaigns for years: we think the true power remains in the community.

You take on the role of a Wanderer\u2014someone who died, but didn\u2019t end up in Heaven, Hell, or any other traditional afterlife.  Devoid of any memories of your life on earth, you find yourself in an endless desert filled with gateways. Search different planes of existence for clues of your former life - or a semblance of one. Along the way you'll encounter strange inhabitants, alien cultures, and other humans who\u2019ve lost all hope and are bent on destroying you. \nAfterlife is Alice in Wonderland meets What Dreams May Come set in a world inspired by the works of Guillermo del Torro, Hayao Miyazaki, and surrealist artists. \nFind lost memories, come to terms with how you died, and discover who you truly are. \nStepping onto the Tenebris for the first time you realize you're in an outlandish world full of creatures, cities, and customs you don't recognize. A city built atop a giant skeleton, a roadside diner in the middle of the desert, a vast dark pool of inky water. Nothing here is truly human and you're the alien here, far from home with no hopes of return. Salvation lies in the memories you've lost so you travel and search - you are a Wanderer. \nAs a Wanderer your ultimate goal is to regain your memories and find your Requiem\u2014a true end in a place known as the Beyond. In order to do this, a Wanderer must do what their title implies and travel. By travelling into different Limbos\u2014different gateways to the Beyond\u2014you find memory fragments. These glimpses of memories summoned forth by your unconscious give you Resonance. Gain enough Resonance to experience a Break, a full blown memory of your past life, bringing you closer to your Requiem. Each Break creates an opportunity to heal, to strive to remember, to fight for your personality - and your soul. \nLimbos may be cities, forests, or even entire worlds. Each Limbo is populated with its own unique inhabitants who have no idea of any realm beyond their own, much like humans on earth. Wanderers enter (and exit) Limbos through the Tenebris, but consider Limbos their own realms. A Limbo may appear like a person\u2019s version of Heaven, or it may appear totally alien\u2014it all depends on the Limbo.  \nWanderers don't travel the Tenebris alone, it is far too dangerous for that. Instead, you travel with a Crew, a group of lost souls who you met on the boat ride from the world of the living to the world of the dead. A Crew travels together for protection and companionship, personalities may differ or even clash, but these people are the only ones who truly understand what you're going through.\nMechanics in Afterlife: Wandering Souls center on player's action and GMs do not roll any dice. Instead, GMs set scenes, develop plots, and present their players with obstacles. Players decide how they want to overcome these obstacles.\nYou make checks to determine whether your chosen action is a success or not - to make a check you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). A die face of a 4-6 is a success and you must gain enough successes to meet the Challenge set by the game master (GM). \nIf your check is a success - you do what you set out to do. If your check is a failure - things get worse. When things get worse you take damage to one of your Concept pools - Health, Hunger, or Will. Or the GM escalates the scene by pulling in a plot twist, more enemies, or other surprises.\nTo prevent things getting worse you may spend points from your Vitality pools, which is an in game currency representing extra resources a Wanderer has to throw at a problem.\nDuring character creation, the GM takes on the role of the Boatman, guiding your Wanderer on a boat ride from their mortal life to the Tenebris. They will ask you a series of questions based on a variety of dice rolls, and how you answer gives your Wanderer different stats. \nThe memories your Wanderer retains during character creation are vague and highlighted by one brilliant feature your Wanderer refuses to forget. Throughout play you\u2019ll experience more concrete memories during Breaks illuminating the shadows of your lost memories. Things may not always happen as you remember them and part of the journey is the surprise.\nWanderers have many tools, which you may use to make checks easier and perform fantastic feats. \nDuring character creation, the Boatman gives each Wanderer a martial item - a Bow, Sword, or Shield - which reflects how they deal with conflicts. This mystical item, called an Approach, grows as they grow and stays with your Wanderer until they die. Your Approach isn\u2019t limited by earthly limits places on the concepts of a sword, shield, and bow; bows can deflect, shields can slice, and swords can be missiles. \nWanderers use Talents to mold and manipulate the world around them. They can be anything from summoning a mythical beast to reading someone\u2019s mind. Your Talent is a gift bestowed upon your by the Boatman on your ride to the Tenebris. You may learn new Talents as you advance. Depending if your Approach is the Bow, Shield, or Sword your Talent will be different than those with a different Approach, but same Talent. \nAfterlife is a game about a Wanderer's personal journey to recovering their memories. Wanderers recover memories when they see something or someone that reminds them of their past life while exploring a Limbo. This is called a Fragment, and the GM uses it to create a Break - a private scene where your Wanderer re-lives a memory. When the Break concludes the Wanderer has a newfound sense of self, for good or bad, and you get to unlock a Death Mark.\nDeath Marks are tattoo-like markings that  are constantly shifting, flirting on the edge of imperceptibility, whispering forgotten secrets in Wanderer's ears. Each Death Mark is linked to a specific memory and grants Wanderers special abilities to use in game. Death Marks are predetermined in character creation by your Wanderer\u2019s ride with the Boatman. \n\nCheck out the exciting rewards you can get through backing our Kickstarter. If you'd like to add any of these rewards as an add-on to your pledge tier, please add the listed cost to your pledge. Please note the products featured are mock-ups and the final design/colours may vary. \n\u20ac35.

A set of two coloured quick-references to use in game. The quick references are made from a sturdy never-tear material, which is waterproof and easily cleaned with a damp cloth.\n\u20ac11.

The Wanderer\u2019s Tome is a unique notebook that not only contains a copy of the character sheet, but also information on rules players constantly refer to. Behind the character sheet and rules references are lined pages for players to keep all their notes.\n\u20ac25. UNLOCKED STRETCH GOAL!  A Wanderer's Guide to Mirages & Limbos is a brand new setting book. It introduces new Limbos and Mirages for GMs to use in their game along with player focused information on how to interact with Limbos and Mirages. We'll also take a deeper look into the different species you can meet within the Tenebris and give each of them an in depth write-up. This book will be 14.8 x 21 cm, full colour, soft cover, and roughly 100 pages depending on the final word count. \nPlease note - because this was a stretch goal this book will be done later than the core book. We'll offer an option for people to wait and bundle their package to save on shipping. \nShipping for all physical rewards will be charged after the campaign ends via a pledge manager. Prices for shipping change on a weekly basis and we've estimated the following shipping costs, which we will try our best to meet when sending out our rewards:\nNetherlands:  \u20ac5\nEU:  \u20ac9\nWorld:  \u20ac13\nThe EU rate includes the UK for the time being until the result of Brexit is determined.\nDigital rewards will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG, a trusted partner we've worked with for many years.\nOur stretch goals include physical reward upgrades, new books, and getting a host of amazing talent to author custom Limbos for our backers. As the Kickstarter progresses we'll reveal new goals and author biographies once they become available. \nElizabeth (Liz) is the creator of Afterlife: Wandering Souls, leader author, and owner of Angry Hamster Publishing.

Numbering now in the trillions, they are a polyglot, cosmopolitan people, organized under a central hegemon: Union. The galaxy is vast before them, and humanity is its mirror. For some, it is a golden age of post-scarcity utopia. For the rest, that golden age remains a dream to be attained. \nInto this roiling galaxy you take your role as a mech pilot \u2014  from cold-blooded mercenaries to honor-bound Baronic cuirassiers, hardscrabble Union regulars to professional Constellar Midnights, Far Field teams at the uncanny edge of known space to the ever-wandering Albatross. Operating with a wealth of licenses from one of the galaxy\u2019s Big Five fabricators, you and your friends play a tight-knit squad of pilots on campaign \u2014 comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Will you fight for Union, working to rectify the crimes of previous administrations? Will you run contracts for a corpro-state, working to advance private interests while lining your pockets? Will you fight to liberate your people from all masters, human or otherwise? Or will you fight only for yourself? \nLancer features a mix of military science fiction and mythic science fantasy. In the setting, conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpostate agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking entities. \nIn Lancer, there is promise in the potential, but the hard-won gains of humanity are under serious threat. From the internal: ruthless corpro-states, bitter anthrochauvinist reactionaries, and ponderous oligarchs, to the external: MONIST 1, or RA, an anoriginary being with unfathomable power and unknowable goals; the Aunic Ascendancy, the unbroken heirs of Old Humanity; and more. \nHaving only begun the project of recovering from its own internal political revolutions, Union now scrambles to reassert its control over a galaxy that would fall to chaos otherwise.\nWho will you fight for, pilot? \nLancers relaxing between deployment\nWhat is Lancer?\nLancer is a tabletop roleplaying game that prioritizes four pillars of play: \nRules-light, fluid, narrative play while outside of the mech.  \nTactical mech combat that promotes creative tactics, teamwork and explosive moments of action.\nModular, progression-based mech customization where narrative, setting, and character is imbued in the gear, systems, and equipment your character chooses. \nA play loop that encourages narrative advancement. \nLancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds to prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. It\u2019s best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign. \nLancer draws thematic inspiration from various media: The lived-in, cosmopolitan, working class CRT retrofuture of Aliens, Blade Runner, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Akira, and Cowboy Bebop; the science fantasy of Dan Simmons\u2019 Hyperion Cantos, Bungie\u2019s Destiny, Ursula LeGuin\u2019s The Left Hand of Darkness, Moebius\u2019s The World of Edena and Arzach, and Anne Leckie's Imperial Radch trilogy; the soldiers-on-campaign tension of The Thin Red Line, Band of Brothers, and Platoon; and the subjectivity-fraying uncanny of Tarkovsky's Stalker, Cronenberg\u2019s Videodrome, and Evangelion\u2019s Angels. \nMechanically, aspects of Lancer\u2019s play owe particular thanks to existing media for inspiration: Schwalb Entertainment\u2019s Shadow of The Demon Lord for its Accuracy/Difficulty system; the Armored Core series for its modular mech customization; and to John Harper\u2019s Blades In The Dark for its downtime systems.  \nWhile we have a significant number of finished art and lore in the book already, we imagine the final product to be part setting book, part ruleset, and part art book \u2014 a rich resource for not only roleplaying tools, but narrative-inspiring art and worldbuilding. \nBruja introducing her Gorgon\nWhat Does Lancer Do Differently?\nThere are clear, differentiated rules for narrative play and tactical combat.\nNarrative play and tactical combat demand different rule sets and scales of play. Whether you want the game to move at a fluid, narrative pace in order to zoom in or expand your story, or jump right into tactical mech combat, Lancer establishes clear guidelines for when and how to implement differing styles. \nLancer offers systemized downtime and brings narrative-enhancing structure to the play session.\nLancer has a clear play structure making it easy for game masters of any experience to run a dynamic campaign. Players can take downtime actions with defined outcomes to progress story beats, work on projects, or get access to resources. What they do during downtime impacts how their missions begin, progress, and end. This structure prompts clear goals, stakes, and personal involvement from the characters that will help your table to bring storytelling, role-playing, and consequence to every game.\nLancer\u2019s character system is classless, modular, and encourages deep customization.\nWhen you progress in Lancer, your pilot permanently gains licenses that grant them access to parts and gear from a mech of their choice. Unlike other games, however, you are not locked in to a set character path - instead you will create your own personalized mech. Your pilot can mix and match any parts you like, creating a system where players define their own roles by the choices they make. Build broad or deep \u2014 your pilot is your pilot, and your mech is your mech. \nFlavor, characterization, and setting drive every aspect of Lancer \nNearly every gear option has lore attached to it, further defining the history and tone of the setting as well as acting as hooks for deeper player characterization. When you take licenses from the IPS-Northstar Raleigh, the gunslinging mech with the MJOLNIR chest cannon, you know exactly what you're getting.\nOda and his IP-N Raleigh, deep desert\nYou can already play the pre-release version of LANCER here (the link or clicking on the title above will take you to our itch.io page where you can download the game) and download a fully working version of our companion app, COMP/CON, here. This is the full game, totally free and currently being played by dozens of groups, but without a lot of the art, layout, and editing that's the goal of this kickstarter. Even after release, we will always have a free version of LANCER available on all platforms.\nAfter nearly two years of development, play testing, and community building, we wanted to take the next step and finish Lancer\u2019s first edition core book in proper form: hardback, with full color, professional editing and layout, and packed with art by some of the best illustrators working in comics and concept design today. \nClick through for a larger size\nLancer is a large project.

Despite the campaign to raise funds necessary to create a final product, we mean to keep a version of Lancer free \u2014 always. We've gone almost two years in public development of this game and intend to keep the game available for the community to play and enjoy.\nLancer is the second TTRPG from Tom Parkinson Morgan, creator of Kill Six Billion Demons and Broken Worlds, and Miguel Lopez, a fiction writer based out of Portland, Oregon.\nMassif Press is a new publisher made up of Tom Parkinson Morgan and Miguel Lopez.

These are four (five???) mechs not included in the core book. This supplement will be available for wide release some time after our campaign concludes, but we are including it early and for free with all pledges.\nThe Long Rim Mechs\nEveryone who backs this campaign \u2014 at any level \u2014 will have access to any additional social stretch goals we unlock, as soon as we can deliver them.  \nWhat are social stretch goals? Pretty much what they sound like: they're unlocks tied to social engagement, not money raised. \nWe're going to include some additional simple social stretch goals attached to how many backers we have. Here's the breakdown:\n 300 Backers: Iconic Mech Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 400 Backers: Logo Wallpapers (for desktop and phone) - ACHIEVED! \n 500 Backers: Company Catalog Wallpapers  - ACHIEVED! \n 1000+ Backers: Access to CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO, a sealed Union Intelligence Bureau report. -  ACHIEVED! \n CLOCKMAKER'S BARDO Report unlocked.

Expect a Twine game to be delivered no later than the physical copy's launch date. \nClick through for the social stretch goals\nAs we gain in backers, we will release the art and details for the four Long Rim mechs above, so stay posted!\nWe amazingly blew through our first stretch goals in the first 6 hours of this campaign. This means all backers at the PDF tier and up will receive digital copies of No Room for a Wallflower, Lancer's first official campaign module, and three Field Guides, setting and lore guides for the various areas of the Lancer canon. Delivery for these digital-only rewards will be some time in 2020.\nSince we're predicting our physical book will be ready to ship no later than March 2020, and shipping quotes are only good for a brief window (comparatively speaking) we're going to hold off on charging shipping fees right away; we don't want to under charge now and then have to charge you again when it comes time to fulfill your pledges!\nAs soon as we're ready to ship, we'll send out a notice via BackerKit \u2014 that way we can ensure you'll have the best possible price on shipping. So, for right now, you don't have to add anything to your pledge beyond the stated pledge level! \nIn the meantime, here's an idea of what we're projecting for shipping costs (subject to change, of course, all prices in USD):\nDomestic shipping (US) will run a flat $12.00.\nCanada, UK, EU, Australia, China, Hong Kong, and Japan is a flat $25.00 USD.\nShipping to New Zealand is $27.00 USD\nShipping to Switzerland and Norway is $45.00 USD. \nAnd shipping to the rest of the world is $51.00 USD.\nNote that these are all subject to change. If you're snagging a physical book, be on the lookout for further communications via BackerKit. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe know backing TTRPG campaigns from new developers can be a risk, but we want to assure you that Lancer is a safe bet. While this is Massif Press' first campaign, we are confident in our timeline and our product. \n\nHere's why:\n\nThe text for the Core Book is done save for a final copyedit and layout, has been available in progressive editions for free since July 2017, and has a robust play and homebrew community. If you're new to Lancer or on the fence about backing, you can check out the full game for free, request a PDF of an older edition, or come chat with the dev team and homebrew/fan community on the Discord. We're passionate about this project, and intend to use the funds raised by this campaign to pay our layout artist, editor, and general artists to polish this book with the finish we feel it -- and its fans -- deserve. \n\nSo, to that end, here are the risks we face: \n\nDeadlines. As soon as the campaign wraps and we can pay our team, they'll get working on art, editing, and layout. As long as they stick on deadline, we'll meet our final PDF fulfillment date. We don't anticipate any delays as long as we are able to get deliveries from our art team on time.\n\nPrinting. Once our final PDF is sorted out, we'll be working with our printer to get the first run of books on time. As soon as the final product is proofed and the first run is printed, we'll get physical copies sent to the backers that pledged for them. Time and shipping are the risks here -- we'll be communicative and up front with all backers who come in at this level, and expect physical fulfillment no later than March 2020. In the meantime, you'll always have access to the free PDF, and the Premium PDF as soon as it's finished.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Ominet Access", "descp": ">//ACCESS is TRUE and PERSISTENT\nWant to follow along with development?

Take care of your island and customize it as you want. Explore an open ocean full of places to travel and people to meet and trade with.\nSet in a tropical ocean, Summer in Mara is a single-player game about farming and crafting, with an easy-RPG system and exploration elements. You'll be Koa, a little adventurer who has to take care of her own island.\nYou can also sail away on your boat and discover new different islands. With new islands come new people. You will trade and bargain or just chat with them. Getting to know these people is a significant part of the game because every one of them has their own unique and exciting story.\nAfterward, you can go back to your island and manage your resources to improve your home, grow new crops and create new structures.\nThis is the circle of life: take care of your home island, travel through the ocean to get new items and help others, and then come back to your home.    \nSummer in Mara is a calm and relaxing experience with a handmade look and a compelling narrative.\nMore than 150 quests to make the world a better place.   \n  Over 20 characters to meet and trade with. Befriend them! \n More than 130 inventory items to craft, use, and trade. \n Improve your boat, make it bigger and faster.  \n Unlock and acquire new skills and abilities for Koa, helping her to craft, trade and explore in an easy-RPG system. \n Day and night cycle with climate events.\n      We have been developing a game that not only feels great but is also a ton of fun. Full of things to do, in Summer in Mara you will take care of your own island by sowing and harvesting your crop fields, planting and chopping down trees and mining. You will also be able to craft brand new tools and materials to build structures and improve the ones you already have.\nBut the adventure doesn't stop there. You will be fishing, swimming, and diving in the ocean. With your boat, you can sail through the sea, discover new islands and seek for treasures.\nTake care of your island. \n  Explore the ocean. \nImprove your home.\n Sail away.\n  The game is inspired by the exploration in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, the farming in Stardew Valley, the visual aspect of Studio Ghibli\u2019s movies and the adventure feeling of your childhood summers. It\u2019s also part of the Deiland universe, although it is an independent and unique adventure with its own story.\n   We will release the game on PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One and Windows and MacOS in Steam. \n       The game will be in English, Spanish, German, French, Dutch, Japanese, Valencian and Galician when it is released.\nWe would love to have the game in all the languages possible, but we're going to need  50 backers to translate the game to Russian, Japanese, and Chinese to translate the game into these languages. So, share this campaign with a friend and help us to reach this goal!\n\nIf you want Summer in Mara in another language, leave us a comment and we'll see if we can make it possible. \nOn the planet Q\u00fc, Mara is the ocean that brings life to our islands and our lives. You\u2019re Koa, a little adventurer who has to take care of her home island. She has never seen the outside world beyond this island, but the ocean has always called her. \nKoa has always lived with her grandma, Yaya Haku, a very strict old q\u00fcido. Yaya Haku allows Koa to go wherever she wants on the island. But there is a big door on a cliff and Koa can't touch or do anything to it. Surrounded in mystery, this door keeps a secret that only Yaya Haku knows about.\nNow, Mara ocean is in danger. An evil corporation from another planet has arrived at planet Q\u00fc, attracted by a strange energy that emerges from the sea. They're the Elit and they want to conquer and exploit Mara's resources. \n    Mara is an ocean full of life, with a lot of exciting things to do and see. Don't miss the city island or the pirates racing through the sea and take very good care when you reach to the Storm Belt in the south. That's just a few of the things that you can find in the Mara ocean. \nHome Island\nYour island. It has a beautiful beach, an enormous mountain, and a strange door. This is the place where Koa grew up and the only home that she knows. Taking care of an entire island is a lot of work, but Koa likes it.  However, she wants to venture outside and discover new places.\nCity Island\n\nA lot of different q\u00fcidos and humans (even an elit!) live on this island. They have their business, such as the fish market, the restaurant, the bank, and the forge. On the edge of the cliff, there is a lighthouse where a strange and lonely shadow lives. \nDesert Island\n\nIt seems like an empty island, but you will have to look closer. The most relevant thing in this place is a hive of strange creatures. If somebody lives here, it might be because they don't want to be found. \nSmall Islands\n\nAll across Mara are little islands scattered about. You can find treasures, new items, and mythical creatures on these small islands. \n  Koa\nThe main protagonist of Summer in Mara, Koa is a little adventurer who wants to explore the world, but she can\u2019t leave her home island. She's always barefoot and has a name for every seagull on the island.\nYaya Haku\n\nYaya Haku takes care of Koa and their island, but she\u2019s old, and she can\u2019t do all the things that she used to do. She\u2019s very strict with Koa because she thinks that discipline is essential for surviving. Yaya Haku has a fantastic past, but few people know about it.\nNapopo\n\nNapopo, like all of the creatures of her race, cares very much for the other species that live in the ocean. Also, she can feel if someone is pure at heart or a dangerous person. They\u2019re not fighters, but they won\u2019t let evil prevail, and they will do everything they can to fight it. \nOther Characters\n\nThere\u2019re a lot of q\u00fcidos, humans and other species living in Mara. Almost everyone is friendly and all of them need a little help. \n\nThere aren't factions in Mara, just different lifestyles. For example, the Q\u00fcido are the principal inhabitants of the planet. They always help one another and don't have a ruler or a leader. At sea, you can find the Q\u00fc Navy, guardians and explorers of Mara, and the Pirates, people who only trust themselves. Recently, the Elit, a corporation from another planet, appeared on Q\u00fc. \nThe Q\u00fcido are a strange race, but they're pretty calm. They are fishers, merchants, cooks, explorers\u2026 They can live for 200 years, and there are stories about 500 years-old Q\u00fcido. Also, they can change their color under certain circumstances.\n  The Q\u00fc Navy is an old institution where the boldest and the brightest are trained to guard and explore Q\u00fc, the planet of the Q\u00fcido. Their primary objective is to protect the peace in the ocean and help others.\n    In Mara, the pirates tend to race a lot for ridiculous prizes and fight each other for no reason. They\u2019re always running away from the Navy and even have their own island too. Among these fierce pirates, you can find Ereti, the fastest pirate in Mara, Mr. Ecco, an old and not-so-trustworthy man, Litio, the lawful evil outlaw, or Rigatta, the Elit pirate. \n     An evil corporation from another planet. They travel from one world to another, exploiting their resources and destroying them. The Elit need the dadiva fruit to survive, and that\u2019s why their skin is purple.\n \nWe want to give you the most beautiful and summer-like game possible. These are just a sample of our work, with character designs, concepts, illustrations and background pictures that you will see in the final product.\n       We start with 2D concepts of all the characters and buildings. From them, we work to get a 3D model that feels similar to the first idea. In the case of the characters, after the 3D model, we made the animation, trying to convey the personality traits that every character has in particular.\n \nPaco Mitos, our musician from Deiland and the previous Chibig projects, is back for Summer in Mara, this time with a tropical feeling in his instrumental themes.       \n\nWe also have Adri\u00e1n Berenguer with us. He made the song that you can hear in the trailer. He also has other surprises for you. \n Check the sheet music for Marinera by Adri\u00e1n Berenguer.\n  As a sound designer, we have Jaime Almenar, who worked with us to make a fantastic atmosphere and bring life to all the creatures in Mara. \nThe animation that you saw in the trailer was made by Ciervo Alto, with a little help from our artists. We think it helps to convey the universe of the game, expanding through different media the story of Koa and Mara ocean.     \nWith your help we can create even more amazing 2D cinematics, working with our Ciervo Alto friends. We would love to make a cinematic opening and ending for the game, but it would only be possible if we reach certain stretch goals. \n           We have limited tiers with special rewards, so stay tunned to our Kickstarter page because you never know what surprises could be!\n\n  How do add-ons work?\nPress the \"Manage your pledge\" button on the top of this page.  \n Remember to add the shipping costs for physical rewards (physical artbook, postcards, print and diorama): 5\u20ac for Spain 10\u20ac for Europe and 20\u20ac for the rest of the world. \nIncrease your pledge in the \"Pledge amount\" with the quantity needed to claim the add-on(s).  \n Save your pledge. \nAfter the campaign, we will send you a survey asking what add-ons you want.\nChibig Studio has been making games since 2016. In 2016, we launched Tiny Planet and Ankora for iOS and Android. Today, those games have over 3 million players.\nLast year, we launched Deiland for PS4 and PC, after a successful Kickstarter. We sold over 20.000 copies, and it\u2019s a massive hit for us. A small community was built around this game, with content creators and fans taking care of their own tiny planet.\n   We also count on Vicente Molina as a 3D modeler to help us with the project. \nYou can learn more about us on our website: Chibig.com\nOur previous experience with Kickstarter was a great success for us. We funded the project in five days, and we reached four stretch goals. After that, we launched the game for PS4 and PC, and everyone received their rewards on time.\nKickstarter and our community were so kind to us that we want to share our new game with all of you and give you the chance to get the game before anyone else.\nSummer in Mara has been in development for six months now. We can finish the game on our own, but we want to involve you in this development. With your help, we can make the best possible version of Summer in Mara. \nWe will launch Summer in Mara for PC, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. We want to take the game to Xbox One, but our resources are limited, and we need you to smash that stretch goal. \n        This campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $250MM through crowdfunding.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChibig Studio is a small indie game studio. Even though we learned a lot from the development and launch of Deiland, we\u2019re still learning from this experience. Summer in Mara is our second game, and we will launch it, with or without Kickstarter. \n\nWe think we might have a struggle with the Nintendo Switch version since it\u2019s the first port for this console that we have done. Also, translating the game to many languages is, for us, a resource problem, since it costs a lot to be a hundred percent right. And, lastly, we want to add some extras to the game, and we can only do that with this Kickstarter and its stretch goals.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac16 or more", "title": "SAILOR OF MARA", "descp": "Get a digital copy of Summer in Mara\nINCLUDES:\nDigital download of Summer in Mara for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Sailor'\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["5,854 backers", "Limited (6 left of 5860)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "TOURIST IN MARA", "descp": "Pre-Launch Access: Get the game before anyone else!\nGet the artbook in a digital edition and a postcard about the game right at your home.\nINCLUDES:\nPre-Launch Access: Digital Download for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Sailor'\nDigital download of Art Book with designs, concept art and more.\nPhysical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,369 backers", "Limited (11 left of 1380)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac30 or more", "title": "SINGER IN MARA", "descp": "All the above and a digital download of the Summer in Mara OST by Paco Mitos & Adri\u00e1n Berenguer.\nINCLUDES:\nPre-Launch Access: Digital Download for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Sailor'\nDigital download of Art Book with designs, concept art and more.\nDigital download of Summer in Mara OST.\nPhysical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["627 backers", "Limited (23 left of 650)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "ARTIST IN MARA", "descp": "The Summer in Mara physical art book, each copy is numbered and signed, and an exclusive print.\nThis reward DOES NOT include the game.\nINCLUDES:\nPhysical art book, each copy is numbered and signed.\nExclusive print of Summer in Mara numbered and signed.\nDigital download of Art Book with designs, concept art and more.\nDigital download of Summer in Mara OST.\nPhysical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.\nYour name in the credits as 'Sailor'", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["49 backers", "Limited (6 left of 55)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "THE BEST FRIENDS OF MARA", "descp": "Two copies of the game, with four postcards and two exclusive prints, for you and your pal.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Pre-Launch Access: Digital Download for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Sailor'\n2\u00d7 Exclusive print of Summer in Mara numbered and signed.\n4\u00d7 Physical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\n2\u00d7 Welcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["170 backers", "Limited (30 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac75 or more", "title": "CAPTAIN ART OF MARA", "descp": "The game, the physical artbook, four postcards, one print and everything else.\nINCLUDES:\nPre-Launch Access: Digital Download for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Captain'\nPhysical art book, each copy is numbered and signed.\nExclusive print of Summer in Mara numbered and signed.\n4\u00d7 Physical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\nDigital download of Summer in Mara OST.\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["205 backers", "Limited (15 left of 220)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac120 or more", "title": "COLONEL DIORAMA OF MARA", "descp": "All of the above and a diorama of Summer in Mara and its amazing beaches.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Pre-Launch Access: Digital Download for PC, PS4 or Switch.\nYour name in the credits as 'Captain'\nDiorama of Summer in Mara.\nPhysical art book, each copy is numbered and signed.\nDigital download of Art Book with designs, concept art and more.\nDigital download of Summer in Mara OST.\nExclusive print of Summer in Mara numbered and signed.\n4\u00d7 Physical copy of Summer in Mara postcard.\nWelcome Pack: Wallpapers for Mobile and PC and other goodies.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["36 backers", "Limited (4 left of 40)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1,500 or more", "title": "NAME A MARA ISLAND", "descp": "All of the above, plus you can put a name to an island in Mara.

In the course of their journey, they will travel through a wide array of diverse landscapes spanning from wind-tanned plateaus and exotic archipelagos to sunken cities and forgotten dungeons.\nDiscoveries to be made around every corner: Take your time to discover a world brimming with surprises. Expect to find concealed locations, such as caves behind waterfalls where mad hermits have made their homes, as well as sewers filled with hungry krakens, hidden villages built inside of crashed airships or even a dungeon found in the belly of a giant sandworm.\nReady to enter the dungeon inside the sandworm?\nMethods of traversal: Your heroes can run, climb, swim and even board a Mech in order to find loot-filled treasure chests and monsters that are ready to drop rare crafting materials.\nLook out for different ways to reach your treasures\nBattles take place in a fast paced turn-based battle system. There are no random encounters in Chained Echoes. You can see your foe on the map and fight it exactly at the place where you engage it. There is no separate battle screen. Everything is fluid and on point.\nNo separate battle arena. Right into the battle.\nNo random encounters: No separate battle screen means that every battle takes place in a unique area. The player can take advantage of that environment. See that chandelier hanging above the enemies? Cut the rope and let it come crashing down on them.\nUse the environment to your advantage!\nDepth built on simplicity: The battles are built on systems that are easy to learn but require strategic thinking to master. In a unique tag team system, your characters can switch other allies into battle in order to trigger certain skills, obtain overdrive bonuses and access a wider array of abilities. Every action you and your enemies take moves the party\u2019s position on the overdrive bar. Your effectiveness in battle depends on this position and under certain conditions even allows the use of special attacks. But moving too far on that bar will have dramatic consequences for you and your party.\nUse your skills and reach the overdrive mode for extra damage\nEverything a RPG lover\u2019s heart wishes for: find treasure chests, defeat strong enemies, buy equipment, pimp it or craft it anew, gather, take on side quests, analyze your stats and learn new skills. Being a proper RPG, you will find all the features you would expect and more.\nLearn, set & upgrade your skills! (mockup)\nYour second skin: Expand the possibilities of your traversal. No river, plateau or canyon shall hinder your thirst for exploration. Board your mechs to reach isolated places. Equip them with a wide arsenal of mechanical parts and weapons and set one of your characters as the pilot to fight against bigger foes up in the sky.\nSpeed up your travels!\nCustomize your mech (mockup)\nTake it even higher: In the course of the game, you will get your very own airship. Explore the continent of Valandis and the seas around it on a classic JRPG styled world map. Similar to your mech, you can equip it with powerful upgrades, assign your characters (depending on their skill) to positions like the bridge, machine room and more, all to fight against your enemy\u2019s armies in massive battles across the skies.\nOptimize your airships for battle\nThe continent of Valandis and its three kingdoms are just recovering from a war that had lasted for over a century. The land is devastated, towns lie in ruins, monsters roam throughout the night and noblemen who have lost their lands and ranks organize themselves in bandit groups. In spite of all this, after a war that had lasted for generations, this is the first time the people of Valandis can finally experience peace. For this reason, on the second anniversary of the peace treaty, the southern Kingdom of Fonset is holding the biggest festival the land has seen in a long time. The streets are full of colorful food and loud music. People are dancing and laughing. Lords and ladies from all over the continent are invited to an extravagant banquet inside the castle. \nJoin our heroes on their quest through Valandis\nOn that commemorative night, our group of heroes are also present at this event, each member with a different agenda. There is Victor, a world-renowned celebrity known for writing the most enchanting stage plays. He had been invited as a guest of honor. We have Sienna, a con artist who tries to take advantage of all the wealth streaming into the city. In attendance is the Princess Lenne, who fled her country in search of a special place and ended up - after a series of coincidences - as one of the palace guards, without anyone knowing her true identity. Always at her side is Robb, her bodyguard and childhood friend. And lastly, there is Glenn and Kylian, former mercenaries on a secret mission to infiltrate the palace. \nBut things do not go according to plan for anyone on this fateful night; the festival is hit by a disaster, which leads to a chain of unforeseen events. In the end, it causes a new war that is much worse than anything previously seen, surrounding a newly discovered weapon of mass destruction.  Our group of heroes are swept into this maelstrom and find themselves on a new mission:\nTo stop the war and destroy this devastating, god-made weapon, the Grand Grimoire.\nThe PSX inspired music for Chained Echoes is written by the talented Eddie Marianukroh. Listen to a selection of released songs from the game\u2019s original soundtrack on his Soundcloud.\nYou will be credited as a backer in the game\u2019s credits (5\u20ac tier): Thanks to you, this game can become a reality.

Together with a quote of your choice.\nYou will be credited as \"World Builder\" (150\u20ac tier): Being a backer of the designer tier will get you credited in a special designer section of the game\u2019s credits. Since those tiers are limited, you will get even more exposure inside the game\u2019s credits.\nDesign a monster/boss/NPC/mech/airship/quest (250\u20ac+ tier): If you would love to add an idea to Chained Echoes, you can choose one of the designer tiers.\nSome examples of what you could design\nCurrently, most basic systems for Chained Echoes are implemented. The most complex systems that still need to be done are the main menu and the mech and sky battles (the last two are based almost completely on the normal battle system but with some tweaks that make them play out differently).\nAfter this, it's time to fill the game with content. The game is currently scheduled to be released in September 2021. Check out the road map below for an overview.\nChained Echoes has been in development for around 2 1/2 years now, with me working on this game in the evenings after my day job. Making a game of this scale needs a lot of preparations. Before starting the crowdfunding campaign, I wanted to have all the things that made exact time management difficult coded first. Now in 2019, I\u2019m at a point where most of the basic systems are finished and I can schedule things exactly. I know my goal. And I can assess what I need to get there.\nSince this is a classic RPG where exploration and cutscenes are vital parts of the experience, a LOT of assets need to be created. The funds are needed so that I\u2019m able to concentrate on producing this content for the next 2 years, pay licenses and other things I list in the budget breakdown graphic below. It is also needed for Eddie to produce an awesome soundtrack. In this campaign, I\u2019m not only asking for your money, but also for your support, in order to create a game that we all can appreciate.\nJust one year ago I started my social media presence on Twitter and since then both my personal account and the game's channel have grown significantly. Thanks to that, I got to know a lot of nice people, which I\u2019m really grateful for! You can join us either on Twitter or in our Discord channel, too.  \nIf you have any kind of feedback or just want to say hello, feel free to send me a message on any of those channels!\n(psst, you can also follow my private twitter account here: https://twitter.com/arkheiral )\nYou can customize your reward tier by adding the above items to your rewards. \nMore add-ons will be available throughout the campaign.\nShipping costs: If you choose a physical add-on you need to add shipping costs to your pledge:\nIf the hardcover artbook is one of your add-ons the shipping costs are: 20\u20ac worldwide, 10\u20ac EU, 5\u20ac Germany.\nIf the hardcover artbook is not one of your add-ons the shipping costs are: 10\u20ac worldwide, 5\u20ac EU, 3\u20ac Germany.\nIf you have already paid for shipping through your pledge tier, you don't need to add any shipping costs.\nHow to: In order to get an add-on, you don't need to change your reward tier. Instead you need to raise your pledge amount by the cost of the add-on (e.g. add 15\u20ac to get the additional game copy). Every tier above the \"Thank you\" tier is allowed to get add-ons.\nFollow the steps below to raise your pledge amount:\nStep 1: Click \u201cManage your pledge\u201d on Kickstarter's main page.\n  Step 2: Click \u201cChange your pledge\u201d next.\n Step 3: Enter your new pledge amount and click on \"Continue.\"\n Step 4: Confirm your changes by clicking the \"Confirm\" button.\n After the campaign, you will be able to specify what add-ons the money should be used for (e.g., if you raised your pledge by 15\u20ac, you can choose for an additional game copy).\nYou can also get two additional copies, if you like. You just need to raise your pledge by 30\u20ac.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.\nhttp://jellopcrowdfunding.com/?utm_source=Chained_echoes", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking as an indie developer always comes with some risks like misjudging the scope and budget of a game. But I used the last few years to improve my work routine, to calculate exactly how long I need for any kind of content and to finish all the systems that would make planning hard. I used the last 2 \u00bd years not only to develop the game but also to plan on how to handle the risks and how to get the right balance between polishing features and getting them finished. I learned what I\u2019m capable of and when I need to get the help of others.\n\nOf course, sometimes things will go a little different than planned. But I'll try to make sure that this only happens on a smaller scale. And most importantly: I will be as transparent with you as I have been in the past and keep you all updated throughout the development.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nYou'll be credited as \"Adventurers of Valandis\"\nAccess to exclusive Kickstarter updates\nExclusive Wallpaper", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["43 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac17 or more", "title": "Basic Pack", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nDigital copy of the game\nDigital game manual\nYou'll be credited as \"Brave Knights of Valandis\"\nExclusive Wallpaper\nAccess to exclusive Kickstarter updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2021"}], "stat": ["3,026 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "Supporter Pack", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nDigital copy of the game\nBeta -

At the writing of this paragraph (12 hours before the campaign ends), we just broke through the $AU50,000 barrier, external PayPal pledges included. This means Portuguese, Polish and Italian translations, plus one scene in which Eevi's cat becomes a playable character! Thanks so much, ladies and gentlemen! <3\nBorn Punk is a point & click adventure! It's a cyberpunk adventure! It's science-fiction too! Now that the buzzwords are out of the way, let us explain this in a less sensational manner: Born Punk is a game in the style of the 80s and 90s point & click classics like Monkey Island, Gabriel Knight and Beneath A Steel Sky, that wants to deliver an intriguing storyline and logical, non-outlandish puzzles - which admittedly, were a bane of ye olden games. \nWe want to combine the best of both worlds, the old and the new: keep what made point & clicks great, and replace what made them tedious. Last but not least, Born Punk is a love letter to hope: even though cyberpunk traditionally is a dark and edgy genre, we firmly believe that most forms of popular sci-fi (and cyberpunk is definitely part of sci-fi!) delve too deeply into 'depressive territory'. Whilst we are here to tell a story about tragedy and strife, we also want to tell a story about how in the middle of despair and anguish, there's always an acorn (or even loads of them!) of hope to be found.\nActions (and gameplay demos) speak louder than a 1000 words! Please feel free to download our demo (for Windows, Mac, and Linux) to test our game for yourself here. \nIf you for whatever reason can't play the demo (or can't be bothered), here's a gameplay video for your convenience: \nAnd now, let's get to the nitty gritty details.\nLet us give you a bullet point list TL;DR of what we think makes Born Punk special, or rather, we think is noteworthy about our baby, before we delve deeper into the details:\n Choices and consequences: often, it's possible to approach dialogs and puzzles from different angles. As a result, potential interactions with other characters, the difficulty to overcome certain obstacles, and the results of some actions will be slightly to majorly different.\n   A comprehensive cyberpunk universe: there's lots of background info to read and experience, which gets added to your PDA as you continue to interact with the gameworld. Lore nerds should be happy about this! Sometimes, in-game lore will also serve as a gameplay mechanic.\n   Full voice-overs: every character in Born Punk and every line will be voiced. Our main character's voice actress, Linsay Rousseau,  previously worked on Elder Scrolls: Legends, Fallout 76, Sailor Moon, and for Blizzard!\n   Cyberspace: the main character can enter the global net and surf through a VR world full of weird online personas and deadly counter-measure programs - meaning that the 'hacking' part of the game will be a much more wholesome experience than a simplistic mini-game or quicktime-event. \n   Music: The main theme and various other tracks are composed by Jeff Kurtenacker, composer of Wildstar and choral arranger of World of Warcraft. Jeff is joined by two other musicians (Jeff Miller, Javier Morales) to deliver a bombastic soundtrack. (see below for more details)\n   Graphics/Animations: our graphics and animations are done by Indrek Plavutski, formerly of Wadjeteye's Blackwell: Deception!  We try to capture the charm of the 90s, and mix in neat particle effects from today. \n   Veterans and newcomers welcome: Born Punk will not cater purely to nostalgic purists nor to hyper-modern tastes; we don't try to dumb things down to appease a streamlined gaming market nor are we trying to make things needlessly complicated just to stay true to the classics.\n Let's be serious, it's funny: it's cyberpunk, but with a hopeful, often humorous undertone. Point & click adventures without at least a bit of humour are unthinkable!\nPlease do pledge here on kickstarter if you can, but if you for whatever reason absolutely can't, please follow this link, which will take you to our PayPal donation page. There, please put in the $$$ amount that you want to pledge. If you are pledging at a level that will result in physical rewards for you, please also add your name/address. If you're going via the PayPal route, thank you so much for supporting us by taking those extra steps!\nThe game follows Eevi Rinasdottir, a former corporate combat hacker. Eevi grew up in the bad parts of Bornholm - of which there are many in 2155 - and was forcefully recruited by a mega-corporation called Mitsotomo. One decade later, Eevi was forced to return to the place of her humble beginnings, to work as a barkeep for her foster father, and to dream of returning to the glittering corporate lifestyle she had grown used to.\nIn the game, we meet Eevi as she is suffering an ungodly hangover, trying to prepare for a nightly 'data drill', a freelance hack meant to extract enough critical data from random targets to finance her comeback. What she doesn't know is that an electronic entity has infected her cyberdeck (think brain-computer-implant). At least at first glance, this entity - likely a rogue AI - seems just as confused about the situation as Eevi is.\nAs the story advances, the player will seek answers about the nature of the intruder, either come to terms with it or try to expel it from her body, struggle with suffering from what is essentially a digital multiple personality disorder (imagine having a self-aware talking program forced into your brain! ... actually, that sounds kinda cool), and ultimately uncover a conspiracy that could change humanity's future forever.\nAs should be painfully obvious by now, the game is set on the island of Bornholm, which is a Danish territory IRL. By 2155 - the year the game takes place in - Bornholm has transformed from a quaint holiday getaway with some interesting history to a proper mega-city, governed by a corporate council called The Conglomerate. Most importantly, the island hosts a space elevator; a gigantic construct used to transport goods and people into orbit for a fraction of the cost traditional methods would be able to. This has made the formerly obscure region a hot spot of 22nd century geo-politics. \nBorn Punk will feature many intriguing, unique, dark and wacky characters alike. But there's a few who you will likely see a lot of:\n Aaaand a few designs of the kind of characters you can expect in the future:\nThe final amount of locations/scenes in the game will heavily depend on our kickstarter success, or lack thereof. Should things go as we want and hope they will go, there will be about 40 different scenes in the final version of Born Punk.\nOn The Ragnarocks Bar\nThese scenes will include the bar 'On the Ragnarocks', various funky neon-coloured scenes in cyberspace itself, the seedy parts of town, the glittering streets of downtown Bornholm, a futuristic harbour, the local space elevator, and last but not least, one or more scenes in SPACE! You may not be as excited as the writer of this blurb, but come on, IT'S SPACE! It is not guaranteed though that you will see each and every one of these locations during one playthrough, as the decisions you make during gameplay may affect the storyline in a way that locks you out of certain progression paths. We do love us some choices and consequences!\nJeff Kurtenacker, composer of the bombastic soundtrack of the MMORPG Wildstar and former World of Warcraft choral arranger, is keen on delivering a VERY high quality soundtrack. I encourage you to check out his work on Wildstar here.    \nApart from Jeff Kurtenacker, we have two professional musicians (Javier Morales and Greetings Program) working on atmospheric tracks that will be playing in the background, tailored to dynamically switch according to the situation at hand.\n You can check out some soundtrack samples for yourself:\nYes there are!\nBorn Punk will release on all viable platforms for this kind of game. The UI and controls are designed with a PC in mind, and will be adjusted to different platforms according to their limitations. To be concrete, the game will release on:  \n   Windows (all stores that we can get the game on)\n Linux (same)\nmacOS \nPlaystation Store\nXbox Marketplace\n Nintendo eShop (likely solely for the Switch)\nAndroid\niOS \nAs so many things in regard to this production, our timeline depends entirely on our success on kickstarter. As the gameplay demo explains (please do play it if you haven't yet), we will finish the game no matter what, but I can't possibly give you any sort of precise timeline. In the case of everything going smoothly on this platform, we expect the game to be in development for 12 to 18 months. \nID22's lead is Falko. Falko has been a (PC) gamer ever since 1984. Sierra and LucasArts adventures were some of his most memorable experiences as a small child and teenager alike; memories that most definitely shaped his taste in games. In the late 90s, Falko developed a couple of freeware games, but was drawn into 'real life' too much to make a business out of that hobby.   Four years ago, Falko closed his business consultancy and translation business of 8 years, to move with (and for) his wife to Australia. \nIn the last 4 years, Falko has been producing gaming videos and streams professionally, but now it is time to move beyond merely playing and criticising games. As the film Ratatouille once said:\n\"In many ways, the work of a critic is easy. We risk very little yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgement. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read. But the bitter truth we critics must face is that, in the grand scheme of things, the average piece of junk is more meaningful than our criticism designating it so.\" \nFalko, Insert Disk 22 Founder\nFalko is joined by Indrek, an enormously talented graphics artist from Estonia. Indrek is blessing Born Punk with his love for both point & clicks and pixel art alike. Previously having been a background artist for Blackwell Deception by WadjetEye Games, as well as an industry designer, Indrek is able to contribute not only with his raw creativity, but also by counseling Falko on the intricacies of game developer life that he has experienced. Indrek is responsible for all animations and background graphics.\nIndrek in all his glory, being all focused and stuff\nJean Czerny, an architect and friend of Falko, is contributing concept art, maps and architectonic advice. He contributed to the movie Dwarves of Demrel as a concept artist and worked as an illustrator of card game Godforsaken Scavengers. \nJean being a professional artist.\n If you would like to stay up to date with the game development, you can follow us on the sites listed below.

During that year, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to fine-tuning the level design and the combat system. The result of our work so far can be seen in Tunche: Arena - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is 100% ready for release. \nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game, some of them planned but scrapped due to time and money constraints, others completely new.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince 2012, our team at LEAP Game Studios worked together on projects of different size and scale, including work-for-hire projects for Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, KFC and other recognizable brands. And while we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, no one can predict the future - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line.

We've taken Lore Finder as far as we currently can on our own, so we need your help! This project has a small scope, with realistic scale, and attainable goals. We want to be creators that this community can trust to deliver a fun game, on time, with help and feedback from you. \nSpeedrun Contest\nWe're running an any% speedrun contest for the demo which runs through December 23rd. The top three runners will be immortalized in the final release with trophies bearing their names and times, displayed inside the mansion. Additionally, anyone who submits a video of their run will be listed in the game's credits under a special speedrunner section.\n  Social Links\nWhat happened to turn the mansion into such a gallery of horrors? We'll be sending exclusive journal entries to give you a glimpse only to our mailing list, so make sure to subscribe! You can also follow the project through our various social media channels.\n  Lore Finder will initially be available for PC Windows on the Steam store at release. You can wishlist it on Steam now.\nMac and Linux\nThe game will be powered by the FNA library created by Ethan Lee, which is used in the Mac and Linux ports of games such as Eversion, Celeste, Salt and Sanctuary, FEZ, Rogue Legacy, Dust: An Elysian Tail, Bastion, Transistor, and even our very own MidBoss. Our Mac and Linux on release stretch goal has been met, so Lore Finder will releases simultaneously on Windows, Mac, and Linux!\nMore details can be found in this update post.\nConsoles\nIf fully funded, we will have a stretch goal to partner with Ratalaika Games, a porting and publishing company responsible for porting over two dozen games to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and the PS Vita handheld, to bring Lore Finder to all four of these consoles.\nLore Finder is a modern queer reimagining of the cosmic horror genre, taking influences from the various games and literary works in the genre first inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, set in the latter half of the 20th century. It is the story of K.C. Morgan (a non-binary character) who is a Private Investigator turned Paranormal Investigator after the disappearance of their father, Richard Morgan, a professor and researcher at Boston University. Eventually, their search takes them to a mansion owned by the Wright family on an island off the New England Coast.\nOnce there K.C. discovers that the residents and staff have been horribly corrupted by some twisted occult influence, the only clues as to their fate, and the fate of their father seems to be found within scrolls, written on human skin, filled with dark forbidden lore so terrible that it may rend the very fabric of reality itself.\nMatters become even more disturbing once K.C. begins to explore the basement. Evidence of terrible, inhuman experiments lie discarded next to twisted bodies and implements of torture.\nAlone, and facing terror, madness, and corruption, not only all around them, but also within their very soul,  K.C. must work their way through the mansion, risking death, madness or worse in an attempt to uncover what happened to the inhabitants of the mansion, and their father. \nDramatis Personae\nK.C. Morgan (The protagonist)\nAs a genderqueer non-binary person in the latter half of the 20th century, K.C. lives outside mainstream society, making ends meet as a Private Investigator. That all changed when their father went missing. Searching for clues K.C. turned up nonsensical writing from their father about things from beyond this reality, things that aren't perceived by most people.\nFollowing the trail, K.C. started taking on jobs steeped in all sorts of occult weirdness, the better to understand what had happened to their father. Eventually, they took on the job of Paranormal Investigator as a fulltime position, which at least saved some money on the office letterhead. \nK.C. is a skilled shot with their .38 special revolver, with the grit and resolve to match, but what they'll find in the New England mansion will test even their limits.\nPamela Jones (The girlfriend)\nA librarian who started dating K.C. after they came into the library often enough with odd requests on niche, paranormal subjects. Pamela cares about and supports K.C. in their quest, but doesn't really believe in the supernatural. Or at least, so she thought.\nPamela had responded about a job at the Wright mansion, to tutor their only child, but once there an odd feeling of unease overcame her. She could swear there were things moving in the corner of her eyes, but if she turned to look they were gone. Upon hearing K.C. was going to this very same mansion Pamela tried to reach K.C on the phone, but only got their answering machine, leaving a message begging them not to go.\nThe Wright family\nAn affluent family living off the New England shore in a mansion on an isolated island, only reachable by ferry, with staff living on-site in the servant's quarters.\nBertram (The Wright Family patriarch)\nHead of the household, Bertram is an aspiring scientist and mathematician. A patron of the sciences and intellectuals, Bertram hosts many parties at his mansion for intellectuals, scientists, academics, and philosophers. However, he feels continuously frustrated by his inability to genuinely contribute, instead of merely aspiring to, and has been known on occasion to go into fits of dark brooding for days at a time when feelings of frustration and inadequacy build to intolerable levels, setting the entire household on edge.\nRosemary (The Wright Family matriarch) \nBertram's wife and a prolific artist. Though her specialty is in the visual arts, she dabbles in many forms and media. A quiet, reserved soul, she prefers smaller, more personal gatherings. She will spend long periods of time isolated in her art studio, engrossed in her work, with nothing but the sound of the radio to keep her company.\nThe Only Child (The Wright Family heir)\nBertram and Rosemary's child. With busy parents, and only staff around on the isolated island, the child is often bored and lonely. As a result, the child has an imaginary friend.\nMinions of Chaos and Corruption \nCultist\nMost of these poor lost souls were at the mansion when everything went wrong, and have fallen victim to the corruption within. Some other unfortunates have been drawn to the mansion and the darkness within like moths to a flame, enthralled and corrupted even before reaching their destination. Whatever the source of their dark genesis, they have all become dark, twisted monsters whose still human visage is all the more horrible for being only skin deep.\nGazer\nA creature hidden from sight until one's eyes are truly opened. These bat-like creatures fly around, their single putrid-green eye splitting into a gaping maw of teeth when anything comes near, swooping down in a vicious attack.\nThey also make for a really cute plushie!\nTurned Cultist\nThis grotesque shambling corpse that was once a man seems to be infested with something. Tentacles cover their face and seem to function as eyes, with a larger tentacle protruding from the mouth which seems to propel the corpse forward. At the back of their neck some slick mass pulsates.\nNon-Euclidean Horror Algarott\nA vision of nightmares brought to life, Algarott dwells in the places between, and can travel through geometry composed of straight angles. Its skin \u2013 if it can be called that \u2013 is a sickly ooze, creeping over its form and randomly erupting into grasping tendrils that appear to have a mind of their own. Gaps in the ooze reveal the flesh underneath. Its torso is shaped like a dog's, and its hindquarters like a horse, though with hooves that instead turn into slithering tentacles, while its tail has another gaping maw.\nAnd more!\nWant to discover what other dark and twisted horrors can that we come up with? Fund the campaign and find out!\nAs you can see by playing the demo, a substantial amount of work on the game has already been completed, which is why we're asking for a lower initial funding amount to complete the rest of the game and deliver a completed project.\nFor the initial $10,000 goal, the breakdown is as follows: \nQ: But where are the fees, shipping costs and such?\nA: We believe so strongly in this project that, if it is funded, we will cover taxes, fees, and other expenses on the initial funding goal out of our own pocket.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKitsune Games is an indie studio that has been around for nearly 6 years, and the team collectively has over 20 years of industry experience and has worked on and shipped many games.\n\nLore Finder itself is already reasonably well developed, as we feel the demo shows. We've added a generous overflow buffer of time to complete the project for our estimate, and we've chosen stretch goals that are fun for you, the backers, but won't cause giant delays in the completion of the game.\n\nWhile there's a risk backing any kind of project on Kickstarter, we feel confident that if we hit our funding goal we can deliver the product described within budget and on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Credits", "descp": "Get your name in the credits, and stay up to date on the project including beta testing information.\nINCLUDES:\nBacker name in credits\nOur heartfelt thanks!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "Receive a digital copy of the game via Steam key for Windows (available on release), Mac, and Linux.

We are also hoping to bring it to the Nintendo Switch and other consoles on the same timescale, with your help! Hazelnut Bastille is a lush, topdown Zelda-like ARPG. It features a complex, characters-driven narrative that deals with timeless life and social issues. It features a real-time, highly tactical combat system where the player needs to carefully read the screen and look at each room as a novel challenge. There is also a central focus on sequential and lateral thinking puzzles, which ramp up in difficulty quickly as the player is introduced to new ideas.\nBest of all, all of this is presented in a glorious 16-bit character, where everything from the art style and content, sound, music.... even the camera and transitions are authentic to the game experiences of 1994. In our quest for period greatness, we have even enlisted the help of one of the great composers straight out of this time, the famed Hiroki Kikuta, best known for his Secret of Mana OST at Square in '93. And the similarity isn't merely skin-deep. We have striven to deconstruct the classics of the SNES to extract all of the superior design principles behind their mechanics and level design, to understand exactly what made them so peerlessly great, even by today's terms. We hope you will come with us in our quest to bring the rigor and polish of the past back to today's gaming scene!\nHazelnut Bastille is the story of a young woman who has just arrived on the shores of a savage, foreign land for the first time. She casts a haunted figure, and has come to seek the fabled knowledge of a race of long-dead ancients on the edge of the world, in hopes of finding a way to reclaim something which was lost to her. Along the way, she meets the other inhabitants of this undiscovered country: a band of castouts and pariahs from the old world, all seeking to make a new life in a place far away from their old troubles. Her story will become entangled with theirs, as they each lean on one another for their own needs, and slowly she will get to know exactly who each of these strange bedfellows are, and what they have themselves run from in their old lives.\nAs she gets closer to her goals, new troubles and woes reveal themselves like nested matryoshka dolls. When things seem their darkest, that is when she meets a cryptic stranger- someone who can recite her life story as soon as set eyes on her- and the real journey begins! She will set foot in halls lost to time, and gain dominion over the very forces behind the natural order, but will it be enough to find what she is looking for?\nThe Art of Hazelnut Bastille is a result of combining the charming 16x16-grid style of the early 90's with modern color-selection sensibilities. Part of the clarity of games from this era was the extra emphasis on clearly-defined edges and regular collision bounds, which while perhaps being necessitated by degradation of the picture on CRT displays, also creates a super-readable experience of gameplay which we still heavily appreciate to this day, even with the constraints of that period now lifted. In the great standout examples, a scene reads as a collection of symbols by which the player can immediately appraise their situation, and the most important information is at the visual foreground.\nThe high degree of modularity this system allows creates a sort of functional skeleton, where a discrete number of niches are created for the art to fill. For instance, in the dungeon setting, when the wall width is held constant, there are wall segments, doors, interior corners, exterior corners, column pieces, negative collision space, and positive collision space assets. Despite their variations, their utility defines what is needed.\nAnother trait of the 16-bit era that we really admire is the economy of color selection. Most surfaces have between 3-8 color values. This was partially a result of needing to meet the requirement of no more than 4 palettes of 16 colors each per scene, but the crisp contrasts this limited and unified palette helps to create is incredibly striking, and something we are emulating in all of our game art.\nHazelnut Bastille's gameplay experience rests on four pillars: exploration, puzzle solving, combat, and the complex inventory system which brings the player into regular contact with the game's background storytelling. These systems are used in concert to keep the player engaged with the expansive world, in which they need to solve problems of several types in an overlapping continuity.\nThe world itself is like a character in the story in its own sense, and the first one you will meet. At times seemingly inviting, it is also offers ample resistance to exploration into new domains. The player will have to find ways to expand their range to new regions in an ever-widening expanse. Sometimes they may be inhibited by hard barriers, and other times only by the barrier of their own resolve. They will gradually find new ways to traverse this world, however, so while the world gets ever bigger, they will acquire abilities and shortcuts which get them to where they want to go at a rate which offsets the expanding map. The world is subdivided into a number of regions which have their own local traits and stories as well. The accretion of history over the ages is written all over the land like a book to be read.\nThe puzzles of Hazelnut Bastille grow to be quite demanding. They are designed around the old standard system of introducing concepts one at a time, and then testing the player later on whether they have fully understood the real lessons behind their logic. The more concepts that enter the player's working memory, the more rigorous these puzzles will grow to be, until they are using 5 or more ideas, and several game mechanics in concert to solve problems in 8 steps! Fear not though, for while the puzzles toward the end of the game will make you feel quite accomplished for having worked them out, the mental tools for solving them will be gradually supplied and reinforced over the course of our Heroine's journeys!\nThe combat system takes a lot of nods from the great topdown adventures of the 80's and 90's. While the movement of the player is freed from the tile grid, enemy motion uses the grid tiles as the basic unit. Everything revolves around movement patterns and probabilities, as well as the distinctive attack patterns and directional traits each enemy has. The result is a system that creates complexity by combining simple, known elements in novel situations. Enemies are also heavily predictable if the player makes note of the patterns and traits of each, meaning they can be assembled into rooms that are quite crowded for safe space, but which the player can safely negotiate if they plot out the likely vectors each actor will take in their head. As the player you aren't so much concerned with individual enemies, as you are the state of the entire room, and where safety will be from moment to moment. This is something we recognized in studying our precedents: that while later games focused on the tactics of how to manage encounters with single enemies, the earlier ones focused on the meta-system of entire rooms, and it is a novel experience that isn't explored much today. Enemies also tend to fall into roles in rooms; some of them are softer targets, but have devastating ranged attacks; some of them are aggressive and tend to make up the hard vanguard; others play a support role, casting debuffs on the player. These roles are in some ways similar to turn-based combat in JRPGs, but executed in a real-time top-down setting.\nIt probably sounds strange to think of an inventory system as a central mechanic as opposed to just merely a question of interface, but games like Skyrim have proven that exactly what you have in your pocket, and what you plan to do with it can be governing concerns! Part of why that is in our case, is that the denizens peopling Hazelnut Bastille do not have a currency! As dwellers on forgotten frontier with no reliable contact with the rest of the world, items are valued in terms of what they can be traded for. Everyone has something they can contribute, and something they need themselves. Some of these things are simple, some of them are very rare and character-specific, and probably relate to what drives them in their own personal stories. As our heroine acquires items on her quest, she should keep in mind people she has met, and what their recent needs were. How much of what she acquires can she afford to use herself? How much should be put toward crafting useful intermediate products? How much should she reserve for the local barter commerce? The more she gets involved with the people around her, the deeper down the rabbit hole of their troubles she will go, and may acquire both shiny rare loot, and insight into what their own experiences are.\nAll along her quest, the heroine acquires a number of singular items which have mysterious power over the world. These items generally have applications across several domains at once: they can be used to traverse the world, create shortcuts, to as tools for puzzle solving, and usually in combat. Her relationship to the world and its dangers changes every time she finds one of these. The Dawnthorn also has its own power reserves which get magnified over time by other items she can acquire. This reserve can either be used for the special sword techniques of the Dawnthorn itself, or be focused through these other objects of power. These reserves regenerate over time, but the player should be careful not to deplete them too fast, as they will find themselves at much diminished capacity if they run dry at a tense moment. The player will also acquire a number of miscellaneous items which modify the traits of other items, or grant special abilities. They will also start to acquire a number of magic bands which can be worn to grant various small but critical benefits, but only in limited number.\nThe next class of items are generally much more common, and can be thought of more as commodities. These are the items which the player can consume on their own for various small benefits, or combine with other items in a basic crafting system to obtain slightly more special products from items of disparate locations. These are also the sorts of items which the NPC's are usually after, so the player should be careful to leave some for trading.    \nThe inventory screens also contain a map system, which keeps a record of everywhere the player has been, and the macro features of some spaces, such as where doors are located. They can also place colored markers on the map to remind themselves where points of interest are, for later.\nOne of the most striking things everyone remembers about the 16-bit era was the extremely memorable soundfont-based music. The preceding 8-bit era was known for its powerfully melody-driven 4-track audio featuring natively-synthesized wave instruments; Sony's soundcard for the SNES, however, upped the number of sound-channels to 8, and introduced music built out of small instrument sample libraries. The result was that the tracks of this time have this wonderful trait of occupying a strangely satisfying middle ground between synthetic and acoustic music, that seems to compliment the games of this era better than any other form of music. With the advent of all these extra sound-channels, they feature lush harmonies and driving percussive backings which pushed game music into a much more orchestral level of development.   \nIn keeping with our central drive toward authenticity and honoring this time period, we've enlisted the talents of Shannon Mason, a woman who has devoted a large part of her composition career to methodically studying both technical mechanics and the Romanticist writing style of 16-bit music on the SNES. From her appreciation of the nuances of the characteristic reverb system and mixing style of SNES tracks, to her intuitive understanding of their use of harmony and counterpoint, Shannon understands this form of music at its core level.  \nWe also have the great privilege of working with a legendary, founding composer in this field, Hiroki Kikuta. While most of us were there to experience the 16-bit era as young people just enjoying the fantastic games, Kikuta-San was the lead composer at Square for The Secret of Mana, a game whose soundtrack is recognized as one of the few highwater-marks of an era packed with fantastic compositions, and whose influence was felt through the rest of this period and beyond.\nWe are honored to announce that Hiroki Kikuta is joining us as a celebrity guest composer, and will contribute several of the core tracks and melodies which will form the backbone of Hazelnut's OST!\nProbably the best-known sample of his acclaimed early work is his opening theme for Secret of Mana:\nIn the course of developing Hazelnut in the Unity environment, we have created a handful of tools for building and scripting every aspect of our gameplay experience right in specially-made Unity editors. The most powerful and involved of these is our level editor, which is literally a one-stop tool for putting the majority of a level's features together. It handles the placement of tiles in a many-layered system, consolidation of these many layers into a few discrete depth layers for run-time, the placement of special depth-sprites, and animated tiles. It also has a system for designating spawn boxes and sites for the enemies of the scene, events for situations like door controls and stair-depth changes, and even a fully-featured triggers and switches board for scripting puzzle logic and event sounds with. Integrated in this tool is also a global-room placement system which allows us to quickly lay out the totality of a level or area, and move rooms around, or quickly swap in new ones seamlessly.  \nA small sample of some of the interesting spaces we are able to assemble with our tile system and custom editor!\nAnother of these tools is a node-based system for creating story events and dialogue in the world. It handles the behavior of NPC's and their speech, and uses player interaction and global variables as its inputs. These systems have been invaluable for constructing the game experience with speed and precision, and make successive iterations of levels fast and painless.

Some things, such as supporting the Switch platform and offering physicals for it dramatically raise costs. A big part of the Kickstarter's goals for us is having enough of a stipend so the developers can afford to work full time on the project, however due to the costs accrued at the Switch tier, this stipend doesn't really start to grow until past 110k. The amount pledged past 110k will have a major impact in how much time per week we are able to dedicate to finishing the project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a small studio still establishing its history, we have striven to provide our users with a complete picture of what the final product will be.

As well being invaluable for improving our work through public feedback, we believe these demos are an important part of demonstrating our competence to complete the project as a whole. We also view the demos as a tool to help mitigate the general risks to backers associated with indie game kickstarters, since you can try before you buy!\n\nWith this project, we are very much emphasizing quality over other concerns. As a rule, when some element of development is not up to our high standards, we continue put effort into that element until it is a joy to interact with in the game context.

I understand that the graphics style doesnt put a strain ( or I dont think it would ), but I don't know if the story arc could be so fantastic that it would reach the limits size-wise of the Switch.

We are running this Kickstarter campaign in order to raise funds for cartridge, box and manual production.\nMicro Mages is a new platform game for the NES, play solo or with up to 4 players simultaneously. Fight to get the best score or cooperate to overcome challenging sections.\nNES version\nAll officially released console versions and regions are supported: NTSC NES, PAL NES, Famicom with a 72-to-60-pin cartridge adapter (not included).\nHigh-quality clones such as the retroUSB AVS and Analogue Nt mini are also supported. Furthermore, our testers confirmed the game works on the RetroN 5.\nDigital version\nAlternatively, we offer a ROM version. This allows you to play the game on your PC and many other platforms through the use of an emulator. \nAlongside the ROM download, we will provide easy-to-understand instructions on how to set up an emulator and play Micro Mages on a Windows PC.\nEnter the Demon Fortress. Built to torture pesky adventurers, this place is home to great treasure and ghastly creatures alike. But don't worry, you can count on allies like Fairies and Magical Seagulls to come to your help!\nMicro Mages is an homage to NES-era platformers. Being a homebrew NES game itself, it was made completely from scratch. We carefully distilled the spirit of the best games in the system's library, all the while drawing inspiration from the modern and putting our own spin on things, creating an experience like no other on the NES.\n\u00a9 Grzegorz Karkoszka. Pictures from Gamefest at gamesweekberlin 2018.\nWhile many homebrew games and later commercial NES releases can be upwards of 512 Kilobytes in size, we challenged ourselves to make the best game we could given the harsh limitations that the very first NES titles (e.g., Super Mario Bros.) had to deal with. That is, the whole game fits into 40 Kilobytes. Micro Mages could have been an NES launch title!\nAnd yet, fun was our number one priority, the classics were our benchmark. Half of the game's development time was spent on optimization and polish. Fluid gameplay, tight controls and a carefully balanced challenge were our dedication.\nMultiplayer mode\nThat's right, Micro Mages supports up to 4 simultaneous players. We made sure the game plays perfectly well in single player mode, but for that extra bit of fun, do invite friends and family!\nPlayers of all skill levels can take part in the action. Play carefully and cooperate to overcome difficult sections OR take risks, shove your friends into lava and snatch the high score!\nAs long as at least one player is alive, you won't lose a life. Dead players turn into ghosts and have the ability to help their comrades by freezing enemies. They can also destroy crates and treasure chests in the hope of finding a Fairy or Magic Seagull Feather that will bring them back to life.\nMicro Mages is full of surprises\nUp to 4 simultaneous players\n8 worlds spanning a total of 26 levels (normal + hard mode)\nDangerous traps, monsters and bosses\nSecrets!\nPassword function\n40 Kilobytes, fully optimized\nand more...\nWill you be able to beat it?\nTeam up with friends\nDiscover the different towers of the Demon Fortress\nCan you beat the dark forces?\nPictures from Gamefest at gamesweekberlin 2018. Picture on right by \u00a9 Grzegorz Karkoszka.\nDespite having only two controller ports, the NES can be extended with the FourScore multiplayer adapter that allows you to connect up to four controllers. Micro Mages is compatible with this adapter as well as the Hori 4-player adapter released for the Famicom.\nOn the left, the FourScore for the NES; on the right, the Hori adapter for the Famicom\n Update: the NES Satellite wireless 4-player adapter works, too!\nOur wish is to release Micro Mages in cartridge format and deliver it in a package worthy of the NES.\nWe have been working meticulously for the past two years to bring you an experience on-par with NES era commercial releases. The game and print data are finished, but it's a special financial challenge to produce cartridges, manuals and boxes in high quantities.\nThat's why we are seeking your help.\nExclusive to the NES version: cartridge, box and instruction booklet\nComprehensive instruction booklet: hero moves, enemies, worlds and more...\nWe are a two-man team from Berlin, dedicated to bringing new games to old hardware!\nJulius created Morphcat Games in 2011 when he released the NES demo Super Bat Puncher. He made other games during game jams and also composes music on his free time. On Micro Mages, he did the programming, created tools for data optimization as well as music and sound effects.\nNicolas joined Julius during the Ludum Dare 32 game jam and together they created a short NES game named Banana Nana. On Micro Mages, he made the graphics and levels as well as box and manual illustrations.\nThanks for your interest in our project and we would also like to send special thanks to:\nBroke Studio\nWeloveoldgames\nComputerspielemuseum Berlin\nBerlinGameScene.com\nSaftladen Indie Games Collective\nBooster Space\nBerlin Retro Game Slam\nNesdev community\nNintendoAge community\nFamiTracker", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing our first Kickstarter campaign, risk reduction is our highest priority. Thus, finishing the game and print data before launch was an absolute necessity for us. That's right, the game is 100% complete!\n\nNaturally, we have thoroughly planned and prepared all the steps required for the game's release.

(Spoiler Alert: We're #1.)\nWhen the Shutter Stops is a Detective Mystery visual novel adventure hybrid, featuring a heroine with a sordid past whose actions\u2014your choices\u2014shape her view of the world and steer the outcome of the stories within.\nGameplay\nInvestigate scenes, criminal or otherwise, to build a case against a ruthless serial killer.\nInterrogate witnesses, suspects, and informants for clues, leads, and lore.\nNavigate the story, the social life, and the career of a former child detective thrust back into the life equipped with little more than her guts, guile, wit and charm.\nWe draw inspiration for When the Shutter Stops from different forms of mysteries, including classic movies such as The Maltese Falcon and Chinatown, books such as Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone Alphabet Series, and games like the Tex Murphy and Ace Attorney series.  \nOf course, we love visual novels and visual novel fans will see influences from Steins;Gate, Root Double and Analogue: A Hate Story, and fans of western cartoons will see our Americanime, Disney-esque art style.\nWhen the Shutter Stops combines a love for detective mysteries, drama, comedies and cartoons.  You'll experience action, a few laughs, stolen kisses, breaking hearts, and visual storytelling with branching narratives.  \nMeet Priscilla \"Pri\" Vate. Where most child prodigies show off at school and on TV, Pri put her skills to work as Philadelphia's youngest private eye. She saw things most kids never imagine and was unfazed by the filth in the world around her...until one case hit too close and ended her career. \nBut like the stench of the city, the life of a Philadelphia detective never completely washes off. A decade after the infamous Dart Killer case, Pri\u2014now working as a family photographer\u2014finds out that the man she locked away is set to be released on new evidence. \nShe must return to the streets to solve the case that put her out of commission, once and for all. But the city has changed in the past ten years, and so has Pri. Can she get to the bottom of a case everyone thinks is closed in time to keep a murderer from striking again?\nWhen the Shutter Stops is a branching visual novel that uses a standard choice system in addition to non-traditional dialogue interactions through investigations and interrogations.\nAt its base form, features include:\nA 120,000 (estimated) word visual novel, roughly 8-10 hours of content not including gameplay.\n\nExpressive cast of characters.\nTouchy subject? (You'll get it if you play the demo.)\nFour distinct branches with danger, thrills, romance, intrigue, and a few laughs.\nPriscilla in hot water\nCharacter interrogations that provide non-linear interactions.\nThe Interrogation of Valerie Fatale\nAnimated backgrounds based off of real locations and street art in Philadelphia, PA. And the graffiti in locations changes over time and you can add your own graffiti by supporting us at the Mark Maker tier!\n1 Bridgebain Street (Priscilla's Office, Exterior)\nA modern noir theme, fog and steam included.\n4th and Wicker (Crime Scene #7)\nFour optional romantic subplots and flings with Priscilla's potential partners.\nDouble entendres (See above bullet point.)\nPriMad (Concept)\nBad end scenarios with story. It's a dangerous life.\nIt ends poorly for everyone involved.\nA in-depth glossary containing definitions, lore, regional facts and trivia.\nYes, we defined a Philly Cheese Steak.\nOphelia Paque (Concept)\nPriPaque (Concept)\nRen Ridges (Concept)\nRenPri (Concept)\nSamuel \"Sam\" Simmons - Sprite Set #1\nPriscilla Vate (Young) - Portrait Set #1\nCharacters Animated with Spine (Concept)\nAudio of all kinds is important to us, and we're putting a lot of time, effort, and resources into it.  First off, our scenes are composed with four layers of audio, which will include voice acting, scene ambiance, sound effects, and music.   Sound, and the absence of it, will play a critical part in Priscilla's story.\nSecond, for the hearing impaired, or for those you of you prefer to play with the sound off, we'll also be putting in visual cues and captions for sounds \nLast, and certainly not least, When the Shutter Stops will feature a fully original soundtrack composed by Dale North of Scarlet Moon Productions!  His work is phenomenal.  I don't want to gush, so just listen to it yourself and please tell us what you think in the comments!\n Your contributions will be used for  \nCreating the remaining art(sprites, backgrounds, etc.)\nAnimating CGs and backgrounds. \nContent editing and QC Partial/Chapter voice acting for Priscilla\nIf we are able to raise more than our initial goal, we'll be able to do more:\nAdditional scenarios(More characters, more crimes, more choices)\nAdditional love interests(Needs more artwork and screens.)\nFull voice acting for major or even all characters.\nMore digital and physical rewards for backers.\nAnimating Characters ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done a lot to mitigate risk to the project over the years we've been working on it. For the sake of clarity and transparency, I'll cover our biggest risks, what causes them to be risks and then follow up with our strategies for mitigating the problems.\n\nThe biggest, most tangible risk to the project is delays. We're doing something that's pretty ambitious for a team our size, even more with our stretch goals. For character animation and voice acting, work involved will increase the amount of time it will take us to complete When The Shutter Stops. Character animation would require each character's main poses be rigged to move and then have a variety of animations, increasing the amount of time we would spend on each character. Full voice acting would require us to put forth a larger casting effort, which would take time in its own right, and would require directing, checking takes and retakes of lines, and implementing the lines into the final product.\n\nThe second largest risk is the physical rewards. While we've sold physical goods in the past, most of them have been created and shipped domestically, or handled by a third party entirely. We'll be taking on the full responsibility for the production and the shipping, including the international orders. Depending on the raw amount of physical goods that need to be shipped, our risk of running into issues of labor and shipping cost. The heaviest risk from this is having an abundance of international backers at the Hardcover tier. The cost of production and cost of shipping would leave us with 2/3rds of the total backed amount while still contributing 100% to our goals. \n\nAs for our mitigation factors, for delays, the current scope of the project and the increase of scope with stretch goals is not something we can really avoid. However, we can mitigate loss of productivity in a number of ways, including having a backup and restoration routine to minimize the impact of data loss on the project and maintaining a project production schedule.\n\nFor physicals, we've had test runs of all of the physical rewards, from production to shipping done both domestic and international. We've obtained manufacturing quotes for 20, 50, 100, and 200 units for production, and while shipping does vary based on destination, we have a reasonably good idea of what to expect from the countries we're actively advertising this Kickstarter to.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Remort Studios\nFirst created \u00b7 59 backed\nRemort Studios is a fledgling visual novel developer composed of a husband and wife duo.

Play the Demo!\nEnjoy a sneak peek of life on the mean streets of Cradlebridge...\n___\nThree months ago, you died. And in that moment you were reborn as something new. A monster. A predator. Not a creature of the night, but one of its masters.\nUnfortunately, things aren't simple as they used to be. Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new nature is not. You came to the City hoping for a new start, but found only suspicion and starvation. Now you stare at the ceiling of your cheap hotel room as a penniless outcast, suckling on rats and destined to wither away.\nBut every new era brings new opportunities, and in the political chaos of a world gone mad, even an outcast may rise. An outcast can change everything.\nThis is the story of how you rose.\nLatest Updates\n#10 - Nighthawks Exposed - City of Colours\n#11 - Nighthawks Exposed - Second Death\n#12 - Nighthawks Exposed - Flashbacks\n#13 - One Week Remains - Stretch Goals, The Demo, Cats\nPress?

Check the bottom of the page for assets, including a YouTube version of the trailer to share, or e-mail contact@nighthawks-game.com.\nEmbrace the Night \nYour new life begins... on the wrong side of the tracks in a city that hates you.\nNighthawks is the brand new urban fantasy RPG from Wadjet Eye Games (The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed, Technobabylon) and writer/designer Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies, The Long Journey Home). The initial concept for the game came when working on Sunless Skies and dreaming of seeing that calibre of interactive fiction merged with the atmosphere of some of his favourite urban-fantasy books and games, in particular 2004's Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines... and then deciding he wanted to play that new game far too much to just leave the idea sitting in the mental \"What If?\" folder.\nWhich brings us to now. Welcome to the mean streets of a city grudgingly trying to show that humans and vampires can live together, despite the cynicism and conspiracies raging on both sides. It's a place of bleak horror and dark humour, filled with monsters who don't all have fangs and a thirst for blood, and featuring new stories down every dark alley. What part will you play, and how will you turn a newly awakened world to your advantage?\nAbout The Game \nRun your own nightclub, as your personal sanctuary and a trap for unwary visitors.\nNighthawks is a mix of story-driven RPG and undead life-simulation, where every decision you make is another move in your chess game against the world. Invest your time into learning new skills or honing your fighting style as you uncover the city's mysteries and venture deep into its darkest secrets. Gather fellow outcasts to your side, binding them with favours and choosing when to cash in. Manage your eternal thirst, legitimately, or balancing the risks of being caught stalking unwary victims and working the black markets.\nAnd of course, what would a vampire be without a few secret powers? Choose from a range of dark Gifts, including Corpse-Talking, Tenebraean Form and Mesmerise. Be careful to hide all evidence of them from the authorites, while keeping them ready as your ace in the hole. Embrace your vampire side, sprinkle a little cinnamon in your blood to handle that pesky iron aftertaste, and get ready to live the nocturnal nine-to-five.\nStructurally, think a freeform RPG core, with stories branching off it - some funny, some tragic, some horrific - where your decisions are always bleeding together. Get caught lying too often and your untrustworthy reputation will follow you around, while raising suspicion will draw the attention of first mortal, and then darker authorities. Do you, for instance, break a window and hurriedly search a crime scene while the alarms wail, pick the lock and explore at your leisure, or use vampire powers to impersonate the security guard and walk right in? The choice is yours, and all part of learning the beat of the city, developing new skills, and building up favours and contacts to help seize the day by the throat.\nChoose Your Friends Carefully... \nKnowledge is power. Your bartender Rebecca hears everything that's going on in town.\nNever travel alone. Befriend and recruit a wide circle of fellow outcasts, such as Madame Lux, vampire stage magician capable of fooling any eye with delusions of light. Con-artist turned cult-leader Maze. Vampire enforcer Saiorse, as comfortable discussing great works of opera as she is getting her claws into the most dangerous dockland fighting pits. Former Queen of the Black Sea Inez, a ruthless pirate out of her time. Disgraced scientist Morgan Shah, funding her attempts to cure vampirism by selling crystal meth. Maybe even Samuel, a former doctor cursed with good intentions and a withered brain that considers no fate worse than death for patients who end up in his care. No matter how much they beg.\nCompanions here don't just fight for you. Take part in their lives as they work on their own problems, have them look into rumours with their own contacts and social circles and dive into their deepest secrets with interactive flashbacks set in locations like 17th century Nassau, Las Vegas, and the corrupt European courts of the Eternal Dynasties. Help them handle their demons, and they'll help you deal with yours. But good deeds rarely go unpunished, and everyone has their own agenda that consumes their endless nights.\nEnter The Story  \nWith every choice comes consequence. How will you live your second life?\nWhy are we focusing on text? The possibilities! Games like Sunless Sea and 80 Days and Cultist Simulator have repeatedly demonstrated this over the last few years, and we intend Nighthawks to be seen in that company - a deep, wide, replayable RPG in which a favour can be the ultimate weapon and the friendliest smiles often have the sharpest teeth.\nText-driven gameplay lets us really focus on details and mechanics, including bringing you a living city with little seen features like NPC scheduling (you might, for instance, know a guy who'll slip you blood from the hospital blood bank, but he only works Tuesdays to Fridays and it's Saturday), varied stories, incredibly reactive characters, and most importantly, player freedom. You're planning to head out on a quest you were expecting to pay for your hotel room this week, but the friend you wanted to bring along isn't available. Do you wait? Take someone else? Risk going alone? Hope for another opportunity?\nWe're drawing inspiration from a wide range of RPG classics, from Baldur's Gate 2 to Yakuza to Bloodlines to Fallout to Quest For Glory, and in particular, their sense of freedom and focus on letting you live in their worlds. In Nighthawks, you're in charge of your destiny, whether it's running your nightclub sanctuary, playing politics, or plunging into stories that range from light-hearted adventure and modern political intrigue to blisteringly bleak horror.\nMeet The Team \nJust a few of the games our team has worked on...\nAll that said, it's also going to look and sound great! Along with Richard Cobbett on words and design, we have Ben Chandler (Unavowed, Shardlight) and Ivan Ulyanov (The Charnel House Trilogy) on art, painting a 'living book' style that combines backgrounds and animated ambient effects in glorious 4K resolution.\nLast, but definitely not least, we have adventure game legend Dave Gilbert (The Shivah, The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed) acting as executive producer and overseer of the whole project, cracking whips and ensuring things stay on track. Budget allowing, we also hope to bring in additional writers to help produce extra-varied stories and characters, as well as other experts to help polish everything up to a fine shine. On top of all that, we're bringing a full voice cast to breathe life into the characters, and of course, plenty of original music.\nThe Biz Side \nWe're looking at a development cycle of around 18 months, not including time already invested to get to this stage. We're not doing physical rewards like pins and posters, so as to be able to spend every dollar on creating the best RPG we can make. Instead, we're focusing on rewards that let backers at every level become immortalised within the game itself. Be the vampire you deserve to be... or the unwary blood-bag, or undead hunter, or crooked cop, or depraved sewer abomination. Are you ready to be killed by yourself?\nTarget Platforms and Beta Access \nA living city full of stories. Write yours.\nOur key platforms at the moment are PC and Mac. We also hope to bring Nighthawks to iOS at release, and will be looking at other platforms closer to the release date.\nAs for beta testing, we don't believe in offering it as a reward tier - you're helping us! - but there will be opportunities to sign up and take part in that during development.\nCommunity\nJoin the Discord!

We're a small team, aiming to bring you more design innovation with text, careful art and a tight budget than many AAA RPGs and developers with all their fancy polygons and resources.\n\nBut that's the fun part! And we can do it. We're all interactive fiction veterans with multiple titles to our name, using well-established tools like Ink and Unity to bring you a game we think will be both special, and the deep urban fantasy experience gamers have been dying for. The main risk is that development time is always hard to predict, save that everything always takes a bit longer than expected, and stretch goals especially always mean extra work to get things right. But we will. Everyone on the development team has also promised to look both ways before crossing any major road, just to be on the safe side.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nighthawks Supporter", "descp": "Stay up to date with all the latest updates, including beta testing information/opportunities.\nINCLUDES:\nOur Gratitude\nBacker Name In Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["68 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Guest", "descp": "Nighthawks for PC/Mac.

Let's talk about it a little...\nCombat is a really tough design challenge, and one that I'm nowhere near actually finishing yet. However, the pieces are in place, and I think they're working pretty well. In case you've missed the info in the past, it's card based - more like Slay The Spire than Hearthstone, and without any deck building. Your deck is instead made for you based on your player state, companion, weapons (one melee, one ranged) and stats, and any injuries or similar you might already have sustained. Any player can use any weapon, but if your skill in Brawler/Gunslinger is too low, the 'do damage' cards come with an increasing number of 'miss' cards to represent your lack of finesse, to the point that your deck quickly becomes useless in a fight."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "In Darkness And In The Light", "update_content": "Greetings, and I hope everyone's having a good September.

Coding, mostly, implementing feedback from the first wave of beta testing that I wanted to address before we send out the next build, which brings lots of nice features including a new character creation system, tooltips, multiple character slots for saving, and reworking some of the graphics to allow for more particle fun. Despite being weighed down with chronic productivity guilt at the pace right now, things are clicking along.

We saw people on today's major social media networks complaining about the limitations and flaws of these sites, yet lamenting that there was nowhere better to go. We aim to be that better place to go: a user-friendly space on the web for creativity, communication and content-sharing. We\u2019re creating Pillowfort.io because we are avid bloggers ourselves, and have long dreamed of a platform that would bring together all the best features of the various platforms we\u2019ve used over the years, allowing each user to customize their own experience.\nPillowfort is currently in closed beta with over 10,000 users. Everyone who donates $5 or more will get a registration key (or keys) on September 1st to create an account on the site, so if you want to try out the site while it's still in beta and even help us decide on how to continue developing it, now is your chance!\nPress Mentions\nGita Jackson for Kotaku\nChristina Bonnington for The Daily Dot\nThe Site and Its Features\nUser Control & Privacy\nA lot of the problems in other social media sites come from a lack of control over one\u2019s own content-- who can view it, share it, etc. Pillowfort aims to remedy these problems by giving users more control over how their content can be used by the community. Pillowfort\u2019s users can choose whether or not a post can be reblogged by other users; whether it\u2019s viewable to all users, or only users that are already following them; and more. This way, Pillowfort users can be as social as they want when they\u2019re feeling extroverted and want to share their ideas, but also restrict their more private thoughts and feelings to a closer circle of confidantes. We also give users total control over their content: deleting one of your posts will delete all reblogs, and edits made to your post will be reflected in all reblogs. You can also delete any unwanted comments to your posts.\nCommunity\nOn Pillowfort you can create, and join, user-moderated \u2018communities\u2019 so that you can easily find other people who enjoy the same things you do, all in one place. Post pictures of your proud baking exploits to a community of bakers, discuss the new spoilers for your favorite TV show in a community forum full of other fans-- whatever you want! User moderation means that users can decide on custom rules for their community and enforce them (so long as they don't contradict the general site Terms of Service).\nNested comment threads for better dialogue between users\n\nA private messaging feature that lets you build friendships one on one\n\nA built-in blacklisting feature, so you can hide posts containing certain keywords and tags\nBudget & Goals\nThe bulk of our fundraising goal is to allow us to hire staff to work on the site long-term. Here is a detailed break-down of our fundraising goals and how your donations will be used:\nA Business Plan for Pillowfort\nOur main goals are to create sources of revenue for Pillowfort that can ensure the maintenance of the site as well as its growth. We also want our plan to reflect a mutual respect between the site and its users.\nThe Short Term: Staff at Pillowfort is hoping that a crowdfunding campaign will allow us more time to ready the site before it exits beta. This means fixing high-priority bugs; tightening site security; revising the Terms of Service to be more specific and address user concerns; and expanding our moderation system, including on-boarding more moderators. This short term plan incorporates the remainder of 2018 and the first two quarters of 2019.\nThe Long Term: In order to build sustainable revenue, Pillowfort cannot rely solely on crowdfunding. Staff at Pillowfort is also adverse to receiving funding from outside investors and sponsors because we want to maintain total creative control over the site. Because of this, we're drafting a business plan that looks at two sources of funding:\nPremium Account Features: Essential site features will remain free from a paywall, while users can pay for premium features. (For example: being able to upload larger file sizes, multiple user icons, uploading gifs to a library for easy access, etc.)\nAdvertisement Opt-Ins: All Pillowfort users will not see advertising by default. Instead, users will have the choice to opt-in to advertising to help support the site. This means overall less ad revenue, but we believe it is important to respect our users' experience and not force advertising on anyone.\nRewards + Beta Testing\nAnyone who donates an amount of $5 or more will be given a key to create an account on Pillowfort! You will receive one beta key for every $5 you donate-- so if you donate $20, for example, you will receive 4 registration links. If you do purchase multiple keys, you can give them to any friends, family, etc. that you'd like!\nLaptop stickers:\n T-shirt and poster designed by Jennika Tia:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a one-time fundraiser to help us get off the ground. \n\nThe main obstacles that Pillowfort faces in the future are 1) preparing the site to exit beta and open registrations to the public, and 2) become financially independent. If we meet our fundraising goals, it will give us the necessary funds to hire more personnel to work on the site and meet these objectives as fast as possible. \n\nFor the first objective, exiting beta and opening the site to the public, we will need to develop a number of technologies for the site such as more efficient data handling and security measures. For the second, we are working on a business plan that will allow us to bring in revenue without exploiting our users or hindering their experience in using the site. For both of these things, having funding will allow us to hire talent to develop these technologies and the more people we are able to bring onto the project, the sooner we can meet these objectives.\n\nAs for liabilities and legalities, Pillowfort.io is incorporated under the Pillowfort Blogging LLC.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Pillowfort.io Registration Link(s)", "descp": "You will receive registration links (containing a special key) to create an account on Pillowfort.io!

But what happens to the others ?\nNora, a young girl whose agility is matched only by her cowardice, is going to discover it the hard way. Embarked in spite of herself in a raid that goes wrong, she will have to prove her valor to the Lord of the Ase by going through the nine Realms of the World Tree and by \u00ab defeating \u00bb the dreadful Guardians. Equipped with Gungnir, the magic spear, she finds herself catapulted into an epic and funny journey.\nWonder found on the road\nThe game offers four different gameplay styles : \ndynamic platforms where you can combine Nora\u2019s athletic skills and acrobatics with the help of Gungnir\u2019s powers to perform fluid and elegant moves,\ninfiltration, because, even if she owns a powerful spear, Nora is totally unable to fight,  \nreflection to get out of the terrible traps scattered among the nine Realms, \nconfrontation against colossal bosses, the Guardians. \nDeveloping a video game is never easy, even more when we are only two. For several months now, we have been working full-time on the development of this project without any income, and we never gave up because we believe with all our heart in Unspoken Chronicles : Nora. With your help, our ability to upgrade the game production will be increased. The donation will be of course used to pay us, but also to hire musicians, to buy equipment\u2026  \nAs you can see in the Stretch Goal board, with a high enough fundraising, we will be able to add elements to the game that will make the game experience more immersive and pleasant. The playable demo that we make available on this Kickstarter allows us to present in detail the work that we have already done, and to let you imagine what the game could be like with your help.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHowly Games is a really small studio, as it only counts two members.

In 2013, we had a highly successful Kickstarter to fund the publication of an English version of the rulebook. But there\u2019s more to discover in Hitotsuna Town.\n\nThey come out at night. The mononoke, creatures of pure Wonder. The michinoke who lurk on roads, the strong oni, the aquatic kappa, the spooky ghosts, and the fleeting visitors. As strange as they might look, they too are residents of the town, seeking friendship and hope.\n\nGolden Sky Stories: Twilight Tales (originally released in Japan as Mononoke Koyake) is the first Japanese supplement for Golden Sky Stories, and it adds the mononoke as a new set of character types for players and narrators alike. Each has a signature character, but they\u2019re also easy to reskin to be any number of creatures. The rules for the kappa also let you play other aquatic creatures like mermaids, and where the signature visitor is an alien, your visitor could be a time traveler, a winter fairy, or even Santa Claus. The book will also feature an intro comic and scenarios to help you get started using mononoke in your stories.\n\nWe expect the English version to weigh in at around 70 pages, and in addition to the \u201cOtoshidama\u2019s Adventure\u201d and \u201cA Ghost\u2019s Errands\u201d scenarios, it will include two original scenarios by T.S. Luikart: \u201cPresent Thunder\u201d and \u201cBig Dog\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nBig Dog's Day (art by Honoel A. Ibardolaza)\nOur secondary goal for this Kickstarter is to fund a second printing of the core rulebook. It\u2019s taken a while, but thanks to Indie Press Revolution we\u2019re close to selling through our first printing, meaning the print version alone has reached close to 3,000 people. If we're not able to amass the funding for the full print run of the core book, we will still be able to fulfill any extra copies via Print On Demand if need be.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the Golden Sky Stories core rulebook yet, don\u2019t worry! Pick a pledge level with the PDF Library to get PDFs of the core book and all three original English supplements (it\u2019s a great deal!), or one of the levels that includes the GSS book if you\u2019d like a physical copy of the core rulebook.\n\nIf you'd like to get a feel for the game before you pledge, have a look at these:\n\nThe Girl From the Old, Old House, an episode of the Six Feats Under podcast where Ewen runs a session of GSS for them\nThe Broken Window, an original replay (a transcript of a complete game session)\nTabletop Day 2013 Golden Sky Stories Demo: In the leadup to the original GSS Kickstarter we released this demo PDF, which has a simplified but playable version of the GSS rules and a scenario to go with it.\nPreorders are now available through BackerKit! If for whatever reason you're unable to use Kickstarter or simply would prefer not to, you can now put it preorders, which will ship at the same time as backer rewards. Backers will also be able to add physical copies of Maid RPG or any of our Golden Sky Stories books as add-on items once surveys go out.\n\nTwilight Tales PDF: Get the book in PDF form.\nTwilight Tales Book: Get a printed book delivered to you.\nPDF Library: This is a bundle of the PDF versions of the previous GSS books: the core rulebook, The Colors of the Sky, Faerie Skies, and Fantasy Friends.\nGolden Sky Stories is the core rulebook, with all the info you need to play any of the six basic types of henge, example NPCs, two introductory scenarios, and a sample town.\nThe Colors of the Sky collects bonus material from the original GSS Kickstarter: five new playable character types (mouse, wolf, pony, and fish henge, plus the witch), two scenarios, Allen Varney's Henge Candies essay, and two prose short stories.\nFaerie Skies is an original setting, which moves the game to rural England, where you can play one of six types of fae. It adds new NPCs, story seeds, and the sample town of Westwick.\nFantasy Friends is another original setting, which takes place in a village in a fantasy world. It has six new character types based on different kinds of fantasy monsters, 36 magic items, NPCs, story seeds, and the sample town of Grassdale.\nWall Scroll: Get a colorful wall scroll of Golden Sky Stories art. You can choose from two designs: the design from the wall scroll from the Golden Sky Stories Kickstarter (depicting the spider and centipede goddesses), or the Kappa and Oni's Excellent Adventure design we commissioned for some reason.\nCustom Character Type or Scenario: For backers at the $600 Narrator level, we'll make a custom character type or scenario to their specifications (within the limits of good taste and legality of course). This will be available as a PDF to all backers, and incorporated into collections of GSS bonus material. Leave your mark on Golden Sky Stories, and do something cool for your fellow fans!\nIf we go over our base goal, we'll be producing some new Golden Sky Stories material that'll go out to all backers in PDF form!\nBase Goal: $6,000 (UNLOCKED): It\u2019s happening! We\u2019ll be able to print and ship Twilight Tales to backers and get it out into the world!\n$7,000: Kappa and Oni's Excellent Adventure (UNLOCKED): T.S. Luikart returns to GSS with an original scenario inspired by the wall scroll art! The kappa and oni will indeed have an excellent adventure!\n$8,000: Tsukumogami (UNLOCKED): This character type is a new kind of mononoke, a man-made tool that has taken on a life of its own and become a magical creature.\n$10,000: Land of Illusions (UNLOCKED): It so happens that for the Japanese version of Golden Sky Stories there is, of all things, a doujinshi book for the Touhou games. While we can\u2019t publish the full book, if we reach this stretch goal we\u2019ll do an English version of the character options from the book, which include new Miko and Fairy character types, as well as a library of Powers and Weaknesses you can use to customize your characters.\n$11,000: Witch\u2019s Cat (UNLOCKED): Inspired by the Witch Quest RPG released in Japan in 1991, this is an alternate cat character type that is a witch\u2019s companion. You can play one alongside a witch PC (as featured in The Colors of the Sky) or with a witch NPC, and they have some nifty magical powers that make them a bit different from a normal cat henge.\n$12,000: Story Seeds (UNLOCKED): A collection of paragraph-long story ideas that you can easily spin into a full scenario.\n$13,000: Western Fox (UNLOCKED): Where the fox henge in the core rulebook are based on the fox spirits of Japanese folklore, this is an alternate fox that\u2019s more in line with Western folk tales, good for games set outside of Japan, or if you just want a different take on foxes.\n$15,000: Raspberry Sky Stories (UNLOCKED): We\u2019ll make a Golden Sky Stories version of Ewen\u2019s card-based schoolgirl slice of life RPG Raspberry Heaven, with character cards for the six signature henge and a set of 12 scene cards for stories around Hitotsuna Town. Backers will receive a PDF and a code for ordering the cards at-cost from DriveThruRPG.\n$16,000: Raucous Night At The Tanemura Estate (UNLOCKED): In the late summer, when the last traces of dusk have fled the sky, spirits gather in the crumbling old house on the edge of town. They come together to play Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai, a game of ghost stories where each storyteller snuffs a candle when their tale is done, inviting more spirits to appear. Of course, these new spirits are quick to join in the festivities, leading to a night of supernatural merriment for all in this Golden Sky Stories scenario from Richard Kelly.\n$17,000: Raccoon Henge (UNLOCKED): Outsiders from beyond Hitotsuna Town, raccoon henge love to solve problems using their creativity and big city know-how. A new character type by Rach Shelkey.\n$18,000: Deck of Dreams (UNLOCKED): This will be a 54-card deck of cards you can use as Dream tokens, with appropriately colorful GSS-themed designs. It will be available to backers as an add-on item, and then put up for sale on DriveThruRPG as a POD product.\n$20,000: The Colors of the Sky POD Book (UNLOCKED): If we hit this stretch goal, we\u2019ll put together a \u201cThe Colors of the Sky\u201d Print on Demand book, compiling all of the stretch goal material from both Kickstarters, plus some new art, and provide discount codes to all backers.\n$21,000: Magical Girl (UNLOCKED): Regulars of the town by day, magical girls walk out into the wild and wonderful world of henge and mononoke as avatars of Wonder at night to help bridge the two worlds, so long as they can still get their work done by morning! A new character type by Sean K.I.W.

The major challenge for us will simply be to get things done in as timely a fashion as we\u2019d like, especially if we hit all of our stretch goals.

Each box will be signed and numbered by me, Taylor Smith, the creator of Spell: The RPG. Included in each box is a perfect bound copy of the 48pg Spell: The RPG rulebook, 88pg perfect bound Spellbook Vol. 1, a set of 108 wooden letter tiles for playing the game, 12 wooden six-sided dice, and a cloth drawstring bag. This unique collector\u2019s set is only available through this Kickstarter campaign!\nSpell: The RPG Collector's Chest, approximately 6.5\" x 9.5\"\n While the Collector's Chest collection is limited, the books and letter tiles are available without limit. The books are in their own reward tiers and printed letter tiles can be added onto to any tier (see FAQ).\nAll of existence and nonexistence, reality and surreality, is spoken in a Universal Language. It describes all the laws of the universe: what is and is not, everything that ever happened and ever will, won\u2019t, or can\u2019t. This language is beyond the full comprehension of any mortal, though a rare few have an ear for it. These individuals can translate the Universal Language into familiar glyphs and, from there, spell out new descriptions, new laws, new realities. This is the world of Spell: The RPG \u2013 What you spell is what you cast.\nSpell: The RPG front and back cover mock-up, art by Nathalie Fourdraine\nSpell: The RPG is a complete, original tabletop roleplaying game. Characters have twelve stats called Impulses that describe their motivations and problem solving methods, which they can use to accomplish any basic task. Impulses are also used to cast Spells: While characters observe the Universal Language and translate it into new pieces of reality, the player uses letter tiles to spell out the magic the character is going to cast.\nEndless possibility is balanced with a dynamic six-sided dice system, keeping gameplay accessible and imaginative while still being rooted in fair math. Spell: The RPG is setting-neutral, which means it can be played with any story, in any time period, wherever you\u2019d like!\nSee the game played here:\n    Spellbook Vol. 1 is a collection of five campaign stories. Each chapter presents a unique plot and setting that can be played as an ongoing campaign or a single session with the option of continuing. Through stretch goals (below), we've also unlocked four mini-chapters of the digital-only Spellbook Vol. 1.5 and the first chapter of Spellbook Vol. 2.\nSpellbook Vol. 1 front and back cover mock-up\nThe chapters represent a variety of settings and stories, but also moods and play styles to match your particular gaming group. Each chapter is fully illustrated with black and white art throughout and is designed with convenient in-line sections on how to alter or expand given stages of the story. Below are the five chapters:\n  Magical Moon Warriors\nThe Moon Goddess has gone missing and now the monsters from the dark side of the moon are invading! As her parting gift, the Moon Goddess sent to earth fragments of crystal with the transformative power of the moon. Become a Magical Girl (or Boy or Enby) to fight the monsters of shadow and solve the mystery of the missing Moon Goddess!\nIllustrations by Christina Gardner!\n  The Crystal At Skymouth\nThe realm of Gultera is kept safe under the protection of the Sky: A magical ceiling that holds back the chaotic power of the gods who live in the stars. The Sky is cracking and it\u2019s up to a party of Starborn, the heretical inheritors of Gods\u2019 whispered magic, to travel to the sacred mountain Skymouth to restore the Sky\u2014and discover the ancient secrets the Skymouth holds.\nDiscover more details and art from this chapter in Update #3!\nIllustrations by Jok!\n  Hijinks at Huntsville High\nHigh school is hard enough when you don\u2019t have to also learn how to use this weird, reality-altering magic you never asked for. Now you have to plan a school dance so the other kids don\u2019t think you\u2019re so weird? The only thing worse\u2019d be if a sinister-looking administrator starting snooping around or if a monster showed up! So, of course, both those things happen.\nDiscover more details and art from this chapter in Update #7!\nIllustrations by Kuropin!\n  Godqueen\nThe Godqueen is the one who brought order to chaos and structure to civilization. Her rule was benevolent and her word was Law. Over time, the rulership was too much for one individual, so she dissipated her essence into a pantheon of children. Through generations, they must manage the largest catastrophes down to the most minute of heartbreaks. In them is the gift of the Godqueen: Their word is Law.\nDiscover more details and art from this chapter in Update #6!\nIllustrations by Leland Goodman!\n  Wakeful in Reverie\nThe city has an underbelly and so too does the waking world. Lucid dreamers practice skillful conjurations in Reverie, the dimensions of dreams. It\u2019s all fun and games\u2014and the occasional mercenary mission\u2014until an inhabitant of Reverie begins to exert control over the waking world. Act fast! The lines between waking reality and dreams is beginning to blur.\nDiscover more details and art from this chapter in Update #3!\nIllustrations by Fusspot!\nI\u2019ve come to Kickstarter once more to bring this project to life. About two and a half years ago, a much less experienced me ran a Kickstarter campaign for this game. It was an unknown property by a no-name designer and it was budgeted and marketed pretty poorly. Since then, I\u2019ve gained unfathomably important skills and knowledge by connecting with industry professionals, various vendors, and as lead designer on Evil Dead 2: The Official Board Game and The Terminator: The Official Board Game. I\u2019m breathing new life into this project with the expertise to match my ambition.\nThe Collector's Chest comes with 108 laser engraved wooden tiles.\nOnce the original Spell Kickstarter ended without reaching its goal (though it still made more than this campaign\u2019s goal), I published Spell: The RPG digitally via Whimsy Machine Games. Since then, it\u2019s sold hundreds of copies and has been played in livestreams, actual play casts (language warning), at conventions, in youth organizations, and has had school clubs founded around it. It\u2019s been refined, edited, and expanded. I\u2019ve always been proud of this game, but with this campaign I can finally get rid of that \u201cbeta\u201d subtitle and have a full official release.\nThe Collector's Chest also includes twelve 16mm laser engraved wooden dice.\nIt\u2019s with great pleasure that I can offer such a boutique version of Spell: The RPG. I\u2019m blown away by the quality Blue Panther, LLC, is providing with the laser engraving and all the wood components. This box set is designed to be a treasure for your gaming shelf. If you\u2019re just interested in the game, that\u2019s okay too! There\u2019s no limit on the digital- or book-only tiers, which have everything you need to play the game except letter tiles and dice. The letter tile sets are also available as optional accessories, an online letter generator (whimsymachine.media/letter-generator), or use the tiles from one of those crossword games you still have sitting around.\n          Clickthrough to the tweet to share out!\n              There are several great reward tiers you can back at depending on the gaming experience you're looking for. Below are the options for just digital rewards, books, the full set, and even artist commissions. In the Extras section are optional goodies, like tote bags and a set of letter tiles you can get no matter what level you pledge at.\nThank you for contributing to the campaign! I'll write your name or username (nothing explicit!), take a picture of it, post it on my Twitter, my Instagram, and on a special page on WhimsyMachineGames.com. I'll tag you too, if you'd like!\n  At this tier, you'll receive the PDF versions of Spell: The RPG, the core book of rules, and Spellbook Vol. 1, the collection of complete campaign modules. In order to play, you'll need character sheets, six-sided dice, and letter tiles or the letter generator. If you play on Roll20, the beta version character sheets are already available as a template for use. This tier also includes the previous tier.\nWe've unlocked many social stretch goals that will be included in this tier and up! On Twitter, we've unlocked eleven mini-campaign supplements in Spellbook Vol. 1.5 and it's still going! Every ten retweets unlocks a new playable mini-chapter. On Facebook, we've unlocked Monstrum Opus, a creature collection with over 300 entries and nine illustrations. Every like adds a new entry and every ten shares adds a new illustration. These will both be open until the end of the campaign, so share to unlock even more!\n  Are you looking for a book to hold? It's a good feeling! Get the perfect bound, 6\" x 9\" Spell: The RPG book. It has 48 pages of words that tell you all about how to play the game, including optional rules for a full and customizable experience. This tier also includes all previous tiers.\n  These two books were meant to be together! Spellbook Vol. 1 is an 88 page, perfect bound, 6\" x 9\" collection of five chapters, described above. Each chapter is absolutely full of beautiful art and totally playable as presented with options for personalization. This tier also includes all previous tiers.\n  Here it is: The Make/100 special! The Collector's Chest is assembled from birch wood and designed to be durable. The illustrated Spell logo is laser engraved into the lid for that sweet, classic look. This box includes a set of 108 wooden tiles (3/4\" x 1\" x 1/8\") with laser engraved letters in a distribution designed specifically for play with Spell, twelve wooden 16mm six-sided dice (one player typically only rolls up to six dice at a time) with laser engraved numbers to match the letters on the tiles, a cloth drawstring bag big enough to fit all the tiles, and the two books. These chests are individually signed and numbered by me, Taylor Smith. This tier also includes all previous tiers.\n  Christina Gardner is the wonderfully talented artist of Magical Moon Warriors, as well as the logo design on the Collector's Chest. In addition to the Collector's Chest, Christina will draw a portrait of your RPG character (or your OC, yourself, loved one, whatever!), based on reference, using pens and marker on art paper. Christina will also sign and ship to you the original piece of art for you to keep. This tier also includes all previous tiers.\n  Jok is the maestro behind the illustrations in The Crystal At Skymouth and has been petitioning for a comic adaptation since! In addition to the Collector's Chest, Jok will draw an ink wash portrait of your choice, based on reference, in a \"sword and sorcery\" style on watercolor paper. Jok will also sign and ship the original art for you to keep. This tier also includes all previous (non-commission) tiers.\n  Kuropin, AKA Pur\u00e9, blessed the pages of Hijinks at Huntsville High with her fabulous illustrations! In addition to the Collector's Chest, Kuropin will paint a portrait of your choice, based on reference, in watercolors on watercolor paper. Kuropin will also sign and ship the original art for you to keep. This tier also includes all previous (non-commission) tiers.\n  How did I get so lucky to have Leland Goodman illustrate Godqueen? I don't know, but she did and it's amazing! In addition to the Collector's Chest, Leland will draw a full color digital portrait of your choice, based on reference. Leland will also print and sign a copy of your portrait for you to keep. This tier also includes all previous (non-commission) tiers.\n  Fusspot, AKA Amy Phillips, brought Wakeful in Reverie to life with her excellent illustrations! In addition to the Collector's Chest, Fusspot will draw a full color digital portrait of your choice, based on reference. Fusspot will also print and sign a copy of your portrait for you to keep. This tier also includes all previous (non-commission) tiers.\n  Lenka \u0160ime\u010dkov\u00e1 will be bringing her hauntingly beautiful illustrations to Witch Hunt, but you can get a commission from her now! In addition to the Collector's Chest, Lenka will draw a cropped, color digital/mixed media portrait of your choice, based on reference. Due to international shipping costs, there is no signed version available (contact for details if you're interested). This tier also includes all previous (non-commission) tiers.\nIn addition to the rewards featured in the pledge tiers, you can also get some fancy, fun extras! Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the value of the extras you'd like. During the survey phase of Kickstarter (the \"pledge manager\"), you'll be able to pick and choose which extras you'll receive.\n  Just getting the PDF or books, but still want to play with real tiles? Grab this full set of 108 wood letter tiles with Spell: The RPG specific letter distribution. These letters are high quality printing that won't smudge or fade and come in a cloth drawstring bag.\n  Players and gamemasters alike need to keep thorough notes on their adventures, spells, the wacky NPCs they meet\u2014whatever needs recording! These spiral bound notebooks fit nicely in the wooden Collector's Chest box and are filled with 80 blank lined pages.\n  Okay, so you go everything. How're you going to carry it all to game night? How about this super awesome cotton canvas tote bag, measuring at 15\" square. It'll easily fit everything available through this campaign and whatever extra goodies you're bringing to the table.\n  If you're a retailer and you're interested in stocking Spell: The RPG and/or Spellbook Vol. 1 (or any extras) in your shop, contact me via Kickstarter messages or admin@whimsymachinegames.com for a 50% discount! You must have a verifiable resale license. Minimum order quantity is two copies; pledge for either one or both books (sorry, limited tiers are excluded from the discount, but you're still welcome to pick one up for your store) and you'll receive double for the same price. If you'd like additional copies, you can increase your pledge amount accordingly during the campaign or during the pledge manager.\nWhile Spell: The RPG and Spellbook Vol. 1 are already written and have been regularly played for over two years, this Kickstarter campaign helps me bring them to the next level. The most obvious cost is for the wood components and laser engraving. These really aren't cheap, but 100 is about the sweet spot of reasonable per unit cost, but not too big of a run to exhaust Blue Panther. The $2,000 goal will cover the minimum costs for each component, which is less than 100.\nAnother significant chunk of the goal is to pay for printing of the two books. They've only existed as PDFs until now, so they'll also go through an actual graphic designer (I do my best, but I'm no pro) before going to print. That designer is Miss Mandible, a wonderful person I had the pleasure of working with on The Terminator: The Official Board Game. To make these books official, I'll also be purchasing ISBNs and barcodes from Bowker directly, instead of through a middleman service.\nLastly, Kickstarter takes 5% of the total cut and payment processing fees take up about another 5% of the goal. After that, there's always a percent of additional fees from credit cards either not charging, having international fees, or any of those weird logistical things, as well as pledges that fail to process or other unforeseeable charges and pings\u2014that's what the \"Credit Card & Other Fees\" section refers to.\nShipping\nShipping is not charged during the campaign, but shipping is not free. Shipping will be charged during the pledge manager phase of the campaign, also known as the survey. This allows me to be absolutely sure I account for all shipping costs. Inaccurate shipping estimation is one of the biggest campaign killer, so this is the safe route. Below are my current estimates for all tiers, excluding shipping art.\nUnited States: $12\nCanada: $16\nEverywhere Else: $24\nShipping prices recently increased across the board, so I'm looking closely into fulfillment options that can help mitigate those new costs. At a quantity of 100, options are very limited since there's no bulk to discount. That said, my goal is to minimize shipping as much as possible.\nSpell: The RPG represents endless possibilities and imagination. I'm dedicated to the production of this game and will continue developing new Spellbook volumes with new writers and artists for a long time to come\u2014a few exciting ones I hope to announce during the campaign! But first: What about the immediate future?\nYou can look forward to regular, totally transparent updates as we go through the process, including gameplay videos, Kickstarter Live videos, Q&A with Blue Panther, and more, based on your feedback! Just like in Spell, let me know what you're looking for and I'll do my best to make it a reality. I'll be making an announcement at the end of the campaign as to the future growth and structure of Whimsy Machine.\nAnd, hey: Thank you. Honestly and truly, thank you. Even if all you've done is read down to the bottom of this page, I'm overwhelmed with gratitude just to share this labor of love with the world.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has many components, some of which are sourced from different companies. By launching as a Make/100 project, there\u2019s no risk of the Collector's Chests being ordered beyond capacity or significantly delayed\u2014beyond unforeseeable acts of misfortune or goblin attacks. Blue Panther is experienced at making wood board game sets with more components than Spell: The RPG has and a count of one hundred is comfortably within their reasonable production capacity.\n\nI've decided to charge shipping in the pledge manager, so I can be absolutely sure everything is covered, especially since USPS raised shipping costs earlier this year. Based on experience, sample tests, professional advice, and a dozen blogs I've read, the quoted shipping costs should be very accurate, but that's not a risk I want you to have to take on me. \n\nIf the goal is reached, all minimum components will have been accounted for, which is less than 100. If we far exceed goal (by about 1,000%), delivery will likely be delayed by up to one month to account for printing and shipping all the extra books. There\u2019ll be enough per unit margin at that point to make it up in other ways and any delays will be abundantly discussed and explained.\n\nAs an individual, I am fully able to offer absolute transparency. I am answerable only to you, the backers, for providing a good quality product, so you get to know what\u2019s going on the whole time. I\u2019ll explain all decisions made and take responsibility for any mistakes made. I\u2019m practicing only my own ethics in this campaign, so there's no behind-the-scenes shadiness or third party approval mishaps to be had.\n\nI'm deeply passionate about Spell: The RPG. It's a game I believe in wholeheartedly and will pursue and expand and grow and continue to love. It brings me so much joy to be able to take you on this journey with me.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Thank you so much for supporting Spell: The RPG!

It is a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden. At least on the surface. Underneath this, just as in Austen's own novels, it is a game of social ambition, family obligation and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.\nIn this game, you play the type of characters that captured your imagination in Austen's books - from a wealthy heir who falls in love with the aloof new arrival, to a charming socialite bent on ruining the reputation of their rivals. Exploit your advantages, connections, and family influence to achieve your secret desire - all while jealously guarding your good name.\nNot only that, players in Good Society hold the power to control the story itself, and change it in their favour. Take control of influential connections, create rumour and scandal, and spend tokens to orchestrate balls, carriage accidents, and even marriages.\nIt is the elegance of Austen's world, the sharpness of her wit, and the beauty of her passion that inspired us to create this system. But it is the deep and complex struggle between desire, expectation, and position that has guided its development - and we hope you will enjoy both elements.\nDesire to see Good Society in action? Watch an actual play of the game on Geek Space TV!\nClick to go the Backer's only update\nIn Good Society, you will play a character that could very well have stepped out of the pages of Austen's work.\nYou will build you character from four components: your character role, your family background, your relationship and of course your secret desire.\nYou could for instance, play a socialite in the militia, with the secret desire to come into substantial wealth - while also being childhood rivals with another player (Wickham perhaps?)\nOr, you could play a wealthy heiress from old money, with a secret desire to marry off two of your closest acquaintances - while also dealing with a long-term uncertain romance of your own (um, Emma?)\nWhatever you choose, drama, romance, and tense ballroom scenes are sure to follow.\nGood Society comes with nine character roles to chose from, as well as seven different family backgrounds, to capture the full range of regency gentry.\nGood Society will be a full colour hardcover book, packed with over 150 pages of thematic material and beautiful art. Our aim is to create a beautiful book worthy of even Pemberley's library.\nThe game comes with 20 Secret Desire and Relationship cards to keep Good Society replayable and customisable. It also includes all the rules you need to create original desires and relationships of your own.\nPlus, 16 additional cards have already been unlocked from stretch goals.\nOn top of all this, thanks to stretch goal unlocks, backers at All the PDFs and above will also receive a PDF LARP VERSION of the game, perfect for play on a single occasion - and of course, in regency dress.\nAnd, if you were thinking to yourself that the regency era would be better if it was just a little magical, backers have also unlocked a PDF re-theme of the game, Pride, Prejudice, and Practical Magics, that is included in every tier containing the stretch goals. You can read more about this expansion in our update here.\nIn Good Society, supporting characters hold tremendous influence over the lives, situations, and hearts of the protagonists. Not only that, but players actually take on the role of such characters during the game, to inject more drama (and romance!) into the story.\nTo help you create vivid supporting characters quickly and easily, we've created the Deck of Non-Player Gentry. Each (double-sided) card contains two different intriguing regency characters, along with vital information such as their wealth, marital status, and less importantly, their personality. \nThere are now 30 cards in the deck, which will be fully illustrated by Aviv Or (avivor.com). Thanks to a stretch goal unlock we were able to add 10 more cards!\nThere is now also an additional Expansion Deck of Re-theme cards, containing20 unique NPGs, 10 Secret Desire Cards, and 10 Relationship Cards, created especially for Pride, Prejudice, and Practical Magics and Sense, Sensibility and Swordsmanship. You can add a physical version of this deck to your pledge for $25aud.\nWant your regency character immortalised in the deck? Back at the Gentry of Note, or Gentry of Consequence level and work with us to create a member of the regency gentry for inclusion in all copies of the deck of NPGs. \nYour character will be illustrated in full colour by Aviv. This illustration can be based on a written description, or inspired by your likeness, or the likeness of someone you love (with permission!)\nWe don't make any extra profit on the Gentry of Note tier - all additional funds go directly to the artist. We just want to fill our game with beautiful art.\nPlease note, these pledges do not include a physical version of the Expansion Deck of Re-theme Cards. If you would like a physical copy of the deck, simply add $25aud to your pledge (physical tiers only).\nGood Society is a collaborative tabletop roleplaying game, where you and your friends take on the role of regency characters, AND the forces that complicate their lives, to create a truly Austen story. One person takes on the role of the Facilitator, who helps the players to create the game's fiction, and plays supporting characters as needed.\nThe game is quick to teach and easy to learn, whether or not you've played a roleplaying game before.\nNew to roleplaying? Not a problem. The New To Roleplaying Guide has already been unlocked in our stretch goals, so if you want to give roleplaying a go for the first time, now is your chance!\nTo create a game that plays like an Austen novel, we've created a completely original system, with game mechanics that mirror the actual mechanics of Austen's world.\nReputation, family background, rumour and scandal, and of course, the writing of letters, are all important rules of the game. These mechanics are all geared towards narrative and collaborative play, allowing players to work together to shape the story they want to tell.\nAt the core of Good Society is the trade of resolve tokens that grant story shaping powers to players and the Facilitator alike. These tokens let players take actions as diverse as:\nCausing an event, conversation, or circumstance to occur\nManipulating or changing a character's feelings\nProcuring favours or discovering secrets\nCreating details about the past, or even flashbacks \nTo mirror the ebb and flow of an Austen novel, Good Society is played in five phases.\nTo learn more about how the game works, back the game and grab the Quickstart, or view one of the actual plays below.\nGeekSpace TV - recommended!\nUs!\nA minor caution - the end of this Actual Play reveals some of the Secret Desires which appear in the Quickstart (spoilers!)\nAs part of this campaign, backers unlocked and voted for a re-theme of Good Society. The winner was Pride, Prejudice and Practical Magics, inspired by fiction such as Jonathon Strange and Mr Norrell, Shades of Milk and Honey, and Sorcery and Cecelia.\nThis re-theme will be included as a PDF for backers of \"All the PDFs\" and above. In it, characters will take on new roles, desires, and relationships as they struggle with prophecies, glamour and incantations, all while maintaining an impeccable reputation, and finding a suitable match.\nWe've now unlocked a second re-theme of Good Society, Sense, Sensibility and Swordsmanship, inspired by the high number of votes we received for the Scarlet Pimpernel. This re-theme also pays homage to works such as Zorro, and Sovay.\nThe key focus of the theme is on double lives \u2013 with each character having their regular Good Society play materials and concerns, as well as additional play materials that represent their secret bad-ass persona.\nMaterials from Good Society and both re-themes are completely compatible, which means, if you want sword fighting AND magic AND advantageous marriages now you can!\nWe are NOT using a pledge manager for this campaign. Should you be after the Expansion Deck of Re-theme Cards, or additional copies of one of the fine products below, please adjust your Kickstarter pledge by the appropriate amount.\nAdd-ons are only available for physical reward tiers. If you have pledged at All the PDFs and you would like the physical cards, there is now a tier for that, All the PDFs + Physical Cards.\nStorybrewers Roleplaying is made up of Hayley Gordon (twitter: @storybrewers), and Vee Hendro (twitter: @rocketeer_vee).

A planet of flashing swords and choking sands, of winking courtesans and lantern-lit canal cities.\nMars, where fortune and heartbreak are two sides of the same obsidian chit, where lost cities and dry oceans stretch between the last bastions of civilization. Where the First Martians, the monument-builders, are but a haunted memory. Where the Red Martians become decadent and reckless in their last days. Where the Pale Martians rule the wastes, remembering a history whose weight would crush a lesser people.\n    Mars has canals... therefore, Mars must have Venice!\nCavaliers of Mars is a swashbuckling adventure setting from Rose Bailey, longtime developer of Vampire: The Requiem and other World of Darkness titles. Cavaliers draws inspiration from pulp fantasy and historical fiction, adding a modern edge and an exotic setting.\nCavaliers of Mars is powered by the DEIMOS system, in which a hero\u2019s motivations and approach to problems strongly influence her chance of success. In combat, heroes face off with their enemies in contests of tactics and chance.\nWHAT IS THE DEIMOS SYSTEM?\nIn the DEIMOS system, heroes are built from their Motivations (For Self, For Honor, and For Love), their Methods (With Cunning, With Force, and With Grace), and their Careers (such as Cavalier, Thief, or Courtesan). These traits are rated in die sizes, which are rolled as a pool against difficulty dice chosen by the GM. In Cavaliers of Mars, a hero's reasons and approach just as important as their background in solving a problem... or getting into yet more trouble!\nWhen our heroes must draw steel, players choose three dice to represent their character's actions, combining Strikes, Parries, and Stunts. All players roll their dice, then resolve actions in order from highest die to lowest. Players can also use their dice for special maneuvers like Ripostes or Disarms. Combining tactics, chance, and creative flair, Cavaliers of Mars evokes classic fight scenes such as those in The Adventures of Robin Hood, Scaramouche, and The Princess Bride.\nCavaliers of Mars is a new entry in Onyx Path\u2019s lineup of creator-owned games, produced in partnership with Rose Bailey and written by Rose Bailey, Benjamin Baugh, Dixie Cochran, Storn Cook, Steffie de Vaan, Meghan Fitzgerald, Jordan Goldfarb, Danielle Lauzon, Ethan Skemp, Lauren Stone, Travis Stout, Audrey Whitman.\nTo learn more about Cavaliers of Mars, you can check out the CAVALIERS OF MARS JUMPSTART RULES here at DRIVETHRURPG.COM:\nhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?discount=9318cdfe08\nBACKERS ONLY:We'll be providing a link to the complete text for Cavaliers of Mars (barring last minute tweaks) in Backer Update #1. Please let us know what you think!\nRose will be providing excerpts from the Cavaliers of Mars rulebook in Updates during the duration of this Kickstarter, so keep an eye for them!\n  The goal of the kickstarter is to fund the creation, printing, and distribution of a beautiful 180+page, 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover book. Plus, if we meet our funding goal, we hope to unlock many exciting additional projects and upgrades to the book itself!\n  Careers Spread Layout Mock-up\n    It's pretty easy. Contribute any amount you want, bearing in mind the levels of contribution and their commensurate rewards over there on the right. If we hit our $5,000 goal, you'll get the reward that goes with your level of contribution.\nPDFs and Print on Demand items will be made available first in the form of a coupon from our online sales partner, DriveThruRPG.\n\nThe Cavaliers of Mars book will take multiple months from the closing date to print and ship as we upgrade the book due to your support. PDF Rewards and Add-ons will not take as long as the Cavaliers of Mars book, but will come after we send out the Backer Surveys using BackerKit.

This knowledge has been applied to the FAQ below:\nhttp://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/\nRose has been designing games professionally for more than a decade, including nine years as lead developer on White Wolf\u2019s Vampire: The Requiem and writing or co-writing over a dozen roleplaying books. As a video game designer, she\u2019s worked on MMOs like EVE Online and The Elder Scrolls Online. She also writes original fiction, like the adventures of Sasha Witchblood (http://blog.fantasyheartbreaker.com/books-and-games/sasha-witchblood/), and her own independent games, which you can find on her Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/fantasyheartbreaker).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped seventeen Kickstarter projects and several more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Cavaliers of Mars is finished, and we are only looking at adding additional art to the book itself.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of Cavaliers of Mars.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to up the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our last ship-out, for Pugmire, started a month earlier than estimated on KSl.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via

The first of those books, I've printed so I have experience dealing with deadlines, printers and any possible delays.\n\nThis campaign is meant to pay for the artists, shipping and printing of the book. Almost everything is completed before the campaign starts so fulfillment can proceed soon after payment is received. Shipping of products - books and otherwise - will be handled by myself.

It is also inspired by magical teen stories such as Harry Potter and Carry On.\nMagical duels in an original turn-based RPG battle system\nTime your hits to increase spellpower and block incoming attacks\nExplore a sprawling and mysterious school of magic and secrets\nMeet a huge cast of strange and diverse characters\nFind hidden spells, items & equipment to aid you\nA touching story of friendship, rivalry, & romance... in many forms <3\nIkenfell will be available for PC and Mac. Depending on how things go, it may also be made available on other platforms, such as consoles.\n    Chevy Ray is the game's writer, designer, programmer, and artist. He has over a decade experience creating games of all styles and genres. Ikenfell is borne from his love of the Paper Mario game series and the world of Harry Potter.

My 14 years experience developing games is enough to carry me through this project, and I have others (both friends and hires) to carry the weight of the tasks that could overwhelm me (writing and animation, being the big two).\n\nTechnical risks are also a possibility. Bugs that make the game unplayable or inconsistent really ruin the experience. If this occurs, I have a vast amount of programmers and contacts that I can consult with to help me solve any major issues that pop up.\n\nThe other possibility is life occurrences pushing back the release schedule. If something happens, my computer breaks, or a health issue occurs, I could lose precious development time. If that occurs, I will set back the release date of the game. But I will do everything in my power to get it in your hands as soon as possible, and I guarantee your experience playing it will be well worth it either way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 5 or more", "title": "Apprentice", "descp": "Every little bit helps!

It\u2019s about humanity, and how those among us who are the most obsessed have the power to alter reality until it aligns with their fevered desires. It\u2019s about getting what you want despite others trying to keep it from you.\nUnknown Armies presents magick as it might exist in a world co-created by Tim Powers and James Ellroy, as twisting wrinkles in reality created by greater and greater risk, sacrifice, and obsession. In Unknown Armies we ask, what would you risk to change the world? Your friends? Your family? Your health? Your sanity? Magick finds a way to ask the very most from you, until you achieve what you want or you are left with nothing.\nUnknown Armies lets you play one of these characters. Resolve your character's actions through the luck of percentile dice. Track your character's emotional response to significant forms of trauma and shock. Try to accomplish a self-assigned objective or goal in order to get what you want. As part of a cabal, your character helps others to achieve their own goals, as well as a group objective that can \u2014 and will \u2014 have long-lasting consequences when it is met.\nCo-created by Greg Stolze and John Tynes, Unknown Armies presents an entirely original and yet disturbingly familiar approach to mystery, horror, and action in roleplaying games. This new edition, helmed by Stolze, also features the diverse talents of a cabal of contributors: Cam Banks, Tim Dedopulos, Shoshana Kessock, Sophie Lagac\u00e9, Chris Lites, W.J. MacGuffin, Ryan Macklin, Chad Underkoffler, Monica Valentinelli, and Filamena Young. \nSometimes the occult underground is literally underground. Sometimes it's not.\nHere at Atlas Games we love Unknown Armies. Fans love it, too. We want to bring it back. It's a beloved roleplaying game that created ripples throughout the tabletop community when it first came out in 1998, and again in 2002.\nThis Kickstarter campaign is all about taking that game \u2014 a game that has inspired, disturbed, and excited gamers for almost twenty years \u2014 and updating it for a new generation and a new era.\nWe need your help to do this. Change won't happen without broad consensus. Reality won't twist without the focused expression of your collective will. This is Unknown Armies Third Edition.\nUnknown Armies consists of three books presented together as a complete set. Initially softcover, we expect to upgrade them to beautiful case bound volumes in a slipcase once certain stretch goals are met. The books are:\nBook One: Play\u2014The book for players.\nAll of the rules for resolving actions\nThe central shock gauge mechanic\nObsession and identity\nAvoiding fights and then dealing with them when you end up being dragged into them anyway\nThe magick of adepts and avatars\nBook Two: Run\u2014The book for the Game Moderator.\nPresenting the players and their characters with obstacles to their fevered dreams of changing the world\nProcedures for overseeing character creation and setting collaboration in the first session of play\nPlenty of background on the world of the occult underground\nBook Three: Reveal\u2014The book of the weird.\nFuel for the Game Moderator: packed with ideas, hooks, tidbits, scraps, lies, truths, and horrors\nWhat's heresy and what's just hearsay?\nFreaky Game Moderator characters, locations, creatures, and events\nEven more magick\nAn example interior spread (not final)\nInterior spread without splash chapter opening (not final)\nBy backing this project at the $10 level or greater, you get early access to drafts of the three books in their raw, dangerous state. Look for the link in the first backer update. With these documents also come access to the Gamma playtest of this edition, which means we want your feedback about the game before we seal the deal with the Invisible Clergy, AKA our talented production team.\nWe are funded!\nWe've got you covered.\nPublishing three full-color, beautifully illustrated, expertly crafted softcover books is certainly appealing, but we want more for this game, and we want you to help us get there. Here is what we plan to do with backer funds that exceed the initial target set for the campaign.\n$50,000: Hardcover Upgrade - FUNDED!\nWe upgrade all three books to casebound volumes with soft-touch laminate covers. This is a free upgrade to anyone who gets the books in print.\n$75,000: Deluxe Set Magnetic Slipcase - FUNDED!\nWe add a Deluxe Set option, which is the three books in a full-color slipcase with magnetic clasp.

Added as bonus content to all tiers from CHECKER upwards.\n$160,000: Book Four Grows to 96 Pages - FUNDED!\nWe unlock the final set of chains on Greg Stolze and lock his full talent upon Book Four: Expose, increasing it to a total of 96 pages in PDF and EPUB for all backers eligible to receive bonus ebook content.\n$180,000: Add Book Five as Bonus Digital Content - FUNDED!\nAs we delve into the occult underground we uncover new and diverse rituals, organizations, archetypes, and magickal phenomena.

These digital-only products contain everything you need to get an Unknown Armies campaign started:\nFive pregenerated characters, broken and damaged and ready to go\nOne group objective for the cabal to pursue\nA first session scenario to get things moving quickly\nGM hooks, additional objective ideas, GMCs, and suggestions for your aggressive GM planner sessions\nEvery backer who has pledged at a tier that provides bonus ebook content or bonus digital content gets these at no additional cost.

You can thank (or blame) him for several of the new schools of magick in third edition, as well as the pile of free fiction he\u2019s gradually accrued at www.gregstolze.com/fiction_library.

He got his start in the gaming industry by writing articles for Dragon Magazine while he was still in high school. His writing paid his way through college, and he started Atlas Games in 1990 while he was still pursuing his BA in Philosophy at Carleton College, as a way to publish his own work.\nJohn manages the business side of Atlas Games, handling distributor and retailer orders and queries, fulfillment (i.e., packing boxes), accounts payable and receivable, translation queries, and even a little layout and proofreading once in a while. Somehow, it turned out that he hasn't actually published much of his own work, since he kept finding amazing works like Unknown Armies to publish instead.\nOn the road to a better, more productive occult life.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlas Games is a well-established publisher with a 25-year track record. Each member of the team is a seasoned professional with years of experience in game creation and production.\n\nAtlas Games\u2019 finances are stable, our delivery date is conservative, the game\u2019s manuscript is complete, and art direction has already begun. Greg's work on the manuscript is all but complete, and none of the remaining members of the production team are irreplaceable in the event of a serious illness or similar misfortune.\n\nThe greatest risks involved in this project lie in the uncontrollable schedules of our production partners. We're planning to print the core books in this project in China, for example, which brings its own challenges. As mentioned above, though, our timeline has been estimated with great conservatism, and we do not anticipate delays. We can't rule out reality being re-written by adepts in the course of the project, but that's not a specific risk to us and more to, well, everything.\n\nPlease do note that in the unlikely event that we aren\u2019t able to ship rewards to backers before Gen Con 2017, we reserve the right to sell the game at that convention only.

It is set in a world where the \"NPCs\" of the village--the bakers, minstrels, farmers, shopkeepers and healers--set off on a wonderful adventure exploring a fantasy world together. Some people colloquially call it \"Hayao Miyazaki's Oregon Trail\", because of its heartwarming (in Japanese \"honobono\") feel of family anime, and its focus on traveling and wonder over combat and treasure.\nThe game has been out in Japan for years, and is widely loved by the people who play it. Even today long campaigns and short stories are being played in homes and cafes around the country.\nThe Original Ryuutama Japanese Book Cover. Click for a larger view!\nPlease see the website for more in-depth information about Ryuutama.\nRyuutama means \"Dragon's Egg\". It is set in a western fantasy world where the four Seasonal Dragons create and maintain reality. The characters go on an adventure, which is watched from afar by a Ryuujin, or \"Dragon-Person\". This Ryuujin watches their struggles, and records the events of the characters' journey. The Ryuujin then tells those tales to the Season Dragons, which gives them strength, and helps them bear the eggs of future dragons which will protect the world.\nThe background is that every person in the setting, at some point in their lives, feels an intense need to go on a long journey. Their family, friends, and co-workers understand, and help them prepare for their journey. The characters are not powerful warriors and wizards, but rather just normal village people. \nThe character classes are Minstrel, Merchant, Healer, Hunter, Artisan, Farmer and Noble. Each class has a few simple abilities that reflect their backgrounds. Each character can be a fighting, technical, or magic-using character depending on the player's choice.\nThe players play the roles of the characters, and one Game Master (GM) creates and navigates the characters through a scenario. Together, they create the details of the World and the Towns that the characters visit. The GM also has a special character with its own sheet called the \"Ryuujin\", which is a character that remains offscreen most of the time, but watches over the characters: The Ryuujin can cast some limited spells or abilities to help out or guide the characters. The GM creates the adversity that the players have to overcome, but the Ryuujin is out to protect and nurture the characters to some degree.\nTravel and people form the core of the game: While there is a unique console RPG-style combat system that's quite exciting, a majority of the focus of the game is on travel and problem-solving. Hit Point loss and gain mostly happens due to travel, and the unique Seasonal Magical Spells focus on solving interesting problems in unique ways.\nYou just need paper, pencils, a set of polyhedral dice (4, 6, 8, and 10-sided dice), a place to play, and friends with an open heart to play Ryuutama. Record your journeys. Create a tale that you will remember for years to come. Enjoy the time spent with your friends and family. This is what Ryuutama is all about.\nYou can find more about the game, including pictures, at the Ryuutama website. If you're familiar with Tabletop RPGs and want to know how Ryuutama is different, we have a page for that, too.\nYou can peruse some sample English character sheets and the like as well.\nFinally, you can legally download the full original Japanese version of the game from the 100% legit (the author listed it) free Japanese manga download site \"j-comi\" (click on the green \"PDF\" button on the left). The English version will look very similar to that book, but with some extra text and pictures (and of course Be In English!). One day, in a few years, we too hope to make the game available free to all in English as well.\nThe PDF Rulebook - This is a copy of the Ryuutama book in English, running at about 7x10 inches (almost B5 size), 200+ pages, and unlike the original, the English edition will be in full color! It will be gorgeously laid out by layout genius Daniel Solis, using the original Japanese book as inspiration. It will be in PDF format, and distributed exclusively to all backers through DriveThruRPG.\nEveryone at the PDF backer level and above will have their name added into the book as a supporter. When we finish the first editing pass, everyone at this level will get access to the raw \"pre-layout\" text as well, so folks can begin playing before the end of the year holidays.\nWe will also bundle some extras with this as well: New rules, new content, and play aids for the table like Terrain and Weather tracking cards. So it's going to be more than \"just a book\"!\nElectronic Supplemental Material - Matt and Andy are working on translating a bunch of other supplemental material that came out for the original Japanese and translated French editions of the game. We are also having the author write some more material for the game! This includes new character classes, a travelogue of new places and events, and more. We will also eventually be releasing the supplemental Seafaring rules and Navigator character class. It will be released piecemeal in electronic format.\nYou really only need the core rulebook PDF to enjoy the game, This package just gives you a little more for the future!\nThe Physical Book - We're producing a hardcover copy of Ryuutama. It will be black and white, 7 x 10 inches (intl B5 size), all full-color pages, 200+ total pages, all of the contents of the original Japanese book plus some extra materials, information, notes and clarification. \nOriginal Character Art - Miss Toyuki Mizusaka, one of the two original artists of the Ryuutama game (she did most of the art for the supplements), has volunteered her time and energy to do your Ryuutama character sketches! They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. There's only so much art Mizusaka-sensei can produce, so these are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you tell us some things about your character, and she will design a manga-style sketch fitting a Ryuutama game. See the sample sketch of \"Ruru\", below: This is the kind of sketch she will be doing for you.\nOriginal Scene Art - Again, Toyuki Mizusaka has volunteered her time and energy to do a limited number of scene sketches for you or your group. The \"Ryuutama Marketplace\" illustration at the top of this Kickstarter campaign was one such picture. They will be black and white (you can add $40 for full color if you wish), and be delivered electronically in high quality formats. These, too, are in limited quantities.\nWe will send out a survey where you describe the scene and the characters in it, and she will design your scene for you. Some of these sketches may appear in the rulebook!\nScenario Design - Atsuhiro Okada has volunteered to craft original Ryuutama scenarios for you and your group! After the Kickstarter ends, you'll give us some details about what you want to see: He will write the scenario (a few pages), we will translate it from Japanese to English, and we'll also have Mizusaka-sensei contribute two pictures of scenes from the scenario (including of your characters, if you wish) to go with it. \nADD ONS\n* An extra physical copy of the book: $40, no additional shipping cost anywhere! If you live outside of the US, please feel free to gather friends and get books together to save money on shipping! Each additional copy you purchase for a friend, we will send one additional electronic PDF to that person, plus add their name as a Backer in the book! If two or more people each want a \"PLUS PLUS\" level, simply add an additional $10 per person who wants the \"PLUS PLUS\" rewards!\nRuru the Healer, the first Ryuutama character Toyuki Mizusaka played!\nOur goals are simple:\n* We want to develop an English PDF version of Ryuutama that will last forever.\n* We want to produce 1,000 physical copies of Ryuutama in English, and put them into distribution around the world.\n* We want to translate and publish some of the supplemental material for the game, if interest warrants it: More text, limited art, and table aids like cards and printouts that help ease into play faster or make it more fun.\n* We want to do all the above at an easy pace for all of us: No races here: We're in this project for the long haul, and plan to develop for it for years to come.\n* Finally, we want to get more people interested in Ryuutama: It's a wonderful tabletop RPG that deserves attention. We're opening the system, allowing fans to write, produce, distribute and sell their own material for this game.\nAtsuhiro Okada 's motto is \"No Gaming, No Life\": He lives in Tokyo and works at the first tabletop gaming cafe ever created in Japan, Tabletop Cafe Daydream in Kanda ward. His job is to run and play games almost every day of the year, and focuses on getting new men and women interested in tabletop gaming.\nYuki Mizusaka is one of the two original artists of the game, having worked primarily on the art for the original Ryuutama supplements. She's a wonderful person and an avid gamer (player and GM).\nMatt Sanchez is the primary translator of the game. His Japanese-fu is epic and love for gaming strong, almost as strong as his love of the \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\" manga series. He lives and works near Atlanta, GA.\nAndy Kitkowski is the other translator, and the producer of the game. This is the third Japanese translation/publishing project he's worked on, after Tenra Bansho Zero and Maid: The Role-Playing Game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nDaniel Solis is a layout expert and professional tabletop game designer, and he will be doing the layout of the game. He lives and works near Durham, NC.\nWe're doing something new, called \"Milestones\". Instead of drumming up higher levels of money to aim for, we're instead taking our time (so that things don't get out of hand) and announcing goals achieved afterwards. Here's the current list of all Milestone Rewards, together. If the item says \"++\" after, that means it is available to the backers of the \"PLUS PLUS\" levels.\nSee MILESTONE ONE and MILESTONE TWO updates for details on the below.\nSpecial extras:\n* We are funding the creation of a Ryuutama gaming/assistant app, for Apple IOS and Android. It will come out within the next year and be reasonably priced.\nAll level extras:\n* Ryuutama will be in FULL COLOR for all Kickstarter backers: PDF and Physical Book!\n* Random NPC Generation Tables\n* New Rules for Herbalism/Healer Class\n* Topography and Weather cards, downloadable/print-and-play\n* We will be making a free downloadable guide to beginner character creation.\n\nPLUS PLUS level extras:\n* The content of the original Japanese Ryuutama supplements, which includes the following:\n* Wagon Travel Rules ++\n* Road Campaign Creation Rules ++\n* Ocean Travel Rules ++\n* New Class: Navigator ++\n* Konekogoblin PCs ++\n* Random Events for Weather/Topography ++\n* Ad-Lib Style Scenario Hooks ++\n* Additional Character Classes from the French edition of the book ++\n* New Air Travel rules, including skyships! ++\n* And with it, a new Air Pilot character class. ++\nCanadian/Japanese Friends: Shipping to Canada, Japan is $28: See the $68, $78 levels. This is a careful estimate at a 3 lb weight for a 220-page, hardcover book at 7x10 inches plus packaging. However, this puts the book right on the line of 3 to 4 lbs. If it crosses over to 4lbs (because of page count, add-ons) or prices go up on intl shipping again, I may later require an additional $8 USD ($36 total) for shipping at a later date. I'm taking a risk by setting Canadian and Japanese shipping at a lower price, so please bear with us.\nThe Character Sketch, Scene Sketch and Adventure Creation levels have to be set to $40 for now for all intl backers.\nInternational Friends: Shipping is $40. This, too, is at current cost estimates and rates, and seeing that there are no international rate hikes coming in the next 6 months. However, if prices do go up on intl shipping again unexpectedly, I may later require an additional $10 USD. However, this is not very likely. This cost is a one-time cost: If you order 1, 2, or 4 books at $40 each, the $40 shipping fee is a one-time fee applied to the entire total.\nSince international shipping rates skyrocketed in January 2013, it's been hard to easily accommodate our international supporters with reasonable shipping rates for the physical book. We are putting a flat $40 fee on all outside-US shipping (except Canada), even though we know that shipping to Canada and Japan is estimated to be $28; Europe $45-55, and Asia $45-60. We're willing to take a small hit on the books in order to get them to you. Extra donations are always welcome!\nIn any case, shipping within the US will be free. I would highly recommend international backers to look into reshipper/reshipping services (also called \"mail forwarders\" who will work with your country to bring you goods from the US. In most cases you'll receive a US address for us to ship to, and you will pay them about $25-35 (and no cost of shipping from us to the forwarding address) rather than $40; furthermore, the book will get there just as fast as if we had sent it direct.\nAlso, if it's easier, you can always just back the electronic copy of the book: We'll of course grant you full rights to print the book yourself or with a local Print on Demand service; we will also allow everyone to print their copies from DriveThruRPG: For international physical backers, printing a softcover copy locally and having it shipped that way will save you some money.\nAgain, here's how to make international shipping slightly less horrible:\n* Get your friends to buy their copies together: Each additional copy of the book is $40 per book, with no extra shipping costs: Just the one-time $40 shipping fee. You will also get one \"PDF Download Link\" per extra book copy you buy, so your friends will be able to get a download of the game as well.\n\n* Look into a reshipper/mail forwarder that services your country. Using the dimensions above, you may be able to turn a $40 shipping (from USPS) into a $25 or less deal.\n\n* Stick to the PDF version for now. You can then print that version locally at a Print on Demand or other printer if you want. \nThank you so much for your understanding, this really hurt us but we don't want to cause problems in production because of lack of funds.\nNekogoblins (Cat Goblins) and Konekogoblins (Kitten Goblins)\nThe game is done, we just need to tighten and edit. So there is no development time needed, and we'll be avoiding all those potholes. All backers will get access to the \"plaintext only\" copy shortly after the Kickstarter project finishes (or before, if we can complete the first editing pass by then).\nWe support all types of gaming and playstyles: Atsuhiro-sensei plays everything from Warhammer minis (he will roll over you with his Skaven army) to Honobono-themed family games. We all love Ryuutama, and none of us consider it the Final Word of tabletop roleplaying; it's just another great, fun, well-designed game to put in your toolchest and play with your friends.\nFinally, I want to give a big shout out to Andi from Germany of the band Gillicuddy: You can visit his Bandcamp page here. His album \"...Plays Guitar\" is a perfect accompaniment to a Ryuutama game table. When I first heard the tune \"Travelling Made-up Continents\" (the one we used in our video, after asking Andi for permission), I knew that this was the perfect track to accompany this project. The entire album is wonderful: If you're a fan of fingerstyle classical guitar (Will Ackerman etc) it's definitely worth a listen/purchase. Please check it out!\nThank you all for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's not really a lot that could go wrong in a Kickstarter like this. However, I've done one in the past and have learned a lot from the experience. Here's some potential problems and planned workarounds:\n\n* Overall product delay - Not likely. The game is translated from front to back, with the current exception of a few hand-written captions. We just have to edit it, and add two pages of explanatory text. We're not starting the project; rather we're a few meters from the finishing line.\n\n* PDF delay - The layout person, Daniel Solis, is noteworthy for his professionalism and speed. No issue here.\n\n* Book delay - Instead of overseas, we are printing in the US this time with a reputable printer. No unexpected cultural or freight delays. The distributor/warehouse is two states away, and are as well very reputable (we've worked with them for years), so no major problems/\"several months delay\" expected there.\n\n* Overall burnout/Fatigue - We're keeping this Kickstarter simple. We have more in the pipes for it, stuff that will be available to you all, but that will come in time. But me and Matt have day jobs, and want to make sure that we're not going to promise more than we can deliver, and burn ourselves out. Plus, we well-padded our expected deadlines so that we don't blow through them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #53", "update_userinfo": "Quick Update - Supplement, Supplement Print Run, and RPG Second Printing!", "update_content": "Hey Team Ryuutama!
