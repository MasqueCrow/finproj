[{"backer": "AngelSword", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " The campaign may be over, but you can still get Dreamscaper!\nTry out our Alpha Demo!  \nListen to our title track as you read!\nDreamscaper is an ARPG Roguelite blending elements from brawlers, top-down shooters, and dungeon crawlers. \nEvery slumber is a different random dungeon and you must unlock the power of your dreams to see a new day.\nPlay as Cassidy, a young woman trapped in a deep depression. Dive into her subconscious to take on the surreal nightmares she wrestles with. \n\nWe're three game developers that left behind traditional development to make a game that is fun, deeply replayable and has emotional resonance. We find the games we gravitate to the most strike a chord on multiple levels, interconnected in both gameplay and storytelling, and that\u2019s what we plan for Dreamscaper. \n\nPLATFORMS\nAs we're a small team, we're focusing our efforts on a PC release first. We're also targeting additional platforms down the road (Nintendo Switch is planned and hopefully PS4, and Xbox One at a later date). With your help, those can be a reality much sooner! \nAdventure through haunting dreams to discover secrets, vanquish nightmares, and upgrade your gear all while uncovering Cassidy\u2019s story.\nBattle nightmares and make the rush of permadeath your ally as a multitude of surreal items, and an ever-changing world make Dreamscaper replayable over and over again. \nLive Cassidy's waking life - forge friendships, build relationships and learn more about the world around her to bring new hopes and memories into her next dream.\n\nYou'll explore both the waking and dreaming worlds  - your actions in one affect the other.\nWaking\n Build Relationships -  Meet the people around Cassidy and empower her with their hopes and memories to dispel the darkness of her nightmares. \n Unlock Stories -  The further you make it into your dreams, the more you'll learn about Cassidy and her story. Choices you make as the story progresses influence your dreams. \n Earn Upgrades - Progress in the Dreamscape allows you to forge friendships, unlock new weapons, items and powers that will help you once you fall back asleep.\nDreaming\n Confront Nightmares - Face Cassidy's nightmares to help her see the dawn.\n Explore the Dreamscape - Gear up and build your dream powers as you see more of Cassidy's subconscious.\nDreamscaper features a rich combat system that rewards skilled play. Use careful positioning, exact timing and quick reflexes to defeat foes with an abundance of combat options.  \n\nGET UP CLOSE\nEach weapon class in Dreamscaper is unique, from rending the earth below your nightmares to whipping a yo-yo into their faces. You'll have a myriad of options to approach combat.  \nUse devastating primary and alternate attacks to dispatch nightmares - send them flying up into the air, careening into a wall, or slam them into the ground. \nPut on some boxing gloves and weave through attacks as you drop her nightmares to the mat\nCassidy grew up on a steady diet of games, action movies, and comic books.\nAs you explore you'll encounter weaponry (and not-so-weaponry) from her life that's been pulled into the dream.\nCassidy was pretty big into Yo-Yos in middle school\n\nKEEP YOUR DISTANCE\nDon't like it up-close and personal? Ranged weapons allow you more freedom to overcome the nightmares.\nBlast enemies away with finger guns, fry nightmares with laser eye beams, and rattle skulls with soccer balls. Cassidy has an arsenal to discover in her dreams. \nHARNESS DREAM POWERS\nCassidy uses Frost Fracture to put her nightmares on ice, and with a snap of her finger, shatters them and freezes the playing field\nWarp the Dreamscape around you with \"Lucid Powers\" - surreal dream attacks and abilities that manipulate the elements, warp space, and even control time itself.\nDream Rush - slow time to give yourself the edge\nEVADE AND DEFLECT\nCassidy's nightmares are vicious, so you're armed with all the tools to handle them. Shields and footwear allow you to dodge, weave and deflect enemy attacks. \n\nWAKING\nHOME\nCassidy\u2019s apartment is the player\u2019s home base, a reprieve from the intensity of the dreams and a space to dive deeper into the narrative.\nAs players progress and as Cassidy's character grows, this space evolves with them.\nREDHAVEN\nVenture through the town Cassidy lives in, Redhaven. You'll find locals to make friends with at bars, parks, gyms and more. \n\nDREAMING\nHOMETOWN\nThis is where Cassidy grew up, she often dreams of the home she left.\nAs players learn mechanics, they\u2019ll explore some of Cassidy\u2019s most cherished memories and learn why it meant so much for her to have left it.\nCITY\nCassidy's new home. The adjustment for her has been challenging. \nShe feels isolated and lost amidst a very different world than she's used to. Her dreams become a reflection and amplification of this.\n\nCAMPGROUND\nThe calm before the storm.  \nThis memory of her childhood spent adventuring in the woods with her family lets players look into Cassidy\u2019s world and history before everything is upended as her dreams begin to take on a more nightmarish form.\n\n\n\n\nDISCOVER A HIDDEN WORLD\nExplore ever changing Dreamscapes and discover lost memories, surreal scenery and a multitude of unique events, challenges and puzzles.\nAs you venture through the Dreamscape, you'll find:\nChallenge Rooms\nPuzzle Rooms\nEmpowering Shrines\nRestorative Ruins\nStory Vignettes\nMerchants\nChallenging bosses\n\nGEAR UP\nIt's dangerous to go alone.\nDreamscaper features a plethora of weaponry, abilities and items to give you the edge you need to take on Cassidy's nightmares.\nSpecial modifiers and rare items add depth and variety as you plunder through the dreams, allowing you to create unique character builds that encourage strong synergies.\nAs you make progress in the Dreamscape, you'll earn Sand and Glass to unlock powerful upgrades, new weapons, items and more. \n\nDiscover and do battle with the deadly shades and bosses that invade Cassidy\u2019s dreams, clearing the dark miasma that surrounds her.\nChallenging foes will push your skills to the limit as you learn their patterns and unravel the mystery behind their appearance.\nEach shade represents a different emotion that Cassidy is struggling with. From anger to anxiety to hopelessness, her feelings take form as deadly nightmares that overrun her once peaceful Dreamscape.\nEach boss in Dreamscaper is a representation of one of Cassidy's most negative emotions that she struggles with throughout the game.\nBosses not only have emotion dependent looks, but unique attack patterns that are also fashioned after these feelings.\nInsidious and cunning, Isolation exists between dreamspaces, waiting for the moment that Cassidy can be totally separated from all that comforts her\nPLAY\n\nMysterious, hulking, and inescapable, Fear follows Cassidy through the Dreamscape, dwelling just below the surface, ready to erupt at any moment and overwhelm her\n\nA dark, malevolent force, Loss rips apart her memories in the dream world - \u201cI will take away everything you hold dear\u201d\n\n\nPlay as Cassidy, a quiet, young woman lost in her own daydreams.\nShe struggles with a move to a new city away from her support network; she feels more lost than ever. Even her dreams have changed.\nA chronic underachiever, Cassidy is witty, sardonic, and opinionated with a strong moral compass. A natural introvert, she enjoys time on her own - anything that can take her to another world. Now shiftless and indecisive, Cassidy is dissatisfied with the direction she's heading - a malaise hangs about her life lately and she feels more lost than ever.\nShe used to love dreaming, escaping to far away lands and fond memories. Now something feels strained - dark thoughts have been invading her sleep. Although concerned and anxious about it, she doesn't know who to reach out to or how to talk about it.\nAn unexpected tragedy sends her tumbling down a dark hole that she struggles to get out of.\nUnravel Cassidy\u2019s story as you plunge through her subconscious, meet people in the real world and discover dream vignettes. \n\n\n\nWe would not be able to deliver the experience we wanted players to have without the help of an incredibly talented musician. \nWe got Dale North involved very early on in production - as fans of his fantastic work on Wizard of Legend, we're thrilled to be working together to make sure Dreamscaper is as fully-realized as possible. \n\nDYNAMIC SOUNDTRACK  \nAll music in the dreams have a duality to them. While exploring, players can expect a more thoughtful, introspective experience - allowing them to fully take in the Dreamscape. \nWhen confronted by nightmares, the music ratchets up to a pulse-pounding crescendo, complementing the intensity of combat. \n\nUNREAL BOSS TRACKS\nDreamscaper features killer boss tracks - befitting of the haunting emotions that Cassidy is struggling with. As the bosses are manifestations of Cassidy's mental state, each boss track is inspired by one of Cassidy's own emotions.\n\n\nAFTERBURNER STUDIOS\nFeeling burned out in traditional game development, Rob, Ian, and Paul left it behind in the summer of 2018 to follow their dreams and build an indie title they could call their own. Through this, the idea for Dreamscaper was born; a very personal project, drawing inspiration from childhood favorites and focusing on an emotional through line confronting depression and mental health. Afterburner Studios was then formed in the summer of 2018.\nPRESS\nhttps://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/06/18/dream-diving-roguelite-dreamscaper-enters-open-alpha/ \nhttps://www.alphabetagamer.com/dreamscaper-alpha-sign-up/ \nhttps://80.lv/articles/dreamscraper-game-dev-in-ue4-shaders-and-animation/ \nhttps://www.indiegraze.com/2019/06/19/interview-dreamscaper-dev-team/ \n\nBecause we need you! \nAs a team of veteran developers, we are confident we can make a great game. But, in order to make an amazing game as a small, self-funded team, we need feedback, more time, and resources - that's where you come in.\nFeedback\nFeedback about run speed, animation and certain attack animations lead us to take another pass - we're constantly improving Dreamscaper with the help of everyone who plays it.\nWe have a small, but dedicated community at the moment, and the feedback they've given us over our year of development has been instrumental in creating an amazing game.\nWorking with you has been a highlight for us and we plan to continue developing the game in a transparent and collaborative manner.\nScope\nWe have big ambitions for Dreamscaper - we want to create a game that has the depth and quality for many repeat playthroughs.\nYour support will allow us to reach heights that were not possible before.

In the distance, just upon the slopes of a broad cliff, lie the ruins of a city. Her alabaster walls wind their way along the rocky mesa, guarding buildings both fair and ruined.  It was a great city in its day, now long since fallen to the ravages of time and war. Long ago she stood as a shining doorway to the east, a place for rest and restocking of provisions for those on the long trek into the wild lands of the barbaric frontier in the Western Empire. But all that is past for this, the ruins of the Lost City of Gaxmoor.\nABOUT THE LOST CITY OF GAXMOOR 5E\nThe Lost City of Gaxmoor 5E is a sandbox adventure we are converting to the 5th Edition of the world's most popular role playing game. Designed for characters that range from 1st to 10th level. It is the brain child of and written by Ernie and Luke Gygax, the sons of the legendary co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons Gary E. Gygax (who also playtested Gaxmoor). If this campaign is successful, The Lost City of Gaxmoor 5E will be released in hardcover format, in a Full Color, 144+ (probably 160, but we won't know until actual layout) page book that includes a fold out map of the city that retails for $49.99 (was $39.99). The PDF with large fold-out map will retailer for $19.99.\nThe Lost City of Gaxmoor includes the following:\n59 Fully Developed Encounter Areas outside the city walls\n70 Fully Developed Encounter Areas inside the city walls\nThe Labyrinth beneath the city proper\n70 Magical Statues, Pools and Areas of Interests fully developed for campaign play\nan overarching objective for those who desire campaign style play\nover a dozen maps of all the relevant areas\nNPCs and Areas of Refuge\nNew Monsters\nNew Magic Items \nGaxmoor Map Book: This booklet is designed for the Kickstarter. It will include all the maps of Gaxmoor, extracted from the text, updated for this project, in color and printed on heavy, loose leaf card stock for ease of use. Print & Digital combined will run roughly $20-25.00.\nThe Lost Valley Adventure Module: The Lost Valley is an adventure set before the gates of Gaxmoor. It serves the GM as a lead in to the City Itself. It will be printed separately from the Gaxmoor book. This book will run roughly $13.00.\nThe Character Reference Sheets: This are designed in house and sport the Gaxmoor logo! Printed on loose leaf 60lb text paper. \nGAXMOOR, IT CAN BE SO MUCH MORE\nIf our goal is reached, we hope to add stretch rewards that include the Undercaverns of Gaxmoor, terrain building material from Fat Dragon Games and more. And hopefully, if things go very well, we'll begin adding new encounters areas, statues and NPCs.\n USING THE LOST CITY OF GAXMOOR\nThe Lost City of Gaxmoor, written by Luke and Ernie Gygax (playtested by the late, great Gary E. Gygax) is a sandbox adventure setting. You can begin adventures in Gaxmoor immediately or if you wish to integrate it into a larger campaign it can be placed almost anywhere. This includes published settings such as the World of Okkorim (created and published Luke Gygax), the World of Aihrde (Troll Lord Games), the Lost Lands (Frog God Games) or Eberron (Wizards of the Coast); or it can be placed in your own world created at your table. It is designed for parties that range in size from 1-18 with only minor adjustments to monsters and encounters.  \nGAXMOOR HAS IT ALL\nThe Lost City of Gaxmoor is a game master's dream. The setting is full to overflowing with adventures, adventure hooks, set ups and more. With almost 200 Areas of Interest and a veritable host of NPCS, as well as factions of monsters at war with each other, the NPCs and soon the characters as well, it offers countless hours of fun. Throw in the machinations of ancient gods and the rise of a demon prince and you suddenly have a campaign setting that just won't quit. Here's a little more of what you'll be getting.\nOutside the Wall: Gaxmoor begins with encounters on beyond the city walls. These include Grimhelda the Witch, burned out buildings, Weary Travelers Respite Inn and Stable a swamp, the gates, breaches in the city wall and more. \nThe Graveyard: There is a graveyard beyond the walls as well.

Both learned to play in the earliest days of the game's creation, and at the feet of the game's original creator. Not content with that, both authors have kept up with modern iterations of the game and Luke frequently participates in 5E games, often running them himself. Ernie has continued to write, working toward bringing his own massive dungeons to the playing public. Luke runs one of the most successful conventions on the circuit today, Gary Con. \n TLG has had the pleasure of working with both Ernie and Luke for many years, as well as their late father Gary Gygax, both in previous publications of Gaxmoor and in the many years at Gary Con! \nABOUT PLEDGE LEVELS\nCreating Content for Gaxmoor: For those interested in adding content to The Lost City of Gaxmoor, we are very excited about welcoming you aboard. You can join the fray by adding street names, NPCs, beverage names or even designing a short encounter. We welcome all creative, interesting out of the box approaches. Entries should be about 500-1,200 words (unless you are just naming something of course) and will be subject to approval from the publisher and Luke and Ernie Gygax. Entries must be in by December 1. This gives us time to read, edit, get back with you and generally prepare the entry for publication. \nThe Special Leather Collector's Edition: This book will be designed as are other leathers. It will have dual-color embossed logo, with gold trim, hubs on the spine, a place marker ribbon, as well as your name embossed on the front. You can get a better idea of what the book will look like via this video. It was made a few years ago about a C&C PHB collector's edition, but it will get you a good idea of what you are receiving. \n  Below are expansions to the Amazing Adventures 5E game  we'd love to see come to your table.

He told me that he was so in tune with the Elements that he had shrunk down and his features changed to the epitome of those elements.\" \nShe hands you a picture book, \"These are some of the most iconic elemental forces he found in nature and how they can be held in your hands.\"\nAir Elemental\nWhile I was sitting in my nest a gust of wind rushed through my antlers. It tickled me as it played and danced around me. I was so curious that I focused my keen dragon senses and I saw her. She was a wee elemental who had wild hair that danced around her face. She wore a light blue dress and her skin was a sweet pink. We spoke long into the days and I came to realise that Air is the most difficult to describe. She is everywhere, however when she leaves us we are gasping for her and when to much air is near we cannot handle her. The scents she brought with her were divine.  To help humans sense her I have created these rocks that capture a small portion of her essence.  I have many more stories and elements I have met along the way, hopefully we will meet many more together.\nFire Elemental\nI once flew into a fire; its light was dancing and vigorous. Such a voracious appetite, consuming everything in its way; then I saw him, a slender elemental, he had bits of wood he was shoving quickly into his mouth. Delight filled his features as he ate everything, he quickly looked at me as if I was food and I had to back away as fast as I could. He was so dangerous, everything was something that could be consumed, but the heat made my nights safer from the other creatures. \nEarth Elemental\nWhen I was a larger dragon I would spend a lot of time walking along the beaches pondering the vision of land and sea. I could hear a roaring in the distance, I ran thinking a dragon was in trouble and a curious sight was laid out before me. A huge fellow of a man was roaring at the waves every time they came on to land, when it receded he would quiet, and sure enough roar again. I stood beside him shouting my displeasure as well more for company than true anger. \nWater Elemental\nAfter I had tired myself out I saw a woman standing in the waves, she was covered in foam from the sea and had star fish in her hair. She said not a word but would wave her hand to make huge waves. She dove beneath the surface and I followed. To my surprise I learned of an entire world under the waves, filled with life. I watched the sea for a while, sometimes it raged and destroyed the earth, and other times it was peaceful. Always I remembered that its waves are filled with life. \nEther (Space) Elemental\nAs I lay upon a sea island and floating with the waves the sky above me was filled with such vivid wonder. Stars shot across the sky and I noticed massive eyes watching me. They were made up of the stars and I felt a shiver go down my tail. This huge elemental creature was enveloping the world I lay upon. I haven't found the courage to go into the unknown, but maybe one day. \nStretch Goals\n18.000-22500 unlocked 4 sets\n24,000 - All In stretch goal receive stickers of Moonie\n25,500-30,000 unlocked 4 sets\n31,500 - All In stretch goal receive stickers of Zen\n33,000 - 39,000 unlocked 4 sets \n40,500 - All in stretch goal receive Enamel pins of Moonie\n42,000 - 46,500 unlocked 4 sets\n48,000 - All in stretch goals receive Commemorative Coins - Kickstarter Exclusive\n 60,000 - Mystery Set 1 Unlocked\n65,000 - Elemental Stickers - All In Stretch Goal\n70,000 - 1 D6 Resin Brick unlocked - Color TBD\n75,000 - Zen Enamel Pin - All in Stretch Goal\n80,000 - Mystery Set 2 Unlocked\n85,000 - D2 Moonie Coin - All In Stretch Goal\n90,000 - Mystery Set 3 Unlocked\n95,000 - Baby Moonie Enamel Pin - All In Stretch Goal\n100,000 - 1 D6 Resin Brick unlocked - Color TBD\nAdd-ons\nAll our Add-on\u2019s, Shipping, Extra Dice Orders, are going to be processed through BackerKit; once the Kickstarter closes you will receive an email to make any selections you want to add on and to pay for shipping.\nNeat things about backerkit!\n1 - you can pay via paypal\n2 - if financial trouble comes up you can keep your kickstarter pledge, let it fail and then if by the time shipping comes around your life has gotten better you can get the dice then.\n3 - it is an easy succinct system for add ons, updating address, and mass information. \n Dice Trays\nFor $15 CAD (roughly $12 USD) you will get a custom dice tray with Zen in the middle!\nIt will be a stylish black leather exterior and the Interior will have a felt, with the option of being in Pink, Green, or Purple.\nPurple, Green, Pink, & Backview\n Commemorative D6\nFor $3 CAD a die you can order as many of the commemorative D6's you could want!

My Dungeon Master, Jeremiah, and I came up with the idea of creating a book that has hundreds of cut-out pieces used to build more engaging encounters within our game. We started by drawing and printing trees, rocks, and a single house. These pieces made the encounters more interesting and made our game maps looks much better. We decided to see where we could go with this idea, so I called up my good friend Travis (a phenomenal artist) and asked if he could help us create a book. Travis jumped all over it and started sending us some amazing art. Jeremiah built a massive list of important items for Dungeon Masters to use and we slowly built the book Dungeon Craft. \nDungeon Craft is the culmination of a lot of work by a few friends that truly believe it is a great tool for players and DMs alike. We wanted to make a book that was affordable to everyone while still being of great quality. Dungeon Craft is perfect for any D&D essential kit or collection. This book is beneficial for seasoned veterans, new players, young children, and everyone else who enjoys role-playing games. We have been play testing this book for some time and have sent it out into the world for DMs and players to \"put it through its paces\". After all the work and testing, we are ready to present it here to all of you. Thank you for your time and interest. I hope you enjoy our book.\nCheers,\nJosh\nEvery backer who purchases a copy of Dungeon Craft will get all the terrain that is unlocked by hitting a stretch goal during the campaign.\nWith Dungeon Craft, we hope to offer the tools needed for any Dungeon Master, Game Master, and player to build an engaging world to play in. Our goal is to decrease the time spent drawing and increase the amount of time playing your favorite Table Top Role Playing Game. Simply cut out any of the 1,000+ terrain pieces that are in the book and place it on a map.\nEach book contains a ton of reversible City, Dungeon, and Wilderness terrain pieces. We have also included hoards of creatures and a few extra pieces we just couldn't leave out.\n\nUnlike 3D terrain, Dungeon Craft doesn't require much storage space. When you receive a copy of Dungeon Craft, all the terrain pieces come bound in a spiral book. Simply cut out the pieces you need. All the pieces can easily be stored in a binder. The whole book can fit neatly into any backpack for the on-the-go Dungeon Master.\nOur goal creating this product was to make it available to everyone. We understand that this community has enough books that are $50+. Our belief in a quality product at a fair price is paramount. \nAs everything gets more expensive, we wanted to carve out our own path. We have worked very hard to create a product that everyone can afford. That's why we are very proud to release this Dungeon Craft for $30.\nPLAY\n\nTo bring this idea to life we had to find someone who had the ability to deliver quality art. Luckily we were able to work with two brothers who are fantastic artists. Travis and Jordan Kotzebue worked day and night in order to create all the assets for Dungeon Craft. As our community of D&D players thought of wild and crazy ideas, Travis would then piece together all the ideas and draw up a blue line for us.\nIf the blue line looked good, it was approved and moved to the next stage. Travis would then refine his work into a fully inked piece. The final step was coloring, where Jordan would bring the art to life.Working on this project, it was incredible to see our ideas being brought to life so masterfully.\nPLAY\n\n***All rewards that include Hell or High Water will ship in March 2020***\nAlso available in the Kickstarter is our \u201cHell or Highwater\u201d companion books. These two companion books were made to be used with Wizards of the Coast's two newest books \u201cGhosts of Saltmarsh\u201d and \u201cBaldur's Gate Descent into Avernus\u201d \n\u201cHell\u201d is our companion book for Descent into Avernus and contains numerous hellscape terrain pieces that allow you to craft and shape your battle maps to look like the first layer of hell. Included in this book will be all new terrain and creature pieces straight out of the river Styx, all of it there to bring your journey into hell to life.\n\n\u201cHighwater\u201d is our companion book for Ghosts of Saltmarsh. Included in this book is a large collection of creatures, ships and more. Each piece is chosen to help you run the adventures in Ghosts of Saltmarsh and any other seafaring adventure you choose to have.\n ***All rewards that include Hell or High Water will ship in March 2020***\nWe made sure that our product worked with all types of grid mats on the market today. Every terrain piece has a 1 inch grid over it so you can place it onto any mat. For those going for that perfect aesthetic feel, we've created our own wet erase maps that use the same colors and textures as the backgrounds of our terrain. This allows any piece you place on the map to blend right in and look seamless. Right now we're in the prototype stage of creation, but we plan to launch the maps shortly after our kickstarter ends so keep your eyes peeled and follow us on social media for updates or news.\n*The map below is an early test mock-up. The final will match perfectly.*\nWe've partnered with the amazing folks over at LEVEL UP DICE to bring you the Dungeon Craft D20. An aluminum D20 using our own custom font and a mixture of colors never used by Level Up Dice before. This exclusive D20 can only be found here on this Kickstarter.

Since then, right here on Kickstarter, you\u2019ve made an otherwise unimaginable variety of gaming terrain possible.  Thank you!\nAll gamers know that there's one theme that's a key part of any great adventure: danger. \nSo we're proud to introduce our most deadly setting ever: Hellscape!  Only the most intrepid (or the most foolhardy?) will venture into this lethal underworld... where peril permeates the entire plane, and manifests as fire that consumes the very ground beneath your feet.  Here, the threat is relentless -- and your only imaginable victory is survival.\nHellscape brings you detailed, modular terrain so real, so visceral and dramatic, you can feel the blazing magma on your tabletop.  Enter if you dare... \nHellscape has been painstakingly sculpted by hand-- every rippling lava pool, each jagged rock spire, every infernal rune -- by our team here at Dwarven Forge.  Many of the pieces have a 4\"x\"4\" footprint, so modular building is fast and covers a lot of ground.  Months of refinement have produced what we think is our finest painting to date, including specific areas with translucent paint.  \nEverything is  cast in Dwarvenite\u00ae, our proprietary casting material that combines great heft, tactile feel and amazing durability.  For Hellscape, we've developed a translucent, yellow-tinted formulation for most of the lava pieces that allows light to penetrate in just the right places.  About half our Hellscape pieces are completely new; the rest are updated translucent, lava-painted pieces adapted from Caverns Deep.  You can see the entire catalogue of pieces here.  We've done our very best to make Hellscape come alive!\nHellscape pieces include standard anchor magnets wherever practical so they will stick to our terrain trays, making them easy to move and carry without disturbing your setups. \nOne essential feature of all Dwarven Forge terrain is modularity. Hellscape is no exception. You can build the Encounters we\u2019ve pictured -- or you can build something completely new, every time. You can also combine your Hellscape pieces with any of our other terrain for unlimited versatility.\nWith this Kickstarter, we're also introducing some brand new technology: \n\n\nDF Light Panels:  Our goal was to illuminate entire builds at once, without hotspots, embedded connections or batteries.  Place your Hellscape terrain atop these thin, 8\"x8\" Light Panels and illuminate your setup (in the right places) in an instant.  You can use just one, or connect them together in a \"daisy chain\" (up to approximately 9 panels with a single transformer).  One look and you'll understand why translucent Dwarvenite is so perfectly suited to this terrain. DF Light Panels are included in specific \"Illuminated\" Pledges, and are also available as Add-on Sets. \nPlease note: Light panels will accept 110-240 input voltage, but will come standard with US style plugs.  So you won't need to convert the voltage, but you need an adapter to plug into a non-US outlet.  These are easy to find and inexpensive, but we will also try to offer them for the EU and Australia in the pledge manager for a nominal fee.\nPhantasmal Filters: Bold graphics are printed onto these 8\"x8\" thin but sturdy filters.  They look great (and appear opaque) on their own, and magical when placed atop DF Light Panels and light illuminates them from below (you can see the effect in the image below).\n\nHellscape consists of:\n Three Main Encounters: the Crucible Chamber, the larger Torrent of Torment and the giant Soulcage Vault.  Each Encounter can be built as shown, or the pieces can be rearranged and combined with other Dwarven Forge sets in endless combinations.  The only limit is your imagination!\n Add-on sets: A wide assortment of Add-on sets to customize your choices and enhance your collection.  New Add-on Sets will be introduced steadily throughout this campaign.\n Painted and unpainted sets: All sets are available either fully hand painted or unpainted*. Unpainted pieces will mostly be cast in yellow-tinted, translucent Dwarvenite (the color shown below might change a little for production).   Please note: painting Hellscape requires more time and a finer hand than the typical wash and drybrush required for normal dungeon or cavern pieces.  While this complexity makes our painted prices a little more than usual, we recommend painted sets for those of you \"on the fence\" between unpainted and painted selections.\n*Does not apply to Terrain Trays, Overlays, Phantasmal Filters, DF Light Panels and certain Pledge Levels.  \nIf you'd like to back our campaign, our pledge options are outlined below and actual pledge levels run down the right-hand side of this page.  They include:\nA Build Your Own option for those of you who want to select Encounters and Add-on Sets completely \u00e0 la carte.  If you choose sets that contain unlocked free stretch goals, they will be included automatically.  We've photographed some recommended Build Your Own pledges at various price levels (starting at $98 unpainted) here.   With this pledge, you'll confirm all your specific set selections using our pledge manager after the campaign is complete.\n Hellraiser.  This starter option includes an assortment of Scatter Terrain.  These are standalone pieces that aren't just for Hellscape, but go perfectly with battle mats, other types of terrain or even just decorations for your gameroom.\n First, Second and Third Circles of Hell.   These pledge levels feature our Main Encounters, with bonus packs and free stretch goals as specified.  The \"Illuminated\" versions of these pledges include DF Light Panels.\n All Hell Breaks Loose. Our ultimate top level pledge includes double the sets included in the Third Circle of Hell, additional bonus packs -- and two Kickstarter-exclusive, very special resin capstone pieces.\n\nHere are some alternate builds of the pledge levels:\n ENCOUNTER 3 ALTERNATE BUILD\n\nFirst, check out the map below to get the lay of the land and a sense of scale.  Detailed graphics showing our 3 Main Encounters, Crucible Chamber,  Torrent of Torment and Soulcage Vault follow...\nEncounter 3, continued... \nAs the funding level of this Kickstarter grows, our production run gets larger and more efficient. This enables us to add in both: \nFree stretch goal pieces that \"unlock\" (and are automatically added to your pledge) at specified funding milestones. Each free stretch goal fits into a specified set. If your pledge includes that set, you receive that stretch goal when it unlocks; if your pledge does not include that set, you do not receive that stretch goal. \nNew add-on set options that we can afford to tool as our funding grows.\nStretch goal milestones are eligible to unlock until the Kickstarter ends on July 1st, at 9PM US Eastern time. \nOur stretch goal map is shown below.  \nIn addition to the Encounters, Hellscape includes a wide variety of Add-on Sets.  Some Add-ons are actually subsets of the larger two encounters, while others are specific types of pieces that you might want to add to your collection.\nSelect Add-on Sets are shown below.  Click here to see them all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1) First, select a Main Pledge level. These are the pledges shown down the right-hand column of the page.  \n2) Once you select your Main Pledge, you can also include any other set(s) you see on this Kickstarter, as long as it has a price listed on our Google Sheet or our Pledge Calculator. These include anything from small add-on sets, to full Encounters -- or even another Main Pledge level.  Take note of the total amount for everything you want.\n3) To pledge, click on your Main Pledge selection.  Then enter the total amount (including shipping/taxes) of your Main Pledge + any additional set(s) you want, and press \"continue,\" then \"pledge\".  You can modify your pledge as many times as you want until the campaign ends at 9PM US Eastern Time on July 1st.  You don't get charged until the Kickstarter ends.\nHow do we know which sets you've chosen?\nI.  When the campaign is over, Kickstarter will charge you for your pledge.  Kickstarter takes their commission, and then they send the remaining funds to us.  They give us: your e-mail (the one you use with KS); your main pledge level; and your pledge total.  It's then up to us to collect all remaining information.  We do that with our online Pledge Manager.\nII. About 4-6 weeks after the campaign closes, you will receive an e-mail invitation to this online Pledge Manager.  It will be pre-loaded with your main pledge and your total pledge amount.  You'll then enter your name and shipping details, and reconfirm your set choices from our online menu, which will be a much enhanced version of the pledge calculator.  Once you're done, you can download a copy of your order, or even upgrade your selections (subject to availability).  If you didn't include shipping/import fees with your pledge, the pledge manager will also collect them.\nIII. This will be our 7th Pledge Manager, so please don't worry -- this part is easy and fun.  Any questions at that time, we are absolutely available to help!\n\nWhile,  with your help, we've run 6 successful Kickstarter campaigns, we remain a small business in a pretty narrow market.  Kickstarter -- primarily through our amazing backers -- provides a platform that funds our tooling and allows us to produce relatively vast assortments of products that simply wouldn't be feasible if we were speculating which items -- and especially how many of each -- you wanted.  In addition, Kickstarter helps us reach a lot of passionate gamers who have never heard of us.\nWe remain deeply committed to this platform and most importantly, to the backers who support us.  That's why we continue to offer our Kickstarter backers:\n Kickstarter-exclusive prices that will never be as low again.\n Guaranteed availability of backers' set selections (which, although we try, is nearly impossible to offer on our website).\n Our guarantee that Kickstarter backers always receive their product before any Hellscape items are sold to any other party.\nShipping is not included in the pledge and set prices. You can see exactly how much your shipping will cost on our Hellscape Spreadsheet. (If you are including Add-on Sets, Kickstarter cannot provide you with shipping totals because it does not capture any shipping associated with add-on sets.)  \nPlease include the shipping in your total pledge. If you choose not to include the shipping, our post-campaign Pledge Manager will collect your shipping charges.\nTaxes Our Hellscape spreadsheet and pledge calculator will provide totals for import fees/taxes for shipments to the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. Duties, taxes and fees for shipments to other countries are not included and will be collected by the courier upon delivery.  In addition, sales tax for shipments to NY and Connecticut will be collected in the pledge manager.\nWe deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these extra charges.\nAbout half the pieces in Hellscape are already tooled, since they are translucent, repainted versions of Caverns Deep pieces.  Therefore, we expect the tooling and production to be a bit faster than Caverns Deep, and we expect to commence initial shipments by April, 2020.\nPlease spread the word and join in the Comments section.

We are very familiar with the technologies, skills and resources required to produce and deliver the rewards promised in this Kickstarter.\n\nDelivery time is an estimate based on our best available information. \n\nWe intend as before to have all our product tested for safety and reliability. All the of products shown in the stills and video are resin prototypes. While our actual production should be even more refined, there might be some minor changes made to facilitate production.\n\nWe're all concerned about the looming threat of tariffs, and their effect on our costs. We simply can't (and won't) charge our backers for tariffs that don't (yet) exist. It's already hard enough to keep prices as low as possible when factory production costs are steadily rising -- and when we're always striving to design ever nicer products. \n\nSo the cost of possible tariffs is not included in Hellscape pricing. If tariffs are imposed before the project is fulfilled, Dwarven Forge will pay them; we will not pass this cost onto backers. After that, we'll have no choice but to pass along tariff costs when the sets hit our website, and price them into future campaigns.

Your support has been truly inspirational.\nFor those of you that may have missed the chance to back us during the Kickstarter, fear not! Once production is underway we will be updating the links below to send you to our shop. Many of our products will be available for purchase.  \nIf the link doesn't work yet, don't worry, just keep checking back. We have a lot to do for our backers before we can switch modes.  \n \nHaving illustrated for Magic: the Gathering for over 20 years, Terese is one the most popular and beloved artists to ever illustrate for the game.  With over 200 cards to her credit, she is also one of its most prolific.\nWhile illustrating for Magic has been a rewarding experience, Terese has always wanted to experiment with new materials, media, and techniques that expand well beyond the world of Magic.\nThe Tokens of Spirit project is the realization of this desire, for Terese to explore and expand her artistic horizons while creating some of the most beautiful and engaging Tokens and Playmats the world has ever seen. \nIn partnership with the team at Original Magic Art, Terese has designed a collection of rewards that are functional, memorable, and beautiful.  \nExplore the page below and help turn her vision into reality.\nBring a bit of Terese with you to the battlefield with these Tokens of Spirit.\nAll tokens will be printed on high-quality 300 gsm blue core card stock.   After sampling multiple paper weights, finishes, and suppliers, we are really proud of the quality of these tokens. \n The project is launching with 36 of the most popular tokens, packaged in a custom, and extremely sturdy, two-part rigid box. Each Token Set will have 1 of each token. With your support, we can include even more tokens, which will be automatically added to the sets.  \nAs new Tokens are unlocked via Stretch Goals, they will be added to the image below.  \n   Since not all art will be completed when the Kick starter project ends, be sure to check out the completed tokens once they're done! The button below will update after the project is over.\n  Essential Token Set Back\n\nNow that tokens have all been unlocked, here's the final count of what you'll get in each set. \n \nFor the discerning Token collector, we offer our Premium Foil Tokens.\nPrinted on high-quality, blue core 300 gsm card stock with an added holographic foil layer, these tokens are absolutely radiant.\nEvery token unlocked through the project will also be available in Foil.\n  Thanks to you amazing backers getting us to $250k and unlocking some EPIC stretch goals, all Foil tokens will now be LAYERED foils. What this means is that each token will have parts that are shinier and catch the light, custom to that card. It's hard to illustrate, but if you've seen Foil cards from a certain popular game that these tokens can be used with, you know exactly what we mean. Here's a mockup of how it could look. \n  Layered Foiling means better contrast for the darker areas  and truer color for the midtones. Vianki will process the art for each card selecting both tonal highlights and content highlights (such as swords or gold gilt bits) for the most effective foiling. \nIn addition to the tokens created for this project, we took some of these amazing images and created custom playmats for you to enjoy. These playmats will be 24x14.\nStunning artwork on quality materials, these playmats bring Terese's artwork to life.\nBelow are all of the Playmat designs currently available through this project.  As new playmat designs are unlocked, this list will expand: \n \n Since not all art will be completed when the Kick starter project ends, the final playmat designs will be voted on by backers once the art is complete. Be sure to check out the completed art and playmat selections once they're done and voted on! The button below will update after the project is over.\n  Hand printed by Terese on 13\" x 19\" archival, museum-quality paper, these prints are simply stunning.\n  Any image unlocked in this Kickstarter can be ordered as a print. Here are a few of Terese's newest works. \n   Art Print Design not final, subject to minor changes. \nYou can view all of the Art currently available through the project here.\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    Perfect for stores of any size, the Retailer Bundle allows you to stock your shelves with Terese's excellent Tokens and Playmats.  \nAlso included in this reward is a Foil Uncut Sheet and a Promotional Poster. \nAdditional quantities of everything offered through this project are available to backers at this level at a similarly discounted rate.  Contact OMA if you are interested in a custom order.\n\nCelebrate Labor Day weekend with Terese and the Tokens of Spirit team!\nJoin us at Terese's getaway house in Carson City, NV for a great weekend of Magic, a tour of Terese's studio, and a gallery viewing of all of the artwork created for this project.  \nThose interested in Terese's original artwork take notice, this private viewing will likely be the first and only time the all of the sketches and paintings from the project will be on display before being sold.\nMeals will be included for Saturday and Sunday morning but you will responsible for all travel and accommodations for the trip.\nEach backer at this level will also receive a 4\"x4\" original piece of artwork hand painted by Terese and their choice of a Premium Collector\u2019s Bundle or Retailer Bundle.\nThis truly once in a lifetime opportunity to spend time with your favorite artist is limited to only 10 backers, so you better move fast!\nWant 50 Squirrel Tokens and another Premium Foil Set?  We can make that happen!\n  Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount and once the project is finished, you'll be able to select your Add Ons in the Backer Survey. \nThe project is launching with 36 unique tokens and 3 playmat designs, but we have even more in the works unlockable via Stretch Goals, along with some amazing upgrades to Playmats, Foil Tokens, and more.\nAs each Stretch Goal is achieved, more will be added to the list below.

We've run into problems in the past, but we've dealt with each and every one of them, making sure to communicate roadblocks to backers and always delivering the promised rewards.\n\nThere are several issues that could arise from additional proofing requirements to customs issues. No matter what comes up, we will let backers know and get everyone their rewards without fail.\n\nIf the project does significantly more than our goal *crosses fingers* we will have to work with a fulfillment company to deliver rewards. We've already made arrangements with a very good company and we are confident that we will be able to work with them to delivery everything in a timely and cost effective manner if needed.\n\nStretch Goals could add additional design, proofing, and production time to our schedule.

Use the stump to mark a hidden location in an adventure or as a tactical objective in a battle.\nThe included template is made from thin, double-side neoprene. One side depicts a forest floor to set the trees upon. If your game doesn\u2019t require you to use a template, it still looks great with the trees on top of it. The reverse side depicts a small pond, another natural feature for your tabletop setting. \nThe large tree trunk is 6 inches high and the medium tree trunks are 5 inches high.

Aside from the change of colors, the contents of this set are the same as the Verdant Forest set. \nThe Twilight Forest set contains three Trees, each with mysterious blue leaves, a Stump, a two-sided forest floor Template, a blue Frog, and a Cut-Down Tree Stump and Saw. Aside from the change of colors, the contents of this set are the same as the other forest sets.\nThe Blossoming Forest set contains three Trees, each with beautiful pink leaves, a Stump, a two-sided forest floor Template, a pink Frog, and a Cut-Down Tree Stump and Saw.\nThe Forsaken Forest set contains six Trees, two Stumps, and a pair of two-sided forest floor Templates.

You may choose from any one of the forest colors unlocked during the campaign - Verdant Green, Autumn Orange, or Twilight Blue. Each set will contain six Tree Tops of the same color.\n\nThe Rock Hills set contains one large multi-level rock Hill, one medium multi-layer rock Hill, a small Rock model, a Rock Cairn, and a Signal Fire. The hills have plenty of wide, flat surfaces that you can place your models on as they climb over the rocks, or place other terrain pieces on the hill. The sheer back of the hill is designed so you can fit two hills together to form a larger hill, or place other rocks along side of it creating a new shape. Or the sheer sides of the hills can block the path of your models or provide cover to larger creatures.\nThe large hill is 10 inches long, 6 \u00be inches wide and 3 inches tall at its tallest point. The medium hill is 4 \u00bd inches long, 3 \u00bd inches wide and 2 \u00bc inch high. The small rock is about 2 inches square and \u00bd an inch high.

Together on the templates, these pieces can be used to represent an area of rocky and uneven ground that is \"difficult\" to cross. Or the pieces can be scattered across the table, providing cover and hiding places for your models.\nTwo tall rocks can easily conceal a normal-sized humanoid model. The two medium rocks can provide plenty of cover and act as a natural barrier shielding your models from harm. The small rock can also provide a reasonable amount of cover or conceal a hidden objective. Both of the fallen trees serve as natural barriers or obstacles; they can also mark the edges of a path or dangerous area. The included templates are made from thin neoprene. They each depict an area of rocky ground. If your game doesn\u2019t require you to use a template, they still look fantastic on the mat as patches of bare earth.  \n\nThe Barren Ground set contains a collection of five different-sized Rocks in a desert tan, two Fallen Tree Trunks, a Stump, two area Templates, and a Skeleton, a Dirt Pile and a Shovel.  Aside from the change of colors, the contents of this set are the same as the Broken Ground set.\nBridges & Barricades includes four pieces representing wooden Footbridges or Barricades as well as a pair of small square wooden Platforms, four sets of wooden Steps, a Chest, and a pair of wooden Door Panels. The set can be used to construct a long footbridge or grouped together to build a large wooden platform. Where this set really shines is in conjunction with the Rock Hills and other rocks from the Broken Ground set. Link two rock peaks together with a treacherous bridge, place stairs against a rock face to allow your models to move over it, or set the pieces on their sides to serve as an obstacle or barricade. The bridges have panel sections that lift off to act as gaps or trap doors in a bridge or a hole in a wall. The panels themselves are useful as accent terrain on your battlefield.\nThe bridge sections span 5 \u00bd inches in length. The general width of all of the pieces is 1 \u00bd inches. The stairs scale up to 1 \u00bc inch and the gap for each step is tall enough that most humanoid-shaped models on average-sized bases can stand on the stairs. \nAdd-Ons are additional rewards that you can purchase on top of your pledge. If you wish to include an add-on to your pledge, simply add the total dollar value of the add-ons you wish to include and add that amount to your pledge. You may also include add-ons during the Pledge Manager phase for a limited time. \nThe Monster Game Mat is a versatile two-sided gaming surface for use with your favorite tabletop wargames or role-playing adventures. The Monster Game Mat is printed on thin, double-sided neoprene roughly about 2.5 mm in thickness. One side of the mat is the Broken Grassland \u2013 a green field of grass and plants, broken up by bare spots and bits of buried rock. The other side depicts the Desert Scrubland, a dry, dirty environment of sand and cracked earth where weeds and other plants struggle to break through the surface. The mats are available in a variety of sizes for your adventures and battles.\nThe 6x4 ft Monster Mat is large enough for major battles or epic adventures.\nThe 6x3 ft Monster Mat ensures that your epic galactic conflicts are quick and decisive.\nThe 4x4 ft Monster Mat is perfect for skirmish battles or quick clashes.\nThe 4x3 ft Monster Mat allows you to fight gripping skirmishes and create legendary sagas.\nThe 3x3 ft Monster Mat is a tight environment for furious clashes.\nThe 22\u201d x 30\" Monster Mat is ideal for kill-focused team combat between rival squads.\nThe Monster Adventure Mat has all of the art of the Monster Game Mat with the addition of a 1\u201d square grid overlaid on top; perfect for your role-playing encounters.\nThe Monster Adventure Mat is available in sizes of 22 x 30\", 3x3 ft,and 6x4 ft.\nThe Village Well is a great decoration for your tabletop.

Scattered in your Forests, tucked between your Rock Hills or lining a road or patch, Bushes can conceal hidden dangers or provide cover for your troops.  \nThe Large Bush is 4 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 2 inches tall. The Medium Bush is just under 4 inches long,  1 \u00be inches wide, and 2 inches tall. Finally the Small Bush is 1 \u00be inches long, 1 \u00bd inch wide, and 1 \u00bd inch tall.

These unearthly geological growths may be the radioactive remnants of a doomed world, supernatural extensions warding the world from danger, or fuel for an ancient empire awaking after eons of unnatural slumber. Crystals are useful as scenery decorations or objective markers.\n\nTame your wild Forests and Hills with the Ladder, Crates, & Barrels assortment.

Based on your location, we will either ship to you from our hub in Europe (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or the United States (USA and the rest of the world).   \nBackers who do not complete their Pledge Manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via e-mail notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from our US location. This may incur additional shipping costs to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time.    \nDue to the size of the rewards and the risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes either domestically or internationally. \nMonster Fight Club is a close-knit team of hobby industry veterans whose purpose is to evolve tabletop gaming through fun and unique board game experiences; innovative accessories, terrain and models for tabletop role-playing games and wargaming; and creating distinctive pop culture collectibles.\nThe team behind Monster Fight Club includes many former staff members of Gale Force Nine, including its founder, John Kovaleski. Other staffers and designers have worked for companies such as Games Workshop, EA, and Digital Domain. We have been innovating tabletop terrain for well over a decade; we know how to make and mass-produce awesome looking terrain that will bring your games table to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is our first Kickstarter, we have produced games and hobby accessories, including pre-painted terrain, in China for many years. There are many variables when producing anything overseas such as production delays, shipping delays and customs delays to name a few.\n\nThe estimated delivery date is March 2020, but this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via e-mail to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and may lead to project delays which could impact your fellow backers. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We are both avid gamers, so we thought that it would really amazing if we can customize our characters visually so that everyone at the table could see how their characters look like. \nThere's also something satisfying about being able to visualize how your newly found Flame Tongue sword looks like on your character.\nWe happened to be both trained in design and art, and pixel art is something we're pretty good at. So that's how we started our Reroll journey, by doing this as a passion project outside of our daily jobs.\nWe have also engaged an awesome Development team to help us develop the app and also the website (if we hit our stretch goals). The prototype we've seen so far is absolutely amazing.\nWe have been doing this as a passion project with a development team handling the app programming. Kickstarter is a great way for us to validate how much demand there is for an app like this and fund the app development.\nWe also love crafting pixel art. The more we raise, the more likely we'll be able to spend more time doing this, or even be able to do this full-time! :)\nThe app is currently in development, and we have a basic prototype that is about 60-70% complete. We hope to complete development of the app and have a Beta version of the app ready by second half of 2019.\nFrom then on, we will gather Beta feedback from you as we get the app ready for launch. As Kickstarter pledgers, you'll get your hands on the app months earlier before everyone else. \nAt the same time, we'll always be working to add on more armors & weapons (and races if we hit that stretch goal).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all software development projects, there may be unforeseen delays due to the complexity of the project.

Mereston prodded it carefully with the tip of his dagger, suspicious. But if those doors bore traps of some kind, would he even recognize them as such? If the crafters even were people at all. These doors weren't at the right width and height for humans, elves, or dwarves. Everything seemed so strange.\nLaera stood behind him, still examining the crescent device. It was solid like metal, but smooth like leather. A circle of glass at the center of it showed strange runes made of light that shifted and moved. If anyone could figure out what it did, it would be her. Mereston took a step forward, through the doorway.\n\"Wait,\" Glaur hissed through gritted teeth. \"Something's coming.\" He gripped his axe so tightly that Mereston could see his knuckles grow pale. His eyes grew wide. \"No, something's here.\"\nRearing up before them with a shriek, the monstrous beast resembled an insect, like a centipede, except that it was made not just of flesh, but also somehow interwoven with both glistening metal and solidified light. And it was larger than the house Mereston grew up in. \nLaera exclaimed as her hand passed over a part of the device and an eruption of seething energy burst forth and enveloped the three of them. The creature lashed out with a whiplike tail but it was repelled by the energy around them and rebounded harmlessly away.\nLaera grinned at the device. \"Hmm. I like this thing.\"\nIn the misty recesses of time, before the kingdoms and lands you know existed\u2014before the elder elves, the dwarven ancestral lords, and even the dragons\u2014civilizations undreamt rose and fell. And with their passing, they left behind remnants of the powers they wielded. They built citadels of metal, glass, and light, now hidden away in the deepest recesses of the world, and crafted wonders and harnessed energies we can only guess at. These places, objects, and even creatures all can be called Arcana of the Ancients.\nArcana of the Ancients is a sourcebook for 5th edition players and GMs to bring the wonders of mysterious technology and weird science-fantasy elements to their traditional fantasy campaigns. Designed by Monte Cook, Bruce R. Cordell, and Sean K. Reynolds, all of whom have years of professional design experience working on the world's most popular roleplaying game, this gorgeously illustrated hardcover sourcebook gives you everything you need to add a whole new element to your 5E game.\nIn Arcana of the Ancients, you will find:\nAdventures: This book will start out with an adventure that you can insert into your existing campaign right away that will introduce the concepts of ancient civilizations, weird technology, and new strange creatures. From there, we'll expand on the concept so that it can become a feature of your setting if you wish.\nTechnology: Hundreds of new items, both new wondrous items and \"cyphers\" (one-use, cobbled together bits of ancient tech), for players to discover and learn to use. These items  harness strange energies, warp space and time, create permanent structures, and so much more. At first, figuring out how to use these items will be challenging, but therein lies much fun!\nCreatures: Dozens of new creatures, each with awe-inspiring artwork, presented to use in your campaign. Science-fantasy creatures are notably strange, replete with mysterious abilities that create unique challenges and opportunities for your PCs. \nGM Advice: You'll get pages of suggestions and guidelines for how to incorporate all these concepts into your existing campaign, or build a brand new campaign with science fantasy in mind from the get-go. \nPlayer Options: Players can take on science-fantasy aspects all their own, including mutations, cybernetics, and more.  \nJaw-Dropping Artwork: This book will be lavishly illustrated by talented artists such as Kieran Yanner, Mirco Paganessi, Lie Setiawan, Federico Musetti, and more. We feel this is vital because so much of the joy of introducing the weird elements of science fantasy comes from a visual presentation of what the player characters actually see.\nMonte Cook Games (MCG) was founded in 2012 and our first product was Numenera, a standalone science-fantasy RPG and setting. Numenera has won just about every award a tabletop RPG can, and produced a line of more than two dozen supplements, a licensed computer game, a board game, and a deckbuilding game, as well as a short film.\nMonte Cook, designer of Numenera and creative director of MCG, is a veteran, hall-of-fame game designer with more than 30 years of professional design experience, much of it on products for Dungeons & Dragons, particularly as one of the designers of the third edition of that game. Likewise, most of the rest of the design staff at MCG, including Bruce R. Cordell and Sean K. Reynolds, possess decades of design experience with both D&D and Numenera.\nMCG is comprised of eight game-loving, talented, passionate people. In addition to the designers mentioned above, our team includes: Shanna Germain (MCG co-owner and managing editor), Charles Ryan (MCG co-owner and COO), Tammie Webb Ryan (administration manager), Darcy Ross (communications relations coordinator), and Bear Weiter (art director).\nThe entire team at MCG is dedicated to producing extremely high quality, easy to use products. We feel the (more than 100) products we have produced over the past seven years shows this commitment and encourage anyone unfamiliar with us to check out some of our free sample products such as Ashes of the Sea and Escape From Jade Colossus.\nWe're doing this Kickstarter for one simple reason: because so many people have asked us for this. Our Numenera game is popular, and the following is growing every day, but 5E players have asked us if there would ever be a way to incorporate some of the elements of Numenera into their game. And finally the answer is yes.\nIf you want to learn more about Numenera, and in particular why the elements of that game might make pretty damn cool additions to your 5E game, go here.\n\nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge for the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Your Best Game Ever, add $50 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for. \nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nPDF OF THE ANCIENTS: This is the level to choose if you only want the PDF version of the Arcana of the Ancients book.\nEXPLORER OF THE ANCIENTS: Choose this level if you want both the print and the PDF versions of Arcana of the Ancients.\nEVERY PDF! Choose this level if you only want PDFs, but you want everything this campaign unlocks. We hope to fund not only Arcana of the Ancients, but through stretch goals, some follow-up products as well. If you have backed one of our Kickstarters in the past, you know this ends up being a fantastic deal for a number of products.\nYOUR BEST ARCANA EVER: Choose this level if you want Arcana of the Ancients and Your Best Game Ever in both print and PDF. Your Best Game Ever comes out in the summer of 2019 and inside this gorgeous hardcover book, suitable for your coffee table or your gaming table, you will find advice and suggestions for enhancing your RPG experience at the table and away from it. This is an insider\u2019s look at everything that goes into the hobby\u2014finding a group, making a character, running a game, creating adventures, finding all the right ideas, hosting a game\u2026and that\u2019s just for starters. Go here for more information. \nEXPERT OF THE ANCIENT PAST: Choose this level if you want both the PDF and print version of not just the Arcana of the Ancients book, but the follow-up books we hope to unlock through stretch goals. Who knows how far the campaign will go and what will get added by the end? (As stated above, if you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know this will become a great deal.)\nPURVEYOR OF ANCIENT SECRETS: This level is for retailers only. You'll get six copies of the Arcana of the Ancients book that you can sell, most likely earlier than anyone getting the book through regular channels.\nPLAYTESTER OF THE ANCIENT PAST: Just like with the EXPERT level, you get everything this campaign unlocks, but you also get early access to the material. Basically, you\u2019ll get the material when the playtesters do, and if you want you can provide feedback from your playtests like they do. However, you\u2019re not obligated to do so. You can also just select this level and gain access to the manuscripts early.\nTRUE FAN OF SCIENCE FANTASY: This level provides you with everything that the PLAYTESTER level does, plus your copy of Arcana of the Ancients will be signed by the design team. \n** WE HAVE CHANGED OUR SHIPPING POLICIES. PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PRIOR TO BACKING **\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. It also ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email it is time to redeem a reward. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or\u2014if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase\u2014you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop (using the email address you gave us in BackerKit). Once you\u2019ve logged on to your MCG Shop account, you\u2019ll go to your Coupons page, and you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. \nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. United Kingdom backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but at this time, due to the uncertain situation regarding Brexit, we cannot promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fourteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, dozens of hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record.

I'm a photographer, artist, pin maker, and this is the third Kickstarter i've launched. I've worked as a freelance photographer, lived abroad in England,  traveled around Europe photographing different countries, I have a full time job at a rad tech startup, I own a pin company, I have both a bachelors and a masters degree, and my baking skills are Great British Bake Off level. All of that sounds really great on paper, but what that paper doesn't tell you, is that I struggled through hours and hours of work, and frustration, to accomplish those things...i've got ADHD, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. First and foremost, ADHD is my main squeeze, anxiety and depression are a result of living with ADHD.\nAs is common with girls and women, I wasn't diagnosed with ADHD until later in life. When a psychiatrist first said \"My professional opinion is that you have ADHD\", I just didn't believe her. I was a good kid, did marching band for 8 years, I did really well in school, and I was at the top of my class during my undergrad \u2013 surely she was mistaken. \nI researched the f*ck out of ADHD. The more I read, the more I realized that I carried the same misconceptions and ideologies that the general population does. I thought ADHD meant that you had trouble concentrating or sitting still. What I learned is that everything about ADHD is so complex, that it borders on being incomprehensible at times. Even the term Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, is misleading and incorrect in describing what it is. The symptoms, the brain chemistry, the cognition, the neurological and genetic theories, are so far beyond \"not being able to pay attention\".  Every time I did research, and read about other people's stories, it was like someone was telling a story from my life. \nI studied film and media theory for my undergraduate degree, so for my master's degree I chose the Film, Photography, and Media studies program at Leeds University in England. One of the best things about studying media, is that it is so pervasive, that you can study pretty much any topic. The concentration of my master's degree was studying the representation of people with mental illnesses, and the associated stigma, through media, from the 19th century to the present (talk about getting really niche. I studied everything, from how people with mental illness were represented, to associated stigmas and their detrimental effects to all of society, and even what happens in the brain of a person with a mental illness, when they consume media. This resulted in a 42 page thesis and a photo essay that took a look into the small and intricate cues of my \"disorder\". Getting a post-graduate degree with ADHD was arduous, but at that time, I did it without stimulant drugs like adderall, and I graduated with honors. \nWorking on that graduate photo series.\nOne of my dreams in life is to give a TED talk on ADHD, breaking down how the ADHD brain works, and what life is like living in a world where your brain works differently. I would gladly sit here and debunk whatever misconceptions are out there, but then we'd be here for years. This is just my story, but the whole campaign isn't just focused around ADHD. Needless to say, mental illness, mental health, and stigma are topics that are very near and dear to my heart. I have wanted to create this project for a very, very long time.\nThe cover image of the photo series for my graduate thesis.\n\nWhile you're perusing through the project, please keep in mind the following:\nYou'll find that the first 9 pins of this project focus only on ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression. I am aware that they are not the only mental illnesses that exist in this world. In fact, there are a multitude of different illnesses, disorders, and conditions. Mental health is unique to everyone, so I can only speak from my own experiences. While I would love to branch out and make pins for other illnesses, so that everyone feels heard and represented, I don't feel like I can interpret an illness that I have not experienced or lived through. I don't feel that I have that authority. \nWhile these pins are based off of my experiences, my hope is that maybe you'll find a pin that you can also relate to. If any of these pins resonate with you, remember that you're not alone, because I, as well as millions of other people, have gone through the same struggle. We may experience our illnesses in our own unique ways, but there are some common stigmas and experiences that we have all had to face. I also understand that some people may disagree with what I have to say, and that's totally cool, no one is forcing you to pledge to the campaign. \nWhy did I title this campaign \"Own your Stigma\"? \u2013 Also a long story.\nWhen I was first diagnosed with three mental illnesses, I felt guilty, selfish, like I was a burden. I didn't want to believe it to be true about myself. I went to therapy, tried some medications, and kept it all on the down low. Then over the course of 6 years, in my early adulthood, I went through experiences that were traumatic for me. Soon after that it just kind of clicked for me. I was sitting in my room and out loud to myself I just said \"This is so f*cking dumb. I didn't choose this, my mental health problems are not my fault. Why have I allowed other people to dictate how I feel about my own life?\" It may have just been something I gained from age, or from some empowering sociology classes in college, but my best guess is that I came face to face with one of my deepest fears. Ever since then I have been 100% percent honest and open about my mental health, and the fact that I take medication and go to therapy. I realized that if you can just be a genuine person, and communicate honestly and openly to others, you'll learn that there are so many other people fighting the same fight, that have the same fears that you do.\nWhen someone stigmatizes you, for whatever reason, they're exerting power over you. This doesn't mean that they're always doing it maliciously, sometimes it's out of sheer ignorance or lack of knowledge. When I was younger, if someone called you a slut, it was an insult. If someone were to call me that today, i'd probably find it funny and laugh. It's a good example of a word that carried a stigma, and instead of fearing that stigma, overtime, women just took ownership of the word. We started speaking out about slut shaming, and about how women should be able to be open about their sexuality. Women took ownership of that label, and once we owned it, we took the power back. \nIf someone tells me i'm being over emotional, I say \"yeah? so what. What's wrong with showing emotion?\" People don't know how to respond to that because then they have to admit, out loud, the unspoken rule that we always have to keep our emotions in check. A really sh*tty ex once called me crazy and erratic when I became emotional and anxious, from discovering his unfaithful activities and compulsive lying. Needless to say, that relationship did not last, and it has been over for some time. When we first got together, I had failed to see the red flag when he told me \"his ex had depression and emotional problems, and that she was crazy\". Recently, we had contact where we got on the topic of our relationship. He told me that he couldn't be calm and faithful when someone, (meaning me) was so volatile. Ironically, I had never even raised my voice at him, until I found out what he was doing behind my back. Let me interpret what he was really saying, \"I was unfaithful, and I didn't like your emotional and behavioral response to that, so that justifies my unfaithfulness.\" He tried to stigmatize my ADHD by saying I was erratic. He used my ADHD and anxiety as a scapegoat so he couldn't be held responsible for the pain he had caused me. At that time in our relationship, I had responded with a completely unapologetic emotional response. Did I take the high road, probably not. I said some terrible things out of anger, and did a few things out of pettiness. A good amount of time has passed since then, but from our last encounter a few months back, it's clear he hasn't changed. Many people have asked why I stayed so long. He had his own mental health issues, addictions, and vices, and for the longest time I was patient, forgiving, and I made every attempt to be understanding and to not stigmatize his issues...but I was not met with the same compassion. Indeed this is a long story of an ex, that involved so many more factors, but the importance here, is that this was the most traumatic time that anyone had ever used a mental health stigma to manipulate me, shame me, and take away my power. For a long time I was angry that I let someone do that to me, I felt weak, like I wasn't the strong, independent woman I wanted to be, but it was the most pivotal moment in my life. It was the moment I realized that if I just took ownership, than my ex, or anyone else, could never have that power over me again. I owned the stigma he tried to place on me, I took the power back, and I became a stronger, more empathetic, and caring person. \nWhen this Kickstarter meets its base goal, the first three brain pins will be unlocked. All pins after that will be unlocked when they hit their \"funds raised goal\". The pins will first be sold at an early bird price of $8 per pin, however, there are a limited quantity of early bird spots. When the early bird spots are gone, each pin will sell for $10 each, unless noted elsewhere. This campaign involves 20+ pin designs. More pins will be uncovered as our funding increases. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted elsewhere.\n*Please Read \nThe Once Daily pin is the first time we are experimenting with new materials. The left side of the pill will be filled, by hand, with a special epoxy. This is so we can create the look of a pill with one colored half of the capsule, and the other side clear. We've ordered a test batch of these pins from the manufacturer, because I personally will be filling each pin with the epoxy. If the test does not work, and we realize this was a bust, we'll still produce these pins. The only change is that the clear part you see on the left will be filled with stained glass enamel. Stained glass enamel is not clear, but it does create a unique look.\n The freebie pin is only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Please Read \nThe Mosaic Heart is a pin that will contain stained glass enamel. The white part you see is regular white enamel, but the colored sections will be stained glass enamel. This process means that all the colored spots will be cut outs, that are then filled with an epoxy/enamel mixture. This produces an opaque look, somewhat like, well stained glass. If you hold it up to the light, the colored parts will show some light. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice. The most important thing to note here is that this process can be expensive. If you choose this pin as one of the designs for your pledge level, it will be the only time you'll be able to get it at that price. After this campaign ends, this pin will retail for somewhere between $12-$15. If you've never seen stained glass enamel, google it, and you should find some examples. \n *Please Read \nThe rainbow pins you see above are what's called anodized, or rainbow, metal. The metal plating is a rainbow color that looks really nice in the light. Pins made with anodized metal will always be soft enamel. All pins in this campaign are hard enamel, unless noted otherwise. Below is photo of our logo pin so you can see what this metal looks like. \n *Please Read \nThe Spectrum pin will contain stained glass enamel. The white opaque part you see, inside the prism, will be a milky opaque stained glass enamel. If you hold it up to the light, some light should shine through the stained glass part. While stained glass enamel can be beautiful, it is sometimes hard to produce, and can be risky. The color of the stained glass may vary from pin to pin, and there is the possibility of a few very tiny bubbles in the enamel. These should be minor things you will barely notice.\n I'm more than happy to create more label pins. I like fonts.\nIf there is a label pin you'd like to request, please message me directly. Please message me with the mental illness, condition, or disorder, and how you think it should appear as a label. For example, if you have Bipolar Disorder, should the pin read Bipolar Disorder, or just Bipolar. Please also keep in mind that I will only create labels for another three conditions, because if I made one for every condition, we'd be here all damn day. Please don't message me with a physical illness or condition, for now  i'm only making these for mental illnesses recognized in the DSM-V. (i.e. Autism, Bipolar, PTSD, OCD, etc). I know there are some people who have qualms about \"labeling\". This pin isn't saying that your illness is all you are. I wear my ADHD related pins in hope that if someone wants to ask, i'm more than happy to answer any questions... and the next time my partner looks at my disorganized room with a smirk, i'm going to smile and point to this pin. Even though i'm only making another three label pins, this doesn't mean there that others won't appear in the future. Another note: It might seem that this stretch requires a much larger sum of funds raised to unlock. This is because even though these pins are small, they call for three seperate mold fees. Mold fees are paid only once, but they impact the cost when producing a new pin.   \nFreebie pins are only included in pledge levels that include pins, meaning if you only pledged for the stickers, you won't receive this. \n*Due to the nature of this pin and it's complexity, it's subject to change. We'll notify you of any changes made to this pin before your survey lockdown.\n\nThe other day I did a rough estimate of how many pins we\u2019ll be manufacturing...and it was over 20K. That\u2019s alot of pins which means alot of backing cards. Now I know there are some of you out there who collect backing cards, some of you just throw them away, and some of you even graciously offered to not have one, but I like backing cards. I like designing backing cards, I like quality cards, and even before I launched this campaign, I was designing the backing cards for it in my head. I wanted to try something new, and having a campaign with such a high volume of pins, meant that this was the time to try it. So here\u2019s how the backing cards will work. We\u2019ll be using 4\u201dX6\u201d, 22pt stock, postcards, and each card will hold 4-6 pins depending on size. If you purchase one 1-2 pins, you\u2019ll receive your pins on a typical square backing card. If you purchase say 7 pins, then you might get 5 of them on a postcard and two on regular sized backing card. Unfortunately, you won\u2019t be able to choose whether you receive postcards or individual backing cards, and you won\u2019t be able to specify which pins go with which cards. While buying more than 20K regular backing cards is possible, it would mean we would have to cut the quality. I won\u2019t do that for this campaign because I have a special idea in mind. Let\u2019s say that you purchased 5 pins, so you\u2019ll receive them all on a postcard, but you\u2019re really adamant about a single, regular sized, backing card, because maybe you want to give one pin as a gift. In this case you\u2019ll be able to purchase a single backing card in the add-ons section for 25 cents a piece. (also take note that freebie pins come in the regular factory bag and not on a backing card)\nAfter this Kickstarter campaign has ended, Kickstarter will collect the funds for your pledge level. If your payment is declined, Kickstarter allows you 7 days to \"fix\" your pledge. If you miss the 7 days, you will still have the opportunity to reinstate your pledge through your BackerKit survey. After these 7 days have passed, we will send you a survey from a pledge manager called BackerKit. This survey will first ask pledge level questions, this is where you designate which designs you want. Once you've finished your pledge questions, the designs you've chosen are automatically added to your item list. After pledge questions, you'll go through an add-ons section (sort of like an exit through gift shop situation) Add-ons are optional, and do not affect the items from your pledge level. We haven't posted pictures yet, but here are some things you can expect to find in the Add-Ons section.\n- Stickers (both sticker packs, and individual stickers)\n- Locking backs\n- Pins from previous campaigns or what we have in stock at that time\n- Any extra pins you might want from this campaign\nKeep checking back, as i'll soon add the sticker design mockups. \nStickers\nBelow are the first four stickers for the add-ons section. There are more to come, and not all are just sticker versions of the pins. The stickers range in size from roughly 2\" - 5\". \n\nIt's hard to show what a holographic overlay looks like on a sticker mockup. It's essentially and overlay that reflects back a full spectrum of rainbow colors when you move it around in the light. Below are holographic stickers that Snarky Co. has made in the past. \nWhat is an Add-On Stretch Goal? \nThe reason we use a pledge manager like BackerKit, is because it allows us to create more comprehensive surveys, and streamline our shipping process. BackerKit has a feature called an Add-On Stretch Goal. For my first campaign, I had an idea for a t-shirt design, but I didn't know if anyone would actually want to buy it. So I contacted some screen printing companies, priced out t-shirts, and then added it to the add-ons section of the survey. Three people ordered it. Whenever you manufacture a product, there's a minimum order quantity. The minimum quantity is usually the product at is highest price. To have t-shirts printed, I needed 50 people to order them, and that didn't happen. I ended up contacting those three people and letting know that I had removed the t-shirt from their order, and that they wouldn't be charged for it. \nThe add-on stretch goal will show up in the add-on sections, and it'll have a banner that says something like \"Hey we need 50 people to make this happen\". As people add this item to their carts you can see whether this product is going to be made or not. When you complete your survey, if you add any extra items, you'll be prompted for your card details. You won't be charged when you complete your survey. You'll be charged at the lockdown date, and we'll notify you when that date is. If we don't meet the minimum quantity for an add-on stretch goal you may have ordered, then it is removed from your order, and you are not charged for it. This allows us to put out other products like patches, t-shirts, and key chains, to see if people actually respond to them. It's essentially a fail-safe, if we like a t-shirt design, but then find out no one else does, we aren't stuck manufacturing 50 t-shirts because only one person ordered it. \nWe are still talking to manufacturers to work out pricing on all these items, so we don't have a price estimate at the moment. What we do know, is that we are offering add-on stretch goal items at a discounted price to Kickstarter backers only. If you pre-order these items after the campaign, you'll order them at full price. \nPatch\nBelow is a somewhat blurry photo of a chenille patch. The red and light green are the chenille, which is a soft fuzzy material. The seeds and stem are done in embroidery, and the black outline is felt. Chenille patches are often what you see on varsity letterman jackets. \n T-Shirts\nDuring the Kickstarter campaign you can pledge a monetary amount in any of the pledge levels. Your money won't be withdrawn from your payment method until the end of the campaign. Funds will only be collected if we meet our goal. \nAfter the campaign ends, your funds will be drawn from Kickstarter, and then you will be sent a survey to pick out your rewards and add your shipping info. We will be using a pledge manager called BackerKit to send out surveys. There will also be an add-ons section to your survey, where you can add on extra items, such as sticker packs, locking metal backs, or additional pins. Payment details will be collected in your survey to pay for any last minute added items. \nOnce the funds have been released from Kickstarter I can start production!\nPlease Note: \nOnce orders have been locked down we have a no refund or return policy. After orders are locked and funds are secured, production orders will be placed and paid for. The amount of funds determines the quantities that we need to fulfill this campaign. We will only offer refunds for extenuating circumstances or if you rewards were damaged in transit.  \nShipping for your pledge level will be collected on Kickstarter during the campaign. This project is only shipping to the following countries: USA, Canada, The United Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland. \nIf there is another country you'd like us to consider shipping to, please contact us directly. We will attempt to see if we can arrange to ship to your country. Shipping fees for other countries have not yet been determined, but when you contact us we will give you an estimate. \nPledge Level Shipping is a fixed rate that is based off of the amount of pins in your pledge level. Keep in mind some pledge levels have as little as one pin, and some pledge levels have as many as 20. We will be using the U.S. postal service for shipping. \nUnited States: $4 - $10\nCanada: $11 - $25\nUnited Kingdom, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland: $15 - $25\nIf you choose to purchase extra items in the add-ons section of your survey there may be added shipping fees. Any extra shipping fees are based on the weight of your package, for example, adding a sticker pack has no additional shipping fee, but adding another four pins may have a shipping fee. \nWhen shipping internationally we will make every effort to properly fill out customs forms. We will abide by your countries customs and shipping laws, which means we will denote the package value as the cost of your order, and mark this as merchandise. Please do not ask us to change the value of your package, or mark it as a gift. We are not responsible if your country holds your package and requires extra payment to release it. \nBelow you can find the estimated timeline for this project, as well as the funds breakdown. \nMarch \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Begins\nApril \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign Ends and funds are collected\nApril \u2013 Surveys are sent out\nApril/May \u2013 The pre-order store is open\nMay \u2013 Orders are locked down and sent to the manufacturer\nMay/June - Pins are in production\nJuly \u2013 Shipping of rewards begins (the reason rewards will not ship until June or July is because it takes several weeks to manufacture the pins, package orders, and send them out) If all materials are produced earlier than the estimated shipping start date we will of course begin to ship in asap.\nKeep in mind that July feels like a long ways off, but for our last two campaigns we shipped well before the estimated ship date. Our first campaign was supposed to begin shipping in February 2019, and instead we sent out our last 20 orders in February. Our second campaign was set to begin shipping in April and we started shipping the first orders in the last week of February, and the remaining orders will all be sent out in mid march. We've consistently shipped early so far. We can't make any promises for this project because sometimes with crowdfunding there are unforeseen circumstances, but if all goes well like the last two campaigns, you should get rewards before July. \nCheck out our social media pages, Etsy store, and previous campaigns!\nSnarky Co. Pins - Our First Kickstarter.\nKiller Queens - Our Second Kickstarter. \nwww.snarkyco.com\nInstagram\nPatreon\nEtsy\nThe Things to Know section contained our policies for this campaign, but we've now moved it to the Risks and Challenges section of this page. Even though we've re-located our policies, they still apply. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'll be using trusted manufacturers that i've worked with before, but occasionally, minor mistakes can be made, and delays in production can happen. \n\nI will always be upfront with backers along the way. I will disclose any setbacks, delays, and any other pertinent updates.\n\nIt's important to understand that this is a crowdfunded campaign. Crowdfunded campaigns are often subject to delays due to unforeseen circumstances. Please also understand that money pledged to a crowdfunded campaign is a donation or investment. This is not an online store and you will not immediately receive your rewards after pledging.\n\nPlease note that minor changes may occur in production, and that the images presented here are my mock up designs. There is a possibility of slight changes in color and size, but I don't foresee any major issues.\n\nPin Grades\nThe Snarky Company offers two grades of pins, First Grade, and Second Grade. First Grade pins are really the only pins I offer in my online stores, and they are the only ones available for Kickstarter campaigns. Second grade pins are only available through online stores, and currently we're not offering any. Our pins are handmade and they may have minor cosmetic imperfections. \nExamples of expected First Grade imperfections:\nSmall buff marks, scuffs, or scratches on metal/enamel\nSmall specks, pores, or bubbles anywhere on the pin\nSlightly low or uneven fills\nSlightly misaligned screenprinted details (for pins with screenprinting)\nSlight variations in the distribution of giltter\nSlight defects in text (this is usually only in pins with small text)\nWe want to make you aware that these First Grade pins may have small imperfections, but 99% of the time, these imperfections are non-existent or not noticeable. \nAn important note about color and size.\nIt is crucial to understand that while we have made pins before, the pins in this Kickstarter have not yet been manufactured. The designs you see on this page are only mockups, which means the final product may have slight changes in color and size. Taking your two dimensional design, sending it to a manufacturer, and receiving a three dimensional, physical object is difficult. From our experience, the majority of our pins turn out looking like the mockup design. \nThere are so many variables when you see a mockup that you are viewing on your computer or phone. Different computers, phones, or other devices have different screen settings which means we may not all be viewing the same coloration. We use a Pantone Solid Coated book to choose the colors for our designs. The manufacturers use those Pantone numbers to know which colors to mix and apply where, however, looking at a Pantone swatch on paper, is different than looking at a Pantone color in enamel. \nEach mockup has a rough estimate of what the size will be. Our sizes are either specifying the general height of the pin, or width of the pin, however, the actual size of the physical product may vary. \n\nGlitters\nWhen you view a mockup design that has components with glitter, it is crucial to understand how glitter overlays work in Adobe Illustrator. Glitter textures are artificially created in Adobe illustrator. We have glitter textures in various shades for each color, but they come no where near to the hundreds of different glitter colors that manufacturers offer. The mockup design may show you a section of dark blue glitter, that has flecks of dark blue and silver, however, the physical glitter may contain specs of other shades of blue, green, or silver. When you see a mockup design with glitter, understand that the glitter overlay is to give you an idea of the general color of the glitter, and where it will be on the pin. When a pin has holographic glitter, it will be labeled as holographic glitter. Holographic is what you could call rainbow glitter, each spec of glitter can reflect various different colors. What you should know about holographic glitter is that it reflects different colors depending on the enamel it is placed in. When placed in white enamel, it reflects a shade of light blue, when placed in black enamel it reflects a shade of green. \nRefunds or Exchanges\nAfter the campaign has ended, you will have ample time to make your pin selections in your BackerKit survey. You will be notified before surveys are locked down and any add-ons are charged. Once your order is locked down, we have a no refunds or exchanges policy. The only time we will issue a refund or replacement, is in extenuating circumstances, or if your pin arrives damaged (please read the section on pin grades to determine if your pin is damaged). Examples of damaged pins are, posts that are bent and unusable, posts that may have fallen off, or whole chunks of enamel that are missing. We will also offer refunds or offer to reship an item if it is missing from your order. \nRubber Backs vs. Locking Backs\nEach pin from our campaign will come with rubber backs, but we highly recommend purchasing locking backs. If you choose to adhere your pin to a jacket, bag, or other item, with a rubber back, and it falls off, we will not replace the missing pin. We do offer locking backs through our add-ons section in your survey. \nShipping Policies\nPlease visit the shipping section to read about these policies. \nComments\nMental Illness can be a very intimate and personal topic. Any one who leaves a comment that I determine to be rude, defamatory, or ignorant, will be blocked with no explanation. \nThe Denim Jacket Pledge Level\nIf you pledge for this tier, after the campaign has ended, we provide a sizing chart where you can choose your size. We'll provide 1-3 different options for jackets. We prefer Levi's jackets, but we have other chosen brands that are also great quality. From the options we provide, you'll get to choose which jacket style, color (if that style has color options), and of course your size. For the collector's box you have three options for engraving. You can choose just our Logo, just your name, or you can choose to have the Logo and your name. You'll receive one of each pin, and if that pin has multiple color options, you'll receive one of each color (for example, the Pill pin comes in four colors, you'll get all four). All pins will come on backing cards, with locking backs, and arrive packed in the collector's box. Please be careful when choosing your jacket size, as we cannot provide an exchange or refund if it does not fit. Once your pledge level is locked down (you'll be notified before the lockdown) the pledge level is non-refundable. If any of your items are damaged in transit, we will replace them though. If you purchase this tier as an international backer, we properly fill out all customs forms, but we will not be held responsible if your country loses your package through their mailing service (this means once the package is no longer with the USPS), or if they hold your package and ask for additional VAT, taxes, or fees. You'll also receive any add-on stretch goals that are successfully unlocked. If any add-on stretch goal is not unlocked, it will not come with your order. If you have any questions about this tier, please feel free to reach out.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Give me the Stickers!", "descp": "This tier will include one random sticker pack.

It\u2019s mostly just me packing for 8-10 hours a day, and one day, and a few nights a week my partner helps. Every order is unique and they\u2019re packed one by one. An order can have anywhere from 1-100+ plus items. Which means we\u2019ve packed some orders in a couple minutes, and other larger orders have taken roughly 30 minutes. (It\u2019s frustrating sometimes when you\u2019ve been packing large orders for 2 hours, and you look down to see only 10 packages completed) Two of us worked for 8 hours on a Saturday, packing small orders, and were able to complete 242 orders. A single person packing for 8 hours, cannot do 100 orders, unless all 100 orders had 1-4 items. The numbers here are just to give you a rough idea on how long it takes to actually pack an order. I treat packing orders like a full time job, but it\u2019s still only me packing.

The most recent shipping info is in the update titled \"Last Shipping Update at the Moment\", with the exception of one change. At this time I'm lacking both space and manpower. Only a few people are qualified to help with shipping, and that is due to the fact that only a few people are allowed access to our shipping manager. The shipping manager with all the order information has private personal information, which is why someone has to be vetted before they can help. The people who are able to help have full time jobs, so currently it's just me shipping orders. Most recently, it took one week to just pack the denim jacket tier pledge level, and the wholesale orders. These were very large orders, that required me to pack 2000 pins. While they've been packed, we are still figuring out the best way to ship them, because our original shipping boxes were too large. This project has over 100 SKUs, every order is unique, and there's no way to mass pack orders. Even bringing in someone new to help with shipping is challenging because it takes a good amount of time to teach them everything in order to understand how to navigate 100+ SKUS and a new shipping software.

In the chronicle, the Contagion acts as a motivational force and inspires the formation of factions where vampires, werewolves, mages, mummies, etc. come together in new and unique ways.\nOnce joined together to deal with the Contagion, these factions will never see their world (or each other) the same way, and will be forever changed. Each time the Contagion emerges to threaten the fabric of our world, the only beings capable of manipulating, slowing, weaponizing, or halting it, are the unnatural denizens from across the Chronicles of Darkness. The Contagion permeates Infrastructure and warps the known antagonists and supporting blocks present in the lives of every inhuman being.\nThe Chronicles of Darkness, which debuted in 2004 as the new World of Darkness, drew upon the roots of the original World of Darkness and introduced a new look into a shadowy, dangerous world. Players could step into the everyday shoes of mortals, or they could vie for power and control as a vampire, werewolf, changeling, geistsin-eater - and more.\nNow, some 15 years later, the Chronicles of Darkness and its supporting lines are flourishing, with each game receiving second editions, starting with the 2013 release of the Chronicles of Darkness rulebook. \nAll of that development will be for naught, however, if the Contagion spreads, taking the supernatural world with it, and writing a single bleak end to all tales told in the Chronicles of Darkness.\nThis Contagion Chronicle Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a prestige hardcover edition designed to match the look and feel of our other Chronicles of Darkness core rulebooks such as Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, or Changeling: The Lost.\nWe want to create an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed on a metallic under layer, and featuring an emboss/deboss of the logo. We estimate the book to be more than 280+ pages, with a two-color interior and endpapers on high quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and add additional materials for play, including rules for multi-type supernatural interactions and new locations and manifestations of the contagion! We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Contagion Chronicle will include all the rules you need to combine the various protagonists from the Chronicles of Darkness game line. It features Vampire: The Requiem, Werewolf: The Forsaken, Mage: The Awakening, and all the other lines from Promethean: The Created to Deviant: The Renegades! \nThe Contagion Chronicle contains new playable options in the form of the Sworn and False Factions, new powers in the form of vectors, new antagonists, Tilts, and Conditions, and a broad array of settings and chronicle hooks to keep you playing for year \nChapters include:\nThe Sworn and the False - Your playable factions in the Contagion Chronicle \nThe Vectors - Powers available to the Sworn and False\nPlagues, Interstitial and Otherwise - A history of Contagion and how the different factions formed\nStorytelling - Thorough, accessible advice on running your crossover chronicles\nFive chapters of Contagious fiction\nOutbreak Sites - A rich campaign setting spanning all seven continents and providing 12 different playable settings from Odense to Edinburgh, San Francisco to New Zealand, and Kyoto to Antarctica\nThroughout this Kickstarter campaign, we will be posting complete previews of the Contagion Chronicle manuscript as backer-only updates. \nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Contagion Chronicle that is possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers, but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Contagion Chronicle, expanding into rules companions and other Storyteller and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we are able to explore these scenarios and challenges. \nThirdly, we want to celebrate the legacy of the Chronicles of Darkness by offering an opportunity to cross-pollinate ideas from all the lines, encouraging a story built from all elements of our Chronicles games. We'll help backers by including a discounted selection of PDF titles from the Midnight Library \u2014 the rulebooks for each of the current lines contained in the Chronicles of Darkness. \nBeyond all of those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 open a path to a new world; a setting for our community to build new stories and entwine imaginations. Every person who participates in this campaign is joining with the goal of giving this game physical form \u2014 and like the Contagion itself, spreading the joy of the game. When you back this project, you join our alliance and we explore this story together. \nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($50,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to load a larger version of this reward tier chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Infected and Host Reward Tiers), or go all in with the prestige hardcover (Carrier Reward Tier)? Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Epidemic and Pandemic Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!)\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Contagion Chronicle campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Bio Response Unit) will get 5 copies of the hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount so that they can sell in-store.\nSeveral Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Contagion Chronicle book or a possible supplement. A limited number of may be created if we hit Stretch Goals and fund additional supplements. Finally, as a Consulting Developer, you will act as be copied on all e-mails and receive all drafts during the development of a future Chronicles of Darkness product produced by Onyx Path. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details. \nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for the Contagion Chronicle. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates. \nPDF VERSION - The digital version of the Contagion Chronicle, fulfilled by our partners at DrivethruRPG.com. Kickstarter backers will receive an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DrivethruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nPRESTIGE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus.\nPLAYER'S COMPANION PDF - A supplement containing crunchy rules section(s) on supernatural interactions with examples and guidance (ie, \"What happens when a Vampire does \"X\" to a Mage?\" and similar issues). Built via Stretch Goal achievements, final length and scope will be determined by how many sections are added. Will be included in the rewards list of all backers receiving the Contagion Chronicle PDF.\nGLOBAL OUTBREAKS PDF - A travelogue supplement PDF will be created for the Contagion Chronicle, adding new locations and new manifestations of the Contagion. The Global Outbreaks book will also contain more on the factions, vectors, and sub-splats. Built via Stretch Goal achievements, final length and scope will be determined by how many sections are added. Will be included in the rewards list of all backers receiving the Contagion Chronicle PDF.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Contagion Chronicle, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com and cards from DriveThruCards.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.  \nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run. \nPDF Rewards will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG. Previously-released titles are the ones currently available from DrivethruRPG.com and were created as best they could be depending on the state of the files. So quality may vary from title to title.\nThe Midnight Library contains relevant rulebook PDFs for the Chronicles of Darkness, which can be added on to your reward list. Specific title selection will be made in the BackerKit post-campaign pledge manager. The Midnight Library Collection includes:\nChronicles of Darkness Core Rulebook PDF\nVampire: the Requiem 2nd Edition PDF\nWerewolf: the Forsaken 2nd Edition PDF\nMage: the Awakening 2nd Edition PDF\nChangeling: the Lost 2nd Edition PDF\nPromethean: the Created 2nd Edition PDF\nChronicles of Darkness: Dark Eras PDF\nDemon: The Descent PDF\nBeast: the Primordial PDF\nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy of the the Contagion Chronicle (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.\nACHIEVED! - CONTAGION CHRONICLE: PLAYER'S COMPANION - \"Death\" - A Player\u2019s Companion PDF supplement will be created for the Contagion Chronicle, containing a crunchy rules section on supernatural interactions with examples and guidance (ie, \"What happens when a Vampire does \"X\" to a Mage?\").

To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/ ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the Contagion Chronicle is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "PATIENT", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive access to the backers-only manuscript preview update posts.\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "INFECTED", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you will receive a PDF version of The Contagion Chronicle.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Contagion Chronicle PDF\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["545 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "HOST", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive a PDF copy of the Contagion Chronicle.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Contagion Chronicle PDF\n\"At Cost\" Print-on-Demand option: The Contagion Chronicle\nAccess to Manuscript Preview Updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["107 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "CARRIER", "descp": "As thanks for your support, you'll receive both the PDF and the prestige hardcover versions of the Contagion Chronicle.

Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production.

We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. \n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes.

We're making an album to fix it.\nHi! We're the Doubleclicks: Aubrey Turner (she/her) and Laser Malena-Webber (they/them). We're a sibling musical duo from Portland, Oregon, who make indie folk music about love, science, and anxiety. We have a cello, we have a ukulele, we have a cat keyboard that goes meow meow meow. \nYou can listen to our our music on YouTube, Spotify, or Bandcamp for free! \n    We're known for making music on the Internet with you, other human beings. We also tour and play places like PAX, the JoCoCruise, SF Sketchfest, GenCon, and comics shops, game stores, and comedy clubs. We've released a handful of albums, three of them through the help of Kickstarter, and we want to do it again! Are you ready?  \nABOUT THE ALBUM: \n The time since our last album has been strange! For the first time since our inception, the Doubleclicks took a year-long break from performing and recording to live \"real lives.\" We even got day jobs for a minute there! Did you all know that there are entire groups of people in the world who live their lives OFF of the Internet? It's WILD. \n         Our break taught us a whole lot! One of the things we learned is that we are pretty bad at day jobs. And also, reality is pretty cool. And also, the Internet has ruined a lot of stuff. We learned that, then we came back together to write the longest, realest and funniest Doubleclicks album yet. We're also going to bring this big rad album on tour - even to Europe!\n         \"The Book Was Better\" is about a lot of things: gender, dogs, cats, anxiety, Halloween, and pizza are some of the things. But the big theme is this: We spend too much time yelling on the Internet, and we should all try something else. Certainly we can't stop using the Internet, that would be ridiculous. But just a tiny break sometimes, yeah \u2014 that's probably good. Go to a museum. Go roller skating and break your arm. Try to throw a birthday party and don't cancel it when you get overwhelmed at the very idea of human interaction. \nIt's a comedy album. \n         Tracklist:\n Clifford the Big Red Dog \u2014 body image and a dog\n Ode to a Summer Retail Job \u2014 a song about wet money \n Afterparty for One \u2014 an ode to frozen pizza \n Boundaries \u2014 a song about Laser's cat, Marzipan. She's perfect.\n Something I Can Hold \u2014 a song about the House on The Rock \n We're All Gonna Die \u2014 this one's a lot of fun!\n Happy Birthday, Nobody Hates You \u2014 a celebration for the anxious\n Nobody gets it \u2014 A Halloween song \n I'm Winning \u2014 a song about being genderqueer or maybe videogames\n Brand New Year \u2014 a song about the best-laid plans\n I Don't Wanna \u2014 no!\n The Ballad of Millie Rosa Jane \u2014 a sea shanty?\n Panic \u2014it's gonna be ok\n Check out this video for our new song \"I'm Winning\" \u2014 animated by a group of 16 incredible queer artists!  \nThis album is made with all ages in mind \u2014 there are no swears, but also it's not like, \"just for kids.\" It's the music we like, and it's a lot happier and funnier than the last record.\n  The Doubleclicks are a crowd-funded operation. With no major record label, we depend completely on our audience to help us make our art. The advantage of that - and this is huge - is that there is nothing between us and you. Our music goes straight from our hearts to your ears. We love it. It means so much to us to be able to make just the thing we want and just the thing you want, too. If you don't like it, we can't make it. So we do our very best.\n         We need your help to pay for recording and our studio rent, to produce CDs, merchandise, and promotional items for the album, to get the necessary software, instruments, and plug-ins, to master and mix the music, to submit the music to iTunes and other music stores, and to generally \"create something from nothing.\" \n         We thank you for supporting art and artists, and for making the world more beautiful! \nChart of project costs\n In exchange for your pledge, we have some rad stuff you can get. \nPINS!\nYou spoke and we listened \u2014 you love enamel pins, and you want one of our little featherless dinosaur friend. PLUS, we'll have a new badge-style pin from a VERY EXCITING ARTIST as well, the design will be released very soon! If you order a pin, you will be able to choose from these options!  \n\nSHIRT!\nThis new Doubleclicks t-shirt design will be available in \"unisex\" (S-4XL) and \"ladies\" cuts (S-4XL) and for the first time, this Doubleclicks shirt will also be available in youth sizes (XS-XL)!   \nShirt Design by Natalie Metzger\n \nREALITY BOX\nWhen you first open this box, you'll see a little pouch to put your phone in. Set it aside and start to enjoy this immersive \"real world\" experience. We bring you to a land... before constantly refreshing twitter and arguing on facebook and getting group texts and work emails 24/7. This is an entire (approximately 10\" x 8\" x 4\") box of activities, gifts and fun stuff that you can appreciate without your phone.\n         The box will include: the Doubleclicks-designed \"reality book\" of activities and puzzles (see below), a way to listen to a Doubleclicks song without any devices, and more! You'll be able to make something, solve some puzzles, play a game, learn a new skill, send a letter, and give a gift. There will be a rock, some string, and some exclusive Doubleclicks merch. We are extremely excited about this reward. \nREWARD NOTE: anyone who backs at the \"reality box\" level (or above) will get both enamel pins, a signed CD, and a shirt or tote. This isn't what it says in the reward level, and though we can't change the text of the reward level, it is TRUE. At the \"two boxes\" level, backers will get *two* shirts and two sets of both pins. \nREALITY BOOK\nLove reality, but hate boxes? This custom Doubleclicks \"field notes\"-style notebook will be chock-full of reality-based activities. Use this word search and find all of the neat, phone-free hobbies you could experiment with! Get some tips about crafting and photography! Read some aphorisms and affirmations! Play a game! Does the whole thing add up to a big puzzle? You bet it does! \n ADD-ONS\n  Don't see the combination of items you're looking for? Don't worry - you'll be able to buy \"add-ons.\" That means, after this Kickstarter ends, you can add extra CDs, t-shirts, books and pins to your order. If your level only includes one pin and you want to get the other one, you can! If your whole family needs t-shirts, you can get them! You don't need to do anything now in order to do that. The only thing that will not be available as an add-on is the D&D game. \n We have been blessed with a whole bunch people who help us every day to live our arty crowdfunded lifestyle. Thank you all so very very much. Some specific shout-outs: Thank you Mom and Dad for your support! Thank you Kim Newmoney for all these rad new band photos! Thank you Justin and Richard for your patience. Thank you Tuesday for your INCREDIBLE help on this page. Thank you to our podcast listeners for supporting our songwriting!

Now that we're funded, we're excited to get back to writing wonderful stories. If you have any late questions about the game or campaign, feel free to ask in a message or comment. And if you want to learn more about the game, visit Plumplim.com.  It's our website for all things related to 1001 Odysseys. \nBlast off to ADVENTURE! You\u2019re the stalwart crew of the deep-space starship Odyssey. The distant stars beckon you to explore, to overcome the unknown, and to befriend the entire galaxy in this whimsical science fiction journey. \nGather your weirdest friends (or journey on your own) and strap in for a whimsical science fiction adventure like no other. 1001 Odysseys is the feel-good, narrative-driven journey full of adorable space aliens we\u2019ve always wanted to play. Unlock the map and choose your own path through Insula, a far-flung galaxy of curious aliens who can't wait to meet you.  Choices made by players decide how the story unfolds.  It is simplest to play with four enthusiastic players who can each take on one of the crew roles; however, it is very easy to share roles and let more people play or combine roles to allow for fewer players.  With hundreds of choices to make, no two gameplay experiences will ever be the same!\nWant to see the game in action?  We've put video playthroughs  and a PDF walkthrough in The Game section below.\n1001 Odysseys is easy to learn, quick to begin, and it's simple enough to save your progress and pick up again later. Our stories are divided into bite-size Chapters, each of which takes 30-60 minutes to play through. With over 30 chapters of content to experience, you'll have all the adventures you can imagine! \nEach piece of the game is managed by one of the crew roles: Operations, Information, Navigation, or Commander. It\u2019s great to have one player per crew role, but it\u2019s also easy to share or combine roles to accommodate more or fewer players.\nWe've published a walkthrough PDF for part of the first Chapter. If you want to see the game in-detail, check it out!\nSimple rules\nDecide as a team (or on your own, if that\u2019s your thing) where to go and what to do next. The Mission Control Board shows letters and numbers for available actions and missions and the Map shows the coordinates for all the locations you can visit. The Operations and Navigation Officers report the combined code to the Commander, who looks it up in the Story Book and assigns a crew member to read the next part of the adventure. Will you discover a new place on your current Map? Uncover an item that might come in handy later? Experience a strange alien encounter?  \nHere's an example:\nThe updates section following the story text contains clear instructions for crew members on what to do next. New locations, missions, and actions will open new options for continuing your adventure!\nThat's all there is to it - make choices, and follow the instructions the Story Book gives you. You can be adventuring through fantastic weird space within minutes of opening the box.\nSaving your progress\nAs your crew plays through the adventure, the Information Officer will be asked to keep track of certain items, contacts, and unlocked chapters in the Passport. This becomes your single \u201csave file\u201d for the game. If you want to play a Chapter again, just insert a new Chapter sheet.  If you want to start a completely new playthrough, add a new Story folder. \nChapters\nPlaying through a Chapter takes about 30-60 minutes, and when that Chapter is over, everything can simply be dropped back in the box. When you're ready to play the next chapter, the Commander begins by reading its first page and play continues with a short list of exactly what should come out of the box.    \nPlaythroughs and Reviews\nOn Feb 4, we joined TWIST Gaming's Twitch stream to play 1001 Odysseys with them. We played through a full chapter of the game, and everyone had a lot of fun! Thanks to all who came and watched live.\nTWIST Gaming Playthrough:\nTWIST also filmed a review segment to talk about their feelings on the game (spoiler: they liked it a lot, but you knew that already if you watched the playthrough above!)\nTWIST Review / First Impression:\nBack in November, we played the game on the Penny Arcade Twitch channel, before bringing the game to PAX Unplugged. It was lots of fun, and you can get a feel for how the game flows from watching our adventures on Brumigum. \n Content Warning: While the game is kid-friendly, some swearing does occur in this video! \nA big, shiny new galaxy requires a big, shiny new space box! You will receive four Story Books, half a dozen gorgeous illustrated Maps, an Almanac filled with creature information and art, Passport supplies for a full adventure, a Discoveries Booklet full of obtainable inventory items, 200+ cards, a Mission Control Board, DISCs, map markers and more!\nNote: Components on display in this image and elsewhere on the page are prototypes, not final production quality. Our goal is to have the best components possible :)\nStory Books\n Note: Components on display in this image and elsewhere on the page are prototypes. The books will be perfect-bound with a thick cardstock cover. \nThe Story Books are your guide to adventure, containing full narrative prose detailing your travels and adventures through Insula. Each Book will include one Story that is roughly six to ten Chapters long and can end in many possible ways. Four of these Books are included with the core game, containing approximately 400 pages of tales in total. \nMaps\nThe intricate watercolor maps provide the background for your interactions, showing you several of the different worlds and locations you'll visit in Insula. The maps have an easy to read grid along their border (more on that below!), and they become more detailed as you adventure through the galaxy. \nLocation Cards\nAnd how does the Map become more detailed, you ask? Great question. As gameplay progresses, your Navigator (or you, if you\u2019re managing the ship on your own) will reveal Location Cards with detailed information on them.  Each can be placed on a specific spot on the Map, sliding into place so that the background art lines up perfectly. Voila: now you have a more complete view of where you can go!\nDecision Information Storage Chips (DISCs)\nIn some locations, you'll want to remember which choice you made, or how the environment changed when you visited. These simple DISCs, which are literally disks, will sit on top of the Location Card to keep track of it for you. \nCrew Location Marker\nYou'll move your crew marker around the map as you interact with the environment, allowing you to easily pinpoint your current position's grid coordinates. Your coordinates are used to look up paragraphs in the Story Book. \nMission Control Board\nThe Mission Control Board is how you determine which actions and missions are available to you at any given moment. It also keeps track of the effects of your choices, guiding you to new parts of the story that show the results of your earlier actions. \nMission Cards\nAs you work through the story, your Information Officer will record Missions in the Passport. On your Mission Control Board, you'll place cards representing them. Each row on the Board corresponds with one Mission in your story.\nAction Cards\nEach one of these cards represents a type of action that you can try to further your missions. Will you talk with a passerby? Study records? Look upon the vista? Action Cards are tucked underneath Missions to give you options on how to proceed.\nMomentum Cards\nAs you progress through the story, you build Momentum toward certain outcomes. The Story Book will direct you to place Momentum Cards in certain slots in a Mission's row, representing the choices you've made. When you complete a row, these cards will combine to produce a code that you look up in Story Book to advance or complete the Mission. \nWere the Plumplim impressed with your interactive topiary installation? What happens if you try to engineer your own spaceship? \nPassport\nEach Story has its own corresponding Passport Folder, where you can keep track of which Chapters you have unlocked, which items you've uncovered, and who you've met. It also holds the Chapter Sheet where you keep a list of your active missions. Keep the Passport safe, and you'll know right where to begin next time. \nDiscoveries Booklet\nSometimes you'll meet fascinating individuals or find interesting items lying around the galaxy. Record the new item or contact in your Passport, pull the corresponding sheet out of the Booklet, and tuck it into your Passport Folder. They might come in handy later.  \nAlmanac\nAn all-encompassing dossier of the species you'll meet and places you'll visit, the Almanac provides an illustrated trove of background information for anyone new to the region. Easy to reference quickly, it might just answer that age-old question: which came first, the Elemens or the egg? \nChoices That Matter\nThis isn't a novel. There's no linear path to follow from the beginning to the end. Instead, each choice you make leads you to new locations, unlocks new actions, or adds new missions that will direct the flow of the Story. Some choices may even remove actions that are no longer relevant. When you finish one Chapter, the next Chapter you\u2019ll play is determined by the choices you made and the secrets you discovered.  \nNo Wrong Choices\n Don\u2019t worry about making the wrong choice. It's not possible to make a choice that will end the game early, though you might find yourself in some exceptionally strange situations if things don't work out the way you expected. Maybe you weren't planning on participating in a planet-wide, inter-species pillow fight, but sometimes it's best to just roll with it and see how things turn out. \nPlaying Again\nStill wondering, \"what if...?\" after your last adventure? Add a new Chapter Sheet to your Passport, and play that Chapter again! Try out different choices and learn even more about the story that's unfolding. On a second playthrough, you\u2019ll find new missions, uncover strange locations, and even unlock whole new Chapters you haven\u2019t yet played. One path through a Story Book will hit only about 30% of its content!  \nRefresh Pack\nMost of the components in 1001 Odysseys are not modified at all during play. Maps, Story Books, cards, and wooden bits aren't changed or consumed. The Passports, Chapter Sheets, and Discoveries Booklet all get written on as you adventure. The Refresh Pack add-on contains a fresh new set of all these components, in case you want to start over from scratch! Passports and Chapter Sheets will also be available as free PDF downloads.\n1001 Odysseys is the biggest and most ambitious game the company has created thus far. We've brought together a whole slew of writers and artists in order to create your space journey, and we can't wait for you to make a bunch of friends in outer space. If you've attended Gen Con in the past few years, you might recognize some of our squad from our Department of Fun demo room!  Here's our creative team for the project: \n1001 Odd Questions Stream\nWe like talking about our game! So much, in fact, that we spent a whole hour talking about 1001 Odysseys and various other fun things (like cats). \nInterview\nBefore the campaign, Chris (Owner of Asmadi Games) and Julia recorded a podcast talking about the game. Here's the interview with Jason of Every Night is Game Night.   \n Ivy has yet to agree to any interviews!\nOn November 13, 2018, an odd transmission was heard throughout the galaxy from a satellite linked to plumplim.com. Here, we asked readers to help us shape the past, in order to unlock the future. The prologue story of 1001 Odysseys has begun to unfold, based on the choices of the readers! Plumplim.com will continue to operate as the Kickstarter campaign rolls on. You'll be faced with life-changing choices, like the ideal location to eat cake, whether to wear disguises and infiltrate sentient cat planets, and which odd space creature to follow for information about the world of 1001 Odysseys. \nJoin the story today!\nDuring the campaign, we'll be running Act II of the prologue, and you're able to vote on what chocie is made next.  We're also posting design diaries every Tuesday. The first one, \"No Wrong Choices,\" is already live! \nAfter the campaign, Plumplim.com will serve as the central location for all 1001 Odysseys information. Fun downloads, extra background stories, and more! \nWith your help, we'll be able to unlock components of the game that will make your journey even bigger and better! \nAt $75K, we unlocked Achievement Medals that will be in every copy of the game! Fun stickers, for your fun adventures.\nAt $100K, we unlocked a free set of crew badge pins to every single backer of of 1001 Odysseys. These will be exclusively available during the Kickstarter campaign and BackerKit pre-order period. \nAt $150K, we unlocked the Fates of the Iliad expansion box. This will be a separate (smaller) game box available as an add-on, containing content from guest authors. \nThe stretch goals at 200K and 300K weren't reached during the campaign, but we'll be counting funds raised in the post-campaign BackerKit toward them! So don't lose hope - we're going to get all the amazing things into the game we can :)\n\n\n\nSample track: Journey Through Insula\nWe have a variety of bonus goodies you can add on to your pledge for 1001 Odysseys. To secure one or more of these wonderful items, add the amount to your pledge for whatever your space-heart desires!  During the BackerKit, you'll be able to assign your dollars to items appropriately.\nThe Explorer + Goodies level includes one each of the Plumplim pin, plush, and refresh pack, at a bundle discount.\nPlease note that the canvas, pin and plush are only available in the USA.\n\nBecause of the weight of this game (literally, books are heavy!) and the fluctuating costs of shipping, we'll be calculating and charging shipping during the post-campaign BackerKit, when it's close to shipping time. The table below lists our estimated shipping cost per region. This shipping cost is flat, regardless of the number of add-ons you purchase.\nOur goal is to come in at or even below these estimates. This is especially true if we have a high enough volume of backers to be able to send a full container of games overseas.  \nEstimated Shipping Costs: \nOther Regions:\nIf you are not in one of the areas listed above, our best option may be to ship directly from the US, instead of using an overseas partner. Shipping is likely to be higher ($35+), depending on the exact location. \nIs the project EU-Friendly?\nThe short answer: we hope so. The long answer: We can't be sure, based on the evolving laws and Brexit situation. Our shipping hub is in the UK, but we will try to add one on the continent if things go messily. \nRefund Policy\nAs with all of our campaigns, if you're unhappy with our progress or product for any reason, we'll give you a full refund. This includes the case where shipping costs rise beyond our targets. Also, because of the complex issues surrounding Brexit, we cannot predict what the taxes / import situation will be when this project fulfills for backers outside the US. \nTo be super clear: If for any reason once production is done it turns out that it'll cost more to ship than you're willing to pay, simply ask and we'll refund your pledge.\nTiming and Logistics\nThe planned schedule for delivery of 1001 Odysseys is March of next year. We've fully written one of the four Story Books, and mapped out ideas for the other three. The bulk of the effort left to be done is writing the rest of the content, painting beautiful maps, and creating the rest of the supporting artwork. Once the campaign completes we'll provide updates on our progress roughly monthly, and you might be able to catch a sneak peek or playtest of the other stories at conventions later in the year! \nStores + Retail Release\nIf you're interested in pre-ordering as a store for retail sale, contact us directly in KS messages, or by email at asmadigames@gmail.com. We don't have a retail pledge level, but will get KS exclusive bits to retailers who pre-order before release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run many Kickstarter campaigns, and have had plenty of experience getting things together and sent out to all our backers. If and when issues arise, we always communicate to our backers so that you know what's going on. \n\nFor this project, we do still have writing and art work that needs completing (the more we fund, the better we'll be able to make the game!), but once the campaign concludes we'll get right to work on finishing up the game so that it can get to your tables - because that's where we want it :)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "FRIEND: One Plush Plumplim", "descp": "Just want an adorably huggable Plumplim plush?

There was one resounding question asked by so many of those Sentinels fans: how do I tell my super-heroic stories in this world?\nNow, for just that purpose, we bring you Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game!\nFor the last few years, we've been developing a new super-powered roleplaying game with the fantastic folks at Critical-Hits Studios. Industry heroes Cam Banks, Dave Chalker, and Philippe-Antoine M\u00e9nard have all contributed their expertise and passion for comic book storytelling to this project, working alongside Sentinel Comics writer and Editor-in-Chief Christopher Badell as well as the dynamic freelance duo, editor Amanda Valentine and writer Clark Valentine. Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game is all about bringing the comic book stories of your heroes to life at the table!\nThis is a game of powerful heroes, terrifying villains, and the conflicts between them in a world of comic book storytelling. The years of Sentinel Comics storytelling that Greater Than Games has produced have all lead up to this point, and now it's time for you to take the reins of your own heroes and bring evil to justice!\nIn Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game (or SCRPG, for short), whenever you take an action, you consult your Powers, Qualities, and your Status. You choose one of your Powers and one of your Qualities as the traits you're using for the action. Then, you consult your Status: are you in the Green Zone? The Yellow Zone? The Red Zone? If you're Out, you can only use your Incapacitated ability. And thus, we get the GYRO system: Green, Yellow, Red, and Out. \nUsing the dice from your hero's Power, Quality, and Status, you make a dice pool, roll it, and use the result dictated by the action you're taking. Learn more with this Gameplay Guide PDF, part of the SCRPG Starter Kit we released in 2017. It's extremely thorough, but the Core Rulebook will have even more!\nVillains, minions, and environments are all affected by the GYRO system as well! The world of Sentinel Comics is one of risks and dangers, and when lives are threatened, heroes must respond!\nMecha-Stalin and Muse (Art by Valerio Buonfantino)\nBesides the SCRPG Starter Kit mentioned above, we've also released two one-shot adventures for the new hero team Daybreak: Stolen Legacy and Urban Infestation! Using the above-linked Gameplay Guide to learn the game, you can play through both of those adventures to get a first-hand feeling for just how Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game works!\nThe best way to get into this game is with Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook. It's a hardbound, full-color, 8.5\" by 11\" book printed on well over 400 pages (we're still determining the final page count as we finish up the writing and art!) of high-quality printing-press grade paper. \nThe core rulebook teaches you everything you need to play Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game, whether playing a hero, or running the game as the GM. It has full, robust rules for hero creation (that we will be showcasing more in an update, coming soon!), as well as a vast set of tools for GMs to create their own minions, lieutenants, challenges, villains, environments, doomsday devices, action scenes, and so much more! \nExample Page Spread Renders\nFor those who want more building blocks than blank slates, there is a massive archive section, containing many heroes, villains, minions, and environments from the pages of Sentinel Comics, all with stats, backstory, and art from many different talented artists, not just Adam Rebottaro! (Don't worry - the book will also have PLENTY of Adam's art!)\nAlso, check out this video to learn how heroes are made in the SCRPG!\nYou'll note that there are many cool things in each level other than just the core rulebook! Let's talk about those things now!\nFor those of you looking for something a little more fancy, we present the Special Edition of the Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook! Bound in high quality leather with embossed foil ink on the cover, the Special Edition rulebook is a classy companion for your tabletop gaming experience. It also features exciting hero and villain art on the inside front and back cover pages, as well as four ribbons sewn into the binding, for keeping tabs on pages you frequently reference. \nMock Up of the Foil and Leather-bound special edition rulebook\nThe Special Edition of the SCRPG Core Rulebook is being produced at the same time as the standard rulebook, so it will ship simultaneously - it won't delay the creation of the game or fulfillment, and it won't be released later than the standard core rulebook.\n Part of what people love about Sentinel Comics is the rich and lengthy backstory of its (entirely made up) comic book history. When Christopher and Adam first sat down to create these heroes and villains and tell their stories, they realized that the world would feel more real and more full if it had the strong history that comic books do in the \"real world\". Thus, they built yet another layer of fiction, creating the fictional comic book company \"Sentinel Comics\" and crafting stories not just of what happened in the pages of their comics, but also what happened in that world to inspire the creators of those comics. \nReal life comic book historians Darren Watts and Professor Christopher McGlothlin approached Christopher Badell in 2016 with the idea of writing a book detailing that history, and they quickly realized they had their work cut out for them. The history that Christopher and Adam had created was evocative and thrilling, but also missing several important elements. Not dissuaded from their task, Watts and McGlothlin wrote up a storm, tenaciously bombarding Christopher and Adam with all manner of questions and conducting many joint brainstorming sessions to uncover the truth of the history of Sentinel Comics.\nNow, the fruits of their labors have been realized! The real life book The History of Sentinel Comics by Darren Watts and Professor Christopher McGlothlin is coming to life with this Kickstarter. Take a look!\n*Mock Up Book Render, Art Not Final\nAnd here's the sort of thing you can look forward to in this book:\nExcerpt From The History of Sentinel Comics\nBut what does that \"a man named xxx\" in the second paragraph mean? Who is named xxx? It could be you! Backers at the \"A Part of Sentinels History\" pledge level will get their name in The History of Sentinel Comics! There are only so many open slots in the book, so we have to limit that pledge level to only 50 people, so first-come, first-served! Be a part of Sentinel Comics!\nPlaying SCRPG involves the players working together with the GM, helping their heroes play to their principles and ultimately save the day... but at what cost?! GMs frequently need to come up with twists on the fly in action scenes, or create minions in response to hero or villain actions. To make your job as GM easier, we've created a kit of useful GM supplies: \n*All Items Are Example Renders. Art subject to change.\nThe SCRPG GM Kit comes with several helpful tools, including:\nA double-sided dry-erase scene tracker with an average scene tracker on one side and a black and white, customize-able scene tracker on the other\nA total of 16 double-sided dry-erase challenge, minion, and lieutenant cards\n6 blank dry-erase cards for you to use as needed for tracking hero turns in the action order, or whatever dastardly deeds your minions may have up their sleeves\nA tear-off pad of 100 full-color double-sided blank hero character sheets\nA tear-off pad of 100 full-color double-sided blank villain/minion/lieutenant sheets\nA 4-panel GM screen (in progress art below) with exciting, full-color art by Adam on one side and a ton of handy info on the other\nEverything a GM could want to jump start their game!\nSCRPG uses a range of dice from four-sided to twelve-sided. We've created a set with three of each of those die types for you. Our dice are customized with engraved numbers in one of our signature Sentinel Comics fonts. Each die type is a different color made to match the example images in the core rulebook as well as the colors of each section tab. All dice are made from colored, semi-translucent material with darker flecks throughout as a visual nod to the look of comic book half tone patterns. White numbers complete the aesthetic and are easily visible so the action doesn't stop because you can't read your dice! \nWhile you can use any dice with the appropriate number of sides and numbering for this system, we've received many requests for a set of custom SCRPG dice, and this is it! A vast cornucopia of dice appropriate for super-heroic encounters!\nIf you want to add any of these products to your pledge, you can do so by increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount. \nWe will be using a pledge manager post-campaign where you can update your address and manage your rewards, adding on more things at that time if you so desire.\nWe funded in the first hour, and we're incredibly grateful to all of you! We have several additional books we'd like to make, as well as a few free upgrades and more!\nAnd that's all of the stretch goals!\nUnlocked Stretch Goals\nWe funded! As a result, we'll be sending every backer a PDF of the Sentinel Comics timeline!\nFor hitting $75k, we added the heroes Heritage and Time-Slinger to the archives of the core rulebook!\nFor hitting $100k, we unlocked The GUISE Book!, a zany book of SCRPG content by Clark Valentine, Dave Chalker, and Christopher Badell about Guise, his friends, his foes, and his adventures. Now on the list of add-ons for this campaign!\nFor reaching $125k, we added the villains Fright Train and Ermine to the archives of the core rulebook!\nBecause we passed $150k, we're going to make a Sentinel Comics coloring book and send it to all of you!

All backers for at least one physical product will also get a physical copy of the adventure for free (as well as a PDF)! Those backing for just PDFs will get a free PDF of the adventure.\nFor reaching the stupendous height of $300k, we've unlocked the Dark Watch sourcebook!

Learn more about it in our third update.\nClick the quotes below to read or listen to the full reviews!\nIn addition to the core teams behind Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game and The History of Sentinel Comics, Greater Than Games has been extremely blessed to work with an amazing extended team of writers and artists. That list is continuously growing as we work on these projects, but we wanted to take a moment to highlight the talented individuals that we've been lucky enough to work with thus far.\nSentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game\nAdditional Writers: Patrick Clapp, Tim Rodriguez, Eric Simon, Tracy Barnett, Tommy Maranges, Cory O'Brien, Jerry Holkins\nCopy Editors: Chris Burton, Alex Schmidt\nArtists: Valerio Buonfantino, Jacqui Davis, Giulio Fanfoni, Grace Gonzaga, Kendall Hale, Will Jones, Angela Lichtenberg (Kassarie), Jorge Ramos, Jo\u00ebl S\u00e9guin, Kevin Shah (Colorreaper), Gene Shaw, Paolo Siega, Joseph Wei Wang, Damon Westenhofer, Ben Wilsonham\nThe History of Sentinel Comics\nArtists: Storn A. Cook, KC Lancaster, Bradley K. McDevitt, Sarah Zeiter\nShipping for this campaign is very complicated for several reasons. Here are the main points!\n1) We will be charging shipping on a per item basis. These charges are integrated into the various pledge levels, but will be per additional item that you add on. That means that, while you can combine shipping with someone else, there is generally no benefit to doing so.\n2) There are two reasons we are charging a per-item shipping fee. The first is that, on any campaign, shipping and labor charges tend to scale with the number of items a person is receiving. However, the major change with this campaign is that we are shipping each item as it arrives from the factory. This means that you will likely get one shipment per type of item you back in this campaign. The only exception is the GM Kit and Dice Set, which will ship together.\n3) The reason we opted for multiple shipping waves with this campaign is that the majority of the products are books. Books are notoriously very time consuming to write and develop, so we didn't want to hold up most of your rewards if one book overshot the release target. Conversely, books are notably easy to ship, both because they are dense, and because we can use Media Mail in the US (which is very cheap), and because the import duties and taxes in most countries are fairly low for books.\nWithout further ado, here are the *per item* shipping charges for each country / region:\nNote One: The GM Kit and the Dice Set will be shipped together. This means that if you add on or back at a pledge level that includes one or both of those items, you will only pay the appropriate shipping charge once.\nNote Two: Shipping charges will be processed through Kickstarter. However, VAT charges will be charged separately through the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nNote Three: The delivery dates on each pledge level are the estimated dates by which we believe we will ship you everything at that pledge level. You will very likely receive some items earlier. Additionally, if we unlock any add-on stretch goals and you choose to add them to your pledge, they will likely ship later than that date.\nOK! So, what does this mean in terms of shipping charges for each pledge level? Here's what they'll look like:\nNow, on to a more detailed explanation of the shipping charges for each of these regions:\nFor US backers, we are offering free shipping. This is not because we have invented a teleporter and shipping is suddenly free. We will still pay a substantial amount to ship each parcel to US backers, both in actual shipping charges and in labor & materials. However, we know that everyone likes the idea of free shipping (including us!) and has come to expect it in Kickstarter campaigns, so we are subsidizing shipping enough to make US shipping free. All US orders will ship from our US warehouse via USPS.\nFor Canadians, we are offering $9/$4 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Canada. Of course, $9 or $4 is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Canada. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Canadian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $9-$20, depending on the item and where in Canada you live. This means that US backers are subsidizing Canadian backers slightly, in the amount of anywhere from $0-$11 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Canada, and $9 and $4 is a nice, low flat rate that we can live with from a business perspective. All Canadian orders will ship from our US warehouse, but be delivered via FedEx Canada - we will cover all customs and import duties.\nFor Australians, we are offering $14/19 shipping per item. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter Australia. $14 or even $19 is not the actual cost of shipping to Australia. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of Australian shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $20-$40, depending on the item and where in Australia you live. This means that US backers are subsidizing Australian backer in the amount of $6-$11 per parcel. However, we really want to make our games as accessible as possible in Australia because we know how hard it can be to get US products in AUS. We have also managed to lower this cost substantially by partnering with an Australian distributor and fulfillment house. All Australian orders will be shipped by VR Distribution.\nFor backers from China (including Hong Kong and Macau), we are offering $29/$24 shipping. This also covers import taxes and customs duties, which we will pay at the point when the products enter China. Note that the majority of products in this campaign actually have to be shipped to China from the US, since they are books that will be made in the US. That means that they will be subject to import tariffs in China, which we will pay. We are partnering with VFI Asia for this campaign, and if it goes well, we hope that we'll be able to get shipping costs even lower on future Kickstarter campaigns when all of the items are made in China. All Chinese orders will be shipped by VFI Asia.\nFor Russians and South Americans, shipping will cost $39/$49 per item. This does NOT include any customs duties or import taxes. Unfortunately, this is incredibly high, and reflects that fact that it is incredibly expensive and incredibly difficult to successfully ship any items to any of these countries. In addition, we are only willing to make a single delivery attempt to you in any of these countries. If any shipments are lost or returned to us, we will unfortunately not be able to re-ship them. We will refund you your pledge minus a 20% fee to cover Kickstarter and other fees. We really do not want to do this, as it will cost us an incredibly large amount of money (the actual shipping charges, and then the return charges if the item is returned, or the replacement charges if they are lost). However, it costs us even more money every campaign to ship multiple times to countries with very complex customs and import regimes. All Russian and South American orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor Europeans (including EU countries as well as Norway and Switzerland, but unfortunately not Russia or other non-EU countries), we are offering $14/$9 shipping + VAT. What does this mean? Well, it turns out that the EU has been really tightening the rules on VAT and import duties recently as a result of widespread VAT fraud on the part of foreign companies. You can read some of the details here, but the summary is that, according to EU law, any items imported into the EU are subject to VAT charges (generally 20%-25% in the case of board games and most other items) based on the actual sale price PLUS the actual shipping cost. That means that, for example, for a $59 game with $15 shipping, the 24% VAT will be assessed against the total $74 price, and will come out to approximately $17.76.\nNote that this law applies no matter how we fulfill the games. If we ship from the US, each parcel is subject to the VAT charge once it enters the EU. On the other hand, if we ship a bunch of games to a fulfillment center in the EU, the whole shipment is subject to VAT when it enters the EU, and, even though the games are arriving in bulk, the VAT is based on the actual sales price to consumers (in this case, on Kickstarter), not the lower wholesale or manufacturing cost, so this method doesn\u2019t actually save any money on VAT charges (though there can be other benefits). In this case, all European orders will be shipped by Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK.\nFor this campaign, there is yet another complexity! It turns out that most of the governments in Europe (but, annoyingly, not all) have decided that books should be taxed at a substantially lower VAT rate! That means that all of the book items for this campaign (basically, everything except the GM Kit and the Dice Set) will be charged the lower VAT rate.\nBoth VAT rates vary wildly. If you want to look into it in more detail, this website has a good amount of information. For the rest of you, here is a handy chart!\nVAT Percentages Around The World\nEuropean Shipping Questions\nQ: So, why are you charging VAT separately from shipping charges for Europeans?\nA: As we mentioned above, the VAT charges are based on the sale price + shipping. If we include VAT as part of the \u201cshipping\u201d charge, EU customs is likely to consider that whole charge to be \u201cshipping\u201d and charge VAT based on the full amount, including what we already charged for VAT!\nQ: OK, so, how much am I going to pay to get this game in Europe?\nA: There is a fixed $14 or $9 fee per item for shipping, which you will pay via Kickstarter. Then, before the campaign is fulfilled, we will calculate each European backer\u2019s VAT and charge you for VAT via the pledge manager before shipping out your parcel.\nQ: Will I have to pay any customs clearance fees or anything when I receive my shipment?\nA: No, you will not! We will have Spiral Galaxy Games in the UK fulfill this Kickstarter for European backers, which means that, after we charge you for VAT through our pledge manager, we\u2019ll handle the payment processing for VAT and import duties on the games. Then, Spiral Galaxy will ship all of your parcels out from within the EU and avoid any weird delays or further charges.\nQ: Where are you getting all of this information? It seems stupid and wrong and I don\u2019t like it.\nA: We talked to a lot of shipping companies, attorneys, and other professionals about the implications of EU law and how, exactly, VAT works. For a decent summary, the government of Finland has a pretty helpful website (and the information is, for the most part, broadly applicable across the EU).\nQ: Wait, but [insert other Kickstarter here] shipped stuff to Europe for way cheaper than this. Why can\u2019t you just do what they did?\nA: They either lost a ton of money on shipping, or they committed customs fraud, and we don\u2019t want to do either of those things. \nQ: You say above that you are subsidizing shipping to Canadians and Australians. Why don\u2019t you subsidize shipping to Europeans?\nA: We do! The $14/$9 per item we are charging for shipping is not the actual cost of shipping and import duties to Europe. It is not even the difference between the actual cost of European shipping and the actual cost of US shipping, which is more like $14-$29 (there is a lot of variance, because it depends on the size of the shipment we are importing to Europe, and to which country in Europe the shipment is heading). This means that US backers are subsidizing European backers slightly, in the amount of $5-$15 per parcel.\nQ: Why do Norway and Switzerland have to follow these rules? They aren\u2019t in the EU!\nA: That is true! However, the customs regimes in Norway and Switzerland are very similar to those of the EU, by design.\nQ: What about Brexit?\nA: Brexit could complicate a lot of things, but what, exactly, it might complicate about this depends on the final form it takes. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if/when we come to it, and let you know about anything we wind up doing to work through it. Unfortunately, no one knows what will happen with Brexit, including Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. If you have any secret information, please let us know. :)\nQ: I hate VAT; is there anything I can do about it?\nA: Us, too! Honestly, the only thing you can do is vote and call your local politicians. We\u2019ll do the same over here to see if we can avoid a long, stupid trade war.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays, and more than one or two grimloids gumming up the works along the way. Many tabletop gaming projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units, and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nFor the last Sentinel Comics Kickstarter, Sentinels of the Multiverse: OblivAeon, we had a lot of delays. We over-promised on stretch goals, committed to an incredibly elaborate storage solution, and wildly underestimated how much time it would take to finish the game design and production. It was also our first project with over 10,000 backers, and we did not have our shipping or customer service teams set up to handle that volume. Fortunately, we now have a much better idea of what it takes to handle a project of that scale as well as what we can promise and what we can't. Additionally, we've been working on this game for a number of years, and it is much farther along than OblivAeon was when we launched it. We are very hopeful that we can stick to our stated delivery time with this campaign.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Sentinel File", "descp": "No physical rewards, just the PDF of the Sentinel Comics: the Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, sent out to you as soon as it's ready!\n(Note: all other pledge levels will also receive a PDF of Sentinel Comics: The Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook at the same time.

Our original Kickstarter was a huge success and, thanks to your support, we were able to make a massive range of affordable, unbreakable and plastic fantasy scenery that allowed gamers to create the dungeon of their dreams, bring their RPGs to life or produce a battlefield worth fighting over. \nAn example of how the sets can be combined (gaming mat not included).\nBut when it comes to terrain, we all know that more is always better! Although the first campaign included hundreds of pieces of 28mm fantasy scenery, we knew there were there other new and exciting genres that needed that special loving feeling that only a TerrainCrate Kickstarter can provide.\n When choose your Crate, you can choose from any of the four Crates below. The Crates are Bleakwood Hall, Campbell Heights, Bellevue Square and Morneville Ruins.\nIn a dark, dark house something stirs. In the bedroom, there\u2019s a strange knocking from the cupboard, while down in the parlour, the piano keeps playing an eerie tune. The servant\u2019s quarters are covered in cobwebs and dust, although fresh footprints are scattered across the cold floor. Outside, the family mausoleum and gardens are hidden in fog, but something can be seen skulking in the shadows. You\u2019ll need to complete your investigation of Bleakwood Hall quickly and get out, before you become the latest victim of this ghostly place.\nThe Bleakwood Hall Crate contains: Gothic Manor, Servant's Quarters, Grim Garden and Bleakwood Mausoleum sets.\nCampbell Heights used to be a bustling town. Shoppers would flock to the Two Trees Mall, while the Crystal Peaks Campsite was a popular destination for families wanting to experience the great outdoors. But that was before the outbreak. Now, the factory\u2019s machinery remains still, and the warehouse workers have fled. Well, most have fled. Those that are left have become shuffling corpses that groan and shuffle their way towards their latest victim.\nThe Campbell Heights Crate contains: Two Trees Mall, Survivor's Stronghold, Crystal Peaks Camp and Abandoned Office sets.\nThe sound of laughter and conversation floats through the Bellevue Square. Children play in the park, chasing the ducks and squirrels. Lovers sit outside the caf\u00e9, admiring the statue of Lord Bleakwood before visiting the store for supplies, carefully wrapped in brown paper. Once finished they return home to their cosy cottage. No one talks about the Bellvue Hospital. Or the screams they hear from the grounds at night. Bellvue is a nice place. A quiet place. A pleasant place.\nThe Bellevue Square Crate contains: Market Day, Bellevue Hospital, Cosy Cottage and Peaceful Park sets.\n The sound of gunfire and shouting floats through the ruined remains of Morneville. Soldiers duck behind makeshift barricades or the crumbling remnants of Lord Bleakwood's statue. The contents of the store and homes have been pulled out into the street, or thrown from broken windows. At the checkpoint, hard-faced soldiers inspect documents, while an Alsatian carefully watches those that pass. The Morneville church is one of the few places relatively unscathed by combat, although the nave has fallen silent since the fighting started.\nThe Morneville Ruins Crate contains: Papers Please, Wrecks & Ruins, Crumbling Cottages and Morneville Church sets.\n With TerrainCrate 2: Crate Expectations, we want to fund even more incredible 28mm plastic scenery - but we\u2019re moving out of the dungeon and striding across the battlefield to bring you pieces that are suitable for a wider selection of games. From Lovecraftian mansions to campsites ravaged by the undead or quiet villages ready to be explored, TerrainCrate is the perfect companion to bring any gaming experience to life. \nBut making hundreds of pieces of scenery is a huge task \u2013 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking for your support! In return you\u2019ll get boxes crammed full of incredibly detailed TerrainCrate goodness at an amazing price. With this Kickstarter, you'll get terrain that's: \nBIGGER! - more large pieces to fill your gaming tables than the original campaign\nPlastic! \u2013 made from PVC plastic, TerrainCrate pieces are tough enough for the rigours of an intense gaming session. TerrainCrate 2 will use a higher grade of plastic compared to the original\nPre-built! - all the scenery pieces are ready straight from the box so you can bring your tabletop to life in seconds\nMulti-use! - we've created TerrainCrate to be compatible with a range of games, RPGs and existing terrain ranges.\nWith your support we can turn everyone into a dedicated terrainspotter.\n Here you can find the great value optional extras you can add to your pledge to get even more fantastic scenery at a great price!If you want to add an optional extra to your pledge, increase the total amount of your pledge by the cost of the item, e.g. if you want an extra Two Trees Mall set, then increase your total pledge amount by \u00a318.\nWhat's more, if you only want to buy a set (rather than a full Crate) just choose 'pledge with no reward' and add the required amount. You'll be able to choose the set(s) you want in the pledge manager after the campaign has finished.\nOnce the campaign has finished, we'll collect the total funds and within a few weeks you'll receive something called the Pledge Manager. The Pledge Manager will be credited with any extra money you've pledged during the campaign and you can then choose which optional extras you want to add. \nDon't take our word for how awesome TerrainCrate is! Below you can watch a selection of reviews for the original TerrainCrate. \nFinally Rob talks about TerrainCrate 2 with Andy Burdis from BlackJackLegacy. \nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes. \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\n UK: \u00a36-10 (depending upon amount of Crates)\n USA (shipping hub): \u00a310-15 (depending upon amount of Crates)\n Europe (shipping hub, if required post Brexit): \u00a310-\u00a330 (depending upon amount of Crates)\n Canada (shipping hub): \u00a310-18 (depending upon amount of Crates)\n Australia/New Zealand (shipping hub): \u00a315-30 (depending upon amount of Crates)\n Rest of World: \u00a315-40 (depending upon amount of Crates)\nAll optional extras will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.\nInformation about the TerrainCrate 2 retailer pledge can be found here. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components.\n\nWith this project, the terrain pieces are designed and the next stage is getting them tooled and produced. We predict that we will begin shipping in January 2020 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 15 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War, DreadBall Second Edition, Warpath, Star Saga: The Eiras Contract, TerrainCrate and Kings of War: Vanguard.\n\nWe currently only have one outstanding Kickstarter to deliver - Hellboy: The Board Game. Funded in June 2018, this is due to start shipping in late March/early April.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. Following that time, refunds may be given minus Kickstarter and payment fees. In order to request a refund you must contact support@manticgames.com\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this campaign you acknowledge that the components, artwork and design elements for TerrainCrate 2 may change before being produced - although we will inform backers of any major design changes.\n\nIf you do not complete the pledge manager within the time specified when the pledge manager is sent, you agree that your contribution to the campaign was a donation and your pledge is fulfilled. Of course, we will use our discretion on a case by case basis. Completing the pledge manager is the ONLY way for us to confirm your shipping address and pledge details, as well as making sure we hit the production timelines.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that will pay for any shipping and any import or other duties required in your country. You also accept that you are liable for providing us with the correct shipping details upon request and we are not responsible for items lost in transit if sending to an incorrectly provided address. We also cannot ship to PO boxes and you must provide an alternative shipping in this circumstance.\n\nAlthough we are aiming to deliver TerrainCrate 2 to Kickstarter backers before the game is available at retail, production and shipping delays can lead to delivery at the same time or following the retail release.\n\nIf you do not agree to these terms, then please purchase TerrainCrate 2 items once they're available at your friendly local gaming store in 2020.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a365 or more", "title": "CRATE(S) OF YOUR CHOICE", "descp": "Choose any of the available Crates.

Does that Chihuahua have 24 hours to save the world? \nAction Pups is a party game where you compete to tell the secret life story of a dog. It's for three to six players from ages 9-99, and play time is 15-30 min. It's a perfect game to gather around and unplug for some creative, lighthearted, and fuzzy fun.   \n Action Pups comes with 170 unique cards, each with a different photo of a dog on one side and two story prompts on the the other. The game is designed by Jenn Ellis and Keith Baker (Gloom, Illimat, Eberron, Action Cats!),  and includes illustrations by Natalie Metzger and dog pictures from you: our backers. \nHow to Play: The players take turns serving as judge. The judge draws a card and gives the dog a name. Each player combines two cards from their hand to form the beginning and end of a story. Each player pitches their story to the judge, embellishing to win the judge's favor and be awarded the dog card. At the end of nine rounds the player with the most dog cards wins.  The game contains 170 unique double sided cards\u2014enough for over 25,000 story combinations. \nWant to try it out yourself?

The image needs to fit on the back of a card. \nPhotos that contain a single dog and no humans. \n Photos of dogs that lend themselves to story telling. We're looking for pictures that inspire stories. All dogs are good dogs... but a dog that's in an interesting location, doing something remarkable, wearing a funny costume, or that otherwise provides a hook for building a story is more likely to make it into the game.   \nWe're Keith and Jenn, the designers and owners of Twogether Studios.

Breaking from standard traditional d20 RPG mechanics, this game utilizes only 1c6.\nThe game will be released in two graphic styles. The first is more trad, with clean and precise computer generated lines. The other is a more \"zine\" style, which is to say photocopies of my hand-drawn version of the trad style mentioned above. Don't worry, you don't have to choose; you will get both versions. You're welcome?\nCATS&CATS is part of Kickstarter's Zine Quest Project, a celebration of RPG zine creations! Go check it out, there are some PAWSOME things out there!!! \n\n---\nUhm...Okay? But why is this a Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter will fund the production of the custom six-sided cats\u2014I mean custom six-sided dice\u2014which are required to play the game. Unfortunately, producing a limited number of dice with each die face being customized is spendy. Boo. These exclusive 1c6 are only compatible with CATS & CATS, but they at least look really cool! \nHere is a pre-production proof from the manufacturer!\n---\nPledge Levels and Backer Rewards\n$1: ...I have no idea what is going on???\nThat's alright, I don't know what is going on either! But I'm plowing forward anyways. If you accidentally click on this level, you will receive the PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6.\n$3: I know what's going on...and I like it!\nHuh! Wow! Okay? I'm impressed and confused. I guess if you decide to back at this level for some inconceivable reason you will get a digital PDF of CATS & CATS, including a print-and-fold version of the 1c6. Yes, this is indeed the same reward as the \"...I have no idea what is going on???\"  level. It's your own fault. I don't even feel bad.\n$8:  ALL I WANT FUREVER ARE 1c6!??!!!??!!??? \nCat cat cat catcatcat cat 1c6 cat cat? Cat cat cat! This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page) and a beautiful CATS&CATS 1c6 only! You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M ALL IN!!! GIMME!!!!! CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT CAT!!!!!!!!!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nWhat, really?!? Well, I'm not going to stop you. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS & CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$10: I'M LATE BUT ALL IN! GIMME CATS!!! I CAN WAIT!!! -- ALL GONE! ---\nYou were taking a cat nap and missed everything, right? Okay, I am going  to open a second-wave duplication of \"$10: I'M ALL IN! GIMME!!! CAT CAT  CAT CAT!!!!\". HOWEVER, this level WILL SHIP LATE. Hand-making lil bags  and shipping myself takes a lot of work--expect a 4-6 week delay. This level gets you a paper copy of the game (1-page), a beautiful CATS &  CATS 1c6, and a handmade thematic little drawstring bag to hold it all  in. You will also get the PDFs. This will ship worldwide, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n$75: I CAN HAS ARTZ N MOAR GAMES?!\nYer so woah and I can't cope with it. Ok. So. I guess if you really want I can send you the original concept pencil sketches for the catmpersand logo and some of the interior art, all of which has been slept on by my cat (Antoine Rasputin Little-Bunny-Foo-Foo-Hopping-Through-The-Forest-Scooping-Up-The-Fieldmice-And-Bopping-Them-On-The-Head Napoleon Bathory the Third)? I'm not a flash artist, so be prepared! I'll also send you two DELUXE full copies of the game--including a total of FOUR 1c6 and two dice bags. Shine on you crazy cat-obsessed diamond. This will ship to US or Canada only, but shipping charges are extra (see Shipping and Fulfillment below).\n ---\nCat Cat Cat Add-on 1c6???\nYes, you can add one extra 1c6 to your reward, but ONLY if you pledge at an $8 or $10 level. This will not change your shipping costs. If you pledge at $1 or $3, you will need to change your pledge level to the $8 tier.\nThe 1c6 add-on is $6.\n Kickstarter charges your pledge right when the campaign ends (in 48  hrs!). This means that if you want to add an extra 1c6 by increasing  your pledge by $6, you MUST do it  before the project ends! You cannot increase your pledge after the  campaign ends (unlike some projects that use third-party KS managers  like backerkit). \nTo take advantage of this and amp up your CATS&CATS experience, follow these simple steps: \n1. Click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the CATS&CATS page. \n2. Increase your pledge by $6 to claim your 1c6. Maximum add-on is ONE 1c6.\n3. Save your pledge. \n4. At the end of the campaign, I will send out a Backer Survey via Kickstarter. There will be a place to indicate that you added $6 to your pledge amount for the add-on 1c6. \nWhen you make your initial pledge, Kickstarter should automatically add on your shipping cost. Please check this handy chart below to ensure your total pledge amount is correct!\n\n---\n Streeeeeeetch goals!\nHow did this even happen?\nOkay, at $500 I will put together merch like stickers and t-shirts that you can buy on zazzle. You all are even weirder than me.\n...alright. Starting at $1000 and for every $100 thereafter, I will post a cat photo and/or video to backers.\n---\nWho are you? Do you know that you are really weird?\nGreat questions! Thanks for asking! My name is Dana and I am, indeed, very weird. I also really like cats. You can find me on Twitter @DAYtheELF.\nSurprisingly, I actually sometimes work on real and functional role-playing games, such as the recent ttrpg sensation Dinosaur Princesses; CYBERKITTENS, a cyberpunk transfelinism playbook, for The Sprawl: November Metric; and Upcycle, more cyberpunk cats, for The Veil: Cascade. My next upcoming gaming convention appearances will be at BreakoutCon in Toronto and PAXEast in Boston. Stop by and I will show you pics of my cats!\n---\nShipping and Fulfillment\nPDFs of the game will be fulfilled using itch.io (http://itch.io). This is a change from the original plan to use DriveThruRPG, largely because itch.io is easier to use for digital-only game distribution (DTRPG is excellent for Print-On-Demand, however). Itch.io is rad and it's an easy process, though you will need to create a free account, if you don't have one yet. When the game is ready, I will send out download keys to all backers who chose the $1 level or higher!\nThe physical copy of the game will be mailed via standard mail worldwide. Depending on where your mailing address is, you will be charged one of three shipping & handling costs in addition to your $10 pledge: United States (+$4), Canada (+$10), or Other International (+$15).\nProduction Schedule\nCATS & CATS is mostly written and the art is nearly finalized, but we have to wait on the dice to be crafted and the bags to be sewn. Unless something awful happens to me or the manufacturer, CATS & CATS should be shipped (and the PDFs released) by May 2019.\n I will not be selling anything not already available to backers before my upcoming. I  will only be selling printed versions of the PDFs, which will already have been distributed by early March. \nSo for transparency sake, here is the updated distribution/fulfillment plan:\n Early March: PDF of CATS&CATS will be released to all backers via itch.io.\n Mid-March: First-wave $10 level backer rewards (of folx who do not add-on an extra 1c6) will be shipped.\n Mid-March: I will be at BreakoutCon. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD/$4CAD.\n Late-March:  I will be at PAX East. I will be selling a limited number of paper copies of CATS&CATS with the print-and-fold die, BUT NOT THE FANCY ACRYLIC DIE, for $3USD.\n Late-May: Manufacturer willing, I will be fulfilling all remaining physical backer rewards (standard and add-ons).  \n---\nCat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat cat!\n ---", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk is that this won't fund.

All is done in Poland. Our Polish based Factory is the worlds largest resin-miniature manufacturing facility, and one of the leaders of HIPS-based miniatures (plastic injection) in EU.\n  During the past 5 years we have manufactured, and frequently, created  miniatures from scratch for numerous companies ranging from smaller,  passionate Kickstarter projects, to larger industry giants.\n  In 2016 we decided to create our very own board game, and thus  launched LOAD (League Of Ancient Defenders) on Kickstarter. A year  later we created Vanguard of War and moved forward with a re-print of  LOAD, named Re-LOAD. Shortly after we created a line of war-game  miniatures known as Empire of Men. We then returned to our board  gaming roots with the smash hit Chronicle X and decided to give  Vanguard of War the reprint treatment, this time with zombies,  creating the \"Heroes Versus Zombies\" expansion.

This product is not related to the AL release in any way, shape or form.\nVenril's yearly gala - a gathering of the city's most elite - should go without a hitch if the hired help keeps things running smoothly.\nUnfortunately for him, you're the hired help...\nUninvited Guests is a short, one-shot social adventure for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (published through the 5E OGL) and for Pathfinder (published through the Pathfinder OGL). It is technically for any level (although it might be hard to explain why a high level party would be in such a situation) and is designed to be run in a single session.\nThis adventure is qualified as a \"social\" adventure in that it involves more social interactions with NPCs, resolved through skill checks and saving throws, rather than actual combat. There is at least one, possibly two, potential encounters... but they're designed to be resolved quickly even by 1st level party standards. \nThe adventure is not meant to be lethal, and unless players screw up really badly you shouldn't be expecting any party members to die. There is a strong possibility they might get arrested, but death shouldn't be a consideration unless the players will it to happen. The encounters are in controlled environment with plenty of healing available; after all, it would be really bad form to have guests and staff dying every time you throw a party, right?\nAnd, by design, this adventure does something a bit different to make things interesting: it requires to briefly split the party. But, since it's not combat heavy, everything should be fine... right? It's a party... what could go wrong?\nThe Premise\nThe party is tasked with retrieving an item in the possession of Venril, a prominent local noble that lives on a lavish estate at the edge of town. The item has to be retrieved today, which is a problem because tonight is the night of Venril's yearly gala where he invites all the nobles of the city to one big party at his lavish estate.\nSo the players have to go in undercover as event organizers provided by the equivalent of a local staffing agency. They are purposely put in to awkward situations where they must adapt to what's asked of them without arousing suspicion, all the time trying to determine where the item they seek is located, how to get it without causing a scene, and leaving without getting arrested. And doing all that preferably without having to kill anyone.\nSounds simple, right?\nContents\nIt's not written yet, but by all accounts it shouldn't be very long; I'm predicting at most 10 pages.\nThere will be at least two monsters with full stat blocks. Beyond that, all the other NPCs in the party will be provided with simplified stat blocks meant to be used only to resolve social situations and opposed skill checks. \nAnd there's no real BBEG (\"Big Bad Evil Guy\"), although there's one possible adversary that... well... if it comes to that, having a stat block or not won't really matter.\nThe adventure is designed to be setting agnostic, and can be dropped in to any rural setting where nobles would have lavish mansions at the edge of town.\nThe Adventure's History\nThe adventure is designed to be tailored for the party; certain characters will be given tasks that they may or may not be familiar with. The point is that the characters have to react to the adversity imposed on them without arousing suspicion, and even though they may be separated from time to time they must try to work together to reach a common goal.\nI ran this adventure for my office D&D 5th Edition group and it went spectacularly. Quite frankly, it was fun as hell. I've given some thought as to how to make this a publishable product, the difficult part being how open-ended it can be, but I think I can make it work.\nProduction\nThe 5E version of the adventure is currently about 20% complete, but most of it is formulated in my head and just needs to be put to paper. Since it's not the typical adventure, documenting this has been somewhat of a challenge, but it's moving along more or less. The expectation is that the \"beta\" of the product should be close to done by the time this Kickstarter ends, but don't quote me on that; the real expectation is the the adventure will be completed, edited and ready for release by early to mid January.\nThe adventure will be written and published regardless of how this Kickstarter ends up doing, but I wanted to use this Kickstarter to help fund at least the editing of the end product. I've gotten to the point where I'm self-conscious about publishing anything that isn't properly edited, and I don't trust my own writing that much (no writer ever should), so i at least want to do that before the product sees the light of day.\nAs it stands right now, beyond an architectural map of the estate (which I can do myself), there is no art planned for the adventure at the goal amount provided. Stretch goals will allow for more art to be included, but if it funds at the very minimum you'll get the adventure in a runnable state.\nBecause it's mostly a social adventure and has little dependency on mechanics, I have decided to publish it for both D&D 5th Edition and Pathfinder; the only thing that will change between the two are a few stat blocks and which skill check is referenced. It could also theoretically be used in any other system with little modification.\nIf this product is successful, I expect to do more of these types of Kickstarters in the near future.\nFulfillment\nThe product will be published using the Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition and Pathfinder OGLs and distributed through DriveThruRPG.\nBecause the product is rather small and, short of a successful stretch goal, doesn't have cover art... we're not entirely sure if a print version will be available or not. If there is, it will be provided through DriveThruRPG's \"print on demand\" service, and a link to acquire the product at the cost of printing and shipping will be provided to all backers at the $12 VIP level or higher.\nStretch Goals\nWe haven't officially decided on stretch goals yet, but one of the things I'd like to do is art.

Contained in each of the themed decks are 52 dungeon cards that can be configured in countless ways.\nEach deck has downloadable pdfs of full adventure modules for both 5e and Fate with new, never before seen monsters, magic items, and NPCs to help add more flavor to your game. \nBest of all, each of the pdfs is converted for these major RPG systems: Fate and D&D 5th Edition.\nThe modules can be played in their entirety or as a choose-your-own-adventure style dungeon crawl.\nWe have already successfully created and produced the first two decks Enter the Fiery Pits and Break Through the Icy Divide. We know what it takes to make them awesome and we are doing the same to the three new decks.\n Playing Break Through the Icy Divide\nWant more than one item? Pledge for the highest level you want, then add on the cost of the additional items to your pledge. Once this is all wrapped up you will receive a survey to let us know which items you want mailed to your door.\nThe physical decks are waiting on final art files and will be finished before the campaign ends. Once funded we will send over the final files to the printer to get a physical proof made. Once approved the full production will begin! The modules are currently being worked on and pdfs will be released as soon as they are ready. These may take up to the delivery of the decks. Creating these modules takes some serious work, luckily the first two in the series are done and the following three are coming along well. \nCardography is the brainchild of a great relationship that forged between Norse Foundry and Creature Curation. When we met over dinner at DragonCon many years ago, we quickly realized that with our combined talents we could create amazing experiences for our friends and for roleplayers everywhere. Cardography is not our first collaboration, and it will definitely not be our last! Our partnership utilizes the best aspects of each company\u2019s resources to produce a superior product. We\u2019ve brought together Creature Curations\u2019 ability to design and create unique content, creatures, and quests with Norse Foundry\u2019s many years of industry and manufacturing experience, and a combined art team to develop a unique product and design.\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged separately through the pledge manager option after the campaign is over. All products will ship at the same time.

We promise to be upfront about any issues that we face. We have produced two sets of Cardography on a deadline for distribution, and we were able to hit these deadlines on time. We used these timelines to help establish our Kickstarter timelines, adding a bit of padding for delays, large quantity of shipping, etc. All of these modules are being written and developed by Norse Foundry and Creature Curation. Unlike past Kickstarters Norse Foundry is more than just the publisher. We have completed and playtested the module, rules, items, etc. before launching to prevent any potential art delays or module issues. Since these modules are \u201cliving\u201d documents (not bound books) we can release the originals and make unforeseen changes if needed, which will allow instant updates. All of the resources from Norse Foundry and Creature Curation will be focused on this Kickstarter before we start any other campaigns.

Read his review of the Dice Tower, Tray and Vault here!\nGeekDad also got an early look at some of the new designs - see what they had to say here!\nGeek & Sundry dives into the campaign and even touches upon some Wyrmwood history! Read here.\nDice rolls are often a critical moment in gaming - sometimes, the encounter, round or even an entire game can depend on one.  Dice tumbling off of the table, or worse, scattering game components across the board, has happened to all of us.  But those issues can be a thing of the past with a dice tower providing sufficiently randomized, contained rolls, time and time again.  And for those that appreciate fine craftsmanship, natural materials and innovative design, we present the Wyrmwood Magnetic Dice Tower.\nCrafted from fine hardwoods, with no dyes or stains, the Magnetic Dice Tower makes a beautiful centerpiece to any tabletop during game night.  In addition, our dice tower is designed to easily disassemble for storage and transportation due to the use of rare earth magnets, which hold the tower together:\nAssembly is simple.  Using our system of stamped numbers, you can rebuild a disassembled tower in seconds - many of our customers enjoy letting their children tackle the assembly as a game of their own!\nThe Magnetic Dice Tower is the centerpiece of the modular Complete System, which includes the Magnetic Dice Tower, the Personal Dice Tray, and the Dice Vault.  Each of these components is detailed more below, and in this campaign, all three components are available independently.  Pledge for everything you want, and nothing you don't.\nWhether you pledge for the entire system or a single component, Red Oak or Bolivian Rosewood, you're assured of three things:\n1) Wyrmwood Craftsmanship We offer quality that is second to none, and work to ensure that each and every piece we create is one that you will take pride in for a lifetime.\n2) Wyrmwood Service Our commitment to client satisfaction is a cornerstone of our philosophy and has been from the day Wyrmwood began, over five years ago.\n3) The Wyrmwood Craftsman's Promise Our unconditional lifetime guarantee - we stand behind our work and your satisfaction, and if you're unhappy, we will make it right.\n The cornerstone of the Complete System.\n The perfect companion to the Dice Tower, usable on its own.\n The original, and still the finest way to encase your favorite set of dice.\nEvery piece we produce is handcrafted. We take great pride in the fact that we oversee every element of the production and maintain full control over the entire process, from raw lumber to packed, labeled shipments. This allows us the confidence necessary to offer our Craftsman\u2019s Promise; the guarantee at the heart of our customer service philosophy:\nThere is only one acceptable outcome for our Craftsmen: a product that they can take personal pride in and an -absolutely- satisfied client. If you are unsatisfied with your product for -any- reason at all, we will fully refund or replace the item free of charge. We always guarantee our products, and we will always pay for shipping.\nExceptional Materials: Every piece Wyrmwood creates is crafted using premium hardwoods sourced from all around the world. We care deeply about the environment and strive to source our woods ethically and responsibly; to that end, we donate a portion of the sales of our rarest woods towards rainforest sustainability and preservation through the Rainforest Trust. For more information on our wood sourcing, visit our website. For more information about Rainforest Trust, click here.\nHand Rubbed Finish: We use a close-to-the-wood oil and wax finish to protect the piece while allowing the natural character, feel, and color of the material to shine through. We never use dyes or stains. A hand rubbed finish is quite labor intensive, but we believe that the results are worth it, and we think you will, too.\nFrom Our Hands To Yours: When we gather around the table for a game, it\u2019s a social event - we understand, as humans have throughout history, that there is something special and unique about our gathering to share time together.  Technology can enhance that experience, but can never replace the human element entirely.\nWe believe that what\u2019s true for the game is true for the accessories you use to bring it to life.  Technological advances can remove much of the tedium from woodworking and improve consistency in some operations, but there is no substitute for a highly skilled craftsman and the attention to detail they can bring.  That's why each and every piece is made, approved and boxed right here in our shop in New England, and you are directly supporting the artisans of Wyrmwood every time you pledge to one of our campaigns, order from our website, or purchase from us at a convention.\nAs a player, you put a lot of heart and soul into the character you bring to the table; you should rest assured that our craftsmen put their heart and soul into creating your Wyrmwood piece in the same way.\nOur Name and Our Word: Wyrmwood stands for uncompromising quality and customer satisfaction, and as craftsmen we stake our name and reputation on that satisfaction. If you aren\u2019t thrilled, we aren\u2019t done. This is why we unconditionally guarantee our work - for life.\nIn this video, watch as our Craftsmen J and Cesia craft an entire Black Poisonwood Complete System from scratch.\nAs a Kickstarter exclusive, we will offer a very limited number of Magnetic Dice Towers featuring hand-cut marquetry and custom inlay.  Made with Black Poisonwood, highly figured Maple, Holly, Ebony, and silver, these pieces will stand out on any table.  If you're looking for the finest Dice Tower ever made, and craftsmanship second to none, than the Dungeon Master Edition is for you.\nWatch the walk-through video below to see how the Costello brothers created this heirloom piece in our New England workshop.\nThanks to your support, we have now unlocked different designs for the Dungeon Master Tier. You can now choose between three options for the inlay on the side of your Dice Tower: The original knot, the Knot of Protection or the Knot of Harmony. Choose wisely!\nWhile some of our backers have clear wood preferences, we know that it's a difficult decision for many - they might love them all!  As fans of each and every wood that we work with, we get it, and we have a solution.  We call it Roll The Dice, and it's available in this campaign.\nWhen you pledge for a component or components at this level, your wood will be randomly determined from the Kickstarter lineup at the end of the campaign, at Cherry value or higher.  This includes any and all woods unlocked over the course of the campaign.\nAgain, to be clear: the wood of your Roll The Dice items will be randomly selected from all unlocked woods at the end of the campaign - no matter when you pledge, you get access to the whole lineup.  Everything from the price point of Cherry, all the way to the top, for the same price.\nNot only that, you'll receive a custom text engraving at no additional charge on any Roll The Dice Dice Vault in your pledge!  This includes Complete Systems and individual Dice Vaults.\nThe list of Roll The Dice possibilities can be seen below.  We will update this graphic throughout the campaign to ensure it is always up to date as woods are added.\nMaps and cartography hold a fascination for many of us.  Perhaps it's the way a well-drawn map can bring to life a distant land - perhaps one only found in our imagination?  Or is it the promise of adventure, the documentation of discoveries, the historical triumph in charting something so much larger than ourselves?  Maps can symbolize all of that and more, and few maps can inspire like those crafted by Deven Rue.\nYou've seen the work of the Mistress of Maps featured on Critical Role - now, through this campaign, you can display a piece of her artwork at your game table!   Pledge at the \"Mistress of Maps\" tier to choose a map from our selection and have it etched across the surface of a Magnetic Dice Tower.  Select one of four woods, all chosen specifically for their ability to act as a complementary canvas and showcase the fine details of the illustration.\nChoose between four locations!\nNew maps unlocked!\nHave you decided on a Medieval Banner Leather Strap for your Complete System? Well, thanks to your support, we are now offering ten different types of fields to customize your Leather Strap even further! Simply choose your favorite!\nThe Magnetic Dice Tower is designed to let you roll all the dice you want, when you want to.  The design ensures that there's no place for dice to get stuck, and you can even use it with larger, 19mm dice.  You can use it with board games and role playing games, and the magnets enable you to take it with you when you're on the go.\nWyrmwood is a dedicated group of craftsmen based in New England. The company started five years ago with just three people, and a simple idea. As lifelong gamers ourselves, we'd grown up playing tabletop games and forging friendships across the game table, and those connections had remained a part of our lives. But we'd changed in many ways - we'd grown up - and clearly, tabletop gaming had, too. What if the accessories and tools we used to play them did the same?\n In the beginning it was just a few friends in a garage workshop, working for a few days a week. We launched our first Kickstarter, and then found ourselves working every day, and bringing in some friends to help.\n As time went on, we kept growing - all of us left our other jobs and came to Wyrmwood, full-time, and we kept expanding, launching new projects and products, and traveling around the country to conventions, so we could show our work in person, too.\n We found that there were many of us out there - gamers that wanted quality accessories to enhance their experience. We were also able to find more dedicated, hardworking people that loved games and loved craftsmanship - the art of developing a skill and honing a craft, and producing something worthwhile with their hands. We outgrew the garage, and moved into a larger facility.  In early 2018, we outgrew that, and moved again.\n We're a close knit group of people - we work together, travel together, and, of course, game together. Whether it's Dungeons & Dragons in the workshop after hours, bowling or mini golf on a weekend, or just playing some video games at our Holiday Party, we're not just co-workers - we're teammates; we're friends; we're family.\nWhat started as a hobby for three in a garage has now grown to a career for 40. We've grown a lot, and much has changed, but our mission remains: to create the finest in gaming supplies, to offer unparalleled, uncompromising service, and to strive to continually innovate and improve.  In short, to up our game - every time. Through your support, we've been able to keep doing just that - and helping you do likewise with the products and features you want.\nEach and every one of us would like to thank you for your support of our work. When you pledge to this campaign, it isn't a purchase of a mass-produced, cookie-cutter product from a faceless corporate machine. It's for a real piece of handcrafted woodworking, created by the people you see here. Your support enables us to do what we love. That means a lot to us, and we're committed to crafting a piece that will mean a lot to you in exchange. So, from all of us, thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nThis project, as with every project we\u2019ve done, is rather low risk. All the work is being done in our New England workshop, here in the United States. We're sourcing all of the materials as quickly as possible, having already lined up our suppliers and estimates of our material needs, and as soon as the project reaches its goal, we'll begin production.\n\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter campaign, and we\u2019ve learned a great deal from those that came before it. In our very first, the Dice Vault, we were able to meet our deadline for holiday delivery despite an unanticipated and overwhelming response. The rest of fulfillment was complete a matter of weeks beyond our initial estimate. We maintained open communication throughout, and our backers were very pleased - some calling it the best campaign of which they'd ever been a part. Our second campaign, the original campaign for the Magnetic Dice Tower System, was described by one journalist as the \"perfect Kickstarter.\" Our latest and most successful campaign, the Adventurer's Arsenal, is currently beginning fulfillment as planned, and we are striving to finish well ahead of schedule.\n\nWe will be communicating frequently, via email/messages, comments on the campaign page, and Kickstarter updates when there is significant information to communicate or monthly, whichever comes first.\n\nIf the campaign funds, measures are in place to get production moving quickly and efficiently as soon as possible.

Our creative team spent nearly a year developing this ultimate Cavern collection. We started with research, foam mock-ups and advice from our tooling experts, and designed organic forms and enveloping curves that go far beyond the shapes you could build with any previous terrain. \nSCULPTING AND PAINTING. A key part of making Caverns Deep! special was deepening the cave-like overhangs and textures to build astonishingly dramatic and perfectly colored formations. Our artists painstakingly sculpted every single crevice, stalagmite, ledge, swell and pool by hand \u2013 and our painters meticulously applied just the right mix of color to capture all the depth and detail. In our opinion, it\u2019s the best sculpting and painting we\u2019ve ever done. \n THEMES AND FEATURES\nCaverns Deep! includes an extensive variety of terrain, features and enhancements. We have crumbling Ruins, a pestilent Mushroom Grotto, perilous Ice Catacombs, reptilian infested Water, illuminated Crystal Caverns, the treacherous Underdoom, and Dreadhollow Forest, a brand new Wilderness terrain system. \nMany pieces come with working (even some multicolor) LEDs.  Most Caverns Deep! pieces also come with standard Anchor Magnets inset underneath, so your builds stay firmly in place on our colorful (metal embedded) Terrain Trays.  \nThere\u2019s dramatic elevation, traps, minis, bridges, even a modular dock and boat. And, at long last, a \u201cDwarven Forge\u201d!\nOur Trifecta Pieces Offer Unparalleled Modularity\nAll the sets you see come fully hand painted, right out of the box.  Or, if you prefer, order your sets unpainted (and try our custom designed Pokorny paints, available on our website).\nAt the heart of Caverns Deep are its 15 exciting Encounters. Every Encounter is a self-contained adventure with its own unique theme and pieces \u2013 and it's ready to play right out of the box!\nThese 15 Walkthrough Videos do a great job of showing you what makes each encounter special.\nThe Module.  Also included in your pledge is a full Caverns Deep! Module that journeys through every single Encounter \u2013 with photos, illustrations and complete stats, via PDF download. Since the domain of Caverns Deep! is the actual setting for its storyline, the pieces and builds are depicted within and integral to the narrative. So the module and terrain work symbiotically to immerse your group in your game like never before! \nMODULARITY \nOne of the essential features of all Dwarven Forge terrain is its modularity. Caverns Deep! is no exception. You can build the Encounters we\u2019ve pictured -- or you can build something completely new every time. You can also combine your Caverns Deep! pieces with any of our other terrain. The only limit is your imagination! \nHOW TO PLEDGE\nYou\u2019ll see photos of the Encounters followed by photos of the pledge levels further below. But first, let's just lay out the basics of making a pledge:  \n1) To pledge, the first thing you'll want to do is select a Main Pledge level. These are the pledges shown down the right-hand column of the page.  \n2) Once you select your Main Pledge, you can add any other set(s) you see on this Kickstarter, as long as it has a price listed on our Google Sheet or our Pledge Calculator (that means it's unlocked). These include anything from small add-on sets, to full Encounters -- or even another Main Pledge level.  \n3) To pledge, click on the pledge level you want, then enter the total cost (including shipping/taxes) of your Main Pledge + any additional set(s) you want, and press \"continue,\" then \"pledge\".  You can modify your pledge as many times as you want until the campaign ends at 9PM US Eastern Time on August 14th.\nHow do we know which sets you've chosen?\nI.  When the campaign is over, Kickstarter will charge you for your pledge.  Kickstarter takes their commission, and then they send the remaining funds to us.  They give us: your e-mail (the one you use with KS); your main pledge level; and your pledge total.  It's then up to us to collect all remaining information.  We do that with our online Pledge Manager.\nII. About 4-6 weeks after the campaign closes, you will receive an e-mail invitation to this online Pledge Manager.  It will be pre-loaded with your main pledge and your total pledge amount.  You'll then enter your name and shipping details, and reconfirm your set choices from our online menu, which will be a much enhanced version of the pledge calculator.  Once you're done, you can download a copy of your order, or even upgrade your selections (subject to availability).  (If you didn't include shipping/import fees with your pledge, the pledge manager will also collect them.)\nIII. This will be our 6th Pledge Manager, so please don't worry -- this part is easy and fun.  Any questions at that time, we are absolutely available to help!\nCHOOSING YOUR PLEDGE LEVEL\nWe offer 4 different types of Main Pledges:  \nI. Starter Pledges \nThese will give you a great start on building your cavern. These include Cavern Starter and Cavern Entrance.  \nII. Build Your Own\nSelect Build Your Own Cavern to order your own set choices \u00e0 la carte.  You can use our Pledge Calculator or our Google Spreadsheet to add up the total of the sets you want.  \nIII. Adventure Essentials\nThe Caverns Deep pieces are detailed, feature-filled and more costly to produce than most of our previous pieces.  \nWith that in mind, Nate assembled Adventure Essentials 1-3, 1-6, 1-9 and 1-11 from subsets of the first 11 Encounters to provide a maximum variety and utility for the least cost.  Nate's goal was to cherry pick all the key Adventure pieces that define each Encounter, and provide a Universal set of Core pieces so you can build each Encounter you pledge for -- just not all of them at the same time. \nThese pledge levels reflect our recommendation for maximizing the versatility and efficiency of your pledge.\nAdventure Essentials 1-3 contains:\n3 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-3. \nUniversal Core Set 1-3.\n4 Add-on packs that are part of Encounters 1-3\nYou can build Encounters 1-3, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-6 contains:\n6 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-6.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3 and 4-6.\n8 Add-on packs that are part of Encounters 1-6. \nYou can build Encounters 1-6, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-9 contains:\n9 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-9.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3; 4-6; 7-9.\n18 Add-on packs (this includes 2X of 2 sets) that are part of Encounters 1-9. \nYou can build Encounters 1-9, but not all at the same time. \nAdventure Essentials 1-11 contains:\n11 Adventure packs with all the Adventure pieces from Encounters 1-11.\nUniversal Core Set 1-3; 4-6; 7-9; 10-11.\n25 Add-on packs (this includes 2X of 3 sets) that are part of Encounters 1-11. \nYou can build Encounters 1-11, but not all at the same time. \nCaverns Deep! For those of you who want to go all-in, this pledge includes: Everything from the Adventure Essentials 1-11 (please see that pledge level for details); and complete Encounters 12/Ice Cavern, 13/Crystal Cavern; 14/The Underdoom; and 15/Dreadhollow Forest.\nYou\u2019ll be able to build every single encounter (just not all at the same time). It\u2019s a big pledge, and reflects a savings of more than $500 over the cost of all components ordered separately.\nIV. WHOLE ENCOUNTER PLEDGES\nThese are bundles that include every single piece shown from various Encounters. \nUncharted Underground. It includes all the pieces included in Encounter 12/Ice Cavern, Encounter 13/Crystal Cavern and Encounter 14/The Underdoom. (This pledge does not include Encounters 1-11.) \nDeluxe Caverns Deep! This absolutely mind-blowing assortment includes the complete version of all 15 Encounters -- you can display them all at the same time. This enormous pledge covers a 4'x12' table, and includes a savings of more than $750 over the cost of all the Encounters ordered separately.\nOne final note on the main pledges: Except for Build Your Own Cavern, each Main Pledge offers a discount off the \u00e0 la carte price for its components. (The percentage of the discount actually goes up as the pledges get larger.) \nClick on the photo for more detail.\nAnd here are all 15 full Encounters.

If you have a Build Your Own Cavern or higher pledge, you may add any Add-on Set to your order.  Please use our online spreadsheet or our Pledge Calculator to view the prices for all available sets.\nAs the funding level of this Kickstarter grows, our production run gets larger and more efficient. This enables us to add in free stretch goal pieces that \"unlock\" -- and are automatically added to your pledge -- at specified funding milestones. These milestones are eligible to unlock until the Kickstarter ends on August 14, at 9PM US Eastern time.\nEach stretch goal fits into a specific set within one of the Encounters. If your pledge includes that set, you receive that stretch goal when it unlocks; if your pledge does not include that set, you do not receive that stretch goal.\nYou can keep track of the stretch goals using our stretch goal map.\nWHY YOUR SUPPORT IS CRITICAL TO US\nEven though -- with your help -- we've run 5 successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are still a small company in a niche business.  Kickstarter -- primarily through our amazing backers -- provides a platform uniquely able to support the rich assortment of products you see.  This wouldn't be possible doing \"business as usual.\"\nBefore Kickstarter, we typically launched 1-2 new sets per year. Caverns Deep! will tool nearly 200 pieces and produce well over 100 different set configurations.  With that contrast in mind, here are the main hurdles that your backing surmounts:\nFirst, the product development:  The support and enthusiasm you've already demonstrated gave us the confidence and inspiration we needed to devote our resources to designing, sculpting and prototyping this colossal line.  All this work is already done!\nSecond, the tooling:  We could never risk the cost of nearly 150+ massive steel molds (almost one for most every part) without your backing.  \nThird, the inventory: Producing the variety of products you'll see in Caverns Deep isn't possible without the backing we receive.  Imagine a small company having to order over 100 different sets (painted and unpainted encounters and add-ons) for inventory without knowing customer demand.  We might get by producing the wrong quantities for a few sets, but never something of this magnitude.  This is perhaps the most overlooked reason why crowdfunding helps us make this offer so much better.\nThis is also why we offer backers:\nKickstarter-exclusive prices that will never be as low again.\nGuaranteed availability of backers' set selections (which, although we try, is nearly impossible to offer on our website).\nSHIPPING\nThis year, shipping (US and Worldwide) is not included in the pledge and set prices. You can see exactly how much your shipping will cost on our online spreadsheet or our Pledge Calculator. (Kickstarter cannot provide you with these amounts because it does not capture any shipping associated with shipping add-on sets.)\nPlease include the shipping in your total pledge. If you choose not to include the shipping, our post-campaign Pledge Manager will collect your shipping charges.\nThe listed shipping charges on the spreadsheet and ultimately, the pledge calculator, will also include all taxes and fees for shipments to the US, Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Mainland China. Duties, taxes and fees for shipments to other countries are not included and will be collected by the courier upon delivery. \nWe deeply appreciate the interest of backers from all over the world, and we apologize that we aren\u2019t able to make any exceptions to these extra charges.\nPRODUCTION AND DELIVERY\nWhile production of our last campaign, Dungeon of Doom, is complete, actual backer shipments are still in progress, and production time took 2-3 months longer than we anticipated. We are very grateful for everyone\u2019s patience during this time, and it since we\u2019re now promoting Caverns Deep!, it seems appropriate that we address the topic of delays. \nWe hate being late; delays are disappointing to our backers. And since you are the core of our business, your opinions matter to us very much. Yet, even after 20 years of producing terrain with great production partners, our ETA is still really an estimate\u2014albeit a sincere one. \nWith more 200 pieces (some of which are always \u201cpushing the envelope\u201d) to tool, cast and paint, we always have unforeseen obstacles that create delays \u2013 and we actually pad the production schedule to anticipate them. We also work double time to fix problems \u2013 and so does the factory. Sometimes we still don\u2019t anticipate enough. \nWhat will happen with Caverns Deep!? \nFirst, we should note that we launched the Kickstarter now (instead of waiting until August when Dungeon of Doom shipments will be finished) because it\u2019s important to complete the tooling needed to start casting at full speed before the Chinese New Year. This wouldn\u2019t happen if we waited, and we hope you understand. \nSecond, we \u2013 and our factory \u2013 promise as always to run a disciplined process, to work hard and smart to produce your sets, and to keep you informed. Most importantly, we will remain dedicated to making the best product we can, and \u2013 only if unavoidable \u2013 taking a little more time to ensure it\u2019s worth waiting for. June, 2019 is our best projection for when your sets will start shipping.  \nPlease help spread the word -- and  join the conversation in the Comments section.

With every illness I posted, people from around the world reached out saying the artwork described how they felt when their words couldn\u2019t, and for a moment, the art helped them not feel so alone in their battles. \n    Mental health professionals from the US and Europe now use the artwork as a way to help speak to their clients, and I couldn't be more honored. By creating art that focuses on our hidden, but universal struggles, I too have been able to open up about my own battles with depression so that others won't feel so alone. With this book, I want to help bring comfort for those who need it on a larger scale, and I can only make this happen with your help. I want this to be more than just a book of art. I want this to be the first step for many to start a movement using darker art as a way of communicating how we feel.   \n     The book will feature all of my mental health and human condition art with descriptions as well as the inspiration for each piece giving fans a never before seen look into the process. I want to remove the stigma around mental health so that we can all begin the healing, together. I hope you\u2019ll join me . Armor up, and battle on.\nMock Up Design of final book\nThe book will be 8.5x11 inches, hardback, with 165 to 175 pages depending on the response and backers. Each illness , phobia, and armor up series will feature a brief description of the design along with where my inspiration came from and where my head was at during the initial layout.\nWhat it means\nWhat the Masses have said\nStretch Goals: If and When we get to the higher tiers I have some more ideas planned! \n    Shawn Coss is an Ohio based artist who\u2019s been chasing his dream to being an entreprenartist for the past 9 years. He\u2019s co-owner of Any Means Necessary clothing, creator of the Inktober Illness Series, and got his start into the craziness of professional art while working with Cyanide and Happiness. He's also achieved his dream gig of working with Stephen King on the movie Cell, as well as create the album art for bands such as Seether and Sadistik. He refuses to leave Ohio because he doesn\u2019t know any better.\n     Shipping internationally is always a painful process because I feel like so many are gouged due to the country they live in. I tried to make it as cheap as I possibly could without being in the red and hope many of my international friends will understand. Canada was able to get away with a little bit cheaper option due to being the U.S. neighbor. Hopefully all of the extras that come with the book will ease up some of that shipping cost pain.
