Having myself experienced what can happen when a screenplay becomes a graphic novel, to say I'm excited by this Kickstarter is very much an understatement!\u201d \u2014 William Gibson\nMADI is a 260-page road trip graphic novel set in the near future, by film director Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and writer Alex de Campi (BAD KARMA, BLADE RUNNER), and drawn by some of comics\u2019 most exciting artists including Glenn Fabry, Simon Bisley, Duncan Fegredo and Pia Guerra. Each artist tackles a 8-30 page section of the story, bringing to life one location.\nSee for yourself: Download the first 19 pages of MADI here! Includes both the Fegredo/Phillips and Shimizu covers.\n This project is EU/UK shipping friendly! We are drop-shipping to a UK distributor so shipping is affordable to our huge and beloved European fanbase. Estimated maximum shipping costs for a single book are: US: $10 / Canada & Mexico: $15 / UK: $20 / Mainland Europe: $25 / Rest of World: $55. Shipping costs will be collected at checkout (after the campaign ends) via Backerkit, where you\u2019ll also have the chance to add on additional books or upgrade to a higher-tier book. \nMadi Preston, a veteran of Britain\u2019s elite special operations J-Squad unit, is burnt out and up to her eyeballs in debt. She and the rest of her team have retired from the military but are now trapped having to pay to service and maintain the technology put into them during their years of service.   They're working for British conglomerate Liberty Inc as  mercenaries, selling their unique ability to be remote controlled by specialists while in the field, and the debts are only growing as they get injured completing missions. We meet Madi as she decides she\u2019s had enough.  She will take an off-the-books job that should earn her enough to pay out her and her sister, but when the piece of tech she\u2019s supposed to steal turns out to be a kid, and she suddenly blacks out... she finds herself on the run from everyone she\u2019s ever known. \nIn a globe-spanning adventure from Shanghai to Soho, Madi has to stay one step ahead of the giant corporations closing in on her from all sides. \nMADI is the third and final story in the \u201cMooniverse,\u201d an anthology of independent stories that take place in a shared future. You don\u2019t need to have seen MOON or MUTE to fully enjoy this standalone book.\nThe full roster of line artists are: Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Oca\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell, Tonci Zonjic, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Gu\u00e9ra, Chris Weston,  Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David Lopez and Christian Ward. Our amazing colour team includes: Matt Wilson, Nayoung Kim, Chris O\u2019Halloran, Adam Brown, Jacob Phillips, Ra\u00fal Arnaiz, Giulia Brusco, Sergey Nazarov and Kelly Fitzpatrick. Lettering is by Alex. \nEvery artist has been paid their full asking rate and is also getting royalties on the project. As freelancers ourselves, we believe in being the change we want to see in the industry.  \nThe book is almost finished being drawn and is currently being lettered. It will be sent to backers in early November, and comes in your choice of a luxe 7\u00bc X 10 \u00bd\u201d paperback, a 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d hardback (the original art size), or an oversize 10 x 14\u00bd\u201d cased hardback with over 40 pages of back matter. The paperback cover is by Duncan Fegredo & Jacob Phillips, and the hardback cover is by Yuko Shimizu. \nDuncan Fegredo and Jacob Phillips' beautiful wrap cover for the paperback edition\nBecause both Duncan and Alex have big fanbases in Europe we are doing our damnedest to make sure shipping is as inexpensive as possible while maintaining safe and careful mailing of these extremely nice, high quality editions. We're working with drop-shipping to UK distributors so European buyers won't have to pay airmail from the US.  Backerkit is handling all our pledge management and will be charging shipping at the end, once the campaign is over (you'll also be able to add on books or upgrade your pledge at that time, if you want). Z2 has its own warehouse, so US fulfillment can be handled easily and professionally in-house. \nNo digital version of MADI will be made available at this time, or indeed maybe ever.\nStores, you will be able to order MADI for retail sale at your fine shops a few weeks after Kickstarter fulfillment.  \nYuko Shimizu's luscious cover for the hardback edition\nA model of Yuko's cover on the hardback, without logos (why interrupt the pretty until you have to)\nThe deluxe slipcase edition is truly a magnificent book, with the art reproduced at luscious 10\u201d x 14.5\u201d size (a 20% blowup on the book\u2019s original art size of 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d) and with over 60 pages of extras, process, and essays from Duncan and Alex, along with surprise bonus art from friends like Colleen Doran and Jeffrey Veregge! See a scene go from original screenplay through Alex\u2019s handwritten breakdowns to comic script, pencils, inks, then colours! Pore over the thumbnails and rough layouts of masters like Duncan Fegredo and RM Gu\u00e9ra! Enjoy all the character sketches and development work that went on behind the scenes (there was a lot, this project was super complex to produce) such as Annie Wu\u2019s amazing Kitty Cop concept art, below! (The whole Kitty Cop origin story is pretty great, too, it basically involves Alex + too much sugar.) \nThe Madi deluxe edition with diecut slipcase\nThe slipcase edition features Yuko\u2019s gorgeous wrap cover without logos, inside a diecut slipcase that allows Yuko\u2019s illustration of Madi to show through. This slipcase edition will not be available for retail sale; if you miss it here, maybe we might have a few at the Z2 Comics table at a convention, but maybe not. \nAnnie Wu\u2019s concept art for our Kitty Cops, or: \u201ckawaii, but make it fascism\u201d\nDuncan Fegredo's lovely wrap cover for the softcover edition, before its colours by Jacob Phillips!\nA Simon BIsley warmup sketch, as you do; another of the sort of extras that only come in the deluxe slipcase edition\nAlso, neither Duncan nor Alex have ANY chill so we'll probably post lots of lettered pages in the updates.... but only for backers.  \nDuncan's last \"Free the 156\" stickers from MUTE, for the first 50 hardcover backers\n Who we are:\nMan; made Moon & more\nDuncan Jones is a British advertising and film director, best known for his BAFTA winning film MOON, epic game-based fantasy movie WARCRAFT and his other science fiction films SOURCE CODE & MUTE.  He is presently staying safely locked up at his home, waiting for it to be safe to go out and make ROGUE TROOPER of 2000AD fame with Rebellion Studios.  Duncan is answerable to his wife, Rodene, his two kids, Stenton 4 and Zowie 2, and his dog, who takes her privacy very seriously after a scamming incident, and wishes to remain anonymous. \nWoman; made books\nAlex de Campi is a novellist and comics writer, best known for her noir graphic novel BAD GIRLS and her love anthology TWISTED ROMANCE, both of which were nominated for three Eisner awards last year. She has also written some episodes of Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s BLADE RUNNER anime (on Toonami next year) and worked with Masamune Shirow on a GHOST IN THE SHELL comic for Kodansha. Her debut novel, medieval suspense thriller THE SCOTTISH BOY, comes out at the end of the month and you can preorder it here in the UK or here in the US. You can read her action-thriller comic BAD KARMA anywhere in the world right now, as it is pay-what-you-wish on lovely webcomic site Panel Syndicate. Alex is answerable to her daughter Lorelei and her deafblind pit bull Tango, and they\u2019re all answerable to the darn cat. Her little family is currently enjoying being the only people left in Manhattan. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks, the book is already paid for and most art is finished.

My name is Bianca & I'm an Artist who is passionate about creating inclusive, cute & meaningful things.\nThis is officiallyyy my last Wavy Pride Series themed project. It's been an amazing experience creating so many pins reflecting so many different identities!! This doesn't necessarily mean the collection is finished \u2014 I will, overtime, release new pride pins as much as I can but will be shifting my focus onto other inclusive projects <3\nShort backstory on the wavy pride shape: I created this shape in 2017 after being inspired & fascinated with \"liquid\" style and how it would be used to make objects look like they were in motion! Within the custom shape I saw that each groove/line could be separated with a different color and then I thought of adding the pride flag design! From there it just kept evolving.\nWear these pins proudly, share positivity and represent who you are! I hope this will inspire others to spread love, not hate. These pins are perfect for those who strive to be more thoughtful, kind, and inclusive within the LGBTQ+ community no matter your race, gender, sex/sexuality, appearance, impairments/disabilities, or overall identity.\nUNLOCKED! \u2014 Initial $750 Goal: Queer, Polyamory & Gay Male MLM Pride Pins \nQueer \u2014 an umbrella term that has been embraced and reclaimed by some of the MOGAI community as a symbol of pride, representing individuals who fall out of  the gender and sexuality \u201cnorms\u201d.\nThe pinks and blues next to each other represent same-gender attraction,  the orange and green are for nb, and black and white for  ace/aro/agender spectrum people as well.\nPolyamory \u2014 the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more  than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved. It  has been described as \"consensual, ethical, and responsible  non-monogamy\". There are two flags, the earlier with the Pi symbol and the newer update with the heart and infinity symbol. If you pledge for this pin, let me know which flag you prefer in the comments or in a message!\nMLM / Gay Male \u2014 Men Loving Men / Someone, who can be transgender or cisgender, who is generally attracted  to someone of the same gender. Being gay is separate from the concept of gender identity, and so it is possible for a trans person to be both trans and gay.\nUNLOCKED! \u2014 First stretch goal unlocked at $1000\nOmnisexual  \u2014 a sexual orientation where the individual recognizes and is attracted to people of all sexes, genders, and gender identities, with gender as a factor in their attraction.  \nUNLOCKED! \u2014 Second stretch goal unlocked at $1250\nDemiromantic  \u2014 a type of grey-romantic who only experiences romantic attraction after developing an emotional connection beforehand. Demiromantics do not experience primary romantic attraction, but they are capable of secondary romantic attraction.   \nUNLOCKED! \u2014 Third stretch goal unlocked at $1500\nBigender \u2014 A gender identity which can be literally translated as 'two genders' or  'double gender'. Bigender people experience exactly two gender identities, either simultaneously or varying between the two. These two gender identities could be male and female, but could also include non-binary identities.\nUNLOCKED! \u2014 Fourth stretch goal unlocked at $1700 \u2014 Doubles as a freebie and a pin you can pledge for!\nInclusive Pride \u2014 A merge of Philadelphia's QPOC Pride and the Transgender Pride Flags. A design meant to be inclusive of our community. This is a new variation from my collaboration with Netflix's Tales of the City!!\nUNLOCKED! \u2014 Fifth stretch goal unlocked at $1950\nSapphic \u2014 Referring to women or woman-aligned NB people who are sexually and/or  romantically attracted to other women(-aligned) people. Applies to lesbian, pansexual, bisexual, and other women(-aligned) who are  sexually/romantically attracted to women(-aligned). \n\nOriginates from the Greek poet Sappho, a bisexual woman from the Isle of Lesbos, from which we get the term lesbian.\nNext stretch goal unlocks at $2150\nAchillean \u2014 A term to describe men, partial men, or male-aligned people who are  attracted to other men, partial men, or male-aligned people. It is not  necessarily synonymous with gay because people who are bi, pan, ace, etc  can also use it as long as they fit the above statement.\nIn ancient  Rome, as in 19th-century England, green indicated gay affiliations.  Victorian men would often pin a green carnation on their lapel as  popularized by author Oscar Wilde, who often wore one on his lapel.\nNext stretch goal unlocks at $2400\nAndrogyne \u2014 A gender identity where a person experiences a blending of genders, or  feels that their identity is in between genders. Usually, but not  always, people who identify as androgyne feel that their identity is a  blending of male and female, or somewhere between those two genders.  Androgyne people may or may not choose to present androgynously.\nLast stretch goal unlocks at $2600\nGraysexual \u2014 Being between a- and allo- (asexual/aromantic/etc and  allosexual/alloromantic/etc); feeling attraction rarely, vaguely, or  weakly.\nFor example, a gray-a may:\n-Experience attraction but not very often.\n-Experience attraction, but not desire the type of relationship associated with that type of attraction.\n-Gray-a can be used as an umbrella term or as its own orientation.\nGray-a may also prefix to a label, as in \"Gray-heteroromantic, gray-homosexual\"\nYou may choose any available pin below in the special reward tiers :)\nFor now there is one, but more special rewards will be added as the project progresses!\n Learn more information about each pride flag here: Pride Flag Glossary \nMarch \u2014 Kickstarter Launch!

There\u2019ve been many bands, many projects, many tours, many comedy shows, many radio shows, many benefits for many causes, many years just traveling alone. I\u2019ve been on many record labels - venerable American indies like Lookout! and Touch & Go, both of which sadly had to shutter their doors during the economic downturn of the late aughts, as well as Matador Records, who is still going, but with whom my relationship is now over. I\u2019ve never been the hippest ticket in any given town on any given night, but I\u2019ve always been there, and an amazing number of you have always been there with me.\nThe last record that I recorded under my own name or with the always amazing group of comrades we call The Pharmacists was released seven years ago. It\u2019s almost hard to believe. To be fair to myself, it\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been sitting on my hands the whole time - I had an incredibly active few years in the middle there, writing, recording, and touring with my collaborative project with Aimee Mann, called, The Both; I toured with the Pharmacists to the logical end of the cycle on the last album (and some beyond that), I\u2019ve continued to tour solo since, and I am always up for a drop in on any number of extremely talented friends\u2019 podcasts, benefits, comedy, variety, etc. shows, AND, I\u2019ve been little by little putting together a body of work - a set of music and ideas - that has, at this point, sprawled beyond the traditional album length, as well as - little by little - week by week, month by month, year by year - creating a space to record and produce this music, and learning on the job exactly how to do that.\nI probably had enough songs to complete an album a good five years ago, but a number of things - personal and financial - prevented me from doing it. And though it\u2019s always been a constant source of low-level anxiety that so much time continues to pass by, I\u2019ve also come to see that time as a boon. When I missed that first hurdle, that first deadline to PRODUCE SOMETHING, the world didn\u2019t end. Time kept moving, and all of the expectations that I had for MYSELF morphed into a more compassionate and contemplative group of feelings that were more about incubating, honing, experimenting, learning, and rebuilding a certain amount of confidence that I think I\u2019d lost in my stymied relationship with the cycles of releases and promotion and needing support (not just financial) from the label I was working for; and so I started to actually just allow myself that time. It hasn't always been easy, and I've grown and changed some over the long course of working on this. But having the eventual freedom to work on it at my own pace, and in my own space, has allowed this body of songs to change and grow with me. And now we find ourselves in a new political reality, and I find myself compelled to keep writing. We\u2019re close enough, though, that I feel like I can set the stage to finally offer this work to you.\nEnter Kickstarter\nSo, yeah - as I said - it\u2019s been seven years since the last TL/Rx album, but really this has all been decades in the making. If my Twitter mentions are any indication, I'm PLEASED to know that there are at least a few people waiting for me to make a record, and I find myself here, at what I think is the right time, with the right platform, to take a step forward into further autonomy VIA COMMUNITY, and a productive future. It\u2019s often the case that tools arrive before we\u2019re ready to use them or even understand their potential. Just as often we find ourselves sitting around, immobilized for lack of the tools we need.\n\nI\u2019ve thought a lot about this. I\u2019ve always had my hands deep in the processes of making a record, promoting a record, touring on a record, etc. And I\u2019m going to carry that knowledge, gained in the trenches, forward to keep doing this - keep making records, keep touring, keep speaking out, keep singing about all of the things that are important to us; and as part of that, keep challenging MYSELF to keep growing, keep evolving.\nDon\u2019t Want to Live Inside Myself\nConstraints of time and geography have meant that I've been making this record mostly alone, in my dusty, also evolving, impermanent, partially-mobile mad scientist lab of a \u201cstudio.\u201d But I haven\u2019t been entirely alone - the moments in this project that have become the most important to me, are the moments when friends have pierced my bubble - come in and given something of themselves that's often completely changed my idea of what it even was that I was working on. \nChris Wilson, Pharmacists drummer of many years, plays on most of this stuff. Though I fancy myself a \u201cfun!\u201d and \u201cinteresting!\u201d drummer, and began working on these songs with my own drum tracks, I knew I needed what Chris was going to bring to these songs without even knowing what he was actually going to do on them. Wearing my producer hat, I made a conscious decision to let go of my ideas of how things should sound and just recorded him bringing his most raw yet refined vision of how to play these songs, and it turned my head around and wound up being the first piece that began propelling this all toward some fruition. \nI asked force of nature Jean Grae if she\u2019d sing a simple refrain of \u201cCan\u2019t go Back\u201d for me, and she sent me a layered harmony that so deeply cut to the core of what I was singing about - and in a moment when I\u2019d been particularly too inside my own head for too long, reminded me that I\u2019m not alone and that this music is real - it\u2019s not just in my head - that I\u2019m practically a puddle just writing about it now. \nI had what I thought might be a crazy idea to add saxophone to one song, and through a mutual friend, met NEW friend Adrienne Berry, who slotted into that one song so easily and with such a telepathic sense of what I didn\u2019t even know I wanted, that we tracked her on a few more, and they were all pretty much done in one take. \nMy dear compatriot and collaborator, Aimee Mann, who sent me a cross-country harmony for Lonsdale Avenue that, over the time we\u2019ve been playing it live, has become so integral to the song, it couldn\u2019t have made it to the album without her. \nThe great Jonathan Coulton, who, in the midst of the chaos leading up to the release of his OWN new album and tour, took the time (just a few days ago, as of the date I\u2019m writing this) to listen closely to a song I\u2019d lost the thread on, and in adding his voice to mine, gave it a structure that made the whole thing make sense to me again. \nVisionary and friend Rachel Lichtman, who came and STAYED with me to help me distill my thoughts into something cogent and put together, with help from my brother Danny, the video that would capture something of the spirit behind all of this.\nThe Jodi of \u201cTimorous Me\u201d fame, who\u2019s kept me from starving more than once and in more ways than one, and who\u2019s been a constant sounding board and source of wisdom. \nAnd my old friend Molly Neuman at Kickstarter, who helped me understand this new iteration of what\u2019s actually our very old idea of punk rock community, which, by the way, has always included you.\nMusic For Me, Music for You\nThe funding that I\u2019m seeking here will be used frugally and righteously. We\u2019re going to make what I hope you\u2019ll think is a great record, with a lot of extra music for all who join in on this project. I have ideas for some beautiful art and packaging that will come together as we go along. I want to pay everyone who\u2019s been working on this with me what they deserve. We\u2019re going to do all the nuts and bolts stuff - manufacturing, publicity, etc; music video(s) if possible; pay off some debts in any way that I can; I\u2019d like to keep working on building my studio to make sure I, AND MAYBE OTHERS, can keep making music on our own terms. I want to keep making music for me; I want to keep making music for you. I\u2019m seeking sustainability; and as it\u2019s my belief that I have a responsibility to use my platform to do what I can to help others achieve that, too, I\u2019m going to remain as active as I possibly can toward that end.\n\nAutonomy and Community\nSo now that I\u2019m not working for anybody else, I hope we can work together to KEEP making good stuff. I\u2019m ready to bring these songs forward, beyond the constraints of the shifting landscape of the music industry. I\u2019m taking autonomy and control back, and using Kickstarter to commence the next phase, of which the album that this campaign aims to make a reality will be just the first step. The old label Immediate Records used to have a slogan: \u201cHappy to be a part of the industry of human happiness.\u201d I like that industry. And there\u2019s a lot of work to do.\n-TL \n(Thank you to everyone who came forward with photos and video from over the years.

There are still some people I haven't gotten songs to, but I'm working on that, and if you haven't gotten yours and haven't written me with something personal, I'm going to pretend I know you better than I do, and maybe surprise both of us. Meal people - my plan was always to book a tour around these meetings, and that's on the horizon. My own booking agent is on my case about it at this point, so it's not something that I'm trying to put off - I'm trying to make it happen. Before this truly becomes my own personal Fyre Festival, I must just come out and tell you, at this point, that some of this delay is obviously down to the fact that, yes, I over-promised, over-committed, and rolled the dice on some things panning out financially better than they did; and some is down to trying to remain a working musician touring on the record that you helped me make while trying to stay on top of all of this, and the ins and outs of manufacturing some custom items that just took a really long time to get made correctly. I can't break that down into exact percentages, but I'll claim the lion's share. I have some shows and other stuff coming in February, and I would just beg your indulgence in offering me patience to get through this last round of travel, as what I bring home will help me finish the Kickstarter, and my time beyond February is blocked out and dedicated to doing exactly that. I have to do some promo for these shows coming up and a podcast that has arisen out of some recorded conversations Aimee Mann and I have had with other people we've run into while touring off and on over the last couple of years, and Maximum Fun has decided to take and do something with; so you'll see some of that on social media this week. Don't know what the future holds beyond that, but I hope this hasn't left everyone feeling too bruised, and I hope to still see some of your faces somewhere, as we trod on through the new year. xo - T PS, I had a video from the warehouse in Queens where I picked up the last palate of stuff, that it seems I can\u2019t upload from my phone.

This has obviously not been the most ideal situation for any of us, and though I still carry the buoyancy of the first phase of it with me, I obviously bit off more than I could chew on the timeline I projected, and it\u2019s obviously something I probably won\u2019t do again. As I have to keep working, I\u2019ll be on the road all October. However, I have nothing else on deck in November, and next to nothing in December.

Did you order the 7\"s? You're getting them in a custom fitted box, and I just literally don't have them yet.  The 7\"s themselves are done, and they look amazing, and I hope you'll be psyched when you get them. With the other stuff, it's coming.  The priority was to get the ALBUM out, which I did on a pretty advanced schedule. If this were a normal record label, it'd probably just be heading to manufacturing now. If you've gotten nothing, it could be because you ordered a signed bundle.  I didn't have the t-shirts done for that before I went on tour. I'm almost done with tour, and you will get them soon.  The postcards were damaged in shipping from me to the shipping company.  So I had them printed, signed thousands of them, and now have to have them re-printed and sign thousands of them again.  You'll get them.  Demo tapes also have to be made - hand made - it takes time, but I'm doing it - it's FUN, but it's time consuming.  Personal songs?

Our problem occurs because the apparel industry typically uses a fit model who is 5\u20196 or taller to create clothing patterns. In fact, when making pants, the fit model can be as tall as 5\u201910! This is why most inseam lengths for women\u2019s pants are 32-34 inches. But what if you need a shorter inseam? \nCurrently, our only options are to spend time and/or money on alterations to chop off a few inches from the bottom, or rolling them up if it happens to be a style that allows it. We\u2019ve also learned other ways to make things work, like buying \"ankle\" pants and wearing them as regular pants and sometimes we even visit the children\u2019s section. All of these are helpful options, but at the end of the day, they are just band-aids for a problem that shouldn't exist anymore.\nThere are at least 38 million women in the U.S. who are 5\u20193 and shorter. That's a lot of women who are being overlooked! We deserve stylish, beautifully fitted pants that don't need alterations!\nWhile almost all women's pants come in arbitrary sizes like 4, 6, and 8 (without a standard across brands), here at Bantam Garb we want to be as transparent as possible with our sizing. This way you will know exactly what to expect when you order a pair of pants.\nFront and Back Rises When pants are not made to fit our frame, it's not just about the inseam. Two very important measurements are the front rise and back rise. If they are not to your scale, you often find that you have to pull your pants extra high so the crotch aligns properly. Pants for short women need to have front and back rises that are 1-2 inches shorter than average to account for the smaller frame of our lower torsos. If a pant that was altered doesn't fit properly at the top, you could be wearing pants that have up to four extra inches of fabric at the crotch!\nMeasurements\n1. Waist Your natural waistline is located above your belly button and below your rib cage. If you bend to the side, the crease that forms is your natural waistline. Don't suck in.\n2. Inseam Your inseam is a simple measurement from the inside of your pant-leg at the crotch all the way down to the pant bottom.\n3. Outseam The entire length of the pant from waist to bottom.\n4. Leg opening Diameter of the leg bottom.\n5. Front rise From crotch to mid front waist.\n6. Back rise (right behind the front rise) From crotch to mid back waist.\n7. Hips The widest part of your hips and buttocks.\nFor a reference point, if you're about 4\u201910 to 4\u201911, you typically will need an inseam of 26\u201d if you plan on wearing flats or 28\u201d if you plan on wearing heels. If you are between 5\u20190 to 5\u20192, you typically will need an inseam of 28\u201d if you plan on wearing flats or 30\u201d if you plan on wearing heels. If you are 5\u20193 to 5'4 you typically will need an inseam of 30\u201d. \nWe're launching with 3 styles: straight-leg (in black and royal blue), wide-leg (black/white stripe), and skinny jean (black and medium blue denim).     \nStraight Leg The straight leg pant is perfect for professional settings. It's made from 68% viscose, 27% nylon and 5% spandex. This style can be pre-ordered in black or in royal blue as shown. Our model is 4'11 and she is wearing waist 26\" and inseam 26\".\nSkinny Leg The skinny leg jean is the most casual of our styles. It's made from 98% cotton and 2% spandex. This is not a jegging, it is true denim with stretch that will comfortably hug your curves, and it also has real pockets. Our model below is 5'1 and is wearing a 30\" waist and 28\" inseam with flats. No rolling or folding! Our actress in the video is 4'11 and wearing 26\" waist and 26\" inseam with sneakers. This style can be pre-ordered in black denim as shown or in medium blue denim.\n  PLAY\n\nWide Leg The wide leg pant is our only printed option for this campaign. It is made from 100% polyester. The waist is flat at the front and elastic at the back, and has pockets on the sides. These are super dressy yet super comfortable for all-day wear. This style can be pre-ordered in black and white stripes.\nDon't settle for this!\nTheir pants vs. Our pants:\n  As you can see from our rewards, we really want to give our backers the best deal possible on our pants because you are helping us launch not only our brand but also our entire vision. Our retail prices will range from $50-$70, because it's important that we make petite AND affordable pants. We have been overcharged enough! So as a backer, you are receiving anywhere from 20%-50% off our retail, depending on the reward level you choose. In terms of quality, our pants are comparable to those sold for $75-$100, and you won't have to alter them! We can achieve this by bypassing retailers and making our pants available directly to you, our wonderful consumer.\nIf our Kickstarter campaign is successful, we will send a survey to all our backers who have pre-ordered pants and ask them for their size, style and color preference from our five choices. If you have pre-ordered more than one pair, you do not have to choose from just these five styles. You can save your reward pairs as we will be coming out with more styles and colors throughout 2017. However, we do require that at least one pair be from these five choices.\nDELIVERY TIMELINE\nOur Kickstarter campaign will end in mid-October. At that time, our founder will travel to the factory and work for 2-3 weeks finalizing sizing and grading. Production will begin in November and will last about 25 days. The finished pants will then be shipped and we anticipate being sent to backers by mid-December just in time for the holidays. Did we mention these pants make a GREAT gift?\nT-Shirts\nWe have two t-shirts available made from super soft organic cotton. Show your support for our brand while being comfy.\n  While we will be thrilled and utterly grateful for having our campaign reach its Kickstarter goal, we want to set our sights even higher, because our vision is about serving short women in the long term. We would love to offer more choices for pre-order right away and not just our fabulous original five. We have additional styles and colors that we will make available as we hit our stretch goals. The more pre-orders, the more choices we can offer throughout our campaign, and produce them right away. Thank you so much for reading this far, and for being part of our campaign. It truly is amazing that despite advancements in technology and information, something as simple as a well-fitting pair of fashion-forward pants is impossible to find for millions of women. However, with your help, we can change this.\nLike us on Facebook to follow our progress.\nFollow us on Twitter.\nSee our pictures on Instagram @bantamgarb.\nWe want you to be satisfied with your reward. If the pants you receive do not fit, you may exchange it for a different size. For exchanges, you will have to send the pants back to us at your own expense, however, we will pay for shipping the new item back to you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest challenge is making sure our pants fit well.

Bring a friend to the launch party/show at the Troubadour in West Hollywood on August 23rd - 2013\nProject update 10.0\nHello, Everyone.\nLess than a week to go for our Kickstarter campaign.\nSo far we've raised over $200k from a little less than 5000 supporters. That's enough to manufacture and fulfill the orders, pay our wonderful team, cover recording costs, and we have a little left over for promotion and marketing. A few years ago it would have been so much more difficult to get a project like this off the ground, and there would have been a mountain of debt, but here we are - it's amazing to be able to start the release process free and clear. Thank you all so much.\nWe are nearly done with the package design and will send out manufacturing orders as soon as the campaign closes. Vinyl will likely take a bit longer than CDs and posters, but we'll keep updating you with the progress until we can get your orders into your hands.\nWe're so happy we were able to get the music out to you early. Kickstarter isn't actually built for early rewards, but they were generous in allowing us to go ahead and find a workaround to provide you with downloads before the campaign was over. Once we've finished the campaign, artwork will be reworked and we will provide updated download links for you.\nPerhaps we'll reach the stretch goal of $250k, perhaps we won't. It's been exciting to see the campaign become so active again in the last week (We're back on the front page of Kickstarter!). However it goes, it's been a great ride. It took a while for us to get this record made, and just seeing the early reaction to the music has already made it worth the time and effort.\nOnce again - word of mouth is just about our only way of spreading the news. Thanks for all you've done, and we'd still appreciate it if you shouted out once more through Twitter or Facebook, or if you happen to run a giant media conglomerate and want to stick it on the evening news or a stadium jumbotron that's ok too.\nThank you all.\nYou rock\n-Toad\nP.S. We thought you might want a sneak peak of the New Constellation Album cover. We hope you like it!\nP.S.S. Annnnnd an acoustic version of \"California Wasted\"\nProject update 9.0\nHello, there.\nThis has been an exciting and busy couple of months. We\u2019ve been out on the road across the States, overjoyed to play the new material and see the Kickstarter supporters singing along from the audience. Thank you all!\nSo...we are in the final days of the campaign. Artwork has had a few unavoidable scheduling setbacks but is now racing full-steam ahead. My good friend Ben Ciccati has been drawing up a storm - all the images you\u2019ve been seeing on the site are his. For graphic design we\u2019ve brought in Kii Arens, who will put together the LP and CD Kickstarter packages, as well as poster and shirt design. I love seeing what the two of them are coming up with, and we\u2019ll share it with you soon.\nA few days ago I bought a tin space man and shot a lyric video for New Constellation. It\u2019s fairly silly, but if anyone needs motion-tracked rockets added to their home videos I now know how. We might sign the spaceman and have him as a Kickstarter item if people are interested. Let us know.\nAnyway: Thank you again, and please keep spreading the word. If your friends (or Twitter followers, or Friends) like Toad let them know about the campaign, and if you like the record (and the extra tracks) tell them about that, too. Please. With sugar on top.\nMany more shows to come, an acoustic EP to record, people to see and places to go...Say hello if you\u2019re nearby.\nBe well\ng\nProject update 8.0\nThank you so much for your continued support, we're deeply grateful. We'd like to remind you that if we reach our new stretch goal of $250K before the end of the campaign on August 4th, all backers will get a LIVE EP from the August tour. With that end date on the horizon, we have reached the point where we would like to ask all of you - our core supporters - to help spread the word and enlist support from your extended networks on social media and beyond. Together, we have managed to achieve three times our initial goal with less than five thousand backers and word of mouth alone.\n\nWith just a little more awareness we should be able to take this all the way to the finish line, so if you know a Toad fan, let them know there's only a couple more weeks to get the album now instead of waiting till September for the general release.\nFrom the bottom of our hearts thank you in advance, and hope to see you all on the road!\n- Glen, Todd, Randy & Dean\nProject update 7.0\nA huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to our Kickstarter campaign thus far. We are still completely overwhelmed by the response. We have a lot of updates this week! New backer rewards (based on your feedback) a special note from Todd and a new stretch goal!\nSince we have reached our first stretch goal of $150K - all backers will be receiving a new, in-studio acoustic recording - distributed as a digital download - and recorded at Revolver studios. For stretch goal #2 - if we reach $250K before the end of the campaign - all backers will get a Live EP from an upcoming tour date. More music!\nThank you everyone for your continued support! See you on the road!\nCheck out this personal note from Todd\nProject Update 6.0 \nHappy Independence Day, Everybody!\nThanks to all of you who have already joined the Kickstarter campaign for our new Toad the Wet Sprocket album New Constellation. We are stunned and humbled by the outpouring of support and the encouraging first reactions to this--our first, new record in 16 years.\nDue to the overwhelming demand for more Kickstarter packages, we\u2019re giving you the chance to create your own custom package! We\u2019re calling it Kickstart Your Independence!\nPlease give us your suggested packages below in the comments section of this post. We will pick two new packages to add to our campaign and announce them next week!\nAnd remember - In order to get your Kickstarter Early-Rewards Version of the full tracks from New Constellation - you must be a Project Backer. Read this backers only post for instructions on how to get your download!\nThanks for hanging with us - and happy 4th of July!\nProject Update 5.0\nThanks so much for hanging in there with us while we have been trying to figure out how to distribute the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. If you are a project backer - you can check out the Backers Only Updates section for instructions on how to get your download. \nAnd check out this personal note from Dean!\nThank you again for your support and happy listening!\n- Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean\nProject Update 4.0\nHi Again,\nWe're in the home-stretch! Right now the new record is being mastered (a much more gentle process than the name suggests), whereby the final eq and volume tweaks are made. We're actually on the 2nd round of mastering--it's being \"re-mastered\", which, frankly, makes no sense. There really should be a different name to the whole process. In any event, that's what's happening. We're also having the final touches done on the artwork. We don't know what that process is called, but it must be a bit less diabolical sounding. What this all means is that you'll be able to download the whole album very soon, and as soon as the artwork is finished we'll get to work on printing up the CD, creating the actual physical evidence that we're a band! We're genuinely excited about this album, but more than anything we're sincerely grateful and humbled by the support you've given us-- now and for so many years. From the bottom of our very full hearts, Thank You!\nOh, and one more thing - the single \"New Constellation\" is available for download right now if you have backed the project. Hope you like it.\nAgain, a thousand thanks.\nSincerely,\nToad (Glen, Randy, Todd and Dean)\nProject Update 3.0\nWe made it home from this leg of the tour and are grateful for all of your support - it's really quite overwhelming. Now our goal is to make sure to keep up our end of the bargain to you, so we're hard at work (ok scrambling really) to figure out a way to honor the Kickstarter Early-Rewards Bonus Version of the full tracks from New Constellation. We've been collaborating with the kind folks at Kickstarter to figure out a way to make it work, and ask for a little more time to sort this out. We definitely want to prevent any further SNAFUs with this part of the program.\nAll Kickstarter backers will receive the single \"New Constellation\" this week in a \"backer update\". (Going forward new backers will be able to get the single in the same update).\nThank you again for your incredible support (and patience)!\n- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean\n************\nPROJECT UPDATE! \nHello again! This has been a humbling, wonderful few days. In addition to the Kickstarter launch, we are out in New York this week, playing a handful of shows as well as having the honor of playing at 80th birthday celebration for Willie Nelson. Our bucket lists are getting lots of checkmarks.\nWe have set a new stretch goal of $150K for the Kickstarter campaign. Our initial goal was set around the minimum amount we needed to begin promoting the record, but going further will enable us to do so much more. Publicity, radio and retail promotion, music videos, online promotion and on and on...we're just getting started.\nOnce we reach our stretch goal, we will add a new, in-studio acoustic recording to all contributors of the campaign, to be distributed as a digital download. The concert will be recorded at Revolver studios, where we recorded the New Constellation album. Sound like fun? We think so.\nThank you again from the bottom of our hearts. This is such an exciting start to a new chapter. Please keep spreading the word, and we'll keep chugging ahead on our side.\n- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean\n************\nToad started when Glen was a freshman in high school and met seniors Todd, Randy and Dean through choir and theater. We practiced in our parents' garages, played at dive bars, and recorded two indie records which were inexplicably picked up by the Columbia label. We put out three more records, had some hit singles, toured our asses off and broke up for all the usual reasons in 1998.\nWe've all been making music on our own for a while now, and from time to time would get together for short tours, after which we would quickly scatter again. A couple years ago, something changed. Instead of remembering why we'd broken up, we started remembering why we got together in the first place. We started having fun and feeling like a band again, and that energy on the road led us to want to record a new record. So...we did.\nWe're very proud of what we've created. New Constellation was produced, engineered and mixed by our friend Mikal Blue, and we are releasing it independently. That means no label, so it's our job (and yours as well, if you're willing) to get the word out. We've already invested in the recording and mixing, but this campaign will enable us to finish the art, take a single to radio, shoot videos, manufacture and distribute the album, and hire a team to promote and market the record. It will also allow us to deliver the album early and directly to those who care the most, and provide them with extra songs, cooler artwork, and undying eternal gratitude.\nWe're fortunate to be able to come together and feel like a band again, and we think we've created something worthy of our listeners' expectations. We're also deeply grateful to the people who've stuck with us through the years, letting us know that our music matters to them. So here we are. For those of you who asked for a new record, we've done it. Now we need your involvement. You can use this opportunity just get the record early, or you can go into full Patron Of The Arts mode. Either is a big help.\nThanks again, and be well,\n- Glen, Randy, Todd & Dean\nwww.toadthewetsprocket.com\nhttps://twitter.com/ToadWetSprocket\nhttps://www.facebook.com/toadthewetsprocketmusic\nhttp://instagram.com/toadthewetsprocket", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've had a few friends use crowdsourcing for musical projects, and we hope we have learned something from them about potential pitfalls in launching a record this way. This campaign places us in charge of direct manufacture and distribution for our patrons, and means we need to set up a one-time system to make that happen smoothly and efficiently. Things can go wrong, though. We've seen storms delay shipping, posters where shipping ended up costing more than the cost of the item, lost packages, and a vinyl pressing pushed back 2 months because The Beatles were reissuing on 12\" and the pressing plants couldn't keep up with demand.\n\nWe have a small team helping us put together our plans, and our intent is to make the Kickstarter versions of the physical record something worth holding in your hands. It won't be the same package everyone else can get on the road or at the store. How different...we don't know yet. The art process is just starting. But we know we don't want to disappoint anyone.\n\nWe've tried to create items and offers we know we can provide, but there's no telling what the schedule will be yet, aside from that we want to get stuff out as quickly as we can and at the highest possible quality. We will keep you informed about which offers will be ready when, and let you know the process and the reasons why. \n\nAs for the in-person items, we will fit these in with our tour schedule and do our best to give you an experience worthy of your generosity. We've never done this before, but we'll be creative in working with you to make sure you're satisfied. \n\nMaybe we won't bump into any SNAFU situations, but if we do, we're on your side.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "SURPRISE!
