Fingers resinous with fresh cut white pine, and sacred north star geometries whirling around his brow.Born on April Fools Day, and playing the trickster-bard every day since, he's grown from a potent young Interlochen idealist into a black-bearded surprise-eyed psych-rocker singing the woods and water, souls and soils of the Great Lakes.The tools! He's got a pine-box-full, from his Gretsch (and the chops to play it, mister), to the many iterations of Seth-music. From Airborne or Aquatic, bristling with fuzz-poem arena-anthems, to the autumnal instrumental soundscapes of Ecotone. Or he can roll solo, with a catalog of hundreds of original tunes, thousands of covers and millions of improvisational licks. And the waltzes. By god the waltzes.And more tools: Earthwork Music, Earthwork Harvest Gathering, Title Track, The Clean Water Campaign, (you gotta google this stuff), youth engagement, and partnerships with dozens of local non-profits. Like a true old-school folkie, he plays the songs because they mean something, and that something they mean drives a life beyond just playing songs.His most valuable tool, though, doesn't live in that box: two good ears. Seth listens like a priest. To his audience, to his community, to his deep-rooted intuitive star-born aurora borealis campfire ancestor soul.
