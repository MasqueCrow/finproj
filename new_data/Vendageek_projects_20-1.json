Which is larger, Superior or Supreme? You might know (+1 to your Medicine stat if you do), but you likely have players or DMs who don\u2019t, and with everything else to keep track of while playing D&D, any way to avoid slowing down the battle to hit the Index of the Handbook and hunt down the modifier is a positive for everybody playing. \nThe Healer\u2019s Kit solves all that. Next time the halfling is stepped on by a giant, the dwarf gets surprised by a mimic, or the druid jumps off a cliff for funsies ending up crumpled in gore on the rocks, you\u2019ll be ready. Simply flip the latch on the box, admire the handiwork, select the proper size potion for the occasion, unscrew the cap, and dump the dice onto the opened lid, it\u2019s also a rolling surface! Add the dice numbers and the right modifier (provided on the underside of the lid) to reveal just how many or few Hit Points you\u2019re getting back.\nMy goal here is to provide the easiest to use, most glorious potions for everyone. How is that going to happen?\nBottles that LOOK like potion vials!  Some stylish adornments will be on the bottle but not enough to obscure those handsome dice.\nMatching red d4 dice! It\u2019s actually quite hard to get matching d4s, and you\u2019ll have enough to make any potion with d4 dice you might need.\nProfessional designs. The ones on the prototypes are ok, but Amber (the most excellent artist) will do way, way better than me!\nUnderside of the the lid will be leather, allowing it to double as a dice rolling area!\nThe leather of the rolling area will also have the potion requirements etched in, so you\u2019ll never have to crack a handbook for that info again.\nThe foam holds everything neatly in place and perfectly spaced, making it easy to keep the potions ordered how you like them.\n5 Box finish options: Unfinished - Dark colored etch (great for darker stains), Unfinished - Light brown colored etch (great for lighter colored stains), Natural with clear coat, Colonial Maple, and Sedona Red.\nTwo suede leather color options for rolling area: Brown and Tan OR a Druid Friendly option of Cork Wood\nProduct Pictures\n*NOTE* : Artwork and product isn't final. I have budgeted to pay a professional graphics designer to make amazing artwork for all of this. It will only get better :) . The pictures with corked bottles is the latest. \n  Professional Healers Kit - $80\n    Available Finishings for Pro Kits\n  26 Dice up close\n  Starter Vial - $15\n  Basic Healer's Kit - $25\nBackerKit \nWe will use BackerKit after the campaign ends to let you configure your choices!\nWe've partnered with BackerKit to help ensure you get exactly what you want. With their expert help and great tools, you can feel confident you'll get exactly what you meant to!\nStretch Goals\n$17,500 Stretch Goal - Keychain Colors available as a choice\n  $20,000 Stretch Goal - Matching Dice Tower\n    $30,000 Stretch Goal - Red Mahogany stain with golden artwork\n$17,500 - Unlocked - Keychain color is now a backer choice instead of randomized\n$20,000 - Unlocked- Free matching dice tower for each Pro kit. It will be easily assembled and disassembled and attach to the rolling surface side of the Pro kits. \n$30,000 - UnLocked - New design that works well with gold or silver foil and unlocks an additional, very dark red stain, Red Mahogany. The foil looks awesome, but requires a completely different approach to how the artwork will be made, and is one of the few things that shows up well with the stains that are really dark. \n$40,000 - Unlocked! - 1 new suede leather color! (Update coming soon)\n5,000 vials sold - Locked - Golden Caps for all vials!\nBio\nI\u2019ve always been a geek and enjoyed tabletop gaming, and growing up I had heard about d&d but never was around anybody that was playing. It wasn\u2019t until the Geek & Sundry twitch channel launched that I actually got to see it played. My curiosity drove me to watch Critical Role the first day it was broadcast. As I watched the show over the first few months I eventually put in the effort to find a place to play it myself. I\u2019ve since played in a few adventure league groups and really enjoy the opportunities I get to live in another world with friends, doing outlandish and witty things. My passion just keeps growing for this game and I found a way to contribute to the community.\nProject History\nA Facebook D&D group gave me the idea: labelled glass bottles with the formula and requisite dice for each health potion type in 5th Edition. I ordered the same bottles and remade them myself, getting a more complete idea of how I could improve the labels. The first night\u2019s work boiled down to ramping up the fancy with the stronger potions, having more fun with the filigree, font, and overall presentation. I knew some DMs and players who would want to add this to their toolbox, but wanted to make sure they were ready first.  \nTo help brainstorm further improvements, I enlisted trusted friend Jared Bouck, who already has successful Kickstarters under his belt. We spent weeks going over options for various aspects. Moving away from glass bottles that break during gameplay to source containers that could take a real beating proved a good idea when one of the glass bottles broke during a game. I also wanted the vials to be part of the experience of a session, to help place the players in their character\u2019s shoes during a tense moment where someone\u2019s hit points are down, and the aesthetics of an apothecary is a great match. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a hardy adventurer walking into a shop, seeing a wooden box with beautiful artwork containing potions, and immediately dropping some hard-earned gold to be ready to heal with style at a moment\u2019s notice. Bringing the box and potions into the real world for everyone to see is an extra treat brought to the table.\nWhere are the funds going\nMost of the funds will be going towards raw materials, purchasing the needed equipment to do this at scale, and a budget for artwork. I'll be purchasing a larger laser engraver and creating a small usable workspace in my garage. All the rest will be used to establish myself as a business that can go forward and keep making awesome Dice Bottle kits in the future. \nFollow us on Kicktraq\n  Featured on This is Why I'm Broke\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy largest risk is supplier delays.

They have a magic of their own, but the plague was laying claim to more victims and surpassing the constitutions of the realm's considerable army of clerics. They wore a curious armour into battle with the fiend, and it was with horror that I learned why. The plague was invisible to all, and no spell would uncover it. They were forced to fight this invisible villain knowing that if it landed the smallest of blows against them they themselves would be subject to it\u2019s devious curses. Their armor smiths were overtaxed as any armour that was even touched by the enemy became it\u2019s weapon, and would require all armour to be destroyed if any of it were thought to have been cursed.

Choose any prints you want with our numerous packages. \n My goal as a comic book writer is to write for the big boys, but I've been accused of being \"too pushy\" and \"out there\" with my ideas each time I get in front of them.  \nI always told them I'm not going away, and with your continued support as readers and collectors we continue to be a tiny thorn in the face of corporate comic cliffhanger complacency.\nJoin the Faro Comics Universe, where the readers get to help create the new posters with your passionate and perverse feedback.\nI tell everyone I meet that FARO is the greatest adventure story ever written.  So if you want the chance to call me an arrogant asshole then pick up a copy and tell me I'm wrong.\n I have a body of scars, and scars of bodies in my wake from 20 years of working in the industry of rare and exotic art acquisitions.\nIt has been the greatest and most stressful moments that make for the true nature of the stories you will read from us.\nI hope you love reading it as much as I love writing it.\nThanks for making it this far and always remember,\nIt doesn't matter where you're going,\nIt doesn't matter where you've been, \nAll that matters\nis now.....\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe got this, it's all about deadlines.

He discovers that wanting to help his misbegotten collection of narcissists, militants, sadists, and underachievers is a far cry from actually helping them. Can Pastor Bill get through to them, or will their struggles resurrect his own? Here\u2019s a chance to laugh at other people\u2019s pain. Misery loves company, and this support group has plenty. NOTE: This short has a complete narrative arc (beginning, middle and end) it will also serve as a 'proof of concept' piece for a feature length story with the same cast/characters. You could possibly help make two movies with one pledge. How AWESOME is that?!\nYOUR DONATIONS.\nThanks to Producers, Don Walker and Joe Burns, we have an amazing cast and crew who love this project and are willing to sacrifice in the short term to make it happen. Your pledges will predominantly go to SET DRESSING, COSTUMING, CATERING, and your REWARDS. The key to any movie shoot is FEED your cast and crew and make them LOOK GOOD! On a short, that\u2019s easier, and cheaper to do.\nTHE CAST AND CREW.\nJack E. Curenton (PASTOR BILL).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm2930463/\nJack E. Curenton is an actor and producer, known for Star Wars: Generations (2016) which recently won the SPIRIT of FANDOM award at this years Star Wars Celebration London, Natural Born Filmmakers (2016) and Super 35 (2012).\nPastor Bill battles his own personal demons while trying, in vain, to reach a motley group determined to wallow in their own personal issues.\nVictoria Anne Greenwood (APRIL).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm3892102/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_1\nVictoria Greenwood was born in North Hollywood, California at Valley Presbyterian Hospital, to Sheila Lussier and Marc Greenwood. Her mother is an actress, writer, and documentarian. Her father Marc is a drummer, and the son of country singer songwriter Lee Greenwood.When Victoria was just six month old, she booked her first modeling job. At the age of 5, Victoria appeared in her first television series, \"Days of Our Lives\". Growing up in the industry, she has been trained by various people. Notably so, by casting director, Geno Havens (The Jerk, More American Graffiti, etc...). From 2004-2006 she had a life altering experience, helping her Mother, as a production assistant, on a documentary about the \"Godfather of Soul,\" James Brown, and his Wife, \"Life on the Road with Mr. And Mrs. Brown.\" In 2010 she was awarded Miss Encino USA and competed in Miss California USA. She attended Santa Monica College studying theater, with an emphasis on historical styles, receiving her AA degree. After turning down the option to continue her studies at UC Berkeley, she has been apart of various plays, showcases, and films. APRIL, star of such classics as Mecha Goblin, and Gecko Knight Vs. Pirahna Bear, is Jackie\u2019s negligibly older sister. Her spate of success as a B-movie queen has only further reinforced Jackie\u2019s feelings of inadequacy. It doesn\u2019t help that April is your classic 'button pusher.' She likes to get a rise out of people. While all in good fun, she's viewed by the group as someone who's not taking this too seriously, because she's not. She's only here as \u201cmoral support\u201d for her down and out sister, Jackie.\nAlexa Najera (JACKIE).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm4901064/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_1\nAlexa Najera is an actress, known for Blondie (2014), Five (2011) and Nowhereland (2017). JACKIE, has enjoyed an unremarkable tenure during her three years in Los Angeles. While her sister, April, revels in her rising star status, Jackie was just fired from her sixth crappy job. (Also, as April is more than happy to point out, she hasn't been laid in two years.) It's hard enough finding your way in life, but doing so while living with the most confident woman in the world, who also happens to be your sister, doesn't make it any easier. She's hoping the group helps her find meaning, before April gets them both thrown out.\n\n Marco Garcia-Ballare (FRANK).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm4659907/\nMarco Ballare is known for his work on Gun Woman (2014), A DIsh Best Served (2015) and Tengo Miedo (2011).Marco Ballare is known for his work on Gun Woman (2014), A DIsh Best Served (2015) and Tengo Miedo (2011).\nFrank is a cop with a history of shooting black men. Is he a racist, or just doing his job?

Tieraney, along with her boyfriend Phillip, are here because of a court order. Unfortunately, the court can only mandate her presence, and she remains stoic in her silence. But, this silence speaks volumes. What is this seemingly normal suburbanite behind those stormy eyes.\nVanard Payne (PHILLIP).\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm4785629/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_1\nVanard Payne is an actor, known for OakTowne (2013), What Else Were You Expecting (2012) and Discarded (2013). Tieraney\u2019s long-time boyfriend, and self-styled protector, Phillip is sharp, witty, and well dressed. But, his southern manners hide something more sinister that only Tieraney can bring it to light.\nLogan Davis (DANA).\nLogan Davis is an actress, known for Midnight Snack, Theory of Flying, Cat Poop and Buyer Beware.\nA happy go lucky skater girl, Dana, and her family, attend Pastor Bill's church. Dana, also happens to like girls, but, she\u2019s got better things to do than shout it out from the rooftops. Mistaking her awkward teen shyness for fear, and desperate to \u201csupport\u201d their daughter, Dana\u2019s parents signed her up for Pastor Bill\u2019s group. They hope, with the group\u2019s help, Dana will feel comfortable enough to \u201ccome out of the closet\u201d. But, Dana isn\u2019t really worried about it, until she meets April. After that, all bets may be off.\n\nDon Walker (Producer / Director / Writer)  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4712191/?ref_=fn_nm_nm_22\nDon is a filmmaker living in the South Bay of Southern California with his wife and daughter.

You saw Level 2. Now it's your chance to play Level 3...\nWe have been overwhelmed by the support shown for Level 1, and have taken things to a whole new level (both literally and figuratively) in our most recent episode - moving from zombies in our back yard to creating an alien spaceship in an abandoned power station\nWith Level 3, we won't just step up the production value, but also hugely increase the levels of interactivity. All of our backers will be given an account at RLFPS.com which gives you access to behind the scenes and voting rights in pre-production, and the opportunity to join the community in controlling the interactive live prologue to Level 3. Furthermore, rather than finding players on ChatRoulette, our 50 final players for Level 3 will be randomly selected from our backers! \nWe're crowdfunding here on Kickstarter, and on our own website to raise the funds to create Level 3. Whichever way you choose to support us, the money will go to the same place and you will receive access to the same content and privileges.\nIf you don't want to pledge then just sit back and wait - you'll still be able to watch the Level 3 video on YouTube just like you've watched Levels 1 and 2.\n Level 1\n Level 2\n Since Level 1, all we have heard is \u2018How can I play?\u2019 and \u2018We want to put this on VOD\u2019, but nothing was a good fit. Then it struck us - through crowdfunding we have found a way to keep it on YouTube, keep it free to watch AND allow people to play. So, starting with Level 3, it\u2019s no longer a prank on the internet, it\u2019s no longer random strangers on ChatRoulette - we are going to build a community.\nYour \u00a31 pledge won\u2019t just give you the chance to be chosen to play Level 3, it will also give you access to an account at RLFPS.com where you can become part of our creative community, with exclusive behind the scenes access, and voting rights on pre-production.\nYou\u2019ll get to collectively choose anything from character names, to costume designs, to setpieces - when our props team come up with designs for a new weapon, you will be able to vote on which design goes into production and gets built!\nYou all come together for a massive playable live stream of the prologue to Level 3 - this is where it gets really cool\u2026\nFrom Level 3 onwards we are doing away with the genre-hopping and creating a consistent universe - so you will follow the characters and the plot across multiple levels of the game. The story picks up right where we left off in Level 2 - with you and the other survivor piloting the escape pod.\nThe prologue for Level 3 will be broadcast live, and controlled by the voting of all of our backers simultaneously, just like \u2018Twitch does Pokemon\u2019 - except with the actors reacting live to the results of all of your choices. You\u2019re in charge of staying alive, and trying to find somewhere to land the escape pod - all of your decisions will have repercussions that will echo across Level 3 and way beyond.\nOnce the prologue is finished, it\u2019s time for us to start playing the full level - and instead of going to ChatRoulette this time, we\u2019ll be selecting 50 players, at random, from all of our backers. Each of the chosen players will play through the five chapters of Level 3 - as long as they make it through alive\u2026\nIf you aren\u2019t picked for the full game, you\u2019ll still be able to watch the events unfold. We will be live streaming from the webcam of each player as they face the challenges, but you won\u2019t see what they see - to keep everything spoiler free!\nTo keep the game as interactive as possible each account on RLFPS.com will be granted a number of tokens which can be gifted to a player during their stream - similar to the \u2018sponsors\u2019 in The Hunger Games. If you are rooting for one of the players, or perhaps you even know one of them, gifting them a token when they need it most will give them a game specific boost and help them along.\nIf you choose to donate more than \u00a31, your name will be entered into the hat multiple times, increasing your chances of being chosen to play Level 3, but no matter what your donation amount you will have access to all of the exclusive online content.\nCan't use Kickstarter? Visit our site to pledge via Paypal\n We would love to tell you all about what we have in store for you for level 3 - we\u2019re bursting at the seams to let you in on the surprise - but we\u2019re just not gonna spoil it. Here is what we can say\u2026.\nNo more genre-hopping from zombies to aliens and so on - we now have an opportunity to invite you into a vivid, consistent universe with characters and storylines that span multiple installments. We anticipate that the full game will take up to one hour to complete per player, broken up into shorter chapters, probably five 12 minute sections.\nNow that the end goal isn\u2019t a YouTube viral film, the gameplay can slow right down to give you a chance to really explore the world and your options. There will be a heavy focus on interacting directly with other characters and actors in the game, rather than just talking to the guy in the helmet. If you have a great idea for how to solve a problem, convince them to help you.\nBudget allowing, there will be much more interaction that just voice - there are so many new things being developed here, it will leave Levels 1 and 2 in the dust.\nThe team here are more fired up than they have been in years - and we are ready to deliver a rich, living world for you to explore and interact with. We have the best Artificial Intelligence in the industry - because it\u2019s not artificial - there are a dozen real people reacting to each of your decisions in as you make them.\nUltimately the world we can build for you in Level 3 is determined by the number of backers - but trust us when we say, there is a $10m version of Level 3 that would change the face of gaming. The sky really is the limit, and of course anything we don\u2019t get to do with Level 3 will be carried over to Level 4 and beyond.\nRealm is about breaking the rules, and combining cinematic production value with high-concepts on a low budget.

A wooden bin that allows air flow, and keeps your food up off of the counter or shelf makes an ideal storage container.\n2 tier and 3 tier produce bins\nI had a habit of putting the plastic bags of produce in one corner of the kitchen counter. Aside from trapping the off-gassing, the plastic bags also made it difficult to see what was there. I built a small double basket using some scrap wood, and decided it was appealing enough to make an offering of it.\nOriginal bin, built to fill a need\nMy goal is to raise enough funds to purchase several better quality power tools, so that I can continue with various experimental furniture designs.\nBoth bins are made of Pine or Spruce (the standard \"whitewood\" from local home center), and are unfinished. \nIn addition to produce storage, they are also very useful in closets, bathrooms, and laundry rooms.\nAll sponsor levels include the cost of shipping within the US (the plans will be emailed). For those outside the US, I recommend the plans. The plans are simple enough that if you don't have the tools, you should be able to find a woodworker in your area that can build it cost effectively.\nDIY plans - $4 sponsor\nThe plans will include 6 different variations. In addition to the 2 main designs on this project, you will also receive plans for similar projects using stock lumber sizes, so no ripping of lumber is necessary. Another plan will detail a 4 bin unit, and a final one will be intended for hardwood that can be purchased in small trim sizes.\nEach plan will include a SketchUp file in addition to the PDF diagrams. The SketchUp program is a simple 3D rendering program that has a limited free version available, so you can open the files and rotate around the objects, pull them apart, and make your own modifications.\n2 Tier DIY kit - $27 sponsor\nThe 2 tier DIY kit includes all of the wood pieces needed to build the 2 tier unit, cut to size. You will need clamps, glue, and preferably a brad nailer that can handle 5/8\" brads. Alternatively, if you don't have a brad nailer you could use screws on a couple of the critical pieces, and just glue on the rest.\nKit pieces for the 2 tier bin\nThe kit also includes a simple jig to help with assembly. The jig makes it much easier to get everything assembled square.\nDimensions of the 2 tier bin\n3 Tier DIY kit - $35 sponsor\nThis kit is similar to the 2 tier kit, but with longer legs and the extra pieces for 3 tiers. It also ships unfinished, requires glue, clamps and a brad nailer, and instructions will be emailed.\nJig for assembling DIY bins\nThis kit also includes the assembly jig. The jig makes it much easier to get everything assembled square, as well as mark the legs at the proper points.\nDimensions of the 3 tier bin\n2 Tier Bin - $56 sponsor\nThe 2 tier bin is 13.25\" tall. It is identical to the lower 2 shelves of the triple bin. It ships fully assembled.\n2 Tier Bin\nSponsor price includes shipping in the US.\n3 Tier Bin - $68 sponsor\nThe 3 tier bin measures 21\" tall, 12.75\" wide, and 11.25\" deep.

Take a look at how they react when hit or missed and all of the things that differentiate them from each other.\nThe Grey Lady may be shy, but she's not afraid to stop your roughhousing in its tracks. If this librarian has paid your scenario a visit, she won't go quietly! If you do manage to get her attention, she leaves you only with your thoughts, waiting to cramp your style in the next adventure! The Grey Lady will add a challenge to many scenarios, especially if playing more than one in a single session. \nSandman will include a custom scenario specifically designed for him.\nZombie Taxi Drivers are eager to take the Ecto-1 on a joy ride around town! Once one of them reaches your ride, he immobilizes it until you get rid of him, but not until he sends it speeding off, ghost rider style!\nThe Zombie Taxi Drivers will come with a scenario specifically designed for them. However, they can also be used as Class 1 replacements and companions in base game scenarios. \nNote: When differently named Ghosts share a Class, roll a d6 for each, with the higher roll making an appearance. Impossible Mode versions get +3 to this roll!\nPlayer Cards\nUp to 4 players take on the roles of the Ghostbusters and attempt to return balance between the Spirit World and ours, busting ghosts and sealing the gates from which they\u2019re invading. Completing a scenario requires teamwork, planning, and resourcefulness.  \nMelanie Ortiz keeps a watchful eye on her coworkers, and a closer eye on her targets. Her selfless acts bring her closer to knowing herself, and in turn, in how to deal with the approaching end game of the other worldly intruders.\nJanine\u2019s quick response time is her key attribute at the front desk and as a Ghostbuster! When she spots a newly summoned Ghost, she acts fast, and when she sees a fellow Ghostbuster in a tight situation, she leaps into action!\nKylie thinks things through, to the point where she anticipates what's coming! Her research into the forbidden arts has granted her insight into the dark intentions of her enemies, whose actions seem entirely random to everyone else.\nRon is always trying to prove he has the chops to be a better Ghostbuster, even if that means putting himself in danger. He's no schlub when it comes to tech and the closer he gets to a threat, the more brazen he becomes.\nPeter Venkman is a risk-taker who does his best work in close proximity to ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nRay Stantz excels at removing slime from his fellow Ghostbusters.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nEgon Spengler is a wild man with his proton pack, but learns from his mistakes.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nWinston Zeddemore aids the team by being the best at depositing trapped ghosts.\nIllustrated by Dan Schoening, sculpted by Samuel H. Greenwell\nFeatured ghosts from the movies, cartoons, comics, and toylines have unique abilities as well, in terms of how they move and react to your actions.\nThe game features 3 campaigns, each with 4 unique scenarios. It\u2019s a fast-paced game: each scenario takes approximately 30 intense minutes to play. Every campaign concludes with an epic battle against an iconic boss character.\nThe game uses dice to resolve a lot of the action, so it\u2019s never the same game twice! The three types of dice represent the proton packs and ghost traps, the unpredictable movements of the ghosts, and the chaotic activity of the gates. During each turn, players move, shoot proton streams, deposit trapped ghosts, use unique character abilities, and drive the Ecto-1 to complete objectives. \nEach scenario\u2019s map is constructed using double-sided tiles, featuring street and park imagery by the talented Robb Mommaerts.

The worst has only just begun!\u201d\nGreetings, creepy comic-lovers! My name is Aidan Casserly. Scapula is my creator-owned series; first self-published in 2007, Scapula made the leap to webcomics the following year and has been continuously updated ever since.\nFor the sixth anniversary of the webcomic, I am releasing SCAPULA: WORLD\u2019S WORST VILLAIN, the largest and finest book collection in the series. It is both a perfect introduction to new Scapula readers and a creative highlight to longtime fans.\n ...and it just gets weirder...!\nI wish to produce a larger book-run than any of my previous volumes, with a finer quality printing and more extras to reward everyone\u2019s generosity. The larger book run will allow me to sell SCAPULA: WORLD\u2019S WORST VILLAIN at conventions and bookstores, making the series available to a greater audience than ever before!\nWhat is contained in this villainous volume?\n-The Series: Collecting six complete and sequential storylines of Scapula comics, beginning from the series\u2019 relaunch.

Tony has created a dynamic universe and brought forth over 500 characters to populate the Advent Universe! \nINTERIOR ARTIST:  Pow Rodrix - Pow is a dynamic artist whose beautiful pencils have graced the pages of Justice League, Wolverine, Fist of Justice and Lady Death.  His awesome work on Titan #2 is simply gorgeous and will soon have everyone talking about this book!\nCOLORIST:  Brian \"Tots\" Valeza - Tots is an extremely talented colorist who I have had the pleasure of working with on a few occasions over the years as \"the colorist of choice\" for Jimbo Salgado on a couple of Advent Comics projects.  Tots is a highly respected colorist and a staple on DeviantART with his Totmoartsstudio2 page.  Tots is bringing the art to life with his beautiful colors!\nLETTERER:  Ed Dukeshire -  What can I say about Ed that has not been said hundreds of times before?!  Ed is a top notch letterer who when asked stepped up to participate on this project (for which I am eternally grateful).  Ed has also worked on Hulk, Irredeemable and Sons of Anarchy.

And the only way to stop this demon from taking over is to learn to control the demon and the demon's powers before it's too late.\nThe Summary\nDemon Within in a nut shell is a story explaining what would happen if a person could control a demon who tried to possess their body. It\u2019s about using demon powers like super heroes. Think about it, when people get possessed by demons they do all sort of stuff they naturally can\u2019t do. They levitate, talk in different languages they don\u2019t know, and even pick up heavy objects.\n Demon Within takes the things they can do to another level. Shadow power, fire control power, and animal control power, seducing power, water power, wind power, mind control, invisibility power and a whole lot more.\n The Story\nUltimately the story is about two groups fighting- Demonox (hell) vs. Angelic (heaven); they both want our world (the human world). This is the beginning of the Apocalypse.\u3000 There are two other groups involved in this war. The Church \u2013 who kills both Angelic and Demonox, and The Rebels \u2013 Helps those who don\u2019t want to take sides but are either a Demonox or Angelic.\nThe first volume of Demon Within is of a kid who is discovering he is a Demonox. His name is Mason and he has just turned 18 releasing the demon within him. He now has to learn how to control his demon before his demon controls him.\nThere are other demonox in the world and unfortunately our hero Mason will meet one of them the hard way as he sees his best friend and brother killed before his very eyes making him turn to the demon for help. He does not complete the bond with demon and does not save his brother or his friend but he does injure the demonox responsible named Victor.\nVictor then swears revenge on Mason so he kidnaps Mason's little sister. Now Mason must learn to control the demon within to be able to stop Victor before he loses another sibling.\nThe Reason\nFirst of all thank you for taking the time to show interest in this project. My name is Walter Cromartie Jr. and I love to write stories. I have written over forty or more short stories, all unpublished. I chose to make my stories into comics because comics always seemed like a fun way to express and tell stories.\nAnyway I never was a writer who could explain details very well. So doing comics took all the boring stuff out of writing for me and it left only the fun stuff. There\u2019s nothing like seeing words on paper brought to life through art. This whole adventure has been really fun and exciting.\nSo that leads us to here with Demonox. Demonox is not my first story but it will be the first to become a comic. I chose Demonox because it just was one of the stories that seemed to flow with excitement. It is filled with scary monsters and transformations. It had everything I wanted to see in a comic so I said let\u2019s make it a comic.\nNext I got with a great and experienced Artist named Dan MacKinnon who has been one the most incredible people to work with.\nHe has literally been a mentor to me in this journey. He had just finished a successful Kickstarter for a graphic novel named The Merciful. So I consider myself lucky to have been able to get him to work on this comic for me.\nI also consider myself even luckier to have had such a wonderful Inker and Letterer named Becca T-R who did a more than fantastic job with the Inks and Letters.\n\nMessage From Artist - Dan MacKinnon\nPLAY\n\nThe Big Mission\nI come to Kickstarter to help us finish Demonox.

If we can reach 6325 $ we will be able to color the 7 pages of our Rifts(tm) Erin Tarn as a Girl short story!!!!!!\n1st STRETCH GOAL COMPLETED!!!\nOur 2ND STRETCH GOAL will get us 3 extra pages of story for REQUIEM and JUDA FIST:7 Deaths Of The YOBI. It will allow us to tell a more comprehensive story and give a sneak peak at the direction that the proposed series will take. We 7325 bucks to make this a reality!! LET's Make this happen!!!!\nWe are very excited to be back on Kickstarter drumming up support to help us publish issue number 1 of our comic book anthology IMAGINOS PLUS!!!!!!! \nWhile we are quite diverse in the mediums we choose to work in ( from writing for short films  to pitching scripts and projects for film and TV, and helping others through the pitch building process) we believe that comics, particularly comics anthologies are the natural progression in showing what a story can do in the visual medium. \nAs far back as Gary Reed's Caliber Comics, anthologies and Japanese tankobon (weekly/monthly serialized manga series, for example \"Shonen Jump\") have helped to launch the careers of some of the biggest creators in comics and manga!\nWith the first issue of IMAGINOS PLUS we plan to  continue this legacy by giving visionary voices an opportunity to show their mettle on our projects as well as their own creator owned work. \nImaginos Plus, as planned, will begin as a biannual publication(Spring and Fall). Our first issue has  3 stories at 18 pages, and 4 sketchbook pages showing the ideas from each story at their conceptual stages. We will also have Heroes Unlimited Game Stats for the principle Palladium Books property inspired characters.\nTo be clear, what we are asking for your help to achieve is the publication of our FIRST ISSUE!\nSo let's talk about whats going to be in IMAGINOS PLUS ISSUE 1!!!!!\nThe 1st story in our anthology is the ridiculously funny, over the top,superhero comedy\nwith art by the illustrious team of Dimitris Moore, Brandon C. Clark and Shauna Grant and writing by Imaginos Workshop. \nThere are Superheros and there are THESE GUYS ......\nThe alien police officers Skittles and the diminutive Commander Q, the world-hopping Meta mercenary Siege, the super powerful and woefully disinterested mutant Touch Tone, the morally challenged super-geniuses Volcanus and Magna Red, and ticking time bombs Kid Voltage and Highlighter. Though they genuinely are out to help, this octet has caused enough collateral damage that they have earned the nickname TERRORISTS IN TIGHTS!!!!\nWith classic super-powered action, slapstick antics, satirical,social commentary, serious science fiction,heaping plates of fan service, and just plain wrongness,Candy Coated is to the superhero genre what Reno 911 is to the police \"reality\" show. Part Venture Brothers part EMPOWERED!!!\nI forgot to mention one of the most AWESOME elements of Candy Coated is that it is inspired by the ACTUAL PEN AND PAPER ROLE PLAYING GAMING. The game campaign is played in the Palladium Books Megaversal System known as \nThe unpredictable events of game are so tightly woven into the story fabric that if it happens in the game it will happen in the comic!!!!\nHere is a sneak peek at the first two pages!!\n Next is the Mysterious Sci Fi Fantasy\nbrought to you by the outstanding art team of Cassie Henry,,Gary Mitchell andYlenia Di Nopoli and written and created by Joseph Cain!\nSomething unprecidented occurred at the Graydon Hill Sanatorium and NO ONE REMEMBERS A THING ABOUT IT!!! Add a proxy war between two rival corporations looking for an artifact that could either save or destroy the galaxy and you have REQUIEM. \nAs the battle rages between the shadowy Daikenkai Corporation and the dubiously benevolent Archlight Group for piece of a thousand year old artifact, Archlight decides to field a team of agents to beat their enemies to the prize.\nArchlight agents, code name Athena and Balder recruit the Warwitch Zakia, the sonically powered songstress-in-hiding Violet Gale and the ingenius arms dealer Cain Kardinal, at the behest of the enigmatic Omen, to even the odds against Daikenkai's monstrous minions. \nAs they approach their goal, the agents begin to recall things which reveal the true nature of  what they seek. This forces them  to question whether the artifacts are better left alone.\nThis is part FINAL FANTASY, part X-Files. Oh and did I mentions Space Ninjas and Dragon Elves? I could have sworn I did.....\nHere is a look at the first two pages!!!\n Last, but certainly not least is the Afrofuturistic epic JUDA FIST: 7 Deaths of the Yobi!!! \nFrom the mind of Mark C. Dudley with an art team rounded out by ridiculously talented Ka Xiong and the unique vision of SEAGE. \n\nWe follow Amaru Jones, a man transformed into an alien bio-weapon, who awakens 72 years in the future to a world that is far different,in some respects, than our own.  \nHowever, the more things change the more they stay the same, as ancient conspiracies once again weave their web around Amaru threatening to rob him of any semblance of the life that he has worked so hard to build. \nHere is a look at the almost completed page one!\nPart Judge Dread part Menace to Society and 30 years in the making the story finds Amaru having to choose whether to turn his back on his past, or face it head on to create a future for those that he loves.\nNow let's get a little bit more into the business end of this venture!\nWe have added a cost breakdown for IMAGINOS PLUS, to illustrate how your pledges will be used. \nIf we reach our initial goal we plan to have IMAGINOS PLUS issue 1 ready to ship by March 2014. We will be shipping the non publication prizes starting in early January 2014-March 2014.\n . If we  find ourselves in Stretch Goal territory, then things will really get interesting!!!! We will be working to get 3 extra a piece added to the 2 shortest core stories. We want the fans to be able to experience our FULL VISION for Imaginos Plus, and these extra pages will help us achieve this goal.\nDepending on how well that first stretch goal goes then we have an EXTRA SPECIAL STRETCH GOAL which will involve a never before seen Palladium Books RIFTS RPG introductory comic!!!!\n15 DOLLAR REWARD!!!!!\n\"SILENT WEAPONS FOR QUIET WARS\"\n2013 Imaginos Sketchbook 24 Pages Full Color\n25 DOLLAR REWARD!!!!!  \nExclusive IMAGINOS PLUS 28 by 36 Limited Edition Poster\n50 DOLLAR REWARD!!!!! \nBe a part of the team with your  IMAGINOS WORKSHOP STANDARD CONVENTION T-SHIRT\n 100 DOLLAR REWARD !!!!! \n Exclusive JUDA FIST AMARU TATTOO SHIRT!!!!! \nThis is a limited quantity BLEACH PAINTED T-Shirt depicting the AWESOME tattoo adorning the main character in our comic JUDA FIST: 7 DEATHS OF THE YOBI!!!\n 100 DOLLAR REWARD No 2!!!!!    \nExclusive IMAGINOS MASCOT T-SHIRT depicting our mascot NOS!!\n  We know people have a lot of pressing things to do with their money this time of year but we, the founders of Imaginos Workshop, would like to thank you all in advance for believing in us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter the project gets funded, one of the biggest challenges will be collaborating with our artists to get the comic finished in a timely manor without losing any momentum.They have been very patient with us through the kickstarter process.
