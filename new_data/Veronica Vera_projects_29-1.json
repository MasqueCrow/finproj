[{"backer": "Veronica Vera", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is Petal Crash?\nEasy to learn and rewarding to master, Petal Crash is a brand new puzzle game in the tradition of the arcade action puzzlers of the mid 90s. Like the games that inspired it, Petal Crash features a variety of single player challenges in addition to an intense head-to-head versus mode. The rules are simple - push a block any direction, and it'll keep going until it hits a wall or another block. If it hits a block of the same color, the blocks will burst, sending any other blocks next to them flying! Line them up just right to create huge chain reactions, racking up points and burying your opponents in garbage!\nPetal Crash is a game by Tim Ashley Jenkins, creator of Grapple Force Rena, and features music by Michael Staple and dialogue written by Zack Morrison! If it's successfully funded, the game will be sold by GalaxyTrail, through Steam and the Google Play store!\nThe Game\nPetal Crash features a variety of game modes to suit the tastes and whims of a wide variety of puzzle game fans!\nSolo Play challenges you to score as high as possible within certain limits - Time Trial gives you a few minutes to make as many clears as you can, or Turn Trial challenges you to score well with a limited number of moves. Challenge yourself to set a new personal best and get the highest ranking you can! Each game mode is highly customizable, including a mini board option which is great for beginners, and a turbo mode to meet the needs of the twitchiest action puzzle pros.\nVersus Mode pits you against a CPU opponent or another player, racing to make clears and score hits in a tug-of-war battle. In this mode, building chain reactions will slam your opponent's board with garbage - nasty blocks which can't be pushed, and can only be destroyed by clearing blocks next to them. The rules are simple, but the strategy runs deep - do you make rapid clears to pull ahead, or take the time to set up chains to gain a persistent advantage?\nPuzzle Mode presents you with a pre-set game board, challenging you to meet a specific clear goal with a limited number of moves. Each character has their own 5x5 grid of puzzles for you to solve - start with the easy puzzles in the middle, working your way out to the tough ones at the edges and corners! If those puzzles aren't enough for you, a built-in Puzzle Editor lets you and your friends try to stump each other with puzzles of your own making, condensed into easily-shareable codes!\nStory Mode sees you through choosing one character to challenge each of the others in a series of increasingly difficult Versus matches. Each match is preceded by a dialog scene, and every character's story is unique. Winning a match increases the difficulty, while losing lowers it - challenge yourself to get the intensity as high as you can!\nThe Story\nPetal Crash takes place in the land of Florea, a loosely-connected smattering of city-states where people of many different fantasy races coexist with one another. Though the land is divided, it's said that it was once a united and prosperous country, where the people enjoyed a lasting peace presided over by the seven Sacred Blossoms, relics of great power assembled in the Royal Garden. How Florea came to be divided is lost to history, and the legend of the scattered Sacred Blossoms has turned to myth: whoever finds all seven and returns them to the Royal Garden will receive their heart's true desire.\nEons later, the Sacred Blossoms have each fallen into the hands of a different individual:\nLilibri is a fairy who works as an independent scholar and historian, and keeps her own library - she bears the Sacred Blossom Lily, found in a hollowed out old journal, which she now keeps in a scroll case slung over her shoulder. She is cheerful and passionate about her work, if occasionally a little bit scatter-brained.\nStrelitz is a tiefling child and self-made delinquent who constantly strives to live up to his demonic heritage, in contrast to his laid-back tiefling parents. He holds the Sacred Blossom Bird of Paradise, his village's treasure, which he swiped for his own purposes.\nPenny & Deony are human twins who live on their own, practicing their trade as tailors. Not knowing their birth parents, they were left on a seamstress's doorstep along with the Sacred Blossom Peony. The energetic sister Penny has an eye for business and fashion, always trying promotional stunts to attract customers, while the demure brother Deony has great talent and patience for sewing, but is fairly shy and withdrawn.\nOre Kid is a free spirited dwarven treasure hunter who discovered the Sacred Blossom Orchid locked away in an abandoned mine. Unlike other dwarves, who tend to be insular and community-focused, Ore Kid is an independent wanderer, following her whims and little else. (Despite her name, she's actually a young adult - Ore Kid is a nickname which stuck.)\nDaize is a beastkin freelancer who ekes out a precious living, doing odd jobs in a city-state with a sharp wealth divide ruled by an aloof gentry class. His lapel pin is the Sacred Blossom Daisy, which he won in a bet. Despite suffering constant indignities, he always keeps a smile and hopes for the best, and is quick to help others in need.\nYosoti is a legendary centaur dancer, the latest in a long line of performers - all of whom shared the name Yosoti and wore the Sacred Blossom Forget-me-not during their performances. Confident and kind-hearted, Yosoti is adept at capturing eyes and hearts, but secretly harbors complicated feelings about their legacy.\nRosalia is an elven knight who gave an arm and an eye to protect a human kingdom. Though she was rewarded the Sacred Blossom Rose for her bravery, the kingdom she served slowly dissolved over the centuries, and is now a mere footnote in history, leaving her to contemplate her purpose alone.\nThe game's story mode will see your choice of character seeking out the rest of the Sacred Blossoms so that they might receive their wish, meeting and challenging each of the other characters in turn. The dialogue is all written by Zack Morrison, author of the webcomic Paranatural and various other short stories - check out their work! It's good!!\nFunding Goal\nPetal Crash is already very far along, with many of the modes fully playable! But it needs a bit of help to make it across the finish line.\nMusic - 50%: The biggest portion of the funding goal will be to commission music - the soundtrack is set to be composed by Michael Staple, who worked on Grapple Force Rena, along with other great indie game projects - check out his work here!\nOther Collaborators - 20%: This includes things like Zack Morrison's incredible character writing, Ruby T.'s gorgeous cover art, and funds to reward my puzzle-proffering pals for contributing to the game's built-in puzzle boards! (Special thanks to my pals Taxiderby, Will, Strife, Jill, and Heather for helping make example puzzles!)\nRewards & Buffer Zone - 15%: This includes the funds needed to print and ship the Kickstarter rewards - any money left over in this segment will help account for unforeseen costs and help support the game's development overall.\nFees - 15%: This includes Kickstarter's cut and other fees and taxes.\nStretch Goals\nNow that the project is funded, it's time to look forward - that means stretch goals! We hit the first few, and there's a couple more we can still reach!\n$10,000 - Unlockable Bonus Character - REACHED!\nIf we reach $10,000, I'll be able to put in the work needed to get an extra character put into the game - this character can appear in Story Mode as an opponent under special circumstances, and once unlocked (either by encountering and defeating them or by clearing the Story Mode with all other characters) can play through their own Story Mode quest as well!\n$11,500 - Extra Stickers by kokuhaku - REACHED!\nThe wonderful artist who drew my current profile picture, kokuhaku (who is @kokuuhakuu on Twitter) has offered to draw all the characters for a new sticker sheet!\nStill a work in progress, but they're looking good!\nIf we reach the $11,500 level, an extra sticker sheet featuring these adorable new drawings will be added for everyone who backed at the $40 level or higher!\n$13,000 - Mac & iOS Compatibility  - REACHED!\nIf the campaign raises $13,000, I'll have the resources I need to get my hands on all the hardware and licensing required to publish the game for Mac systems and for iOS devices via the App Store!\n$14,500 - More Music\nThe music budget currently accounts for a minimum of 15 tracks across the entire OST - if we hit $14,500, I can increase the music budget, bringing the number of tracks up to 20! This will mean more variety in the background music among the different game modes!\n$16,000 - Play as Penny or Deony individually\nIn the Story mode, Penny & Deony will always act together as one - but if we reach this goal, you'll have the option of playing as just Penny or Deony separately in the other modes, like Solo Play & Versus Mode! Each twin will be selectable individually as alternate costumes, getting their own set of unique animations for when they're on their own. This means two more playable characters!\n$30,000 - Nintendo Switch port\nThis lofty goal would remove the funding obstacle to a Nintendo Switch version - it's a long shot, but if there's a chance, might as well shoot for the stars!\nRewards\nIf you're up to help get Petal Crash ready to play, there's lots in store to reward your contributions! In addition to getting game codes for both the PC and mobile versions of Petal Crash, you can also get:\nEarly Access! The game's already in a perfectly playable state, and if you pledge $25 or more, you'll be invited to the game's closed beta to play the in-progress version of the game as it's being worked on! There's already tons to do, and you'll be in the best place to get your feedback and suggestions heard!\nPhysical goodies, including an 11\" x 17\" poster and a sticker sheet! The poster features all the game's characters in a sky-sea of blocks, and is drawn by the wonderfully talented Ruby T.! The sticker sheet features each character's portrait and a wide smattering of colorful flower blocks you can use to decorate to your heart's content!\nPledge even more and there's lots more rewards - including an original sketch of the Petal Crash character of your choice, an animated sprite cameo in the game's credits, and even the chance to have your own secret character playable in the game!\nThank you so much for visiting and reading - with your help, let's make a beautiful new game blossom together!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFinishing the game is mostly a matter of getting assets done at this point - music, writing, character animations, backgrounds, puzzles, etc. - the base gameplay itself is basically finished and is a blast to play, so I have every reason to believe things will go smoothly!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Pre-order", "descp": "You'll get codes for both the PC and mobile versions of Petal Crash on release!\nINCLUDES:\nPC game code\nAndroid game code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["117 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "You get the game, and you'll be featured in the game's credits as a backer!\nINCLUDES:\nPC game code\nAndroid game code\nName in credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["136 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Closed Beta Access", "descp": "You'll be able to play the in-progress version of the game, starting shortly after the campaign concludes!

This is the highest funding goal we've yet set for a campaign and has been driven by the ambitious scope of our book. A considerable amount of this budget is allocated to clearing rights for our roster of featured games with Japanese rights holders. In addition, we will be translating the entire book into Japanese for approval by SEGA, which is a significant product cost. \n*All designs shown are not final and are subject to approval by SEGA*\nProduction artwork for Jet Set Radio\nMusic\nAs with all previous Read-Only Memory productions, the music featured in our pitch video was created by the brilliant Andy Lemon.

Since we started making videogame documentary books in 2012, we've learnt a huge amount about creating and producing high end publications. This puts us in a great position for this project, and we'll be looking to use our experience to push for the very best results in our final product.\n\nWith this being our fifth book, and having gone through the very same development process with Sega before, we foresee a smooth production.

Pledge over $70 and you'll get all of our book PDFs included! \nAlso free international shipping for rewards over $100!\nShort Version\nSince 2011, Melissa Albino [nalem] and Michael Spanier [spanio] have created over 500 pages of their webcomic, Lighter than Heir. The comic tells the story of a cocky young woman who struggles with her comrades and herself to make a name for herself and become the greatest soldier who ever lived. Back in 2014, 168 really generous people helped bring the first nine chapters of her journey to print. Now, it\u2019s time to bring the second part of her adventure to print in a brand new full color paperback, but it\u2019s gonna require your help!\nLong Version\nWith boot camp behind her, the cocksure and kinda famous Zeppelin Von Schultheiss knows her first assignment as a border patrol soldier is going to be a breeze. Steinbech is the greatest country in the world, and those no good Zamorans are always trying to sneak in to purchase medicine or work their jobs. What a bunch of jerks!\nLuckily, since she\u2019s the daughter of a volant war hero, Zeppelin inherited his ability to fly! What better way to keep the borders secure than from the air? But when a mishap threatens the already tenuous relationship of the two countries, Zeppelin will have to leave the safety of her home behind on a harrowing journey into enemy territory. Since she\u2019ll have to stand up to dangerous villains and confront her own demons to make it back it alive, it\u2019s a good thing famous people never die.\nRight?\n(Zeppelin\u2019s adventures begin here!)\n Volume Two of Lighter than Heir will contain Chapters 10-18 (245 pages!) of the comic with revised art and a never before seen book-exclusive bonus chapter wherein our heroes take a break from their mission for some much needed rest and relaxation!\nMatching the presentation of our first book, Lighter than Heir Volume Two will be presented in full color! That includes chapters 10-12, which will be appearing in color for the first time!\nIf this Kickstarter is funded, this volume of Lighter than Heir will be printed in a 280 page, full color, 6\u201d x 9\u201d paperback book! But printing a full color book of this size can be very expensive! That\u2019s why we need your help! For your pledge, we\u2019re offering special rewards to entice your generosity!\n All backers who contribute at least one dollar will receive a digital wallpaper featuring brand new original artwork! And you\u2019ll be invited to vote for the thumbnail sketch you want produced!\nThe wallpaper is included with all the rewards!\n At the $10 tier, backers will receive a PDF digital copy of the full color Lighter than Heir: Volume Two!

Shenmue defied all convention and created the genre that later came to be known as \"open world.\"  An unparalleled level of freedom let you chose how you wanted to play.\nFirst of its kind realism, an immersive story, and not to mention, the birth of the QTE , made Shenmue a one-of-a-kind experience and an instant classic. \nShenmue 3 is the true sequel to the classic open world action RPG games, Shenmue and Shenmue 2.

Together, we can make a Shenmue that surpasses even the originals!\n Area Stretch Goal Explanation \nWhere we left off... Ryo Hazuki has made his way to China in search of his father\u2019s killer. There he meets a new travelling companion, Shenhua, and learns of a legend from her village that has foretold their path together. \nThe story continues as Ryo and Shenhua start off on a new journey that will take them farther into enemy territory, deeper into mystery, and ever closer to their destiny. \nWill the mystery of the mirrors be revealed? How is Ryo\u2019s father connected to all of this? Will Ryo track down the Chi You Men cartel and face Lan Di in a final showdown?\nSince the release of Shenmue 2, now 14 years ago, I have been greeted by the passionate outpouring of dedicated fans and Shenmue community members wherever I go. They all want to know one thing: \"When will Shenmue 3 be coming out?\" With the advent of games using Kickstarter during these past few years, the new and now frequent demand from the fans has been, \u201cDo a Kickstarter for Shenmue 3!\u201d \nIf Shenmue 3 was going to get made, I wanted to make it with the fans. Through Kickstarter, I knew that could happen. Together, with Shenmue fans everywhere, I knew we could build the game that the series deserves.\nIf we do not reach our funding goal, Shenmue 3 will not go forward. I know that the goal of making Shenmue 3 with the fans, and seeing Shenmue in the hands of gamers all around the world is a lofty one. We are balancing our ambitions for a grand sequel with the pragmatic realities of developing a game of this scale. It will not be easy, but I have dreamed of making this sequel for 14 years \u2013 it is time to bring Shenmue back! And to make it come true, it will need the love and support from each and every one of you!\nSo please join us in making Shenmue 3 \u2013 let us grow our community and build a new, exciting Shenmue experience!\nRyo - On a journey to avenge his father.\nShenhua - Raised among the forests of China.\nLan Di - Coldblooded boss of the shadowy Chi You Men.\nNiao Sun - Deadly siren of the Chi You Men\nA pioneer in gaming entertainment for over three decades, He has cemented a place in history for his visionary work.

After learning of Kickstarter, I knew it would be possible to get Shenmue 3 started. Wanting to make the best game possible, I also knew that I would have to look to more traditional means to obtain all the funds that would be needed to create the game I had envisioned. \nI can say that with their assistance on the production and marketing end, and in Sony\u2019s case with some publishing support as well, Ys Net is able to use more of the money we collect through Kickstarter purely for Shenmue 3\u2019s development. It is also important to note that your funds are going strictly to Ys Net for development of Shenmue 3 \u2013 Sony and Shibuya Productions are not seeing a cent of your Kickstarter dollars.\n- Yu Suzuki", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk and challenge are two words that have been with Shenmue 3 for the past 14 years. In fact, Shenmue has always been about risk and challenge. This time will be no different. \n\nThe real challenge now is to deliver a sequel that we will all be satisfied with after 14 years of waiting. After much research and planning, we set the funding goal at this level believing it will make possible a fulfilling Shenmue experience.\n\nWith regards to development of the game, we have an experienced team, deeply connected with the Shenmue franchise. With modern tools, experienced professionals, and the community of Shenmue by our sides, we have set ourselves up for success.\n\nWe will do our absolute best to deliver Shenmue 3 and the rewards by their respective deadlines. However, there is always the possibility that problems may arise which could affect reward delivery. There may end up being changes in game or reward designs. We may press right when we are supposed to press left and get hilariously head butted and kneed in the groin. \n\nIn these situations, the whole Shenmue 3 team promises to keep you updated and informed on the game development and reward delivery progress. We are all very excited, ambitious, and optimistic that we have prepared well, and are ready for the challenges that are ahead of us.\n\nRyo and Shenhua are not out of the woods yet, so we ask for your ongoing support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #134", "update_userinfo": "Steam Activation Walkthrough & Version Update Notice", "update_content": "\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\u306f\u3053\u3061\u3089\n\nHello Everyone,\nSteam codes are almost ready and will be available soon through your survey.

I crowd-funded the first book with PayPal back in 2010 and the second book here on Kickstarter in 2012.\nYou could also say gastrophobia is the fear of being eaten, an issue all fantasy adventurers have to deal with.\nCheck out my reviews on io9 and Comics Alliance!\nPhobia's life goal is to be the best at winning. The way she figures it, she only needs 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert, but she's a little preoccupied.\nHer slave/boyfriend, Klepto, has been repossessed by the government, her 8-year-old son is furious because she never mentioned his father was an evil wizard, her time-cop daughter from the future keeps trying to interfere with her life, a quack of a surgeon wants to turn her into a mermaid, and a shape-shifting monster from deep within the Earth's crust either wants to be her best friend or kill her (or both).\nAll in all, this is an entirely accurate historical documentary about Ancient Greece.\nThis kickstarted book will be the same dimensions as the previous kickstarted book, but with 64 more pages! 160 numbered pages in all, printed in glorious black and orange ink (just like Greek pottery!) on cream-colored paper.\nFull-color cover with matte finish plus spot gloss!\nLovely patterned inside cover!\n8 fantastic self-contained stories, not counting the introduction & closing chapters!\n\"Educational\" sphinx comics!\nActivity pages?!\nPretty Purple Eyes!\nRed blood is red!\nDRM-free pdf of Gastrophobia book 3!\nLike to read comics but don't own a bookshelf?\nWe have a solution.\nGet all three books as DRM-free pdfs!\nA good level for a newcomer!\nTry to read all of the books in one sitting!\nGet the book!\nGastrophobia vol. 3: Best at Winning; Worst at Love in print!\nThis is probably the one you're looking for!\nComes with a vinyl sticker and a bookmark!\nGet the book! --SIGNED & SKETCHED IN!\nGastrophobia vol. 3: Best at Winning; Worst at Love in print, signed with a drawing of the character of your choice!\nFor those who like a personal touch.\nComes with a vinyl sticker and a bookmark!\nSame as the last, but with buttons!\nGastrophobia vol. 3: Best at Winning; Worst at Love in print with a drawing of the character of your choice, plus five cool 1\" buttons including one printed using 24k gold foil!\nStick 'em on your backpack!

At least once every two weeks, a new course will go up, and you'll be able to freely jump between courses with \"next\" and \"previous\" buttons on the website - it's like a webcomic you can play!\nPlay right in your browser - no download needed!\nBest of all, the game will be completely free! You'll be able to share Grapple Force Rena with your friends, who can play it right in their browser on nearly any device (even iOS and Android tablets and phones) thanks to the magic of Construct 2, powered by HTML5!\nGet advice from helpful friends!\nPledge your support, and you can join the Grapple Force Club and gain access to the downloadable version! Play in full screen, save your rankings and high scores, and play the newest course early - and best of all, give Grapple Force Rena the support to become even better! If you only have $5 to give, though, that's all right - you'll still get credited as a backer, and get the downloadable game once it's finished.\nGrab those bad guys and toss 'em around!\nBut you don't have to wait to try the game yourself - you can play the first three courses on the website now!\nFunded!\nThank you so much!\nAs of July 31st, 2014, Rena reached its $7000 funding goal! Thanks to a wealth of generous backers (including one David James Turton, who funded over a third of the project singlehandedly), Rena has guaranteed its creation from start to finish, free for everyone to enjoy!\nHaving exceeded the goal by over $1000, and with the promise of a future donation by a lapsed high-level backer, Grapple Force Rena met three stretch goals, guaranteeing an Android version, 5 more courses for the complete game, and monthly wallpapers for Grapple Force Club members! Thank you all so much for your support!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPLAY\n\nWith your support, I'll be able to devote the time and resources to promise that Grapple Force Rena updates frequently and reliably until it reaches its end. I've already spent months living off savings to develop the game full time, and your support will allow me to recoup the money spent on software licensing, keep up with web hosting costs, pay my collaborators, support myself while I make the game, and perhaps even bring the game to more platforms or bring in more talent.\nJust because the game is going to be free to play in your browser doesn't mean that there's nothing to offer those willing to show their support! If you pledge $20 or more, not only will you get the backer credit, finished game, and soundtrack, you'll get lifetime enrollment in the exclusive Grapple Force Club!\nThe primary benefit of the Grapple Force Club is that you get access to the continually updated downloadable version of the game. While free users can only play the game in their browser on the Grapple Force Rena website, club members will be able to play the game full screen, run the game more smoothly on older hardware, save their high scores and rankings, and best of all, get early access to new courses when they're released. Other things may be given to Grapple Force Club members in the future as well, like exclusive wallpapers or other members-only material. But it doesn't stop there!\nPledge $30 or more and you'll also get the game's official soundtrack, courtesy of Nonplayable Records! The soundtrack will include all of the music in the game, as well as remixes and arrangements of the game's music. And since this is a serialized game, the music will be coming out in volumes - all of which you'll be able to enjoy without paying any extra!\nThose who pledge $40 or more will get a full color 18\" x 24\" Grapple Force Rena poster! And there are even more rewards beyond this - you can become a part of the game, getting the opportunity to make a cameo, help design your own course, or even make a boss character!\nGrapple Force Rena definitely shows its heritage in the 2D action platformers that inspired it, but it has a uniqueness all its own. The serial nature of the game's development and distribution is unusual, with particular advantages and disadvantages, and I hope that my journey through this strange way of delivering a long, narrative game like Grapple Force Rena will help me learn more about the format's unique advantages and challenges, and pave the way for similar projects from other creative game-making folks. I fully intend to write extensively about my experiences making this kind of game, as well as sharing various tips and tricks I've learned along the way.\nI hope you'll join me on my journey to tell Rena's story from start to finish!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can see for yourself, the game is already underway, and you can play the first two courses right now. I've been very, very careful not to promise anything that I would be unable to deliver - the existing content should be proof enough that I have the skill, knowledge, and will to deliver a complete game.\n\nSince this game is largely a solo project, the responsibility lays solely on me to complete it - if anything happens to me, such as a health emergency of some kind, it could forestall development of the game. I don't have any prior history of medical problems, however, so this is hopefully pretty unlikely.\n\nMy living situation is stable and relatively low cost - I'm sharing a condo with two others, and I don't own a vehicle, nor do I have any conditions or habits that require expensive upkeep, so I can live for a very long time off of relatively little money. The amount I have asked for takes this into account. That being said, if some kind of unprecedented expensive emergency occurs, I might have to take some time away from Grapple Force Rena to find other work, which may mean less frequent updates than promised.\n\nFortunately, these are both nightmare scenarios that don't have much chance of happening - if I receive the amount of funding that I've asked for, I'm very confident that I will be able to deliver a complete game within the time frame I've established - that is, at least 25 courses, with a course released every two weeks. While I'm going to do my very best to keep to my promised update schedule, which is generous enough to allow time to build a \"buffer\" of updates, I can't realistically promise that I will be able to deliver an update on time every single time, simply because I don't have complete control over all the variables involved - one of my collaborators might miss a deadline, or life could simply get in the way in one of innumerable ways.

This has also involved performance optimization, such as a few changes designed to take full advantage of Construct 2's new , improving performance on big levels.

The following Spring, he created a Kickstarter project for a complete collection of the series, and it ended up being a fairly early example of a successful webcomic-related Kickstarter. Neat, huh?\nFollowing that, he spent quite some time deciding just what to do with himself. And to be quite honest, this quest has yet to finish, but nonetheless he did manage to begin a new webcomic on July 2012.\n You Suck opens with a frustrated gal named Anna, who wants nothing more than a bit of \"spice\" in her life. During a movie date, she makes attempts to get her current boyfriend to roll with her, but he just can't handle the pressure, and runs off.\nAfter the movie, it doesn't take long to discover where here beau wandered off to. To her surprise, she finds him engaged in outdoor sex... with a willowy succubus!\nNeedless to say, she breaks up with him... and as bizarre as the whole experience was, this was... as they say... only the beginning. You see, the succubus ended up feeling awful about what she did, and took it upon herself to help Anna out in any way she could.\nThe succubus who came to be known as Izobel may be a bit of a klutz, she doesn't know how or why she ended up in our world, and she speaks no earthly language, but she nonetheless proves to be pretty good at helping Anna live out whatever various perverted fantasies she has. With this, an interesting friendship forms.\nHaving run the popular adult paysite Slipshine since 2001, Josh L has made it a life goal to help provide the internet with comics that are unique and sex-positive, with You Suck being his latest solo effort to do so. It is a day-to-day, slice-of-life story with some sexy twists intended to be enjoyed by everyone ages 18 to 139.\nTHE BOOK\nThe You Suck book will be printed in a square format, size 11\"x11\", and in color so the comics match the look on the website as close as possible. It shall include chapters 1 through 4 (200 comics total) as well as the three bonus \"You Suck IAP\" stories originally published on Slipshine.\nAnd perhaps more things will be added, if this Kickstarter does well enough!\nOne upgrade that will come with the book by default is a remastering of the early comics:\nThe early You Suck comics have pretty shaky art. This wasn't entirely due to my skills; it was mostly because I intentionally drew the early comics very, very, very, very fast. This was not originally intended to be a series I would put a lot of effort into. Of course, that ended up changing in the long run.\nI'll simply be re-inking the first twenty comics and relettering the first 31 comics. There won't be any changes to the layouts or designs of the characters, no changes in the dialogue, nothing like that. It'll simply be a further cleaning up of the original comics, to bring them more in line with the rest of the series.\nA little more about the rewards...\nI suppose it's a little moot to describe the commission rewards at this point in time, sine they're all taken, but regardless...\nThe sketch card tier will include a pencil sketch of the backer's choice on a 2.5\"x3.5\" bristol card (please excuse the slight size error in the description on the right)\nThe digital commission will include a color character commission fairly similar to the drawing of Anna & Izzy at the top of this page. The backer will get a 400dpi print-sized PNG of the commission.\nThere's also the recently-added limited print! And here is what it looks like:\nThe print features Anna & Izzy (and a few other You Suck friends) spending some quality time with the bats at the Congress Bridge in Austin! Limited to a run of 20, signed & numbered, sized 16\"x9\".\nFinally, there's the Girly book collection\nThis is a completely complete collection of my previous webcomic Girly. A very fine collection indeed, that originally went on sale right here at Kickstarter! It normally costs $100 and rarely goes on sale. Normally you have to see me at a convention to get a priced-down version of the book, but now you can drop $100 to got both it and the new You Suck book... a very fine discount indeed!\nThat about does it for the rewards...\nNow... should the funding go better than planned...\nwhy yes, there are stretch goals, of course!\nSTRETCH #1 - $8500: The Guest comics\nYou Suck has already had some pretty nice guest comics throughout it short existence. If this goal is hit, I'll include them in the book and use the stretch money to pay each artist for their contribution!\nSTRETCH #2 - $10000+: BONUS COMICS\nIf this project somehow makes this much money, I shall be pleased to add extra comics to the book that are 100% exclusive.

Let's see how it goes!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe usual risks that come with backing a webcomic-related books tend to involve printer disputes and postage pricing issues. Learning from other Kickstarters in the past, I've included a decent buffer in the goal amount to help alleviate this.\n\nAlong with that, one comic in the book still needs to be finished, and sometimes my productivity in such things varies.

Four BRAND NEW reward tiers have been added!\n---------\nSTRETCH GOALS!\n------\nShort Version\nMelissa Albino[nalem] and spanio have spent nearly three years producing the webcomic, Lighter than Heir. The comic follows the story of a young girl who's trapped in her famous war hero father\u2019s shadow. Being the cocky girl she is, she joins the military in hopes to replace his name in the history books. That task deems difficult as she must face new hardships such as basic training, enemies, and the turmoil of her own emotions. The comic was originally in bluescale on the internet, but with your help, we plan to bring the comic to print in a BEAUTIFUL 6\"x9\" full color paperback book with revised art, book exclusive comics, and bonus goodies available no where else! But only until April 5th 12AM EST!\nLong Version\nThe famous Zeppelin Von Schultheiss is tired of living in the shadow of her father. So what if he was a war hero\u2026 there\u2019ll be other wars! And who cares if everyone loves him? Love is for people without true ambition! And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big deal that he could fly. I mean\u2026 well okay, that was kind of a big deal. But Zeppelin can fly too! And unlike her beloved war hero father, she isn't dead.\nSo join Zeppelin on her personal quest for praise and glory\u2026 or just sit back and get on with the praising and ...glory-ing. Because military boot camp is going to be a cakewalk for someone this headstrong and arrogant.\nRight?\n(Start reading here to find out!)\n Lighter than Heir Volume One will contain the first SIX chapters (224 pages!) of the comic with revised art and a never before seen bonus epilogue chapter detailing the final days of basic training.\nSupplemental materials planned include early character sketches and rare behind the scenes insights.  \nAnd for the first time ever, Lighter than Heir Volume One will be presented in full color!  \nIf this Kickstarter is funded, Lighter than Heir will be printed in a 250 page, full color, 6\"x9\u201d paperback book!  \nBut printing a full color book of this size can be very expensive! That\u2019s why we need your help!\nFor your pledge, we\u2019re offering special rewards that will enrich your life!

So with your help, we\u2019ll be able to dedicate 100% of our time to completing the art revisions and coloring on the remainder of Volume One before the end of the summer. \nThe primary challenge that comes with a project like this is the actual manufacturing of the books.

Amazing!\nThank you all so much, backers! I've added some bonuses for everyone for pushing it past the original goal. [March 18th: lucky $5555 is unlocked!]\nWhat's all this about? What's Band Vs. Band?\nIt's an ongoing comics series about rival bands! It's pretty goofy and lighthearted and retro-inspired, and it is full to the brim with femmy aesthetics and characters who are either LGBTQ or unconventional or (most likely) both. There's one comic page that sets up the premise and introduces the characters here!\n(NOTE: It's not for kids \u2014 it's done in a cute style and has no swearing or frontal nudity, but it actually is full of adult themes. I'd say this is for teenagers and older.)\nI've been posting it online since November 2010, and now I want to do a print collection. I've always fantasized about having these comics in print \u2014 I'm a graphic designer with some print & publication design background, and that's always influenced the look of the comic. I want to make it a really sweet book that suits the style, and feels like something special and cohesive beyond just a paper collection of comics you can read online.\nThe book's vital stats: 7x10\", 150 pages, full color (kinda!), perfect-bound softcover, offset printing.\nCan I read the comic online? How is it different in print?\nDefinitely! It's free to read online at bvbcomix.com.\nThe print version will collect all the comics up until November 2013 (and clean them up a bit \u2014 mostly refining some of the lettering and correcting errors), plus some extra content. I've got it planned as 150 page book where around 130 pages are those comics, and the other 20 are split between fun bonus content, and the other miscellaneous innards of the book like intro pages, titles, copyright, thank yous, and etc. (Why is it \"around\" 130 pages, and not nailed down yet? That's because there are a few really nonstandard pages that I'm still deciding what to do with re: size and placement, and in some cases whether to include them or not.)\nTwo totally out of order sample pages!\nWhere do things stand right now? What's the timeline?\nThe timeline is definite: I want to have these books for VanCAF 2014 at the end of May. I've done my homework: I've spent the past month and a half getting book printing / shipping quotes (comparing at least a dozen printers on three different continents!) and looking at options about different paper stocks and finishes and etc. I think I've settled on exactly the specs I'm doing, and the printer I want to use \u2014 and it's in Canada, which I feel good about! Some international options are cheaper overall, but this means a quicker turnaround, no unexpected problems with borders and customs and overseas shipping, and everything's closer if we run into an issue.\nTo get my books in mid-May, I need to have the files sent off in mid-April. That means a few marathon weeks of finishing it up if the Kickstarter's successfully funded in March - but I can do it! I've been working on it bit by bit all along, and the bulk of the content already exists. The extra work I'm doing is a clean-up sweep through the older comics for lettering issues and minor errors, designing/drawing the covers and some artwork for the bonus pages, and laying out the rest of the book insides.\n(Money timeline: I did read the fine print that it can take a couple of weeks for the Kickstarter money to get transferred, and I DO have an emergency plan to keep it on track if it's funded but it turns out I need to pay the printer before this money shows up in my account.)\nWhat happens if it doesn't get funded?\nI get sad, you guys don't get your rewards, and I'll have to change my plans. I'd probably still offer up a couple of the reward things for sale, but we'd have to go through the hassle of another round of orders from a different online storefront. The work I've already done on the book won't be totally wasted, since I would still want to get it printed at some point - but I don't know when that would be. This feels like the moment to make it happen!\n\nShipping is included in all reward pricing!\nI'm sending this out from Canada, and I've looked up the rates for sending an object roughly the size and weight of this book from here...and the conclusion was that whether it's across Canada, to the USA, or farther, it's pretty much always going to be between $12-20 to ship it, averaging about $15. And yeah, a significant percentage of the cost is shipping if you're just getting one book \u2014 so hey, why not pick up some of the other stuff, too? The shipping cost I added is the same for all the combos (except for the sticker/etc pack without a book - that's lower, because it'll be really light).\nDo I still need to pay for shipping if I live in Vancouver?\nI hear you. I can't really change the pricing, since it's all fixed, but I've got a deal for you. If you live in the Vancouver area, and, instead of having your stuff shipped you want to come pick it up from me at a Cloudscape Comics meeting (Wednesday nights, open to the public), I'll throw in some extras of the small stuff like stickers and postcards to make up for it. If you ordered that too: you get more!\nMoney details\nThe $3000 goal isn't the total amount to cover everything associated with this (printing books, producing rewards, shipping, taxes, miscellaneous expenses) - it's a portion. It's roughly half. I've got the rest covered - it's not an *easy* commitment for me, but it's covered. I decided that it wouldn't be reasonable to ask for everything to be covered up-front with Kickstarter, and reaching it would be unlikely. Kickstarter is all or nothing, so it makes more sense to me to set a goal that seems possible so this has more of a chance of happening. I want this book to happen! I want you to have it! It's important to me on the same kind of level as what someone with different priorities might personally spend on, say, a used car or a trip...and making this investment in it now will leave me with an inventory of books (and some of the other stuff) for the immediate future. This is still a lot of money to ask for, with no guarantee we'll reach it - so please, yes, I need your help.\nIf it goes over the goal: I will be OVER THE MOON thrilled, and add some stretch goals to sweeten the deal for all backers!\nNote: All of this is in Canadian dollars.\nWill any of this be available to buy online later?\nNO GUARANTEE, so get it now!\nCan I get multiple copies of the book?\nYes! Just put in an extra $22 for each one.\nCan I get multiple rewards that aren't in the same tier?\nSure, unless it's a limited thing that's already gone. Just put in enough cash for everything, and let me know what you want. If one of them's limited, choose that one officially.\nIf you want something that seems more complicated (like combining multiple limited things, or combining multiple tiers that come with a book but you only need one book), and want to know how it's stack up re: pricing and shipping, contact me.\nMore detail about some of the rewards\nSticker sheets: I've always wanted to produce something like this, like the stickers you remember having as a kid! High-quality vinyl stickers -  each sheet is 4x6\" with a bunch of different shapes to peel off.\nDolls: These lovable little pals are made of soft felt and stuffed with fluff, sewn together with the details glued on. They're between 5 and 6 inches high when they're sitting, and between 7 and 8 inches long head-to-toe lying flat. Note: These are totally not the work of a professional dollmaker, and I'm no sewing expert. They're just made with love and enthusiasm by this comics artist who only sews sometimes.\nThese are pretty limited, and unlikely to be available again in the future. There are a couple of reward tiers where you can get Honey and Turpentine as shown above, and a couple (even more limited) spaces to get a different Band Vs. Band character made in the same series.\n Paper bands: (the above photo was a test mockup to make sure they stood - the actual pieces will be produced with better print and edge quality) These guys are made of cardstock, and they stand around 4.5 inches high (which varies a little with the height of the character). The clothes aren't removable like paper dolls, but the instruments and accessories are \u2014 which means mix-and-match fun between characters!

Based on the strength of that book, we were invited by SEGA to pitch a title covering an aspect of their history. Being a die-hard Mega Drive/Genesis player from the age of 11, I leapt at the chance to create a book that would encapsulate everything that made that console so unique \u2013 the stylish hardware, the absorbing Hollywood-inspired atmosphere of the games, and most memorably, the bold and irreverent way that SEGA chose to market the console here in the West. \nWe are looking to publish the book as part of the two-year-long anniversary of the console's release (1988 in Japan, 1989 in North America and 1990 in Europe). We started research in early 2013, and are now full steam ahead on the project. The interviews, essay and photography are now largely complete, and we have already collated a huge amount of archive material, ready to be distributed across the book\u2019s 300 or so pages. \nSega Mega Drive/Genesis Rejected Controller Design\nSEGA Mega Drive/Genesis: Collected Works will be equal parts lush \u2018coffee table\u2019 art book and incisive history document, combining the highest values in graphic design, production and journalism. As a die-hard fan myself, I\u2019m dedicated to making this a truly covetable object for every SEGA fan.\nThe Contents\nArchive & Artwork\nWe are working closely with SEGA Corporation on every aspect of the book. They have provided us unprecedented access to their archives, where we have already uncovered an unbelievable number of hidden treasures \u2013 including detailed technical drawings of the Mega Drive/Genesis console, a range of alternative controller designs, a collection of stunning character paintings for The Super Shinobi/Revenge of Shinobi and pencil and marker storyboards for Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage. \nWe have also secured the rights to reproduce images from the hard-to-find, Japan-only SEGA Video Game Illustrations book, published in 1994 and now out of print. More recently we\u2019ve been working with ex-SEGA of America team members who have provided beautiful production art from games such as Eternal Champions, Vectorman and Comix Zone. Finally, we have also unearthed material from the personal archives of a number of original Japanese developers. My aim is to gather the very best material into one hefty but affordable volume. \nFrom hand-drawn sketches right through to meticulously-presented in-game artwork, the book will catalogue the incredible visual history of SEGA\u2019s best-loved franchises, including:\nAfter Burner, Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle, Alien Storm, Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage, Beast King\u2019s Chronicle/Altered Beast, Bonanza Bros., Comix Zone, Cyber Brawl/Cosmic Carnage, DecapAttack, Dynamite Headdy, Ecco the Dolphin, ESWAT, Eternal Champions, Flicky, Golden Axe, Gunstar Heroes, Super Hang-On, Kid Chameleon, Knuckles Chaotix, Landstalker, Metal Head, Phantasy Star, Puyo Puyo/Dr. Robotnik\u2019s Mean Bean Machine, Rent-A-Hero, Ristar the Shooting Star/Ristar, Shadow Dancer, Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic & Knuckles, Sonic 3D, Space Harrier, The Super Shinobi/Revenge of Shinobi, Tempo, ToeJam & Earl, Vectorman, Virtua Racing, Wonder Boy and more ...\nBare Knuckle/Streets of Rage end sequence storyboards\nHardware\nFor the first time in print, we will be unveiling the original Mega Drive/Genesis console manufacturing plans, plucked from the SEGA archive in Japan, as well as design documents and original concept renderings for alternative versions of the now-iconic controller. Paired with this will be a stunning collection of specially-commissioned photographs of key Mega Drive/Genesis hardware by renowned still life photographer John Short. Highlights from this section will include the Nomad, Multi Mega, Activator, Mega Jet and one of the most coveted rarities: the first-party Wondermega.\nThe Activator, Nomad, Multi-Mega and Genesis/Sega CD Model 2 (\u00a9 John Short)\nInterviews\nWe have had the privilege to conduct in-depth interviews with more than 20 legendary SEGA designers, programmers, composers and creatives, many of whom are being interviewed for the very first time. The interviews \u2013 conducted by award-winning games writer Keith Stuart \u2013 provide a fascinating glimpse into the influences, processes and ideas behind many the console\u2019s most important games.\nOur interviewees include:\nNaoto Oshima, Game Designer: Sonic the Hedgehog\nYu Suzuki, Game Designer: Space Harrier, OutRun, After Burner, Virtua Racing, Virtua Fighter\nMakoto Uchida, Planner: Altered Beast, Golden Axe, Alien Storm\nYuji Naka, Game Designer: Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic & Knuckles \nMasami Ishikawa, Product Designer: Mega Drive/Genesis hardware \nMitsushige Shiraiwa, Product Designer: Mega Drive/Genesis outer casing\nTomohiro Kondo, Planner: Shadow Dancer\nYuzo Koshiro, Sound Designer: The Super Shinobi/Revenge of Shinobi, Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage\nAkira Nishino, Planning Director: Ristar the Shooting Star/Ristar\nKan Naito, Programmer: Shining Force\nKazuyuki Hoshino, Art Director: Knuckles Chaotix\nKeisuke Tsukahara, Sound Designer: Shadow Dancer, Alien Storm (arcade)\nKotaro Hayashida, Game Designer: Alex Kidd, Space Harrier II \nManabu Kusunoki, Graphic Designer: Bonanza Bros.\nNaohiro Warama (credited as Taro Shizuoka), Designer: Revenge of Shinobi/The Super Shinobi\nNoriyoshi Ohba, Director: The Super Shinobi/Revenge of Shinobi, Bare Knuckle/Streets of Rage\nRyuichi Nishizawa, Director: Wonder Boy\nKoji Tsuchida, Director: Shadow Squadron/Stellar Assault\nTomoyuki Ito, Director: The Super Shinobi II/Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master\nToru Yoshida, Designer: Phantasy Star II, IV\nTombo Arikawa, Designer: Rent A Hero\nRyutaro Nonaka, Planner: Metal Head\nNaofumi Hataya, Sound Designer: Golden Axe II, Virtua Racing Deluxe\nVarious Logo Paintings\nForeword and Essay\nThe book will open with a foreword by legendary game developer Dave Perry (Earthworm Jim, Aladdin, The Terminator) and be followed by an insightful and pacy 10,000-word piece by Keith Stuart telling the story of what made this console such a global success. You\u2019ll hear first-hand accounts from the big players who made it all happen: Michael Katz discusses what drove their provocative and unforgettable \u201cGenesis does what Nintendon\u2019t\u201d marketing campaign, Trip Hawkins reveals how instrumental Electronic Arts were in SEGA\u2019s US success and Al Nilsen recounts the moment he realised that Sonic the Hedgehog could become SEGA's killer app. In addition to this core narrative, experts from the fields of code, artwork and music will chime in, recounting just what went into making games for the Mega Drive/Genesis.\nEditions & Tiers\nAs a thank you for supporting the project, everyone pledging for THE BOOK on Kickstarter will see their name printed in it as a Benefactor, which will appear in all editions from here on in.

This luxurious edition will feature an exclusive design, and the the book and folio will together slot into a slipcase. \nA note on postage: We have strived to keep postage costs at as low a level as we possibly could for international backers, so you are not shelling out a fortune to receive a copy to your front door!

As numbered, high-value items, Special Editions will be shipped using a tracked courier service to ensure they reach you safely. \nOur Goal\nOur goal facilitates the production of a truly special object. As well as printing the book to an extremely high standard, it covers two fantastic translators interpreting Keith\u2019s interviews between English and Japanese (and back again), our photographer John Short creating the ultimate hardware product shots, our author/interviewer Keith Stuart\u2019s (award-winning) time and skills, indexing, copy-editing, and of course our licensing agreement with SEGA. \nRead-Only Memory\nRead-Only Memory (www.readonlymemory.vg) was started by myself \u2013 a graphic designer and art director based in London, UK \u2013 and born out of a combined love of video games and graphic design. Its publishing aims to recognise the titles, pioneers and milestones that have shaped the industry, and pay homage to the craft of game making. Our first title, Sensible Software 1986\u20131999 was born on Kickstarter in October 2012.

The advantage of being financed in this way though \u2013 by SEGA fans all over the world \u2013 is that it allows us to instantly share progress and ask questions of you. During our last Kickstarter, I was constantly reshaping the contents of the book as I went along based on comments and requests from backers, and I really hope to build another intimate and excited community of backers this time around.\n\nThis is an ambitious project, but having successfully delivered a Kickstarter-funded documentary/art book on gaming history in the past few months (Sensible Software 1986\u20131999) I feel that I am well-positioned to make good of it. I\u2019ve learnt a tremendous amount about researching, designing, editing and printing a high-production book in the past year and feel battle-ready to launch into Read-Only Memory\u2019s second volume.\n\nOur first book has been very well-received \u2013 with tremendously positive reviews from backers and the press alike \u2013 which places welcome pressure on myself and Read-Only Memory as a company to build on what we\u2019ve started. Although just a company of two people, we are focussed on becoming the best video game history publisher around, and we\u2019re fired up to make SEGA Mega Drive/Genesis: Collected Works the next step towards that goal.\n\nThe other notable challenges I face are ensuring that the book is as good as it possibly can be and keeping the project on schedule \u2013 two factors which undoubtedly pull in opposing directions! I\u2019m confident to say that the project has been realistically scheduled and given that I face fewer \u2018unknowns\u2019 this second time around, the most likely cause of any delay will be down to us all trying to squeeze the best of each page.

Over 1,400 backers. Over 400% of the original $ target. \nMore importantly, this project has connected us with each other in amazing ways. I've never experienced the artist-audience bond in quite this way before. I've asked, you've responded; you've asked, I've responded. We've made it all up as we've gone along. We've pulled in friends from around the country and around the globe. We've had a good laugh, and cheered, and supported friends and strangers alike. We've helped each other's dreams come true. \nAnd the journey's far from over\u2014over the next several months I'll be giving you the best in me in various ways. I hope that it's worthy of all the generosity you've shown.\nThank you. \nOnward!\nVT\nUPDATE: ONE FINAL STRETCH GOAL\nTaking a page from Carsie Blanton's book, here's an idea for some Kickstarter final-hours fun: \nIf we reach either 1,400 backers or $80,000 (whichever comes first), I'll perform in ALL of the following countries in 2014: \nCanada (Toronto + Vancouver, possibly other cities)\nSingapore\nThe Philippines\nTaiwan\nChina\nJapan \n\n...plus Australia, where one $5K backer already has me traveling.\n\nLove,\nVT \n\n[NOTE: I've never booked any gigs in Asia before, so I don't yet know what sorts of challenges are involved. I'll definitely visit each of the above countries, and I'll definitely sing my songs somewhere\u2014maybe in a music venue, maybe as a free house concert. Or both.] \n\n\nUPDATE: 1K, 1.1K and 1.2K STRETCH GOALS ACHIEVED!\nWow.\nThank you, thank you, thank you.\nCan you still back the project? Of course.\nShould you? Well, here's what some folks have been saying about the backer updates:\n\"That was the best and most entertaining Kickstarter update I've ever seen.\"\n\"I am enjoying your extras so much I just quadrupled my pledge. I'm glad this project is not only raising money but also helping you explore your creativity too.\"\n\"I know this is for backers only, but once the campaign is over, this is too good not to share with the rest of the world.\"\nPledging $1 gets you all backer updates\u2014past, present & future. Join us!\nLove,\nVT\nUPDATE: STRETCH GOALS!\nAs I say in the pitch video up there, money isn't actually the main reason I'm on Kickstarter.\nI'm doing this because I love what it means to crowdfund a project. We're celebrating the power of creating things together. Of pitching in to help turn an idea into a reality. And we're welcoming everyone to the table, whether you have $1 or $5,000 to spare, whether you live down the street or across the world.\nSo I've set some stretch goals for the final days of this campaign\u2014measured not in dollars, but by how many people join us. Even $1 pledges count. And I need your help to get the word out.\nHere's what will happen if we get to...\n**ACHIEVED** 1,000 backers: We'll make a behind-the-scenes documentary of the Level Up music video!\n**ACHIEVED** 1,100 backers: We'll make an Aims tour trio live-in-studio performance video.\n**ACHIEVED** 1,200 backers: We'll design a commemorative graphic of the Kickstarter campaign that you can print on anything you want (t-shirt, poster, coffee mug, etc). Plus\u2014data geek alert!\u2014we'll survey backers with fun questions and release an anonymized dataset of the whole campaign.\nAlso: new and replenished rewards!\n$150+: Email feedback on your own work\n$200+: Care package from me with handwritten note\n$300+: Cover song of your choice (send me a message to be notified when these go live\u2014they'll go as quickly as the first batch!)\n$5,000+: Spend a day with me! \nSpread the word. Let's do this.\nLove,\nVT\n***\nHOLY MOLY. 100% funded in under 5 hours. 200% funded in less than a week. I am stunned and humbled. THANK YOU.\nWhere will the extra funds go? I'm still thinking carefully about stretch goals. A fun additional project might materialize, but your generosity might be best served simply by our making this music video\u2014and your experience of this Kickstarter campaign\u2014as good as we possibly can.\nFor now: we're definitely going to make the video even more awesome (professional choreographer and dancers! sets with moving parts!), and additional funds will go toward paying off album recording costs\u2014which I've been paying out of my own savings and lines of credit, so I'm incredibly grateful for this outpouring of support.\nThank you for the life you give me.\nLove,\nVT\n***\nHello music lover! \nI just finished my new album, Aims. It comes out on September 24. I had a fine time wrangling global events and personal demons into these dense little pop songs, and I can't wait to share them with you. (In fact you can already check out some of the music here.)\nThere's one song in particular that I really want you to experience in visual form. It's called Level Up\u2014it's the opening track of the album, and it sets the stage for everything that follows. And I know there's an audience for this: the last time I put out a music video, it got over half a million views on YouTube.\nMaking a video for Level Up is an artistic endeavor, just like the album, but unlike Aims, I can't sell copies of the video to earn back the expenses of creating it. Which means it's a perfect fit for Kickstarter\u2014for asking you to help make it happen.\nWHO'S THE DIRECTOR THIS TIME?\nI'm thrilled to be collaborating with Lawrence Chen, whose work is thought-provoking, full of multilayered stories, and strikingly beautiful...exactly the qualities I strive for when I make music. If you haven't seen his videos for Alex Wong's \"Oceanside\" or Delta Rae's \"Bottom of the River,\" please stop reading now and go watch them. I'll wait.\nSee, wasn't that worth it? So, so good.\nLawrence and I have been brainstorming for several months now, and we already have a complete concept, storyline and shooting schedule. All we need is your support to give it the final green light.\nWHY A $20,000 MUSIC VIDEO? WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?\nWe want to make something that will stand on its own\u2014a work of art that you'll want to explore over and over again. (Lawrence and I are both big Michel Gondry fans, as it turns out.) Building a world like that requires equipment, space, materials, permits. Most of all, it requires a team of talented creative people, and we want to pay them fairly for their work. Our budget is super-modest by record label standards, but it'll allow us to realize our vision without cutting any corners, and it won't require any professionals to donate their time.\nHere's the breakdown of estimated costs:\nPre-Production: $2,500\nCrew: $3,500\nLocations: $3,250\nProps: $1,800\nLogistics: $1,250\nTravel & Transportation: $500\nTalent: $750\nCameras & Lighting: $2,150\nVisual Effects: $1,200\nEditing: $2,300\nColor: $800\nFor the math-savvy among you: yes, that's exactly $20,000, and doesn't account for Kickstarter's (well-deserved) 5% cut or credit card fees. I'm ready to put in my own money to cover those costs\u2014but with your help, we can spread the word and exceed our fundraising goal!\nWHAT DO I GET FOR BACKING THE PROJECT?\nI'll be sending out updates throughout the campaign and the journey to the finished product: photos from on set, phone-camera videos, maybe the occasional hand-drawn infographic. We'll be kicking off the Aims tour soon, so you'll get updates from rehearsal and general thoughts about the album too.\nYou can become a backer and receive updates for as little as $1. A $5 pledge gets you a download link to a recording of Level Up as soon as the campaign ends, complete with lyrics and background notes. Beyond that there are lots of one-of-a-kind items (Polaroids from the set, custom cover songs, phone calls from tour), and you can pre-order Aims in various formats as a way of supporting this project. Check out detailed descriptions of all the reward levels below. If you start getting choice overload, may we suggest:\n$15 (new pledge level!)

It can be used on iPad, iPhone and Android devices.  Update: Thanks to achieving stretch goals it will now be available in your web browser on Windows and Mac, and also as an app on Windows 8 and Windows Phone.\n3D Virtual Tabletop is about recreating the physical experience of using miniatures or tokens on a map.\nOther virtual tabletops today look nothing like this simulation. They leave your poor character defined by what the top of their head looks like. What's more exciting? A full-body view where you can see a character's pose as they stand up to fight and stare down their enemies! Don't you want to see the ogre or dragon towering above your party, so that you can more fully experience what they'e going through?\nNow, for the first time ever, you can use a virtual tabletop that looks and feels like the real thing.\nPlay games like Pathfinder, Dungeons & Dragons, Savage Worlds, Rolemaster Classic, Castles & Crusades or Call of Cthulhu. Maps and miniature portraits are easy to add from anywhere, even for use with BattleTech or other tactical combat games.\nWhat makes 3D Virtual Tabletop special?\nFAITHFUL AND IMMERSIVE VISUALS\nThe first thing that puts 3D Virtual Tabletop ahead of the pack is its faithful visual representation of the physical items on the tabletop, be it an RPG map or a board game layout. The virtual miniatures look almost exactly like the real \"pawn\" style minis, a piece of printed card slotted into a plastic base.\nSUPER-INTUITIVE 3D NAVIGATION\nIt's really easy to zoom in and out and manipulate the map to see it from any angle, from top-down to over your character's shoulder. Using the intuitive touchscreen to rotate, pivot and zoom makes navigating a dream.\nNATIVE ON MOBILE\n3D Virtual Tabletop improves on all the existing alternatives as a native mobile app. This allows it to look amazing and incorporate the touchscreen. Because it's running on your tablet or mobile, it doesn't hide you from your friends around the table and takes up much less space - more room for snacks!\nWhat have you done already?\nA basic version of 3D Virtual Tabletop is already available, that works standalone on a single device.\nHere's a brief walkthrough of that version:\nCurrent features include:\nImport your own maps and miniatures from photos on the device.\nSet the size of a miniature when you import it.\nPinch-to-zoom on the map to get an overview or focus close in on the action.\nView the tabletop from any angle, from top-down to over your character's shoulder.\nMinis change to a flat token when viewed from above.\n\nYou can get it on the Apple App Store for iPhone and iPad, Google Play for Android and the Amazon Appstore for Kindle Fire and other Android devices. You can also check out an online demo that runs in your browser: 3D Virtual Tabletop Online Demo\nWhat will be included in the new release funded by Kickstarter?\nCROSS-PLATFORM SHARING. Share the tabletop in real-time with other devices, including between iOS and Android.\nCUSTOMISED ACCOUNTS. Log in (with Google+) so that your own maps and minis that you bring in will be available on all of your devices.\nSQUARE AND HEX-GRID COMPATIBLE.

You can let other gamers like you know by using the links below.\nI use this product in my own weekly Pathfinder game so I want to see it become more capable too!\nThanks to fanatical support from the community we have lit up many of our stretch goals already.  From the latest survey we have a whole new set of stretch goals, and we're almost at the next one.  Look below the map for a brief summary of each goal.\nOh no! While striding down the Hall of the Sword lighting up the braziers for the stretch goals, we have triggered a magical trap and been teleported into a labyrinth!\nHelp us run through the maze as fast as possible to light the stretch goals so that we can escape and enter back into the Hall of the Sword.\nAfter lighting up all the braziers of the stretch goals to reach the end of the Hall of the Sword, it's time to head down the path to the tavern to celebrate.\nBack at the tavern after our hard won victory. It's time to have a drink and tell tall tales that the minstrels will repeat across the land to let everyone know what we have accomplished.\nStretch Goal Details\nAutomatic Miniature Numbering:  When you add more than one miniature of the same type on the map, it will have a number displayed with it so everyone knows which one you're hitting.\nSilhouette Shape for Miniature Card:  When you use a transparent PNG image or have a white background, instead of the shape of the card being a rounded rectangle, it will be a rough outline of the silhouette of the creature.  Your character really will look like they are standing there. Update: This has been partially implemented since unlocking the goal, as you can see in the video.\nMap and Miniature Searching and Organizing:  Search and sort your maps and miniatures to easily find the one you're after. If you pick the Battalion or Colossus levels, you'll more than 300 minis to look through. With Folders and/or tagging, whether playing different genres, or looking for something specific, you can rapidly select the one you want without interrupting play.\nLoading and Saving of Scenarios / Encounters:  Save how your session ended so you can get started right away next time. Prepare an encounter and load it in an instant to keep the momentum of play going at your table. This also works well if you run multiple games, you can pick up where you left off for each one separately.\nHidden Miniatures: Lay out your dastardly foes on the map, but keep them hidden so the player's don't know their characters are walking into an ambush. Useful for friends or foes that are invisible/hiding/plane shifting or just to increase suspense.\nZoom Map and Grid When Importing: This will make it very easy to get the map set up exactly how you want it, no more fiddling around, or importing the same map 3 times to get it set up the way you want. Super convenient pinch-to-zoom when importing maps, for both the map and the grid squares. Getting everything lined up pixel perfect will be a breeze.\nCondition Markers: Whether your character is poisoned, bloodied, stunned or whatever else may befall them, always be aware of their condition with a status marker on their miniature. Each status marker will have the name of the condition as well as a distinct color to let you quickly assess how much trouble they're in.\nGuest Accounts: You don't have to get your whole gaming group to sign up all at once. Work around that one person in your group that never pays for anything, no matter how many hours they spend playing the game. When you create a game for others to join, you'll get 1 free guest spot so that a person without a subscription can connect to the tabletop on your device. You can also pay for extra guest accounts that anyone else can use to connect to your virtual tabletop, and when you join someone else's game, these extra guest accounts that you paid for will add to the guest account \"pool\" which anyone else can use to join that game. A chance for your friends to try it out to find out for themselves how awesome 3D Virtual Tabletop really is.  \nWeb Browser Based: Enjoy the wonderful view of 3D Virtual Tabletop on your Windows PC or Mac through your web browser. Like the online demo which is currently available, it will use the Unity Web Player plugin so you get to experience all the graphical goodness. Both mouse and touch input will be supported so you'll be equally at home on a desktop or lounging around with a touchscreen laptop or tablet.\nGoblin Camp Map: From the amazing artists at Lord Zsezse Works, a highly detailed map of a goblin camp hidden away in the forest. Pledge at the Battalion Plus level or higher and get this added to your collection inside the app. See the update about this map for more information and a close-up look at some of the features in the map.\nAchtung! Cthulhu: Fresh off their massively successful 2,000% funded Kickstarter, Modiphius Entertainment are offering a selection of their terrifying Cthulhu Mythos creatures and dramatic maps to committed backers. Even if you don\u2019t want to lead a team of heroic investigators behind enemy lines, you can still use the creatures in a game of any genre where you need horrific monsters, and you\u2019ll have 3 more mysterious locations to explore, a Nazi underground outpost, a Nazi base and an Elder Thing Outpost! Back at the Battalion Plus level or above to make these available to you in the app. They will also be supplying a wider range of map and minis in the in-app marketplace.\nLine of Sight and 3D Terrain: After walls and doors have been quickly laid down, you will only be able to see the parts of the map that your character can see. As you move your mini around, the new parts of the map that your character can see will become visible automatically. This will also include an optional a fog of war or permissions based movement to prevent players from sweeping their miniatures across the map to reveal the whole thing. The 3D Terrain will start out with 1 default set, primarily for marking visibility. You'll be able to hide it and have it still block sight, if it doesn't match your setting. Other environments and genres will be added over time.\nHex Grid: Set up the hex grid for a map when importing it, including pinch-to-zoom for both the grid and map to get them aligned in seconds. You'll also have the option to snap to the hex grid during play and a grid overlay which you can turn on and off that will work with a map of any color.\nRangefinding: (Expanded descriptions for these labyrinth stretch goals coming soon)\nGroup Movement\nRuler When Dragging Miniatures Without Grid\nEdit Imported Maps & Miniatures\nCount Squares/Hexes When Moving\nMiniature Naming\nUndo Miniature Movement\nGlowing Miniatures in Different Colors\nElevations for Flying Miniatures\nTrack if a Miniature Has Been Moved\nSnap Miniature Orientation to Grid\nClear All Miniatures\nDice Rolling: Beautiful 3D dice roll in front of your eyes before settling on the number that determines your fate.  With this initial dice goal you will have the 6 standard dice sizes that you would normally get in a set: 20, 12, 10, 8, 6 & 4 and the ability to roll multiple dice of each type.  For those playing around a real table with the visceral experience of physical dice, this feature will be unobtrusive enough or concealable to keep the virtual tabletop viewing area clean and clear.\nMap Creation with Map Tiles: Rather than using entire maps, you can import or purchase map tiles and lay down them down next to each other on the tabletop to create your own map.  They'll conveniently snap to the grid so that they line up perfectly and you'll be able to rotate them, also snapping to the grid orientation, to create the twists and turns that you need for your scenario.\nGoogle+ Hangout Integration: Have 3D Virtual Tabletop work seamlessly in a Google+ Hangout with the convenient text, audio and voice chat that it offers. This is not just useful for the web browser version because when you\u2019re on a smartphone or a tablet you can run a Google+ Hangout in the background and still have audio chat while you\u2019re playing with 3D Virtual Tabletop. You can also do text chat if you switch back to the Hangouts app, and even start up the video chat again if you need it, this time while 3D Virtual Tabletop is running in the background. This means you can still get good use out of Google+ Hangouts if everyone is on a different device, some on a laptop or desktop and others on a phone or tablet.\nArea Effect for Spells etc: Overlay a shape on the map to indicate the area of effect of a spell, trap or similar.  Several shapes will be included by default such as square, rectangle, cone and sphere.  The shapes will also have alternate versions that are aligned to and formatted with square and hex grids in mind so that you know exactly which square or hex is effected.  You'll also be able to color them appropriately to identify effects that have a long duration and will be on the map for a while. \nCustom Dice: Adds the d2 (coin) and ability to create dice with your own text or images on each face.  Great for FATE.\nSpecial Backer Offer: This backer bonus for reaching the end of the Hall of the Sword has two components, the Altar and the Sword.\nThe Altar. A place to play, five maps made available for you in 3D Virtual Tabletop from two of the most well known third party publishers for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game.\nFrog God Games is supplying one of the maps from Rappan Athuk, the classic mega-dungeon which they updated for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game and Swords and Wizardry rules.  It's a good old-fashioned, First Edition dungeon crawl that this map lets you get your feet wet with.  One of their core promises is that \"Our maps will be outstanding\" and you can see what they mean with The Mouth of Doom.  The map is the property of Frog God Games, all rights reserved.\nLegendary Games is providing all four of the maps from their Cold Mountain Adventure Path Plug-In, which is ideally suited for the Kingmaker Adventure Path.  Inside the app you'll find a river ford map for the Ansit Ford encounter, a forest trail for the Bloody Victim encounter, a small village map for representing Gloym and a waterfall map for the Falls of Istria.  You can find out more about how these locations are used by buying their PDF.\nAll you need to do to add these maps to your collection in 3D Virtual Tabletop is to back at the Battalion Plus level or higher. \nThe Sword.  Companions to take with you, as thanks for making this Kickstarter so successful, the price of the Immortal Guest add-on is now reduced from $99 to $50 each, so that you'll always have someone there to watch your back.\nInitiative / Turn Tracking:  Cycle through and show your current place in a small list of the visible miniatures on the table, highlighting and focusing on each one when it's their turn.  Drag miniatures along this list to set their new position in the order.  You can leave this feature turned off and it will remain hidden if you don't need it.\nStat Tracking for Hit Points etc:  Count up or down, with the value displayed publicly or kept private.  Set up multiple color coded trackers of any numeric values to show the vital information for your game at a glance.  It'll only show the trackers that you set up so you won't even see them if you don't want to use them.  When counting down you'll be able to show a visual indicator for % remaining.\nRound / Turn Counter with Timing Reminder for Effects: Is the lamp oil still burning? How many rounds has your summoned creature got left? Answer all these questions and more with a counter that increments every round. You'll also be able to link the counter with areas of effect on the map and conditions on miniatures, giving each one a duration that will trigger a reminder to dismiss it. Know exactly when and what you're dealing with.\nLong Miniatures: Miniature bases that are longer than they are wide for things like motorcycles and horses. The miniature image will be used for left/right rather than front/back.\nColored Bases: For quick identification of different factions, change the color of the ground they stand on.\nMiniature Notes: Free-form text notes for each miniature that you can use to keep track of anything, no matter what the game type, game system or house rules you choose. They can be either private or visible to all players.\nMap Annotations: Add text, arrows and other markers to the map to let the whole table know what's going on and exactly where its happening.\nThree Full PDF Adventures & Maps from Adventure-A-Week: Back at the Battalion Plus level or higher and get the maps inside 3D Virtual Tabletop and the full PDFs for the adventures shown below.\nSharing of Handouts\nWindows 8 and Windows Phone Version + 10 Miniatures: Includes Windows RT.  Even if you don't use Windows, there's something in this stretch goal for you, 10 extra fantasy miniatures from the One Monk Miniatures line by Mayhem in Paper.  All you need to do to make these available for you in the app is to pledge at the Battalion Plus level or higher.  Below is a picture of what their real-world counterparts look like.\n3D Props Like Tables & Chests\nImport Maps & Miniatures from PDFs\nFull 3D Miniatures\nSet Miniature Background / Border Color\nDifferent Image for Miniature Back Face\nMini-Tiles for Terrain Features Like Pit Traps etc\nLock in Top-Down View\nCard Decks\nEvery Single Stretch Goal Has Been Unlocked\nWill it be available on Windows, Mac, Linux or online in a web browser?\nBeing built on Unity means that 3D Virtual Tabletop can be brought to these other platforms, and more. There is, however, a significant amount of native integration work required for each new platform, to enable things like importing your own maps and minis so easily. The initial goal is for iPad, iPhone and Android.  Update: Thanks to achieving stretch goals it will now be available in your web browser on Windows and Mac, and also as an app on Windows 8 and Windows Phone.\nIf you want it to be available on another platform, spread the word about this campaign to as many people as you can, so that we raise enough money to exceed the initial goal and can start talking about stretch goals. Drum up enough support for the platform of your choice and it may end up as a stretch goal!\nWhy does this need funding?\n3D Virtual Tabletop has been created using the free version of the Unity development platform. New features such as sharing the tabletop with other devices have been implemented using a trial version of Unity PRO. This lets me test the app but I cannot release it yet. Publishing the app to make it available to you requires a full license of Unity Pro, with the iOS Pro and Android Pro add-ons.\nI need to raise $5,000 minimum to have enough to buy the full licenses and release the latest version of 3D Virtual Tabletop, so that you can use it in your games.\nFunds raised over this amount will contribute to additional developments to the product. If it all goes well, we'll release more features as higher amounts are reached.\nWhat Will It Cost in the Future?\nTo make it as easy as possible for you to use, with a smooth network experience, everything is run through a central server. The cost of this adds up so we need to charge something... but I'm trying to price it as low as I can so that it is accessible to as many gamers as possible. It will cost a mere $0.99/month for network connectivity.\nCharging a monthly fee, even though it is so tiny, ensures that the service will be around for a long time, while being continually improved.  You'll reap the rewards of making 3D Virtual Tabletop happen, for years to come.\nThe Team\nThanks to the great people who're helping make this possible:\nBruce Braun, our US project manager\nMy weekly gaming group, for letting me experiment on them: Chris, Daniel, Domonique, Emma, \"H\", Jordan, Kingsley & Matty\nThe BizDojo, for the campaign edits and advice\nThe DM who got me back into D&D after a long hiatus, Bevan\nDramaScape for supplying the maps within 3D Virtual Tabletop\nLord Zsezse Works for supplying the great maps for this page\nOther friends, family, testers, and understanding early users... you know who you are!\n\nReward Level Clarifications\nIf the reward level gives you a subscription but doesn't mention iOS, Android or Web Browser, like the Veteran and Immortal levels, then your subscription applies to any and all versions of the app after they are released.  If you have both immediate/early access and a subscription, the subscription starts from the public release date so all of the time you get from immediate/early access is extra time.\nFor the map illustrated by Alyssa Faden, you can browse her work here and here to determine a style that you would like the map rendered in.\nThe delivery date for the Immortal +5, Immortal +10 and Immortal Colossus +5, Immortal Colossus +10 rewards should be Nov 2013 since it grants 4-week early access.\nAdd Ons\nEarly Access: If your reward level does not include immediate or early access to the app, you can add 4-week early access to the Android or Web Browser version by adding $21 to your pledge.\nImmediate Access: If your reward level does not include immediate or early access to the app, you can add immediate access to the Android or Web Browser version by adding $51 to your pledge.\nGuest Accounts: You can add on as many 12-month guest account subscriptions as you want for $9 each.  You can also extend guest accounts for as long as you want for $9/year.\nImmortal Guest Accounts: A guest account that is valid forever, was $99 each, but now reduced to $50 each with the achievement of the Special Backer Offer stretch goal.  These will only be available during the Kickstarter.\nMiniatures: The miniatures from the Battalion level are also available at higher reward levels, all you have to do is add $8 to your pledge above what is required for that reward. The value of the reward level must be higher than Battalion. This is an astounding amount of minis for such a low price.\nTravelling Bard: If you've pledged at $99 or higher, for $30 you can make your character famous like in the Bard reward level! Have him or her made into a virtual miniature with a portrait digitally inked and flat colored by Tim Jenkins of Battle! Studio. Your character will be included in the default set with the app, so they can participate in adventures with gaming groups all around the world! You'll also be able to manifest your character in the real world with an image file suitable for printing out to assemble into a paper mini.\nCastle Ravenstein: Get all 6 levels of the massive Castle Ravenstein added to your map collection in 3D Virtual Tabletop for $39. You\u2019ll also get the digital download so you can print it out or use it in any other digital platform.  Alternatively if you back this project and also back Castle Ravenstein at the basic pledge level, you will get the castle in 3D Virtual Tabletop too.\nCastle Ravenstein + Darkraven Fantasy Soundscapes: Get the Castle Ravenstein add on plus more than 15 hours of background audio in 64 tracks from Darkraven Fantasy Soundscapes for a total of $99. These sounds won\u2019t be integrated into the app, but they cover more than half a dozen different environments, from towns and ships to your typical dungeon and wilderness areas.  Alternatively if you back this project and also back Castle Ravenstein at the $99 level, you will get the castle in 3D Virtual Tabletop too.\nMap Tiles: A huge collection of over 600 map tiles from Lord Zsezse Works covering different genres and a wide variety of environments for only $50. This is a deep discount off the normal price that cannot be offered again.  They will be available for you to use in 3D Virtual Tabletop for creating maps.  The terrain types include paved paths of various sorts, river, beach, sea, rough paths, a bandit camp, contemporary gardens, magical gardens, sealed roads, swamp, cave, underground bunker, volcano, lava, mountains, desert, dead land, crypt, winter forest, World War I and II trenches and astral plane. For more detail you can check out Lord Zsezse Works' Ground Sets, all of them are included.  You will also get the PDFs, in addition to them being ready inside the app.  This add-on is available to all, no matter the reward level.\nRoadmap\nYour feedback and comments have added a few more things to the roadmap for 3D Virtual Tabletop. They are presented in no particular order.\nChat\nImport and export of map and miniature placements\nSet miniature rotation with buttons\nDynamic lighting\nDisplay of character sheet\nLock tokens in lie flat mode\nChange the background of the tabletop from plain black to an image you import, such as a starfield\nStacking counters\nLink one map to another at the entrance/exit", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no major risks associated with this project. A simpler version of this app has been released that you can play with right now. Additional technical risk has also been eliminated by testing many of the new features using trial software.\n\nOne issue that does remain is the ability to get the app to perform well on the huge number of Android devices available, since there are too many for me to test on. Use of the Unity engine reduces this risk as it designed to run on a wide range of hardware, however, the experience will be smoothest on higher-end devices.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #100", "update_userinfo": "Starting Work on Cut-Out Standup Miniatures in 3D Virtual Tabletop", "update_content": "Here\u2019s a little preview of what I\u2019m working on right now, using cut-outs for the standup miniatures in 3D Virtual Tabletop.

The story follows Ava as she makes her way across the universe, teaming up with the demon haunting her on a quest for revenge, while fighting her own inner demons along the way. I've been working on this story for quite some time...so this book is only the beginning! And I'm very excited to be able to share it with this project!!\nThe goal of my kickstarter is to raise 12k to publish at least 2000 copies of a 9''x 9'' hardcover, first edition book with the first 500 panels of this story for all the fans! It will be approximately 150-200 pages, 2 panels per page, in full color with broken down frames of all three chapter animations. If stretch goals are met, art and making of sections will be added to the back of the book!\nAll tiers $250 and above will have the back cover variant \"PACT MAKER\", with an official seal proving your dedication to my comic and will ONLY be printed for this kickstarter!\nAlso available to certain tiers are to-scale replicas of Ava's Heart Key: 3D printed in solid bronze-plated steel on a wearable leather necklace with a clasp.\nAvailable to a lower tier is a plastic replica on the same type of necklace.\n-\nNifty art rewards are being designed by myself and a few other official Ava's Demon artists!!\nAvailable to higher tiers are sketches and portraits painted by myself! \nAnd at the $5000 dollar tier you get a statue of Ava, sculpted and 3d printed in gold-plated steel.\nLooks like a bunch of the stretch goals are locked?!?!\n-\n I will be able to DEDICATE ALL OF MY TIME TO AVA'S DEMON! I'll be able to update twice a week starting January 2014, Mondays and Thursdays. Some future animations will be partially 3D animated by myself. I will also be able to work full time on bringing you guys art, contests, better merchandise, convention visits, basically all the things that aren't possible for me right now because of situations in my life that are tying me down.\nAside from all that, you will also get an ocean of tears that unicorns will emerge from because I will cry massive amounts of magical tears for eternity out of the joy and happiness that reaching this stretch goal will bless me with.\nAfter all, I've estimated my comic to be about 7000+ panels long, so I've gotta get cracking!!\nA special thanks to the official Ava's Demon musicians and artists!:\nDana Guerrieri for her art prints!

I\u2019m Kelly, the author of the healthy living and weight loss blog, No Sugar Sweet Life.  I also write regularly for the juicing website RebootwithJoe.com based on the documentary \"Fat, Sick, & Nearly Dead\" and have had articles published by The Saturday Evening Post, Beautiful Layers Magazine, Chobani, and more. \nI struggled with weight my entire adult life.  I \"dieted\" year after year and yet kept gaining weight. But, my daughter's birth was the wake-up call I needed. How could I teach her to live a happy, healthy life if I wasn\u2019t living it myself?\nJust a few small changes made all the difference. They were:\n\u00b7         Cutting out sugar.\n\u00b7         Adding veggie juices.\n\u00b7         Eating smaller portions. Studies show that just an extra 100 calories a day leads to a 10 pound weight gain per year!\nI've lost 55 pounds, with just a few more to go -- all with no calorie, point, or nutrient counting -- and I know I can make my goal because I've got the knowledge and tools to succeed now.\nWhile on my journey, I developed the Simple Portion bowls.  I wanted something beautiful to motivate and carry me through to \"healthy.\"\nWHAT ARE SIMPLE PORTION BOWLS?\nSimple Portion bowls are a unique, stylish, and smart way to be more health-savvy and in control. The Large bowl has an artistic pattern that shows where the bowl is filled to 1/2 cup and 1 cup.  The Small bowl measures 1/4 cup.   Use the Large bowl for cereal, rice, pasta, veggies, yogurt, etc...  Use the Small bowl for more calorie-dense foods like granola, almonds, dried fruit, etc... \n\nIt's that simple.  \nWHY THEY'RE SO SPECIAL:\nThere are some dieting \"tools\" on the market right now, but a lot of them are either complicated or ugly, or worse... both.  (Oh Dieter, you are hereby banished from the kitchen and forced to eat out of this ugly bowl until you drop a few pounds... UGH, no thank you!)  My idea is to combine a really beautiful bowl (tilted shape with modern designs) with a helpful measurement line for common foods.\n\nTo me, less is more and beauty is just as important as function.  You (and I) deserve the best!   You don't have to measure EVERYTHING, just the stuff that matters... like the pasta and rice and granola and heavier foods that we often overeat.\nTHE DESIGNS:\n     Sweet\n     Savory\nSpicy\nHOW KICKSTARTER WILL HELP:\nI have spent the last year and a half designing the Simple Portion bowls, working with the manufacturer to make sure they are perfect and ready for production. We\u2019re there, folks! All we have to do is submit our first order.\nThat\u2019s where Kickstarter comes in. The ordering minimum on the production of these bowls is gigantic. Thousands upon thousands have to be ordered to make the cost manageable for both me and YOU! So how Kickstarter works is that you pledge on your credit card to buy a set or two\u2026or three :) of these bowls. Your card is not charged until the end of the 60 day Kickstarter campaign, and it is only charged if the FULL monetary goal is met. So your card is only charged, and you only get your bowls if enough people are on board and as excited about them as I am!!!\nHIGH QUALITY CRAFTSMANSHIP:\nMade of porcelain, these bowls are heavy-duty, dishwasher-safe, and microwave-safe.  To get the most benefit from these bowls, you'll use them every day, and they will last. You are investing in high quality materials, beautiful original designs, supreme functionality, and shipping to your home. \nREWARDS:\nI have set up some wonderful rewards to go along with the pledges, so if you order one set of bowls, you\u2019ll also receive 5 printed recipe cards that coordinate with the style of bowls \u2013 the Sweet set will get 5 healthy dessert recipes, the Savory will get 5 savory dinner recipes -- you get the picture.  And what I\u2019m most excited about is that if you pre-order 2 sets of any style, you will get a full 30+ page bound cookbook featuring my most popular No Sugar Sweet Life recipes as well as some specially created just for Kickstarter!!\nSTART LIVING THE HAPPY, HEALTHY LIFE!\nI hope you will partner with me on this journey towards a happy, healthy life. 2013 can be YOUR year\u2026the year you decide to do something GREAT for yourself!

See the original here: http://goo.gl/5OnnQ\n2) The pictures included were microscopic.\nSeeing is 99% of history. It really helps tell the story and remind all of us who experienced it of the good and bad we went through.\n3) It was unfinished, outdated, and hastily written.\nThe story was there, but numerous grammatical issues really hindered the reading experience. There really was no ending, many of the specs and numbers listed weren't correctly, and there were several cases of repetition as the original was released in parts. We tried simply shoehorning the website into a book, and while it was met with praise for being thorough, the writing  and total content wasn't there.\n(Original book) http://goo.gl/hQoHx\nWhat we want to do about it:\nWe want your help, Kickstarters, to make this book into what is should have been the first time. We want to fix all the issues that were brought up the first time and make this the ultimate history of SEGA. \nThings this Kickstarter will help do:\n1) Update all the information in the book to be as accurate as can be.\n2) Add more sources, quotes, and original text to help tell the story through the eyes of the people who experienced it.\n3) Add more pictures to help tell the story.\n4) Hire a real (expensive) editor to correct all mistakes and to enhance the readers experience. \n5) Get professionally done artwork on the cover to make this book as appealing outside as it is inside. \nDesign not final\nHow else can I help?\nAre you a good artist, or know a good artist, that could help us get a professional cover on this book? Email us at servicegamessega at gmail dot com! While we won't know the exact dimensions until later, you could help us come up with a cover that is eye-catching and easy to read!\nKnow a lot about Sega and want to help us get our facts straight?

See here.\nAbout our Rewards:\nWe are proud to be able to offer both paper and hardback options, as well everything in either black and white or color interiors. Each book will an industry standard 6x9 size and all versions will include the same information.\nStretch Goals?\n$7000: We would love to do a full Kindle edition with all the pictures and updates from the enhanced edition. At $7K we will make sure this version is done right.\nNothing else to announce... yet!

The more we raise here on Kickstarter, the more we can put into the book. Work has already begun to add more to the book, but there is much more work ahead.

We set our goal for August of 2013, but it all depends on how long the editing process takes and when it begins. We'd love to be done sooner and will do everything possible to finish ahead of schedule, but there are variables that could change that.

I love that I can often play through one in under an hour--simple, challenging, and satisfying! Those games were short by necessity, but brevity IS the soul of wit, and it's not a bad way to do things.\nInspired by SF and Fantasy pulp stories, Tiny Barbarian is made up of individual episodes that, combined, offer a huge amount of content, but individually can be completed in under an hour, while still offering an exciting and complete experience. And we're not asking you to pay individually for a series of episodes. Nope! Buy in once and you'll receive each episode as soon as it is complete!\nHere's some more clips of the game in action:\nThe original Tiny Barbarian was a tiny but very well-received Game Maker project I put out last year. This new version is All New and makes use of Starquail's custom 2D engine - the same engine that powered Astroman on XBox Indie. I received a lot of enthusiastic feedback, and thanks to that feedback, the new engine, and my own determination for improvement, the new game darn near destroys the old one (but you can still get it here, if you like).\nTiny Barbarian now has a much improved combat system that makes juggling enemies a breeze, they can even be knocked into each other for extra damage. TinyB himself is completely redrawn, just as tiny but even more ripped with low-def muscle, and with new moves to attack enemies from different directions (the elbo drop is my favorite). As with the original, the stories are heavily inspired by old Sword & Sorcery yarns (think Conan the Barbarian) with plenty of nods that genre fans (and old-school gamers) are sure to appreciate.\nThis Kickstarter concerns a PC version of the game only, but other platform releases may become feasible later on.\n\nHere are some things you will be able to do in Tiny Barbarian DX, in no particular order (spoilers, obviously):\nFight endless hordes of evil (or just misguided) warriors.\nWack a gnome until gold comes out.\nFlee from a giant serpent.\nDefeat a huge, fire-breathing parrot.\nRide a bumblebee.\nAscend a wizard's magical tower.\nSave the most beautiful ladies that can fit into a 16x16 pixel box.\nBite a vulture.\nEnd the reign of snake-worshiping cultists.\nOutsmart a puma made of liquid metal.\nBattle white apes on an airship.\nEat chicken you found in the garbage.\nCountless exploits that defy description!\nBig, small, or even tiny, making a video game is a significant undertaking. I should know, I've been working on Tiny Barbarian in my free time for months! So why Kickstarter? Well, I could start tiny - finish a single episode and see how it flies. But with your support through Kickstarter, I can work on the project full-time, commit to multiple episodes right away, and you'll get to play them much more quickly. Currently four episodes are planned, but extra pledges will mean additional episodes, \u201cStretch Goal\u201d style.\nBehind every retro sword-wielding barbarian action game is an retro action game fan. I'm Michael Stearns, and I'm the guy behind this one. My friend and programming genius Daniel Roth and I have been producing games under the StarQuail brand for several years now. Our last game, Astroman, was honored by Game Developer Magazine as one of 2010's top ten XBLI titles. Usually I'm the art guy and he's the programming guy, but for Tiny Barbarian, I'm both guys, although he continues to assist me (willing or not!) whenever I need a bit of expert advice. I'm also the creator of the webcomic Dawn of Time, which ran consistently--and received praise from an amazing number of complete strangers--between 2008 and 2011.\nJoining me is Jeff Ball, the super-talented musician who worked with us to create the soundtrack for Astroman, as well as the music for the original TinyB. He has worked on other titles such as Monkey Island 2: Special Edition, Wing Commander Saga, and contributed his violin mastery to triple-A titles such as Mass Effect 3, Gears of War 3, League of Legends, and others.\nAbout Rewards!\nMost of the rewards are pretty self-explanatory but I want to describe or show a few in detail. \nThe Game: The game itself is the most basic reward, and with digital delivery, getting it to you is a snap! Backers will receive the first chapter (almost done!) and each additional chapter as it is completed. The delivery date displayed in the Rewards List is for the total project, so you will be playing the game long before date shown. Also, your name will appear in the Hall of Heroes, an in-game monument to my Kickstarter backers.\nSample box. The finished product may differ (it'll have a proper blurb on the back, too!)\nThe DVD Box Edition: This special box edition includes your digital download, the box with artwork, and a short booklet with cool artwork and a totally unnecessary (but also Totally Necessary!) guide to getting started. The box edition does not include a physical copy of the game, but it's a fantastic thing to have on your shelf.\nThe Shirt: Trade in those barbaric scraps for something more civilized!  If you think it looks good here, think how good it will look... ON YOU.\nTiny buttons: Any reward tier that has stuff shipped to you will also have a set of five shiny, shiny 1\" buttons shipped to you along with it!  Each assortment will include a varied selection of the game's cast but you can always count on getting one pixellated barbarian hero.\n\"Keeper of Terrible Secrets:\" This is the big one! I'll hide an Easter Egg in the game based on an idea of your choosing. It might be a secret room devoted to your greatness, or it might be a unique, game-breaking mount! The ideas come from you but I'll be the one who determines how it actually appears in the game. Anyone playing the game can access these Easter Eggs, but only you will know how to do it--it's up to you to decide if you want to share it or not!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI love games, I love making games, and Tiny Barbarian is the sort of game I love to make. With only one person's vision behind it, the biggest risk is that I may have bitten off more than I can chew--I do worry I've promised too much, not just to my backers, but to myself as well. Your dollars are buying my development time, so the question is, have I budgeted enough?\n\nTo convince myself, I have spent the last several month squeezing game development into my free time. (I have a day job, you know!) It hasn't been easy, but the result is a pretty good-looking project with all the groundwork laid out before me. There will be challenges ahead, but between my experience working on other games and having overcome difficult spots in Tiny Barbarian's development already, I know I can overcome them without delay. If I do find myself stumped, I have other experienced people ready to lend a hand. (Daniel already knows I am not shy about asking for help when I need it!)\n\n$12,000, even minus Kickstarter fees, costs for rewards, and taxes (taxes!) is a lot of money. I don't ask for it lightly, and I've taken a lot of time to determine what I need to support Tiny Barbarian's development. With your support, Tiny Barbarian will be finished, it will be finished on time, and--seriously--you're going to love it.

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys.

And you'll have made a funny cartoon!\n    You will get not just one gorgeous hand-made cartoon drawing - but a whole Goddamn scene!

Or frame them and show 'em off to all your friends at the reform school.\nThis is some rare shit folks! I happen to have every page of the classic comic \"Comic Book\" drawn by Jim Smith, Vincent Waller, Mike Fontanelli, Shane Glines, Rick Altergott and other top Hollywood cartoonists. I hate to part with this fantastic art but I obey our Savior when I say \"Give and ye shall receive.\" \n(Spumco Comic Book soon to be reprinted in hard cover by IDW and YOE comics)\nFor the serious animation art collector. You will own and cherish a whole layout scene from Cans Without Labels - and as an added bonus - a real live painted animation cel from one of Spumco's cartoons, rock videos or commercials. Turn all your neighbors green with envy. Signed by me of course.\nI will not only give you a credit in the cartoon - I will personally draw YOUR HEAD to put next to the credit. Here's a sample:\n  Here's a whole pile of samples of my caricatures:\nhttp://johnkstuff.blogspot.com/search/label/caricature\nYou can show off your head and credit in the cartoon to all your friends and family and act like a big time Hollywood executive!\nYOU'RE PART OF THE 1% AND PROUD OF IT!\nOK, folks here is THE BIG ONE. Join the esteemed ranks of top celebrities I have animated. You - yes YOU will make a cameo appearance in the cartoon. That's right!  I will personally do a caricature of you and animate you into the credits of the cartoon and thank you for being the philanthropic high-roller that you are!

We love Larry\u2026Larry Laffer. We were there when he was born, in 1987. We were there for his last adventure, LOVE FOR SAIL, almost exactly 10 years later.\nAnd we\u2019ve long wished for a version that would combine the characters and game play we already love with:\nThe freedom to play on mobile devices\nA modern point-and-click/touchscreen interface\nUpdated, ultra-high res graphics\nFully voiced characters\nEven more of the humor that\u2019s made Al Lowe a household name\u2026like \u201cBorders\u201d and \u201cEnron\u201d!\nSo we\u2019re making it. From scratch. And we want YOUR help.\nDo you remember Lefty's Bar from the original?  Did you know it's famous?\nWe've already accomplished THREE of the hardest tasks (and one easier one):\nPrying the Leisure Suit Larry license out of the hands of Big Software. DONE!\nConvincing Al Lowe himself to come out of retirement for this top-to-bottom re-imagining of his 25-year-old creation. DONE!\nReaching our initial funding goal ($500,000) so that we can lock in the project. DONE!\nSetting ourselves a new goal of $750,000! so that we can add vastly more content and loads of incredible new features. Al, Josh, the Replay gang and Adventure Mob have a laundry list of bonus features, all aimed at adding length, breadth, and 500,000 new laughs to the original game. Some of the features we'd desperately love to add are: animated intro and cinematic cutscenes, maps, dialogues, more speech, foreign languages, Easter Eggs, minigames (in the LSL tradition: fun to play, easy to skip), new puzzles, new girls, new locations...and that's just the top of the list.\nWhat\u2019s in it for you? That depends on what you pledge in Larry\u2019s Kickstarter campaign!\nTake a look at the list of rewards we\u2019re giving to Larry\u2019s supporters. They include everything from a copy of the game to actually being PART OF the game \u2013 as a character! -- to actually going to Las Vegas with your very own private limo and villa on top of the world's coolest hotels with Al Lowe and writer Josh Mandel!\nThose rewards are cumulative. Pledge at the $100 level, for instance, and you\u2019ll not only get the $100 reward, you\u2019ll also get the rewards given for $50, $25, and $15 pledges. So your sack of goodies can fill up VERY quickly.\nNow, these rewards have never been available before, and will never be available again. They\u2019re strictly for this game, for this campaign, and every single one has been approved by Al Lowe. They are collector\u2019s items to commemorate YOUR partnership in gaming\u2019s biggest comeback EVER.\nSo please help us make LEISURE SUIT LARRY IN THE LAND OF THE LOUNGE LIZARDS: the 25th ANNIVERSARY EDITION a perverted, hilarious reality. Kick in now, and stake your claim in gaming history.\nThe team that created Leisure Suit Larry 1 has been reassembled to create a 2012 \"Reloaded\" version.  Al Lowe, Josh Mandel, Sabine Duvall, and Leslie Balfour have teamed up with Replay Games to form what we call \"The Dream Team\" of adventure games.  We'll be making Leisure Suit Larry 1-7 and keeping you guys informed every step of the way.  If this game is successful then we can bring you guys the rest of the Leisure Suit Larry games (and maybe even Leisure Suit Larry 4: The Case Of The Missing Floppies)! \nWe couldn't do it without you, the most loyal fans in video game history!!  We get all of your fan mail everyday and reply to as much of it as we possibly can.  This is what drove us to create this Kickstarter campaign.  Had we taken this idea to a publisher, they would've turned us down cold since they think adventure games are dead.\nSo, please help us make this a reality and bring Leisure Suit Larry back to his dad, Al Lowe, like he was intended.  We promise to keep you laughing and wetting your pants all the way 'till the end of the game!!!\nWhat happens if we exceed our goal?\nDepending on how far past our goal we get, here's the list of things we'd like to do with the extra development effort:\nFully localize all the voice overs in to as many languages as possible.  We will start with FIGS (French, Italian, German, Spanish) and then branch out from there.\nWe will shoot Leisure Suit Larry on to additional platforms:  XBLA, PSN, and of course: Linux!\nThe game will come to life with a live orchestra performing all your favorite Leisure Suit Larry tunes.\nWe got game!  When our funding goal is exceeded we plan on adding more rooms, more girls, and more lousy pick up lines.

I knew they were good players after watching them record our soundtrack and this night cemented that reputation.\n\nBut the highlight for us Larryites came in their second set when they played several of the cuts from the Larry OST.

We\u2019re nearing the end of the project, and we want to keep you up to date with the information as soon as it hits our desk. This is in an effort to be as transparent as possible while creating what we hope is the single best Leisure Suit Larry project in the entire history of the franchise.\n\nI want to start off by thanking our 4k+ beta testers who have uncovered more GREAT bugs than any internal or external QA department I\u2019ve ever worked with in my entire career. This is largely in part due to the amazing work of QA Manager Jeroen Dekkers, and lead testers Tom King, Justin McMenamin, & badass \u201cwoman in gaming superstar\u201d Serena Nelson. Without each and every tester, Lead Tester, and QA Manager, the game would not be getting all the fixes you\u2019ve found and continue to find.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, and thus this unscehdule Kickstarter update: due to the pure number of bugs found in the PC version alone (Mac version is being tested now,but not via Steam), we\u2019re having to delay the game, yet again, until the end of June. I can\u2019t tell you how many phone calls, arguments, and heart breaking conversations I\u2019ve had with my advisors on this. I SERIOUSLY wanted this game out by the end of May because we\u2019ve postponed it more times than Larry\u2019s been rejected. Ok, well, maybe not THAT many, but still\u2026.we\u2019ve had some delays.\n\nI want you to know this decision was not made lightly, and I\u2019ve consulted with advisors inside the company and outside the company\u2026with Al, Josh, distributors, our QA Manager, testers, marketing people, \u201cstake holders,\u201d board of directors, etc. The bottom line is, it\u2019s just not ready for prime time. Sure, we COULD release the game at the end of the month, but we\u2019d be shipping it with bugs. Things like: the wrong line being spoken, Larry walking through a table in the cabaret, missing sound effects in the tutorial, no music in certain spots, and Larry\u2019s scaling needing fine-tuning. While some of these may seem trivial, we have ONE SHOT at getting this game right, and it will set the bar for quality for all future Larry games to come.\n\nThe first one to bring up the suggestion of delaying the game was Josh on Thursday of last week. We\u2019ve fought, laughed, cried, and argued over what to do for two full days and came to the conclusion you\u2019re reading now. Josh offered to write this update to you since it was his original idea, but I told him \u201cthe buck stops here\u201d and it was ultimately my call, and my responsibility to tell you and the rest of the world. I am not proud of this decision, but -- and please trust me when I tell you this -- having considered every single possible outcome, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we need to give N-Fusion one more month to finish the game. There\u2019s a good possibility that we MIGHT be done before that, but we want to give the game enough time to fix ALL the bugs, and put as much polish on it as possible. Nobody is holding a gun to our head and saying \u201cYOU NEED TO RELEASE THE GAME FOR CHRISTMAS\u201d or anything like that. I\u2019ve always said \u201cwe\u2019ll ship it when it\u2019s ready,\u201d and it\u2019s simply not ready (as much as I wish it were\u2026.trust me).\n\nI\u2019m sure there will be community backlash and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get more hate mail because of this, but please understand, this really is the best thing for the game, for Larry, for future versions of Larry, and for you, the person who took a HUGE risk on us in hopes we\u2019ll deliver to you what you firmly believed to be the game we\u2019re making.\n\nI\u2019m sincerely sorry and I hope this decision is the correct one.\n\nThank you for reading, and I hope you understand.\n\nFrom my heart, "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #63", "update_userinfo": "Unanticipated Update: The Leisure Suit Larry Beta Results", "update_content": "If you pledged at the $75 level or above, this update is for you.

It's an experimental, silent comic set in a strange world of robots and woodland creatures, safe for all ages. I've been running it online -- at intrepidgirlbot.com -- since March of 2009, and after more than two years, I have enough material for a real book. I've done my research and picked a printer. Just to get a minimum run of 1,000 books printed and delivered to me will cost $7,000, which is where Kickstarter and, hopefully, you come in.\nThe book itself is volume one of a planned three-volume series starring Girlbot. Entitled The Intrepid Girlbot: Unconditional, it will be 128 pages, in full color (as much as Girlbot's limited palette demands, anyway) on high quality paper through a trusted printing house. It will contain all the regular comic strips, stacked and formatted into pages, from March 2009 until April 2011, as well as bonus materials.

There will be two \"versions\" of it that I'm pushing: the simply signed version and the artist edition, which is signed as well as sketched in. You may request a sketch, but please, nothing too complicated.\nTHE POSTER: I've just designed this reward specifically for this Kickstarter project. It's a 12\"x18\" digitally painted parody of the \"Hang in there, Baby!\" motivational posters of the 1970s, starring Raccoon #1 from The Intrepid Girlbot. Here's a preview:\nClick here for a larger version.\nTHE ART CARD: These are things I've offered in the past on my site in return for donations during special fund drives. These will be personalized to your request (within reason) and mailed with your book order. Here are some examples from the past:\nClick here for a larger version.\nTHE ORIGINAL ART: I've sold many pieces of original art from Girlbot's run so far, but there are many more still available. I typically sell them for $30-50, plus shipping, so getting one in your Kickstarter bundle is actually a nice deal. I won't be offering them any cheaper than this! Here's where you can have a look at what's available, in the Girlbot store.\nTHE COMMISSION: On occasion, to bring in a little extra money, I'll do commissions, usually in a much more detailed, rich style than the one I employ in Girlbot. For a high enough pledge, a few people can get one of these from me, which will be tailored to exactly what you have in mind. Here are a few examples of commissions I've done in the past:\nClick here for a larger version.\nTHE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: Assuming the project gets funded, all my Kickstarter backers will be thanked in the book, but only those who show tremendous generosity will be specially thanked by name. I...honestly don't think I would have enough room to individually name everyone it would take to raise $7,000.\nTHE COVER ART: The cover actually hasn't been designed yet. That's something that will be worked through, in detail, in the Kickstarter process blog, but rest assured that I'll make sure it's something worthy to wrap up two years of work and toil. And it'll certainly be something sweet for one special collector to have for his/her own.\nTHE BIG FUNNY: Back in 2009, when Girlbot was still very new, I drew a version of Girlbot in the style of a golden age newspaper comic strip, called \"Little Miss Mechanical's Bedtime Amusement,\" for the Big Funny project. It was inked with a nib, painstakingly over several days, and it's a large piece, measuring out at 15.5x20\". Now it's available for a Serious Collector to snatch up. Here's a preview, natch:\nClick here for a larger version.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nTo non-U.S. backers, please add the following to your pledge amounts for additional shipping costs:\n$4 to pledges of $20-25 or more\n$8 to pledges of $40-100 or more\n$10 to pledges of $300-600 or more\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nQuestions you may have...\nWhy is this book so important?\nIt's important to me because having a book of my own will allow me to make more money for myself, as a professional cartoonist. Currently, I'm mostly supported with commissions and freelance work, with a minority of my income actually coming from my own personal projects, of which Girlbot is currently the main representative. It's my dream to be able to make an independent living off of my own work, and of course, the less freelance I have to take in order to pay the bills, the more time I'll be able to dedicate to my ideas. That means more reliable Girlbot updates, and other projects I'm excited about will be given their due.\nWhat will you do if you raise more than $7,000?\nIn that very happy instance, I would put the money toward paying for shipping and possibly ordering more than 1,000 books, as that would be more cost-effective for selling them in the future.\nWhen will I get my rewards?\nAssuming this project gets fully funded, my goal is to have the books printed and shipped to me by early October. Once I have the books, I'll start mailing out the rewards packages, so I'd expect delivery some time in October or November, depending on how fast I'd be able to get through orders. Digital downloads of the book will be made available as soon as the design is finalized, so no waiting on that, at least.\nAside from pledging myself to your project, how can I help make this book happen?\nSeriously, the best thing you could do is spread the word. If you know someone who would be into silly, strange comics about robots and raccoons, let them know. Post about it on Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, or whichever social network of your choosing. The more people who hear about this, the better!\nWhere can I see more of your work?\nYou can check out my portfolio website at jinxville.com, but it's badly in need of updating at the moment.\nHeyyyy, wait a minute! Aren't you the same Diana Nock from that Poorcraft Kickstarter I pledged to? What happened to that?\nNothing's happened to it. Poorcraft has taken longer than either Spike or I thought it would, but it's almost finished. I've been working on it simultaneously while drawing Girlbot for myself, and I promise that the publication of this book will do nothing to impede the release of Poorcraft. They're unrelated projects. So if you pledged to the Poorcraft Kickstarter, you will get your reward very soon, and pledging to this project won't conflict with that. It would, in fact, just make you a super awesome person.\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\nLet me know if you have any more questions!
