Also, some big last day news!!! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a seasoned business owner, I understand how things do not always go as planned. 2020 was definitely an example of that! There are some factors which are out of one's control, and human error must always be factored in. When this happens, problem solving and a commitment to make things right is paramount. I always endeavor to give the customer more than they expect with no gotchas. My experience has prepared me for this and my commitment to honoring my word is my main priority. Our backers will attest to the quality of response and service we provide. \n\nManufacturing and supply chain difficulties are the biggest risk to this project. We have taken several steps to minimize this risk:\n\nFirst, I have been involved significantly in every step of this project from inception; prototyping, working with qualified engineers, costing and quality control of manufacturing. I went so far as to personally finance, at significant expense, an initial low volume run of tables to make sure these tables did what I said they would, and to ensure that we could manufacture these with the quality I expect. The result was a product I am very proud of. This knowledge and being so active in the \"day to day processes\" allows me to personally oversee this project.\n\nSecondly, our Game Toppers are made in the USA. I am working with a manufacture that is based in my home town. They have many large accounts like Target, Best Buy and others, in a 90,000 square ft. facility, that has equipped them to handle the quality and the capacity this project demands. It also provides us many key advantages as far as quality control, problem solving, supply chain and mitigating problems that can happen versus manufacturing overseas.\n\nThirdly, shipping is always a challenge. We have purchased a 5000 Sq ft facility in our home town to manage inventory and the pick and pull process of our topper orders which we have been running on our own since Feb of 2019. Our Game Toppers are somewhat heavy packages. Considerable time and effort has gone into making sure our fulfillment partner in the EU can handle the shipping in a timely manner. We also have been testing our packaging to ensure our Toppers arrive in pristine condition. Because of this I have made significant upgrades in our packaging to ensure a quality delivery. our second delivered campaign has seen lower shipping failure and improved response time due to our implementations.\n\nWe are charging for shipping. I am making sound business decisions so I have enough funds to pay to get them to you. Our Toppers are over sized for the shipping category. The world is currently upside down in this segment or economy, and it's a worldwide problem. We see it easing in the future, but have prepared for the worst to ensure we can stand by our commitments. Our improvements in package engineering have proven well worth it! While we realize it costs a bit more to ship, this was an intentional design decision to provide the best quality, comfort and functionality that gamers desire. We could have made a smaller Topper with 2 inch rails and not offered the versatility that our design offers, but I refused to compromise on this. The small amount of extra shipping, I feel is worth it in the long run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nComponents are extremely well designed and durable goods\nReusability and recyclability\nbuilt to stand test of time.

Hunt", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In Theurgy, you take on the role of a half-forgotten god who wishes to restore their name to its former glory. \nAt the beginning of the game, you have only a pair of loyal acolytes and a handful of followers situated at the rural edges of a faithless world. However, as the game progresses, whole towns and cities will pledge their devotion to you... or else they shall perish by your hand. \nWelcome to a land in which epic pilgrimages are undertaken, incredible miracles performed, and fantastical beasts summoned as jealous gods clash in a fierce contest for recognition and reverence.\nnew monster meeple designs revealed in update #6\nPlease be aware that these images are not to scale and that the the final pieces may look slightly different from those pictured here. The custom action pawns,  acolytes, anomaly tokens, and engraved disks are digital mockups.  Although we think the artwork already looks pretty cool, it is not finalised and our artists will be adding in extra details after the Kickstarter to really make it pop. The photos on this page, like the one below, are of our prototype.\n Minimal Downtime: On their turn, a player has at most four actions to choose from. These actions are easy to execute and require very little upkeep, so play moves around the table very quickly. \nHigh Replayability: With a modular board, variable player powers, multiple paths to victory, and hundreds of unique cards, no two games of Theurgy are ever alike.\nEmergent Complexity: Complex game states and strategic dilemmas emerge from a very simple ruleset which can be learnt as you play. \nLimited Luck: How you manage your hand is much more important than which cards you draw, and a well-executed plan is the only way to guarantee the spread of your mythological religion. \nHeavy Interaction: There just isn't enough room on the board for players to quietly build up their empires and wait until the endgame. Players brush up against their neighbours almost immediately, and deciding which settlements to contest and which to abandon can be critical. \nThe aim of Theurgy is to be the first to achieve one of three victory conditions, all of which involve building temples:\nEstablish the Official Faith: Build X temples, one of which must be in the Capital. \nFulfil Your Calling: Build X+1 temples and fulfil your Divine Calling.\nSpread Across the Land: Build X+2 temples anywhere across the land. \nWhere 'X' varies with the player count. In order to build these temples, you will need to direct your acolytes and command your followers using four simple actions.\nMove your acolytes and any number of your followers into neighbouring settlements. Along the way, your acolytes may either preach to convert a local to your cause, or fight a fantastical beast to protect your following from the ill will of your rivals.\nPilgrimages are an effective way to grow your religion and to carve out a territory to call your own. However, they should be planned carefully. Spread your following too thinly, and you risk being overwhelmed by your opponents. Concentrate your following too heavily, and they become a target for hungry monsters and devastating miracles. \nMark your growing cultural influence in the surrounding settlements by placing a faith token or (if your following is large enough) replace a rival's token with your own. The greater your influence in a settlement, the easier it will be for you to construct a temple there when the people's faith is tested.\nSpread the Word is the simplest and often the most powerful way of strengthening your hold on new territories, but it is also the slowest. Placing and guarding faith tokens requires a considerable investment in time and followers.  \nAllow your acolyte to channel your divine power to perform incredible miracles, or summon fantastical monsters to wreak havoc in your competitor's settlements.\nDivine Intervention actions allow you to dramatically alter your position with powerful and often unpredictable effects. However, even gods have their limitations. The effectiveness of your interventions will very much depend on timing and the positioning of your own and rival acolytes, so plan carefully. \nTrigger a catastrophic or fantastical event in a settlement of your choice to see which god the people turn to. If that god is you, then they will build a temple in your honour. If not, then they will cast your temples down into ruins...\nTest the Faith is perhaps the most important action in the game, since this is how you build the temples needed to fulfil the victory conditions. The key to success in Theurgy is being able to anticipate how the locals' allegiances will shift when their faith is tested. \nAs with Divine Intervention, timing is key. Build your temples too quickly, and your rivals will rush to tear them down. Build your temples too slowly, and you'll be consigned to the history books...\nIn Theurgy, two or more gods compete for temples. However, we know that it's not always possible to find that second player. We also know that, no matter how many of you there are, it can be nice to vary your player count from time to time. That's why we've been working on Theurgy's 'AI Mode'. \nIn order to introduce an AI into the game, flip over a player mat to its AI side. Because all the deity boards are double sided, solo players will get the chance to play as or against any of the gods. You may play against a single AI opponent for a straightforward two-player experience, or seamlessly integrate an AI into a game with a higher player count. You could even play against multiple AIs at once.\nBe warned, though, that these AIs play with some advantages to compensate them for their lack of human intelligence. Each AI god has a different ability and acts more swiftly, cycling through three actions rather than four. This means that they can spread across the land and build their temples fast. You\u2019ll quickly discover that defeating an AI is no walk in the park.\nPlaying with AIs is straightforward, fast, and a highly recommended experience for not only solo gamers but for anyone who wants to put their Theurgy skills to the test.\nThe AI Mode is still in development and the AI rulebook needs to be finalised, but so far the reactions from our playtesters and reviewers have been overwhelmingly positive!\nIn Theurgy, rival gods are just one of your problems. The other is a Guild of Alchemists who seek to explain away supernatural phenomena as part of the ordinary course of nature. \nWhenever you Test the Faith in a settlement with a spectacular event, the Guild gets to work in the neighbouring towns and villages to provide a secular account of the anomaly. So, you need to be concious of which settlements you're testing and when. Test the Faith too often in your own territory, and you'll find the Guild's influence growing on your doorstep. \nThe influence of the Guild is represented by Sceptic Tokens. Scepticism can build up quickly, especially in the Capital and the Inner Ring of towns and cities. Importantly, if left unchecked, scepticism can make it almost impossible for players to win over the people's faith and construct temples. \nThe best way to deal with scepticism is to perform a miracle or summon a monster. After all, it is tricky to stay sceptical when a Manticore flies down and eats the local baker...\nMiracle cards have powerful and immediate one-time effects which can dramatically alter the state of play. However, while the gods of Theurgy are powerful, they are not all-powerful, and so these miracles have their limitations...\nFirst, each player has a hand limit of just three miracles to choose from. Players must therefore work hard to find the best way to use the cards available to them. \nSecond, miracles may only be performed on a Divine Intervention action. Since players are generally prevented from taking the same action on subsequent turns, you need to carefully plan out your miracles in advance. \nThird, miracles must be carried out by one of your two acolytes. Since the majority of miracles have location-specific effects, this makes the positioning of your acolytes key. There's no point bringing blight and decay to an empty settlement!\nRelatedly, if a rival walks an acolyte up to one of your temples during a pilgrimage, you have some time to react. Maybe they're just passing through, or maybe they're here to burn your temple to the ground... \nYou may have noticed that we've recently updated the names of our miracle cards so that they now read as divine commands. \"Floods\" just didn't sound epic enough. Now your acolyte must \"Drown Them Under a Great Wave\". \nWhereas miracles are played from your own hand, monsters are summoned from a common pool. \nImportantly, monsters may only be summoned into a settlement of a suitable type. The Troll, for example, may only be summoned into a Mine and the Shapeshifter may only be summoned into a Marsh. \nOnce summoned, roaming monsters may move into neighbouring settlements on future turns. Territorial monsters, on the other hand, entrench themselves in their new lairs.   \nUnlike miracles, monsters have an ongoing effect and there is no limit to the number of monsters that you may have under your control.  Each monster either has a permanent passive effect or an active ability which may be used each time you take a Divine Intervention action in the future. Therefore, the more monsters you control, the more powerful your Divine Interventions become. \nHowever, monsters require careful management. You will need to make sure you defend your most useful monsters from rival acolytes. Monsters are powerful, but not powerful enough to stand up to those channelling the strength of a god...\nExcept of course for the six legendary monsters. These monsters require two acolytes to slay and have a massive, dramatic impact in the settlements unfortunate enough to become their home.\nWe're determined to do everything we can to keep the manufacture and distribution of Theurgy as environmentally friendly and ethical as possible. This means:\nExclusively using certified sustainably sourced materials.\n  Investing in high-quality, long-lasting components.\n  Exclusively working with partners with the highest ethical employment practices.\nYou can read the full details of our environmental and ethical commitments in the final section down below.\n8 Custom Printed Cloth Bags: \u00a314\nYou can use these eight beautiful custom printed cloth bags to store all the pieces for each deity, as well as the sceptics and monsters. Above you can see the designs we've had made for two of our deities, Orrun and Aeoris.\nApproximate Size (width x height): 100m x 150mm\nPurchase separately in the pledge manager after the campaign. \nWhat can I expect for future stretch goals?\nOur stretch goals will involve upgrading the components and commissioning new artwork that we just couldn't afford otherwise.   \nWhere are the minis?\nWe love the world of Theurgy and really want our components to bring that world to life in the best way possible. We certainly thought about minis, but in the end decided that custom meeples fit the overall look and feel of the game a bit better. We are the Ministry of Meeples after all...\n Shipping will be charged after the campaign through a pledge manager. \nAlso, please be aware that the prices quoted above are only estimates and are subject to change. That said, we have endeavoured to make these estimates as accurate as possible. \nWe will prepay the duties and taxes, including VAT, for the backers who receive their games in the EU, US, Canada, UK, and Australia. \n*Europe Zone 1: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Monaco, Switzerland.\n*Europe Zone 2: Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden. \n*Unfortunately we are unable to ship to the following countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Congo, Eritrea, Ivory Coast, Guina-Bassau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, Niger, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, and Yemen.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this is our first Kickstarter project, we have taken special care to mitigate the risks and challenges associated with the development and delivery of Theurgy. We are working with a German manufacturer, Ludo Fact, well-known for their timely and high quality productions. Our fulfilment partners, Ludo Packt, Quartermaster Logistics, Aetherworks, and Zatu, all likewise have excellent reputations for delivering rewards to their backers without incident.\n\nBrexit has caused a bit of a headache for everyone who works with partners in the EU, and especially for small independent businesses like ourselves. Fortunately, Ludo Packt have a long history of shipping to the UK and have already begun guiding us through each step of the new process.\n\nOur aim is to turn The Ministry of Meeples into a trusted household name and to build a big community around our games. We are therefore entirely committed to exceeding our backers' expectations at every stage of the process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nTheurgy's core components will be manufactured by Ludo Fact, an industry-leading German manufacturer. Ludo Fact's production quality is extremely high, and as the game does not include any fragile pieces, each copy should have a long and happy life!\nReusability and recyclability\nAll of the wood, paper, and cardboard used by Ludo Fact are recyclable. So, if ever you did want to throw Theurgy out, you could recycle almost the whole thing. Of course, we're confident that you're not going to want to throw it out! You're going to want to play the game again and again and again... ;)\nSustainable materials\nLudo Fact have a very impressive record when it comes to using sustainable materials. In fact, this is the main reason we've chosen to work with them.\n\nMany of the game's pieces are wood, and Ludo Fact exclusively uses wood from sustainable forestry. All of Ludo Fact's suppliers are FSC- or PEFC certified, and so is Ludo Fact.\n\nLudo Fact only uses cardboard with the highest possible percentage of recycled materials.\n\nAll colours and coating used in the manufacturing process are water-based and non-toxic.\n\nWherever we can, we will avoid using plastic. Currently, our plan is to use flowpacks made from paper instead of small plastic bags. These flowpacks can also be recycled to make more paper!\n\nOur Printed Bags will be manufactured by The Cotton Bag Company. The Cotton Bag Company works exclusively with eco-friendly fabrics and water-based inks. \n\nOur Monster Meeples will most likely be manufactured by Meeple Studio in Poland. All of the wood used by Meeple Studio is local Polish wood from forests which are PEFC or FSC certified.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nLudo Fact uses exclusively green energy. Their affiliate, Vento Ludens, have realised projects which produce 130 million kilowatt hours of electricty through wind, water, and solar panel plants.\nSustainable Distribution\nLike Ludo Fact, our primary fulfillment partner, Ludo Packt, also uses exclusively green energy.\n\nOur manufacturing will take place in Germany, rather than China, so that there is a shorter distance for our product to travel to our main customer base in the EU and UK.\nSomething else\nWe have endeavoured to manufacturer as many of the components of Theurgy as possible within Europe. This in order to have the greatest confidence that everyone involved in the production process works in safe conditions and is paid fairly. \n\nCurrently, the only components which are manufactured outside of Europe are the Printed Bags from the Cotton Bag Co. However, The Cotton Bag Co exclusively work with factories which are SEDEX or SE8000 compliant (i.e. factories which have proved to uphold the highest ethical work practices) and endeavour to use shipping instead of air freight wherever possible in order to keep their environmental impact to a minimum.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Follower Pledge Level", "descp": "Follow along with the campaign and help us make Theurgy awesome!

The elders, reading this as the return of Aquila, enter the Oracle to find the altar piled high with Radiants, fabled orbs of power bestowed by Aquila and once used to fight back the darkness.\nEach noble gathered for the solstice celebration takes a Radiant from the altar. Most depart to guard their holdings from the dark times the Radiants imply, but you few Dukes and Duchesses stay to give thanks to Aquila for these wondrous gifts.\nAs the solstice fades into night, battle horns sound in the east and ghastly monsters, drawn by Aquila\u2019s light, descend upon the Oracle of Thyne and clammer to breach its walls.\nThe scattered tribes of monster-kin have harried Valeria since the first brick was laid for its first city, but now they fight together. Orcs battle alongside Gnolls. Goblins create contraptions for the Undead. Something has united them in a common cause\u2014to destroy Valeria.\nAquila\u2019s light brightens, the roots of the Oracle tremor, and the elders call out, \u201cShe returns! Hold back the darkness!\u201d You draw your blades and ready your spells to face the enemies of light.\nThis Room + Monster Task will be in Book 7 of all copies of Darksworn\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis Final Room will be included with all copies of Darksworn.\nThis card will be added to Book 7 of all copies of Darksworn\nThe Hatchery will be included in Book 7 of every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn.\n\nThe Fire Temple Monsters will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nThe Kaharian Monsters will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nThe Shade Events will be included in every Kickstarter copy of Darksworn. If you're not getting Darksworn, you'll be able to add this Pack in the Pledge Manager.\nDarksworn introduces cooperative play to Valeria: Card Kingdoms through a story-driven narrative in which your game group are Dukes or Duchesses working together to push back an ancient darkness that threatens the land. During the game, you will be slaying Monsters, recruiting Citizens, praying to Aquila for Blessings, and completing Tasks from a series of Books that reveal the saga of your adventures.\nEach of the 6 Books in the Darksworn Saga is a structured deck of cards and punchboard that introduce new rules that change Valeria: Card Kingdoms into a fully cooperative game. Your game group will set out on a Holy Quest to expand the Kingdom westward and defeat a growing darkness threatening the land and people of Valeria. Every Book starts out with new rules and sets your group against new Monsters, then spins out an expanding storyline that ties your rolls and Citizenry into the tasks and threats awaiting you.  \nSitting above the Monster Row, this board displays the current Book, shows the Book\u2019s new rules, and has an oubliette to hold captured Citizen cards.\nSet between the Story board and the Monster Row, these tiles define the Monster attack columns. When your roll matches any of these numbers the Monster card in that column attacks your Citizen stacks.\nThere are 9 new Monster cards that get added to an assortment of Monsters from the base game and expansions. Together they form the Monster deck with only 5 Monsters active at any one time. If you slay a Monster, that column can\u2019t attack this turn, buying your Citizens a brief respite from the carnage.\nBetween the Monster Row and the Citizens are the Walls. They offer some protection from most of the Monsters but walls get damaged, walls fail, and then the screaming starts. Luckily, there are ways you can re-build the walls...if you have any Actions left.\nActually, there are no new Citizens in this expansion. Instead, you can use any of the Citizens in the base game or any other VCK expansion to outfit your Citizen Stacks. Don\u2019t get too attached to them, though; Monsters love to capture or banish Citizens.\nBelow the Citizen Stacks, you\u2019ll find the Aquila Board. Here you can use a Prayer Action and spend Victory Points to activate one of Aquila's Blessings on display. These useful boons will ease your efforts to push back the darkness.\nYou may have noticed that there is one permanent Blessing on the Aquila Board...Spend 8VP to Rebuild 1 Wall. Along with that, there is also a deck of 12 Blessings with a 3-card draft line to give you a variety of other useful Blessings to assist you.\nEach player receives a special Starting Card \u2013 Explorer. This Citizen card will reward players when all seems bleak (none of your Citizens match the rolled dice) and in times of celebration (rolled doubles). No one should be without an Explorer.\nMost of the Books include punchboard tokens to represent certain special Monsters, deadly effects, looming terrors, or magical benefits. You\u2019ll discover all of these and more as you progress through the Books.\n\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 2nd Edition\nThis new edition of the Valeria: Card Kingdoms base game will have a lower MSRP than the original so that more gamers can enter the amazing game universe we launched back in 2015. It will have a new system of tracker boards, tokens, and +10 markers to count resources, and the box's plastic insert will have a special well to store the track boards. VCK2E will also include a new set of monster-based event cards that were not part of the original game components.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Flames & Frost Reprint \nValeria: Card Kingdoms \u2013 Crimson Seas Reprint\nFlames & Frost has been out of print for more than a year and Crimson Seas stock is running really low, now is the perfect time to reprint these major VCK expansions so that more Valeria gamers can get the full experience. The 2nd expansion, Shadowvale, is still available and can be purchased on our web store at a reduced price with immediate shipping.\nExpansion Pack #1: King's Guard\nExpansion Pack #2: Undead Samurai\nThese two expansion packs were release with the original edition of Valeria: Card Kingdoms back in 2015 and they've been out of print for nearly two years. We're pleased to bring them back here so that new and old fans can fill out their Valeria collections. As a special bonus, this pack now includes the Undead Samurai Rider, which was previously only available as a promo card.\nIf you've been collecting everything for Valeria: Card Kingdoms since 2015 and protecting your cards with premium weight sleeves, and if you got our Valeria Big Box back in 2018, then it probably looks something like this...\nThere's about a half-inch of space in each card well if the cards are crammed as tightly as possible. But if you do that, then you can't get your fingers in there to pull out the cards, and there's definitely not enough room for the 105 cards, 12 dividers, 1 tuck box, 2 folding boards, and the assorted wall and column tokens you'll be getting with Darksworn. So, here's our solution...\nCheck out the Add-Ons information a little further down the page and think about the storage solution you might need now to keep growing your VCK collection.\nThe items you select to add-on to your pledge will ship with your pledge level rewards when the project is fulfilled. \n\nENGLISH Add-Ons: If you have pledged for one of the ENGLISH pledge levels, you'll be able to select your add-ons during your pledge and Kickstarter will total up your list and automatically adjust your pledge for the full amount.\nGERMAN & FRENCH Add-Ons: If you have pledged at one of the GERMAN or FRENCH pledge levels, the items marked above as German Add-On or French Add-On can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign is over. You can add the value of your desired add-ons now by adjusting the Bonus amount in your pledge. Here is a graphic that detailing the Kickstarter process. Doing it now will help the project's perceived success, but you can just wait and do all the picking and paying in the pledge manager later, if you wish.\nAdd-Ons and Shipping: Please remember that in most cases, adding-on more products will increase the weight of your rewards package and could increase your shipping charges beyond the estimates provided in the Shipping section, below. Shipping will be calculated and collected in the pledge manager after the campaign has ended.\nAdding-On Older Products: We cannot offer add-ons for other products not part of this printing project because existing products are stored in different warehouses than Kickstarter rewards. However, we have many more Valeria products available for purchase and immediate shipment in our website shop \u2013 and almost everything is on sale during this Kickstarter campaign.  \nWe sent the resource tracking boards to previewer along with the Darksworn prototype, but forgot to mention that those boards are actually a part of VCK 2nd Edition, not Darksworn. So, naturally, some thought the trackers came inside the Darksworn box. That is not the case. The tracker boards are inside the VCK2E box, but if you're not getting that product, you can add the tracking boards onto your pledge, separately.\n\n\nEstimated Gamer Shipping\nShipping will be charged in the Pledge Manager after the funding project ends. Actual postage will be weight-based and packages will ship from hubs in the USA, Canada, Germany, Australia, and China.

We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success: \n\n1. This game project is in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital games background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games. \n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter project and keep backers up to date with plenty of updates during and after the funding process. Throughout every campaign, we are as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines. \n\n3. We have completed significant pre-production art, graphic design, and translations with the exception of the stretch goals. This will allow us to expedite file prep and get the files to printer in a timely fashion. \n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the files are delivered. We hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly. \n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Custom Pledge", "descp": "Get all the updates and be a part of our support network.\nYou will be able to add-on items now through Kickstarter's Add-On System and in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has ended.\nAfter the campaign has ended, shipping costs will be calculated and collected in the Pledge Manager based on the combined weight of your selected products.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["342 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Darksworn PNP Files", "descp": "All backers at this pledge level or higher will receive a download link to the PNP files for the VCK Darksworn expansion when we submit the files to the printer.\nAdditional PNP files for Daily Magic Games titles can be purchased directly through https://www.pnparcade.com", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "ENGLISH Darksworn", "descp": "One copy of the Darksworn expansion and all applicable unlocked stretch goals.\nCheck the add-ons list on the project page and adjust your pledge as needed for any extra items you'd like to get with your backer rewards.\nAfter the campaign has ended, shipping costs will be calculated and collected in the Pledge Manager based on the combined weight of your selected products.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,540 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "GERMAN Darksworn", "descp": "One copy of the GERMAN Darksworn expansion and all unlocked Darksworn stretch goals.\nNo add-ons are allowed for this pledge level.\nInsured, trackable, and VAT pre-paid shipping for 1, 2, or all 3 items will be $14 to Germany or $20 to Austria.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

Indie Boards & Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS\n\nWe understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case-by-case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense of replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS\n\nIf you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY\n\nSurveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 79 or more", "title": "Fractured Lightning", "descp": "You will receive one copy of Aeon's End: Legacy of Gravehold and The Ruins expansion including all unlocked milestones.\nThis pledge is for the new Aeon's End content: a core game, and a small box expansion that includes all unlocked promo cards from this campaign.\nShipping and Taxes are not included and will be charged in the Pledge Manager.

It has experienced delay after delay in development, asset design, pre-production, and production. We are working daily to get this large game completed and out to backers, and ultimately into the marketplace, as soon as possible.\n\nThis project took 0% of the workload away from Sweet Mess. What is needing to be done for Sweet Mess is being done. Montana: Heritage Edition is a complete game and has already been manufactured and released. This means that the factory has the production for this game already and needs nothing else for its production. Goldrush and Longhorns are also complete and has been produced by our partners, White Goblin Games, and their factory files will be shared with us and the factory, making this project a quick turnaround.\n\nWe hope you do not judge this project, White Goblin Games, or Big Kid Games, on the delay of Sweet Mess. It is an untimely delay that we are facing, but be assured that, in the end, a well-designed and well-produced game will be the result.\n\nTerritorial License:\n\nThis is a licensed game from White Goblin Games and Big Kid Games are only able to accept pledges from supporters in the territories of our agreement - US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Big Kid Games cannot accept pledges outside of these countries. The Montana game line can be acquired through White Goblin Games and their partners in other regions of the world. Please visit www.whitegoblingames.com and contact them directly for any such questions regarding sales in other regions.\n\nMontana: Goldrush and Montana: Longhorns are completed products that are released in Europe and other regions of the world (Longhorns pending). The expansions are complete and ready to print, with needing only minimal factory preparation and setup. We expect to have these expansions print-ready in short order.\n\nMontana: Heritage Edition is a released game in the territories listed above, with a retail version available in stores now, although quantities are limited. This campaign serves the purpose of reprinting the Kickstarter version of the game, as well as additional retail units, along with the expansions and additional content for the game. Montana: Heritage Edition's initial printing included a small batch error of misprints of punchboard 7. We will take steps with LongPack Games to ensure that misprint chances are minimized, if not eliminated.\n\nFulfillment & Shipping:\n\nBig Kid Games have learned valuable lessons in manufacturing, delays, and expected timelines. We believe that our conservative preparation, printing, and fulfillment timetable for the Montana line is accurate. Of course, it is not impossible for delays to occur from uncontrollable sources and/or circumstances.\n\nQuartermaster Logistics will be fulfilling and shipping your rewards. QML's partners in Canada and Australia will handle the shipping to those regions. The 'Shipping Chart' above depicts estimated costs only. Actual shipping costs, per weight, will be assessed and collected within CrowdOx after the campaign. There is no shipping collected within this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nPledge Management:\n\nWe partner with CrowdOx to collect and manage shipping information, as well as collect any additional funds for add-ons, late pledges, and pre-orders. All information collected is private, protected, and not shared. We will be opening CrowdOx for backer management, adjustments, and orders the week after the campaign ends.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the closing of the CrowdOx pledge manager. If the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount refunded. This is corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since those will not be refunded to us after that point. At that point, the refund will be completed via PayPal instead of the credit card you used through Kickstarter or CrowdOx.\n\nTerms & Conditions:\n\nYou agree that it is your responsibility to submit to us your information for the purposes of shipping your rewards. Your information will be entered into CrowdOx, where it will be confirmed by you before the closing date. Your information will not be used by anyone outside of Big Kid Games and their partners and your information will never be given away or sold.\n\nYou agree that it is Big Kid Games' responsibility to ship to you your rewards as listed out in this Kickstarter campaign and as confirmed by you via the CrowdOx pledge management system.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge", "descp": "This pledge is for retailers in the US, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand only.\nEligible retailers can order any and all items from this campaign and retailer orders will include all promos, such as Montana: Trade Posts!

Their games are highly sought after and when Alley Cat Games had the opportunity to create a game by Louis & Stefan we jumped at the chance!\nAndrew's artwork brings Tungaru to life and he has become one of the most sought after artists in board games. We loved his art for Everdell and The river and we think you'll agree that his artwork for Tungaru is absolutely stunning!\nNote: The Deluxe Edition will ONLY be printed for this Kickstarter and will not be available through general distribution. After Kickstarter, it will only be available in limited quantities directly from Alley Cat Games at conventions and through the website.\n Exceptional game design - Louis & Stefan Malz have brought together a wonderful combination of gameplay elements: Dice Placement, Engine Building, and an innovative Leader drafting mechanism make this Euro game truly outstanding.\n Stunning artwork - Andrew Bosley brings a special touch to any game featuring his artwork. He's done some truly stunning pieces for Tungaru!\n Multiple strategies to play - Will you focus heavily on resource conversion for early points or will you focus on recruiting Nomads mainly for their end of game scoring bonuses? Maybe a mix of both?\n Outstanding production quality - Back the Kickstarter version and you'll get 40 culture monuments and 5 beautifully crafted boat minis to hold your dice as well as Island tiles that increase variability.\n Dice-Holding Boats! - We've given you dice-holding ambulances, a dice-holding helicopter and now come dice-holding boats!

Players also gather any resources that the Nomads in their community produce.\nEach player plays one Leader card face down and all players reveal simultaneously. The instant actions are then resolved and the cards remain face up in front of the player who played them, ready to be used for their dice placement slots and special abilities.\n Tungaru provides a huge range of possible actions. Place dice on spots on the board or on the Leader cards to gather resources, settle the islands, attract Nomads to your culture, trade with the islanders, or use other asymmetrical actions provided by Nomads.\nA variety of available actions\nGathering resources is key to victory, you'll use them to trade, recruit nomads, settle the islands and even convert them directly to victory points.\nHarvest valuable resources\nNomads will bring new skills to your culture, and unlock new victory conditions, making every game of Tungaru unique \nNomads strengthen your culture\nYou have limited space for Nomads in your community so deciding which abilities to keep can be a tough choice.  \nNomads provide a variety of abilities including resource production, dice manipulation, the ability to convert resources to victory points and other special once-per-game abilities.  \nLeader cards that were played this round are passed clockwise, giving each player a different set of leaders, and a new round begins.  \nWe will be using Pledge Manager after the Kickstarter has ended to manage add-ons and shipping. \nIf you want to add any of the add-ons below to your pledge, please do so in the Pledge Manager\nYou can pledge at the \u00a31 level now to gain access to the pledge manager!\n Please note, we will be using Pledge Manager to manage add-ons so please do not add the funds to your pledge yet.

Prices will severely vary between location (due to shipping and customs) so please message us for rates.\nUnfortunately, we won't be able to offer group pledges for some countries in Asia, so please message us beforehand so we can check.\nWe are subsidising shipping and absorbing some of the cost of each shipment. Costs are shown in the approximate local currency. To double-check the pricing to your region or for more accurate pricing, please go to to the pledge tier and select your country.\nActual shipping charges will be charged in the pledge manager and may be cheaper than the amount stated.\nDue to previous shipping issues, we do not ship to South America, Mexico, Russia, and all of the Middle East (in particular UAE, or Saudi Arabia).\nAn optimistic prediction of the timeline:\n November: KS completes.

Most backers have their copies.\nPLEASE NOTE: If there are any delays it could push this back farther for completing fulfilment. The above is an optimistic prediction.

The campaign allowed us to get a larger 3D printer, and to deliver some great accessories for Scythe by Stonemaier Games.\nNow we're back! By continuing to hone our 3D modeling and printing skills, we designed what we believe to be the best storage solution for Stonemaier Games' newest game, Tapestry. The design for the inside of Tapestry does not allow a lot of room for all the player pieces in the vacuformed wells or above the board. We have worked hard through a lot of trial and error to design a compact, robust, storage solution that fits in these wells.\nOutlines help show where pieces are stored\nEach player gets their own organizer which holds all their buildings, cubes, towers, and resources. The organizers include outlines to help players know where to store pieces as well. A unique design allows these organizers to stack by slide-locking. Three of these organizers plus a lid just fits into each of the two wells.\nA unique design allows these organizers to stack by slide-locking.\nAll 6 organizers stored neatly in the wells\nThree of these organizers plus a lid fits into each of the two wells.\nThe 6th organizer holds all of the Space hex tiles, and conveniently nests with the other organizers. Holes in the bottom allow you to easily push out tiles without damaging the sides.\nColors may vary\nThe lid has a recessed area, making it easy to grip and slide off. The lids also allow for vertical storage without worrying about the pieces falling out.\nIn addition to the Player Organizers and Space Hex Organizer, there is also a Hex Land Tile & Dice holder and Lid. This conveniently holds all the hex Land tiles and one set of dice.\nColors may vary from shown\nAs with the Space Hex Organizer, it also has holes underneath to allow you to easily push out tiles without damaging the sides. An edge is also exposed allowing you to remove tiles that way as well.\nThe Hex Land Tile & Dice holder conveniently sits atop the board, with plenty of room to allow for future expansion.\nWe truly believe that this is the best and most compact storage solution for Tapestry, utilizing the existing storage and maximizing space.\nThis is your chance to get a bespoke product, a beautiful and functional storage solution for Tapestry.\nThis is a simple campaign. Unlike last time, we already have the 3D printer in-house and configured. In addition, we have since acquired a second T-REX 3D printer, doubling our capacity. This campaign is for the Tapestry Storage Solution. Printing and fulfillment can begin as soon as the campaign ends. We have tried to make this easy, so you can get to playing more quickly. \nAdvancement Track Tokens\nAdd-Ons\nWe have a few add-ons available if you are interested. If you would like to upgrade your organizers to translucent colors, please add $5 to your pledge. If you would like to add a set of Advancement Track tokens (shown above), you can add $5 to your pledge to include these.

If you purchased a set of dice for each player and want a dice storage solution, you can add $5 to your pledge to include a second closed 5-hex box to hold 5 sets of dice. Simply click \"Manage your pledge\" to adjust your pledge amount accordingly to add any of these.

The affection for this period is not for the high and mighty, but for the underdog. It's Lizzy Bennet and John Bates, Jane Eyre and Elinor Dashwood, David Copperfield and Mary Thorne.\nSuch rich material deserves to be celebrated!\nRecognition \nObsession has been honored with prestigious nominations and awards acknowledging both immersive theme and intricate strategy.  It has been reviewed and lauded by the major personalities in the tabletop gaming business, including Ant Lab Games, Dice Tower, Heavy Cardboard, JonGetsGames, Rahdo Runs Through, Three Minute Board Games, and 16 more. Obsession (and the Wessex expansion) sold out over 3000 copies in less than a year.\nProject Scope\nThis project expands upon the Obsession experience with a particular focus on the domestic staff. In the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion, four new servants enter play. \nBefore we get to know the Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid, and Useful Man, note that this project will fund the following:\nFirst printing of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion\nSecond printing of Obsession  \nSecond printing of the Wessex expansion \nThese three titles will be offered at between a 20% and 23% discount off of MSRP (not counting the 43% discount on the Loyalty Bundle), and the pledge levels will feature all possible combinations of these three games.\nImportant Note: Experienced Obsession players are here for the expansion, but others have come to learn more about Obsession. If you're a veteran, scroll down for the expansion content of Upstairs, Downstairs, but if you are unfamiliar with Obsession, here is an excellent video from 3 Minute Board Games to use as a frame of reference:\nKayenta Games Customer Service and Refund Policy\nKayenta Games' refund policy is simple: there will be perfection in your game experience or your money back. In the previous Kickstarter, we encountered issues common to a good-sized fulfillment project and solved them to the 100% satisfaction of our backers. Kayenta Games replaced boxes with slight splits from shipping, any component with an imperfection, even components that a gamer accidentally damaged (spilled wine!), and never one nickel charged.\nAfter production was underway, two errors in player aids were discovered. Kayenta Games immediately committed to reprinting the aids, launched a promotional card project as an apology, and shipped the card packet free to every backer and owner of the game worldwide, an effort that cost over $10,000. \nThe game must be perfect. \n\"My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.\" \u2014Mr. Darcy (and backers of KS projects)\nObsession embraces the rich stories supplied by Victorian fate: shocking revelations, haunting tragedy, unbearable secrets, family dishonor. Navigating the twists of Victorian fate in Obsession is the story...and the tactical challenge. \nUpstairs, Downstairs is an expansion that supplies gamers with new options for mitigating your fate. But true to the game's spirit, the mechanics are intertwined with the theme\u2014specifically, in the unique abilities of new domestics: the Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid, and Useful Man.\nDRAFT Version of Upstairs, Downstairs Rulebook\nMeet the New Servants\nCook Ability: The cook enables a player to invite guests 1 or 2 levels above the reputation showing on the player board. In the example below, our player (the Howard family, reputation level 3) normally would be unable to receive the Marquess of Tetbury (prestige rating 5) in the Drawing Room; however, her extraordinary cook breaks down the social restraint of the marquess, who cannot resist Mrs. Puggins' larded oysters, which will be on the menu later that evening. \nHall Boy Ability: This young footman-in-training presents the butler with an excellent service option for a demanding guest pressed with personal and political affairs while staying at the estate. \nThe hall boy may be placed onto a gentry card showing a monetary favour to increase the pounds received during the Enjoy Favours phase of a player's turn.\nHead Housemaid Ability: The head housemaid is the household's most well-connected domestic worker, with extensive contacts in and around Derbyshire. Since she is so well-informed, the head housemaid is able to supply critical information to the lady of the house to help ensure only the best people become acquainted with the family.\nThe head housemaid may be placed onto an improvement tile or gentry card showing an invitation favour to allow the player to look at an additional card when inviting guests.\nUseful Man Abilities: The useful man is, well...very  useful, and his abilities require a good understanding of Obsession. If you have familiarity with the base game, these abilities are as follows:\nPlace the Useful Man onto the Private Study tile during a Village Fair round, thereby increasing the revenue from that Village Fair by \u00a3200 (either from \u00a30 to \u00a3200 if the Study Tile has not been flipped or from \u00a3300 to \u00a3500 if the Study Tile has been flipped).\nPlace the Useful Man onto any tile in the builders\u2019 market when making a purchase, thereby decreasing the cost of the tile by \u00a3100.  \nPlace the Useful Man onto any improvement tile located in the player\u2019s organiser (only tiles that can be played on the player\u2019s family board qualify), thereby temporarily decreasing the prestige rating of the tile by one.\n One Time Use: Remove the Useful Man from the game to refresh the builders\u2019 market.\n One Time Use: Remove the Useful Man from the game to allow the player to search the tile bag for a specific tile (monuments excluded) and place it in the \u00a3800 rightmost space of the builders\u2019 market (the tile currently in the \u00a3300 space is returned to the bag, the remaining five tiles slide to the left, and the new tile is placed in the \u00a3800 space, where it can then be purchased normally). \nTeam Cooperative Play (New Video!)\nCompetitive Upstairs, Downstairs Play\n\n5th Player\nThe Upstairs, Downstairs expansion adds all the necessary components to enable five players. \nPlayer Board (with reputation counters/marker): Two-sided player board* with improved Order of Play. One side contains an integral improvement tile organiser (shown below) to enable play without using the separate Country Estate Organiser (if space is at a premium).\n* The Howard family board is not required if the Wessex family board is available\nThe Howard Family\nCountry Estate Organiser and START Tiles\nGuests: The inclusion of 33 new guests (16 prestige and 17 casual) expands the supply  for five players and balances the guest mix as follows: \nThere is an emphasis on guests of prestige rating 2 to de-emphasize unsavory guests, which have a high concentration in the original Obsession casual deck\nThere is an emphasis on guests of prestige rating 3 to increase the utility of early prestige guest draws (and support the Expert Variant guest display)\nSeven new starter guests are added  to increase variety (and support the Expert Variant guest display)\nThere are no guests of prestige rating 6 in the 33 new cards, which thematically increases the rarity of these special guests\nThere is an increase in the frequency of monetary favours as pounds can be critically tight early in a game\nPrestige Guests (sixteen)\nCasual Guests (seventeen)\nServants' Hall Rule Change (new tile): The original Servants' Hall is overpowered\u2014particularly in a 2 player game\u2014and needs correction. With the release of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion, this is addressed as part of a formal rule change for this tile. \nNew Rule: In order to spread gossip and \"steal\" reputation from an opponent, an available servant must be placed onto the Servants' Hall tile in the player's organiser. Any available servant\u2014including the butler and housekeeper and the new servants from the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion\u2014may be the source of the gossip and rumours, but the servant used must be expended and rotated normally back to available service.\nAny servant can be a source of damaging rumours\nUpstairs, Downstairs also comes with additional player aids; you are ready to play Obsession with five players!\nModified Extended Play Round Track & Tableau Round Track\nThe Upstairs, Downstairs expansion comes with a two-sided round track. On the front side is the modified extended play track that relocates the National Holiday to make it more relevant.\nOn the reverse side, Upstairs, Downstairs comes with two completely new modes of play supported by a single round track that removes courtship and places the focus on building your country estate. The ruleset for the competitive game called Tableau Obsession is currently being edited and will be posted before the project concludes. For more detail on the solo mode\u2014Solo Estate Challenge\u2014visit the Solitaire Spot at the bottom of the page.\n\nNEW! A playthrough of Tableau Obsession.\nOfficial Variant Rulebook\nAn official rulebook that collects into one place the approved and playtested variants will be included with Upstairs, Downstairs. Rules for the Expert Variant, Dynamic Cooperative Mode, and other designer and user-developed content will be in one location, some with additional components (in the game box) and dedicated player aids.\nStretch Goals\nSee Update #17 for details on the Box Storage System!\n\nRevenue stretch goals, 8 of 10 achieved!\n\n\n\n\nAnd now for a 51 second video interlude: \n A new video from 3MBG, with a GREAT finish:\nLearning Obsession\nYou are the head of a respected but troubled family estate in mid-19th century Victorian England. After several lean decades, family fortunes are looking up! Your goal is to improve your estate so as to be in better standing with the truly influential families in Derbyshire.\nObsession Rulebook\nObsession Glossary\nObsession is a game in which players build a deck of Victorian gentry (British social upper class), renovate their estate by acquiring building tiles from a centralized builders' market, and manipulate an extensive service staff comprised of butlers, housekeepers, underbutlers, maids, valets, and footmen to support elaborate social gatherings. \nEach turn, players choose a building tile representing a renovated room or outdoor space in and around their 19th century British country house. The tile chosen dictates the event that can be hosted and the guests to be invited, and players must carefully plan to have the proper staff available to service the event and support guests as needed. The reward for success is new investment opportunities permitting further renovation of the estate, an increase in reputation in the county, an expanding circle of influential acquaintances, and a larger and highly-trained domestic staff.\nThroughout the game, a competitive courtship for the hand of the most eligible young gentleman and lady in the county presents specific renovation and reputation objectives. The player who best meets these objectives may win the hand of the love interest and the game.\nAn Example of the Obsession Player Tableau\nFor extraordinary detail on Obsession gameplay, the following videos do a superb job teaching and demonstrating the game:\nLarge Consolidated Player Aid\nDeveloped by Peter Lazzaro, provided as a downloadable PDF.\nNew Features in the Second Printing\nThere are several new features in the second printing of Obsession:\nTile Numbering System\nThe builders' market is populated with improvement tiles according to their rank. The sorting system in the first edition of Obsession proved non-intuitive and made setup, as well as in-game refreshing of the market, a daunting task. The 2nd printing of Obsession introduces a numbering system that eliminates the needs to memorize or look up the tile rankings.\nEach tile now has a small number in the lower right quadrant. Tiles drawn for initial population or a market refresh are then placed in numerical order. Consider these six tiles drawn randomly from the tile bag during a market refresh; normally, the rank of these tiles (two service, two prestige rating 3, two prestige rating 5) would have to be looked up in the Glossary. \n? ? ? ? ?\nWith the new tile numbering system, simply sort the tiles by the small number (circled in yellow) and place them into the builders' market in ascending order.\nPlayer Board Upgrades: The player boards (family boards) have received a facelift. The Order of Play has been expanded to include a check of pre-turn events/actions, and the boards are now two-sided, one which has an intregral country estate organiser (pictured below).\nModified Extended Play Round Track: The Extended Play side of the original Round Track had the National Holiday located on round 17, which is not an ideal location.  The Extended Play side will now feature the National Holiday on round 11, which greatly improves the flow of play.\nAdditional Enhancements to the game include:\nFour Objective Cards have been balanced and one card removed and replaced.\nThe value 6, 7, 8 Victory Point Cards have been eliminated; all VP values are 3, 4, and 5 and the frequency of certain cards adjusted.\nThe Box has been increased to be 76mm deep (up from 68mm deep) which will make it possible to store all expansions in the main box, if desired. The white cardboard box insert will be eliminated (there will be a stretch goal for an alternative storage system).\nWessex Content\nWessex Family Player Board: The Wessex expansion adds a fifth, two-sided player board with the updated Order of Play. The Wessex family advantage is that they have the largest estate and begin the game with either the Breakfast Room or the Tennis Court in their organiser.\nThe Wessex Family\nThe Wessex Family Advantage Tiles: Note that in the original printing of the Wessex expansion, the two tiles below\u2014provided specifically for the Wessex family advantage\u2014were placed in the main Obsession box due to an issue with the die cut. This has been corrected. These two tiles will now come in the Wessex expansion box with the player board.\nTile sorting numbers provided in case these tiles get mixed into the general supply\nSecond Printing Bonus Tiles\nThe creation of a diecut to move the two Wessex family advantage tiles to the Wessex expansion box affords the opportunity to add bonus tiles! All 2nd printing copies of the Wessex expansion will contain the Morning Room and Retiring Room tiles:\nFront and Back (with the rose) of the Morning Room Tile\n\nThe Morning Room introduces a variable invitation tile as well as the first ESSENTIALS tile with a prestige rating of 1. The Morning Room was a sitting room in a great house situated to receive the morning sun; this room was a favorite location early in the day to review menus and plan the day's activities.\nFront and Back (with the rose) of the Retiring Room Tile\n\nThe Retiring Room's single female invite can extend a deck, supply critical reputation early, and provide powerful flexibility in the first two seasons. The 'Retiring' Room was a temporary designation for an existing room set aside for visiting ladies to repair damage to dresses and appearances generally (a maid would be on hand to facilitate these repairs).  This introduces the first tile where a lady's maid is the essential activity servant.\n\nPrestige Guests (five)\nCasual Guests (eleven)\nSolitaire Cards (for extended solo play): The base game of Obsession comes with twelve solitaire opponents, four at each level of difficulty. Those twelve opponents are for a standard length game (12 turns).  The Wessex expansion brings six new solitaire opponents (two at each difficulty level) for extended play competition (16 turns).\nHello! Dan Hallagan here; I am going to speak to my fellow solo players directly. Forgive my alteration of the Anthony Trollope quote immediately above (I changed 'book' to 'board game'), but what could be more civil than settling in for a solo game on a wintry afternoon? I am sure Mr. Trollope would agree.\nI have a special place in my heart for solo play. I play every game I own solo (sometimes 2-player solitaire if there is no solo mode), because there is no better way to learn a game before going on to teach it to others. When teaching (and I am always the one who teaches), I am pulled in many directions; the feel and play of the game takes a back seat. Solo is when I enjoy the luxuriousness of high-end board games and appreciate the designer's attention to detail.\nBoth the base game of Obsession (standard play) and the Wessex expansion (extended play) have solo opponents in the form of cards that provide a specific tactical challenge during gameplay. \nObsession solitaire win the 1 Player Guild  fan vote for2018 Solitaire Game of the Year, was nominated by Every Night is Game Night (ENGN) for Best Solo Strategy Game of 2018, and debuted in People's Choice Top Solo Games at 156.\nIn addition, a dynamic opponent has been created that employs a clever and powerful AI for a unique challenge.  This ruleset is being formalized in an official game mode and variant rulebook that will be published online as well as printed for the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion.\nFor those new to Obsession, I am going to let Liz Davidson from Beyond Solitaire teach today. Then I am going to show you a special solo creation that is part of the Upstairs, Downstairs expansion!\nUpstairs, Downstairs introduces a new solitaire game: Solo Estate Challenge. Here, the focus shifts from courtship to tableau-building; the solo player is in total control with all options open to them, but can she finish in time and craft the right tableau to win? \n A complete playthrough of Solo Estate Challenge in two videos (apologies for some technical difficulties):\nPART 1\nPART 2\nDiary Archive \nArchive\nSeptember 19: Cook, Hall Boy, Head Housemaid player aid.\nSeptember 20: Useful Man player aid.\nSeptember 21: (no post)\nSeptember 22: Meet Feifrau von Ludwigstorff.\nSeptember 23: Meet Sir Wallace Carter, Bt.\nSeptember 24: Meet Glencora and Plantagenet Palliser.\nSeptember 25: Meet Dr. Richard Clarkson.\nSeptember 26: A new non-revenue Stretch Goal!

It is now time for some of those ideas to become a reality in this second expansion. More control over the game, more variety in detectives and criminals, more choices, more, more, more!\nTwo new detectives and two new inspectors are joining the team:\n- Brick Larson is a former boxer and rehabilitated second story man. He can reduce time by 3 hours to gain 1 permanent twist marker!\n- Sarah Dayley has special abilities in the Storyline...\nCaptain Harrington and Olga Domino have been included as well as the two new inspectors.\nThe expansion comes with 2 new cases to solve each of which features nice twists and turns!\nThe Society of Corpses: Six all new dastardly criminals! The Chairwoman, Mr. Holiday, Ronnie The Chin, \"Leering\" Jack Callahan, The Obscurant and Lady Ace will trouble your nights during the many sessions of Pulp Detective yet to come...\nPublishing a new expansion means that we have a great excuse to produce a new die, and Todd has obliged us by designing the Girl Friday die! \n6 New Henchmen can be encountered during the game. Each one will give you a special ability! \n6 Gun Molls will cross the paths of your detectives and inspectors, potentially giving you a permanent ability or clues. \nBut be careful to not fall in one of the 6 new traps in the expansion!\n  For more details on the components and rules of Pulp Detective click HERE\nWe are also taking advantage of the second expansion release to solve the minor issue of the mixed color cubes. Todd has designed something great with the yellow and black cubes, which were inside the base game boxes, and we will add the blue and red cubes to the expansion box, which were missing last year.  \nDownload the draft of the English rules HERE\nT\u00e9l\u00e9charger la version Fran\u00e7aise des r\u00e8gles ICI \n\n Add $8 to your pledge to get an additional set of all 8 dice (6 from the base game, and 1 from each expansion)\nWe'd love for you to try Pulp Detective before you back the campaign!

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art, it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends.\n Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems.\nImmersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay. We are responsible for the following big titles: This War of Mine: The Board Game, The Edge: Dawnfall, Lords of Hellas, Nemesis.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded seven Kickstarter projects.

The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.\n\nGame and all components will be produced in China and will be up to the highest quality standards that we hold for our previous games.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Digital Tainted Grail (PC)", "descp": "One Steam Code for Digital edition of Tainted Grail for PC, including early access to the game.\nIMPORTANT: It is already included in all other pledge tiers with Core Box for free!\nThis reward does not include shipping.\nINCLUDES:\nTainted Grail digital (PC) early access and steam code", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["380 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "Core Box", "descp": "Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon Core Box including all unlock Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

Continue below to learn about player powers, libraries, powerful component powers, and game-changing artifacts! \nAfter a limited print run in 2012, Atlantis Rising, like its namesake, virtually disappeared into legend.  We (Elf Creek) managed to get our hands on a copy and immediately understood what Zee and Sam at the Dice Tower loved about this game.  Gripping, tense, thrilling, truly cooperative.  We fell in love.  It's been a joy to work alongside designer Galen Ciscell to bring this game back, with the same core gameplay and new revised features that make it better than ever.  And with the gorgeous artistic work of Vincent Dutrait, it's been a dream come true.  But you don't have to take our word for it. \nAtlantis Rising: Second Edition preserves everything that was cherished and loved from the original edition. The feeling of dread and tension, that rises like the tides along the island shores, the mix of calculation and risk needed to succeed, the stories that the game creates with each play\u2014it's all still here. And it's been improved upon:\nMore strategic choices created by redesigning additional worker recruitment in the Cities and the Wrath of the Gods round tracker (replacing the original's Atlantean Navy)\nNew asymmetric variable player powers that have quickly become a favorite of the new edition's playtesters, that help you feel like your character is in the world helping to save Atlantis!\nAs the floodwaters rise, the tension builds, and hope begins to falter, players now also feel a sense of progression, at their own increasing capacity to stem the tide. New library artifact cards grant players ongoing abilities and the cosmic gate components feature powers that are now reusable.\nFor the first time, a dedicated solo mode and simple ruleset variants to help the two and three player games play with the same excitement and tension as larger player counts.\n But, as with the original edition, you don't have to take our word for it. \nGames will ship in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to keep customs fees & VAT as low as we feasibly can. Rewards shipped to backers in the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China will be shipped to backers from within those regions. The amount under \"You Pay\" is what will be added to your pledge when you select your reward (we have already included a base amount for shipping to our pledge levels). Backers from Thailand and Indonesia: Your shipping costs should be $16. We made a mistake when creating the rewards and Kickstarter is adding $26 to your pledge. We sincerely apologize for this. Please check the FAQ for instructions on how to proceed with your pledge.\n  Any questions?  Just ask us, either in the comments or by message. \nThe Champaign-Urbana Community: Our local board gaming community is an amazing source of support, advice, and encouragement.  Whether it\u2019s a casual board game night or an intense playtesting session, we love playing games with y\u2019all.  We cannot thank you all enough for your playtesting, feedback, advise, and friendship.  Curious parties can learn more about our community at www.cudoplays.com and facebook.com/cuboardgames \nWe Make Games: We loved working with Bryce Walter of We Make Games on the End of the Trail project video and were excited to work with him again on Atlantis Rising.  He\u2019s a wonderful person and talented creator and we cannot wait to see what\u2019s next for him in the greater board game community.\nCoalition Game Studios: We want our games to be the very best that they can be.  As with End of the Trail, we partnered with Coalition Game Studios for blind playtesting and we cannot recommend Mike and his team enough for their feedback and hard work with Atlantis Rising. \nMatt Paquette: We first met Matt at Gen Con 2018 and we are blessed to have him working on the Kickstarter page as a creative director.  Matt has worked with AEG, Floodgate Games, Brotherwise Games and others in the board game community and we greatly appreciate his insights and guidance with our campaign.\nPhilip Glofcheskie: Philip has spent over 20 years in the art and game community and recently ran a successful Kickstarter for Wunderkammer. We are thrilled with the work that Philip has done on our Kickstarter page and can\u2019t wait to see the work he will be doing in the future.\nJoseph McDaid: We want to thank Joseph for all the hard work during the past week in assisting with our Kickstarter. Joe has been working alongside Matt with creating the animated gifs for the page. He has also worked with Roxley Games on their Kickstarter projects. \nProtospiel: We are blessed to have been able to playtest with the designers and playtesters that are part of the Protospiel community this year and the game improved due to their valuable early feedback at Protospiel Minnesota and Protospiel Milwaukee. We wish all the designers and publishers that are part of that community well. \nStonemaier Games Design Day: Speaking of early feedback, one of the first places where Atlantis Rising: Second Edition was playtested at was the 2017 Stonemaier Games Design Day. We want to thank the Design Day community for their feedback and Jamey Stegmaier and Alan Stone for hosting such a tremendous event.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAtlantis Rising is Elf Creek Games's second Kickstarter project. We fulfilled our first game, End of the Trail, on time, getting it to backers ahead of its public release at the Origins Game Fair this past June. We are working with the same game manufacturer (Panda GM), where many of the non-printed components are already in production for this project. Any concerns that came up during the manufacturing of End of the Trail were addressed quickly and taken care of in a very timely and professional manner. This is one of the reasons why we are proud to partner with Panda moving forward.\n\nWe are continuing to partner with Quartermaster Logistics for fulfillment in the US and parts of Asia, with Aetherworks for fulfillment in Australia and New Zealand and with Gamesquest for the UK and elsewhere. We also have decided to add Happy Shops as another European fulfilment partner as well as Snakes and Lattes as a partner for Canada. Partnering with these companies will allow us to have shipping and fulfillment costs that are great for our customers and they will work with us to make sure that the fulfillment process with Atlantis Rising: Second Edition goes as smooth as possible.\n\nAs Kickstarter enthusiasts ourselves, we understand that sometimes it is necessary to cancel a pledge, even after it has been collected. Hardships occur to everyone and we want to be a company that understands the issues that backers might face. To this end, we will offer 100% refunds within 90 days of the campaign ending. We will offer a 100% refund within 60 days of receiving your reward.\n\nLastly, we are anticipating for Atlantis Rising: Second Edition to be a larger campaign than our first campaign, End of the Trail. Every campaign brings with it new challenges and learning experiences. We have the utmost confidence in the experience and expertise of our partners to help us along our way. And we have worked to establish relationships with publishers throughout the industry who are always willing to offer us their advice and support. We will be keeping you, our backers, up to date each step along the way. After the campaign, we will be reaching out to you at least once a month and will be available to answer any questions that you have in a timely manner.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 59 or more", "title": "Atlantis Rising - Standard Edition", "descp": "A copy of Atlantis Rising, including relevant stretch rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nAtlantis Rising - Standard Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["149 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 69 or more", "title": "Atlantis Rising - Deluxe Edition", "descp": "A copy of the deluxe version of Atlantis Rising, including all relevant deluxe stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nAtlantis Rising - Deluxe Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,057 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Retailer Pledge (see below)", "descp": "This pledge level is for BRICK & MORTAR stores in the US, CA, EU, AUS, and NZ (and only them), for up to 10 copies of Atlantis Rising.

We are excited to be working with designer Kevin Riley from Action Phase Games, as well as Indie Boards and Cards to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam, with your help!\nAeon\u2019s End is right at home at Handelabra Games. The combination of deep strategy and cooperative gameplay will feel familiar to fans of our other games like Sentinels of the Multiverse and One Deck Dungeon. Like other deck-building games, you begin a game of Aeon\u2019s End with a basic deck and gradually improve it with new cards as you play. Aeon's End distinguishes itself by adding several innovative mechanics. Randomized turn order simulates the chaos of battle, and deck management rules invite careful planning of every discarded card.\nThe Project:\nWe are adapting Aeon\u2019s End into a digital tabletop game you can play on your Windows, macOS or Linux PC via Steam. As with our previous projects, we are working in Unity.  \nThe digital version of Aeon\u2019s End will cost $19.99 (USD), but backers can get the game for just $15. The 1.0 retail launch on Steam will include all Aeon's End base game content and features:\n8 playable mages, each with a unique starting card\n4 nemeses to defeat, each with their own mechanics\n27 unique player cards (gems, spells, & relics)\n22 general nemesis cards\n53 nemesis-specific cards\nLocal co-op play with 1-4 mages\nInteractive tutorial so you can learn the game while you play\nBrand-new music composed by Jean-Marc Giffin\nSteam Achievements\nSteam Cloud Saves\nAll unlocked promo cards and mages from stretch goals\nThe Kickstarter Edition delivered to backers at the $20 level or greater will also include the following:\nFree digital download of the Original Soundtrack ($5 value)\n Kickstarter Exclusive Digital Player Card Sleeves and Playmat - Alternate in-game background and card backs that show your support. More info here.\nAeon's End is already a huge success on the tabletop. It was Kickstarted in 2016, with standalone expansion War Eternal, and a new Legacy version in 2017 and 2018.  \nAlready familiar with Aeon's End? Visit this link to try the 5-minute demo now! Or read on for a preview of gameplay.\nAeon's End is a deck-building game. That means you start with a basic deck and gradually add cards to that deck as you gain new relics, gems, and spells to play.\nDuring the main phase, players typically begin by playing gems to gain aether. \nAether is the currency of Aeon's End that allows you to gain cards from the supply.\nAdd gems, spells, and relics to your hand to build your deck. \nYour goal is to defeat the nemesis while protecting the city of Gravehold. You damage the nemesis by using your spells. Spells must first be prepped to opened or focused breaches. Then, you can cast these spells on subsequent turns to deal damage.\nOne innovation in Aeon's End is variable turn order. After each round, the order of turns is shuffled, keeping you on your toes and echoing the chaos of battle.\nAnother innovation of Aeon's End is in deck management. Since you never shuffle your cards, you can carefully manage your deck by planning the order in which you discard your cards.\nOn the nemesis turns, watch out! The Nameless have many ways to turn the tide of battle, including dealing damage to your mages, attacking Gravehold itself, discarding your cards and more. \nIf your mages become exhausted by reaching 0 life, or if Gravehold is destroyed, you have lost. \nTo win, you must either reduce the nemesis to 0 life, or survive the entire nemesis deck and eliminate any remaining minions or powers in play.\nThanks to a new service called SIMMER, we can offer you a short demo of Aeon's End in your browser right now! This is a 5-10 minute experience aimed at giving you a feel for how the game will look and play in a general way. This is a pre-alpha build of the game and covers the first few rounds of a 2-mage game vs the Rageborne nemesis.\nYou can try the demo embedded below, but we recommend you click here to play the demo on SIMMER. Click the full-screen button below the lower right-hand corner of the game for the best experience. The demo works best on an up-to-date desktop browser that supports WebGL such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. Enable hardware acceleration in the options for best results. \nSIMMER is a great tool for developers to host builds of their Unity games for others to try out and play. Visit SIMMER.io for more info.\nYou can also check out a playthrough of the tabletop game here.\nDevelopment Streaming Schedule:\nWant to see how the game gets made? We\u2019ll be doing live development streams every Wednesday at 1 PM Eastern on our Twitch channel during the campaign to give you a peek behind the curtain. If you can't watch live, don't worry - we always post our stream to our YouTube channel afterwards. See below for the schedule of topics we will be covering each week:\n Wednesday November 7th: Spell-crafting - See how we implement a spell in the engine, hook it up in the UI, and create a damage effect animation! (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 14th: Making a Mage  - Watch us bring a mage to life by implementing their ability and starter card in the engine and UI. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 21st: Tier 2 Arrives - Join John with special guest designer Kevin Riley to chat Aeon's End digital and see John bring tier 2 cards to the demo. (Watch it here.)\n Wednesday November 28th: Nameless Nemesis - Join David as he begins implementation of the Nemesis Carapace Queen.\nAeon\u2019s End will be delivered to backers as a Steam Key, redeemable on the Steam Service for 1 copy of the game. All Kickstarter backers will receive their Steam Key when the game first becomes available in Steam Early Access. All rewards will be delivered via BackerKit, a great service that streamlines the process of post-campaign surveys and fulfillment.   \nWe are planning to ship Aeon\u2019s End to Steam in the first half of 2019.\nWhat is Steam Early Access? \nEarly Access allows people to play games during their development and give feedback to the developers. We plan to bring Aeon\u2019s End to Steam Early Access several months before the game releases to retail.\nAll backers who choose a reward level that includes a copy of the game will be able to participate in Early Access if they choose.\nSame price as retail, but includes a copy of the Soundtrack + Kickstarter Exclusives!\n* What does it mean to become a member of the beta team?\nBecoming a beta team member means you will get access to the private beta of the game via Steam ahead of any retail or Early Access launch. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. \n* What does it mean to be a member of the alpha team?\nBecoming an alpha team member means you will get access to our alpha testing interface. This is a text-based, rules-only implementation of the game, used to test mechanics. You will play the game to help us discover bugs, report them, and help us make sure the game is as good as it can possibly be. The alpha testing interface will become available to backers shortly after the Kickstarter closes.\nMembers of the alpha and beta teams will be instrumental in helping shape how the new, digital-exclusive promos and mages will play! All content is tested first by the alpha team, then by the beta team before being released to the public.\nWe\u2019ve secured 2/3 of the development budget for the base game already, but we need your help to get version 1.0 completed and shipped in the first half of 2019. \nBut fully funding isn\u2019t the end of the story. The other reason we are using Kickstarter for this project is content. The base game provides countless hours of replayability with its 8 mages and 4 nemeses, but there\u2019s plenty more where that came from!\nAeon\u2019s End has lots of existing promo and bonus cards that we hope to bring to the digital game. We\u2019re also working directly with designer Kevin Riley and our other partners to craft brand-new exclusive content for the digital game. Kevin is taking full advantage of the digital medium to make new content that would be tricky (or impossible) in physical form.\nAnd finally, expansions. The world of Aeon\u2019s End has grown tremendously through expansions like The Depths, The Nameless, The Void, and The Outer Dark as well as the full-sized expansion War Eternal. Through stretch goals, we hope to secure enough funding to bring all that content to the digital game as quickly as possible.\nAs we mentioned above, we will be using BackerKit as our pledge manager for this campaign, which will help us manage add ons. Available add ons:\n $5 - One copy of the Original Soundtrack\n $15 - One additional Steam Key for the game\n $20 - One additional Steam Key for the Kickstarter Edition.\nUnfortunately, the higher levels cannot be added on, as they are limited. If you know someone who would like to become a member of the Alpha or Beta teams, you should have them back the campaign themselves.\n Promo-Packs include 1 Player card and 1 Nemesis card. Some cards are existing promos, while some will be brand new!\n Into the Breach: In her search for the domain of the Nameless, Mist has opened a breach to a strange world known as Mynerva, but someone has returned in her place!\n Xae from One Deck Dungeon joins Aeon's End as a new, digital-exclusive, playable mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley. (More info in this update.)\nAlthough she longs to return to Gravehold, for now, Mist joins the heroes of One Deck Dungeon as they battle in Mynerva! Mist for One Deck Dungeon is being designed by Chris Cieslik of Asmadi Games and will be a FREE addition to the game!\n First Expansion: The Nameless will be added to the development schedule! This expansion adds 2 nemeses and 1 breach mage to the game, as well as new gems, relics, spells, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \n OblivAeon's End: After tapping into the power of the Void, NightMist found herself pulled in and trapped for what felt like eons. So, when she felt a weakness in the fabric of the Void, she lept for it, tearing her way into a new reality and leaving what she knew behind. Now, the Void-powered creature who was once Faye Diamond has materialized in a new place called \u201cGravehold\u201d. (More info in this update.)\n NightMist from Sentinels of the Multiverse joins Aeon's End as a new digital exclusive playable Mage, designed for digital Aeon\u2019s End by Kevin Riley.\n Second Expansion: The Depths expansion will be added to the development schedule. This expansion adds 1 nemesis and 3 breach mages to the game, as well as new spells, relics, gems, and minions. You will be able to add to your pledge to receive this expansion. \nCheck back for more stretch goals as the campaign continues!\nShow your Aeon's End spirit with custom avatars!
