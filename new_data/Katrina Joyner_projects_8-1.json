[{"backer": "Katrina Joyner", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "There are over 1,200 roads in Columbia, MD.  My name is Rick McCray and I am a resident in Columbia, MD.  I am a 39 year old husband and father of 3 boys.  I currently weigh 375 pounds.\nMy father died of a sudden heart attack in 2016.  He had a heart condition and other health problems and when he passed away he was only 61 years old.  I know that I am currently much heavier than he was when he was my age.  I have to stop going down this unhealthy path so I can be here to see my sons and nephews grow up and so my Wife and I can hold our grandchildren someday.\nSo, 1,200 roads in Columbia, MD?  This year I am going to walk 500 miles on many of the roads of Columbia in order to exercise and lose weight and I am going to document it all.  Hopefully, I can learn some things about this city, the people in it, and a few more things about myself.  With this walk I honor my family.  Join me.\n WHY 500 MILES? \nIn doing my research I keep seeing that taking 10,000 steps per day (which is the equivalent of walking 5 miles) for 5 days per week can burn up to 3,500 calories.  This means I could lose 1 pound per week.  This sounds time consuming, but I believe I can break that 10,000 steps/5 miles down into morning/afternoon/evening walking sessions and accomplish my daily goal.  Tracking the total journey for a span of 500 miles will give me a gameplan to attack my fitness journey and keep me focused.\nMe contemplating 500 miles.\nOld Dobbin Lane at dusk.\n COLUMBIA, MD  \nColumbia, Maryland is a planned community started in 1967 that was envisioned by James Rouse.  The city was created as an example of a place where racial segregation and class divisions would be purposefully fought against through intentional city planning and progressive ideals.  Taking this walk as a Black man in 2020 in the era of Black Lives Matter is personally meaningful and I am going to record my reflections upon this as I travel the city over 50 years after its inception. \nColumbia Crossing sign.\n STREET NAMES \nColumbia has the most unique street names of any city I have ever lived in.  The streets were named after works of art and literature.  I always get a kick out of looking up and wondering how the city planners came up with the quirky names on the signs.\nExpressive street names.\n #bigmanwalks \nI am documenting my journey everyday on Instagram using the hashtag #bigmanwalks and my Instagram handle is the same name.  I am going to capture the highs and lows and hopefully seeing my own progress can motivate me and you to keep pushing in our journey.\nBeauty in the shadows along Snowden River Parkway.\nHOW I TRACK MY PROGRESS\nIPhone Health App\nI use the iPhone Health App to track my steps traveled.  If you have an iPhone it is that application with the heart symbol that says \"Health\".  It keeps a record of your daily steps and compares it to what you did yesterday/last month/last year.  I will use that and create a total for my progress that I can hold myself accountable for.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCOVID-19 The biggest risk is that during a pandemic I could get sick. The best way to prevent that is to keep my mask up, keep social distancing and wash my hands repeatedly. My family and I have been doing this religiously and because I am going all over Columbia, MD with Big Man Walks I will keep doing that.\n\nFAILURE TO FINISH What if I don't go a full 500 miles? Did I mention I was 375 pounds? Going from mostly sedentary to moving several miles a day is a huge improvement. I am winning just by starting the journey. But, my goal is to finish it and see this through. I will be video recording my walks and taking pictures to document this journey.\n\nWHY $5,000? I am making this film as a documentary--this is my actual life and nothing about my walking the streets of Columbia, MD will be fictionalized. The costs of professionally filmed, edited and marketed documentaries can be fairly high---but I want to start with a small budget and as I garner more attention hopefully I can get more financial support.\n\nHOW WILL I DO IT? I believe on days I walk I should cover from 3-6 miles. Columbia has mostly short streets in neighborhoods and long streets that serve as connectors for different parts of the city. It is my goal to walk on the streets, beautiful paths and gorgeous parks this city has to offer to reach and hopefully exceed my 500 mile goal.\n\nHOW CAN YOU BE AN ALLY? Thank you for getting this far. If you aren't Black and believe in equality and justice for all people, but you don't know what to do--please support this work. I am only one man, but I will always do my best for my family, my community and my people. Support and share this project. That is a small way you can help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rick McCray\nFirst created \u00b7 94 backed\nA big man changing his world one step at a time. #bigmanwalksSee more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Social Media Shoutout!", "descp": "I can't thank you enough!

When Greater Iran is on the verge of attack by the armies of Rostam's very own son, Sohraab, there is only one person fearless enough to answer the call to defend her friends and family. Her name is Gordafarid! Find out what happens in The Bravery of Gordafarid.\nWhat is the Shahnameh?\nThe Shahnameh is an Epic Poem completed over 1000 years ago by a man called Ferdowsi. It features fascinating and larger than life characters engaged in amazing drama that unfold the mythology and history of Greater Iran. It's full of action, adventure, romance, and intrigue while containing fantastic metaphors and wisdom that can apply to all aspects of life even today.\nStatue of Ferdowsi in Tehran\nWhat's also important about the Shahnameh is that it was composed during a critical period in Iranian history when it's very culture and language was being erased and replaced. Ferdowsi's Shahnameh helped play an integral role in preserving the Persian language and true Iranian cultural identity.\n THE REWARDS\nThis Kickstarter campaign features a wide variety of Shahnameh For Kids rewards packages such as:\n\nThe Books\nYou also have the option to have your books signed or personalized by author, Arsia Rozegar at no additional cost.\nThe first Shahnameh For Kids book, \"The Story of Zal & Simorgh\"\n     Activity & Coloring e-Book\nEvery rewards package also comes with a brand new downloadable PDF with printable Shahnameh For Kids Activity and Coloring Pages. Perfect fun for a rainy day. Featuring different coloring pages, word games and much more!\n Limited Edition Exclusive Art Prints\nYou also have the chance to get your hands on any or all three of these exclusive limited edition Shahnameh For Kids art prints featuring famous characters from Ferdowsi's Shahnameh.\nChoose from:\nArt Print #1: The first enlightened man and first Shah, Kayumars\n  Art Print #2: Hushang discovers fire\n  Art Print #3: Prince Fereydoon and Kaveh the Blacksmith\n Get Drawn in the Book!\nOne of our rewards packages includes the option of being immortalized in the book itself! Have you or your loved ones drawn as a background character in the book of your choice.\n A Little Bit of Damavand\nNow you can carry a little bit of Damavand/Greater Iran with you at all times. This package comes with a small vial of earth taken personally by myself directly from the foot of the legendary mountain. The majesty of Damavand and the Alborz Mountains play an important role in Iranian mythology.\n The Illustrations\nIt was important to me that the art not only visually catered to both kids and adults, but that there was also an authenticity to it as well.  Actual historical reference as well as nods to classical Persian miniature paintings were used in creating the art to Shahnameh For Kids. I found that working with the talented Mike Amante on the last book proved to be very positive and I simply had to have him return.\n Why Am I Doing This?\nAs a Iranian-American kid growing up in the US, it was frustrating at times not seeing my culture or its history accurately conveyed. I wanted to create something that properly represented Persian Culture for not only Iranians to enjoy but everyone the world over. I think it's important to appreciate all cultures and celebrate diversity. With that said, I cannot express how much I loved producing The Story of Zal & Simorgh. The book's feedback from everyone has been immensely positive. But there are simply many more great tales to tell from The Shahnameh. Which is exactly why this Kickstarter is for two books. Rostam is arguably the most famous character in the Shahnameh and his adventures are literally the stuff of legends. While Gordafarid's tale of bravery and heroism needs to be told as well simply for what she stands for and represents to little girls everywhere.\nHow Can You Help?\nA pledge would be awesome! Maybe you know a classroom or library that these books would make a great addition to. It would also make a thoughtful gift for anyone who is a fan of The Shahnameh or World Mythology. But if right now's not the time for a pledge, please help spread the word! If you know a family, a teacher, or organization that would have interest or appreciate Shahnameh For Kids, please let them know! Tweets, Facebook posts, and other social media posts are also a great way to help promote the book's Kickstarter campaign. #ShahnamehForKids #CelebrateDiversity\n\nYou can connect with Shahnameh For Kids online:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nInstagram\nTelegram\n\n\nWhen will the books be shipped?\nBooks will be shipped out as soon as each produced book is ready to go. The Mighty Rostam book be produced first with The Bravery of Gordafarid to come out subsequently after. Rostam is estimated to be completed by the Winter Holidays with Gordafarid hopefully before Nowruz /Spring. If you backed a Rewards Package that includes, The Story of Zal & Simorgh, that book will be ready to ship as soon as the campaign ends.

He's worked in the entertainment industry for over ten years primarily as a concept artist for videogames, but his real passion is telling stories, usually in comic or illustrated book form. He enjoys creating new worlds for big AAA games, but a few years ago he found himself being pushed further and further away from the kind of work he really wanted to do, so he started writing his own stories as a creative outlet. \n     Soon he was enjoying his personal work a lot more than the studio grind, so he left Southern California and moved up to Portland (a place he had never visited) to set up shop as an independent artist. He still works enough freelance to pay the bills, but he works on the comic when he gets any spare time. It's taken a lot of sacrifice (He makes far less money and has zero free time, etc.) but so far it's been one of the best decisions he's ever made. He loves creating art again. Hopefully, with your help, he can continue.\n     Doug is a dog. A very hairy, very mysterious dog. Mac doesn't know what kind he is, but everyone asks. If Doug knows, he isn't telling anyone. Doug is super secretive about his past.\nWhat is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is the #1 crowdfunding platform for independent artists and entrepreneurs, helping creators find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality.

Simon Blood is an all-ages graphic novel inspired by my favorite movies and comics. If you like Moebius, Uderzo, Miyazaki, Asterix, Arzach, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, then you just might become a fan of Simon Blood. Simon Blood will be a 54-page full-color book that\u2019ll include several covers, sketches and illustrations. The book is being written and drawn by me, and colored by Flavia Caracuzzo, my daughter, and it\u2019s scheduled to be finished in August of 2016, and shipped out to backers in October of 2016. The book will be translated in English and Italian.\nThe idea for Simon Blood was in the back of my mind for several years. With time, that idea grew in my mind, and has become a fantastical world where monsters, vampires, zombies and anthropomorphic figures come to life in a series of dynamic actions and extraordinary landscapes. It will be an epic trilogy, inspired by classic tales of adventure, with a mythology and technology that will amaze you. It\u2019s a story that will entertain and inspire the imaginations of all ages. This project is very important to me and Flavia. it\u2019s the opportunity to realize our desire, an idea that unites us, we promise our best, help us make this dream come true.\n Flavia working progress\nPLAY\n\nSimon Blood takes place on Harsac, a planet divided into two hemispheres. In the Northern Hemisphere, there is light, trees, lush forests, high mountains, rivers, lakes and seas. It is inhabited by many people: elves, dwarves, trolls, fairies, and gnomes. Among the Kashar people is Simon Blood, a cheerful, ambitious youth, accompanied by a small dragon named Dal\u00ec. On the other hand, the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by King Xe and Queen Oky, who reign with cruelty and without mercy. The Southern Hemisphere is perpetually in darkness, a huge and dangerous place where vampires, zombies, werewolves, and terrible creatures are eternally fighting against the North.\n Giancarlo working progress\nPLAY\n\n Simon Blood, is the protagonist of our story.

Their kingdom is a land of fear and death, the infernal abyss...\n Lhem\u00f9 and Rupert, the two young friends of Simon, live in Damash Town, and are orphans like Simon.\nTHE COST\nI'm asking for A LOT of money for Print and Shipping. but Half of the funds are going to the production of the content, and the other half is getting the books printed and shipped.
