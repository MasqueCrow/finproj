This poster is part of the Limited Edition Poster Reward.\n\nNeedless to say, we fully agree with this. We had been dedicated to filmmaking for more than 20 years before we embarked on the adventure of starting our own flip book publishing house, and we loved the idea of doing a project that combined both worlds: flip books and cinema.\nTHE PIONEERS is a tribute to these very earliest trailblazers. A collection of ten cinemagic flip books that represent the essence of their works, the very first projects involving the moving image ever made. \nThis collection is a declaration of love for those pioneering talents who sowed the seeds of a revolution that is now a fundamental part of our lives: the cinema.\nIt was no easy task to narrow down the selection of outstanding pioneers to ten. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, these innovators spent years refining their techniques, implementing new technologies and discovering unique optical tricks in no way inferior to those of modern-day YouTubers and TikTokers.\nDuring our research we kept coming across female pioneers, great creators who managed to assert themselves in a male-dominated world, but unfortunately very few of their works have survived, and they have now largely fallen into obscurity. We are proud to include two of them, namely the great Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 and Lotte Reiniger, in this selection.\nFinally, we have come to a great lineup of ten visionary figures, who we consider to be major revolutionaries in their field, whether from the primitive beginnings of the moving image, such as the phenakistiscope and chronophotography, or from the early days of cinematography, animation, optical tricks and the first forms of on-screen narrative.\nScroll down to discover each of the people who make up this collection in more detail.\nThose of you familiar with the Flipboku flip books know that we like a little magic! Our flip books feature a clever trick that owes its success to a sophisticated assembly technique, and this is why we call them cinemagic flip books. As a result, when flipping the pages of the book, you can see up to six different animations instead of one or two like in a normal flip book. Let the entertainment commence!\nThis eye-popping optical illusion allows us to include an impressive 60 film sequences in The Pioneers Collection, representing the first decades of the history of the moving image, from the phenakistiscope to the first colorized films.\nOur cinemagic flip books are surprisingly easy to use and provide an unfailing source of delight to viewers of all generations.\n\nBut there\u2019s more to discover with this collection: in addition to the six film sequences hidden inside the flip book, each edition features a micro-documentary on the life of the respective pioneers, which adds an extra dimension to the experience of learning about their work. These documentaries will be incorporated into each of the flip books using augmented reality and are viewable by simply scanning the cover with a smartphone or tablet.  \nThis feature allows us to add another dimension to the Pioneers Collection as well as an extra educational resource - it's a great way to learn more about each artist's life, their background and their most outstanding works. The feature will be available thanks to an easy-to-use iOS and Android app developed by our friends from Artivive, a revolutionary AR company based in Vienna, Austria.\nTo access the AR content, simply scan the QR code included in the flip book, install the Artivive App, open it and view the flip book on your screen. Easy peasy!\nIt was important to us to not only create a pleasing artifact for people's bookshelves but also to give the edition an additional educational purpose, bringing the stories of each pioneer to younger generations in a fun and interactive way. We have taken the collection to schools and film schools and have received exceptionally good feedback both from the students and teachers.\nStudents can discover the film material in an engaging interactive way using a medium that represents a precursor of cinema itself, while at the same time, thanks to augmented reality, the collection bridges the gap between old-school and cutting-edge technology. A truly unique educational tool for all generations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this edition, we have taken great care with the details.\nSince most of the sequences are in black and white, we liked the idea of contrasting the design with a vibrant color palette, using elements from the film footage for the cover pages and sleeves.\nSome of the creators, whose projects preceded the cinema itself, worked with inventions such as the phenakistiscope in the case of Joseph Plateau or chronophotographic techniques in the case of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey and Eadweard Muybridge, and we have turned these into animations in order to see them in action. In the case of Marey, because these are overexposed photographs that capture movements in action, the result is pretty astounding. \nFor the other filmmakers, we have researched and watched hours of footage from each of them, finding truly extraordinary treasures, and although we have tried to provide a balanced selection of their filmographies, it is impossible to do them complete justice after discovering so much wonderful material.\n\nOnce all the material was selected, we proceeded to subject them to digital restoration and then focused on the design of each edition. \nWe've created an exclusive limited edition reward that includes, besides from the Pioneers Flip Book Collection, a unique print of \u00c9tienne-Jules Marey's backflip jump chronophotography.  This technique was achieved by overlapping celluloid prints one on top of the other, making it possible to discover the different stages of movement, in order to study their relationship to each other in a single image. It is without a doubt one of our favorite images. This reward also includes the full set of AR postcards created exclusively for the campaign.\nFor this campaign we have come up with several appetizing bundles, which may eventually find their way onto your bookshelves.\nBy way of a taster, we\u2019ve created an attractive set of 10 cinematic postcards, one for each filmmaker, perfect for mailing or to be used as bookmarks. Like the flip books, these postcards include the augmented reality feature and each of them will reproduce a micro-documentary with extra information when scanned through the Artivive app on your smartphone or tablet.\nFlipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and film music composer Julie Reier. We have both been working in the world of film for many years and love all things related to animation, books and design. We loved the idea of having our own flip book publishing house, so we started the project in 2016 and it has grown steadily since then.\nToday, the Flipboku team is made up of seven members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The rest of the team consists of the invaluable hands of our two illustrators and graphic designers Noemi Aiolo and Erika Godino, and our irreplaceable production technicians Gustavo Berdayes, Tom\u00e1s Pons and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Pineda, responsible for the entire production process.\nSince 2019 we have had our own printing workshop where 100% of the production is carried out. This means that the entire production process is under our control, allowing for precise results and finishes, in harmony with our commitment and obsession with design and quality. It took us several years to refine our cinemagic flip books and their optical illusion features, but thanks to the talented hands of our experienced print masters, we were able to fine-tune the concept to perfection.\nHere you can get a glimpse of the super effective teamwork of the Boku crew:\n\nEven though we are already experienced flip book makers, there\u2019s a lot of work that goes into developing an entire collection like The Pioneers. We\u2019ve spent endless time researching, going through hours of film footage while contacting museums, film archives and production companies to find the best material. Then we had to restore and set up each of the 60 sequences and make them suitable for a flip book format.\nNow we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to bring the flip books to life and get them to the printers. While our print team works on the production, we\u2019ll focus on planning the development and production of the ten micro-documentaries, one for each author.\nTherefore, we\u2019ll need even more footage from archives that needs to be edited and subsequently processed; ten scripts have to be written, voice-over-recorded and mixed, which also applies to the music for each film. Finally, all this content has to be integrated as augmented reality into each flip book.\n\nShipping will be charged AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the survey stage.\nBelow is an estimate of shipping costs broken down by shipping area. These are only estimates; however we commit to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\n\nADD ONS:\nAll individual flip books and bundles can be added to your pledge AFTER THE CAMPAIGN and at the same cost. We intentionally chose not to offer Kickstarter add-ons within the campaign to keep the survey process as easy as possible for everyone. Shipping costs for add-ons will be charged by weight; this way we can calculate them as precisely as possible. \n*Shipments for all flip book bundles will include tracking. For the postcards you will be able to choose between tracked and ordinary shipping; the price list shows ordinary shipping rates. The shipping costs are expressed in Euros and US dollars.\nWe are extremely grateful for your support and would love to see you on board!\nSpecial thanks to our friends from Artivive, Caroline Hall, Christel Strobel, Ghent University Museum, Marjan Doom, Biblioth\u00e8que des Archives fran\u00e7aises du film, L\u2019\u0153uvre cin\u00e9matographique des fr\u00e8res Lumi\u00e8re, Filmoteca de Catalunya, Filmoteca Espa\u00f1ola, Internet Archive, Path\u00e9 Archives, Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise, Hartley Moorhouse, Alexander Anderson, Marmoset Music, Tumalo, Beatriz Tejeiro, Jonathan Garc\u00eda, Backercamp,  Daniela Sanchez, ICEX Next, and IEB Institut d'Estudis Balearics.\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The design is optimized virtually through our cutting-edge flight path simulator to create the straightest small diameter putter possible within the Professional Disc Golf Association standards, while still offering great grip comfort for both putting and driving.\nDistance in meters\n\n\nThe flight of the Hydrogen is truly unique: Being a very low speed disc, it can hold an anhyzer for any shot between 30 and 90 meters (100 and 300 ft) without neither turning over or flattening out. Likewise, on a hyzer, it will hold the line without flipping up or hyzering additionally. Throw it flat, and watch it go straighter than any other disc you have ever thrown! This is why the disc has the flight characteristics of:\nSPEED: 1       GLIDE: 2\nTURN: 0         FADE 0\nThe exact same properties carry over when putting. With the hydrogen you don\u2019t have to compensate for your putter being too overstable and you don\u2019t have to worry about it flipping over in a headwind putt. Additionally the disc has a rather low glide, ensuring that it will drop to the ground fast in the rare case that you miss the target.\nHydrogen is designed to hold it's line as well as possible within the standards of the PDGA - but not at any cost. Moving the weight of the disc as far away from the middle as possible is one of the ways to make a disc fly straight, so in theory a large diameter disc turns and fades more slowly than a small diameter disc. But we wanted to make sure that the disc made sense to use as a putter, so comfort would always have to be a priority. We wanted to maintain the excellent comfort that small diameter putters have. And on top of that, a small diameter also serves the purpose of lowering wind resistance, lowering glide, and most importantly: Making it easier to hit and stay in the basket! So within this framework, we optimized the straightness of Hydrogen with four key physical features: \nMeasurements in millimeters\nThe flight plate is very thin towards the middle, thickening towards the outer edge of the disc. This moves mass away from the center, and also makes the disc feel a little more shallow near the rim of the disc.\nThe rim is very thin and pretty blunt on the outside, which increases drag (ie. lowering the speed) and decreases the overall pitch moment, which means that no matter if the disc is turning or fading, it is doing it more slowly.\nThe parting line is the line on the outermost edge of the flight plate, which is one of the key parameters to change a disc's stability. This line is placed at the exact spot that gives the most neutral stability possible for the speed Hydrogen is designed to be thrown at, which is rather low speeds. Therefore, you will rarely see this disc fade, unless thrown really nose up. And likewise, you will only see the disc turn when thrown really hard.\nThe flatness and the shoulder profile of the disc ensures low glide. besides making the disc stay in the air longer, glide also makes a disc drift further to the sides when it isn't flying flat, which is very helpfull in some situations, but for the Hydrogen we wanted the disc to push straight forward, even thrown on a bit of anhyzer - or hyzer like you can see in the clip below.\nPLAY\n\nThe disc will be released in two high-end plastic variants. The \u03b1-Solid plastic is our most durable plastic. It offers excellent grip for driving purposes, while having a medium stiffness and a shiny surface finish. The \u03b2-Solid plastic is our putter-optimized plastic. It is relatively stiff, but still with a great grip and a slightly tacky feel. The Beta plastic beats in quicker, allowing you to have various amounts of wear and tear of the same mold.\nOur stamp is based on our logo, which forms the word 'l\u00f8ft' [\u02c8l\u00f8fd] meaning lift or levitate in Danish. Our version of the peculiar letter, \u00d8, that is framing the entire stamp is a recurring reference to our name and to our Danish origins. We deliberately foresee that non-scandinavians will pronounce our name \"loft\", which correlates nicely to the meaning of the word.\nThe box with the disc's name is a reference to the periodic table - also refereing to our scientific approach to disc design. Therefore we used the chemical symbol H for Hydrogen, but instead of keeping the atomic number and weight etc. we used the four conventional flight characteristics; speed (top left), glide (top right), turn (bottom left) and fade (bottom right). \nWe use elements from the periodic table to name all our discs. This has the benefit that discs can be categorized in two axis: Stability and speed. We use the periodic system so you already by hearing the name, can determine whether it is a overstable, understable, high speed or low speed disc. Names for elements with fewer protons in the top of the periodic table are used for low speed discs. Names for elements with fewer valence electrons to the left are generally used for more understable discs. \n\nDisclaimer: Hydrogen is not understable, even though it is to the left in the periodic table. We just only had 2 choices for the lowest speed.\nWe aim for making all discs 174-176 grams, but they will all be more than 172 grams.\nTo make the pricing fair for everyone, shipping is payed individually. We have gathered the best possible shipping prices for a long list of countries of which we expect most rewards, but we ship to anywhere in the world!\n\nWe expect to deliver as soon as April 2021!\n\nIf you ship to outside of European Union, keep in mind that local import fee and taxation may apply. This, however, is not the case in Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein and Switzerland.\n\nIf you live on an island far from mainland, delivery can take up to 1 month as we may ship by boat. You may therefore receive your reward later that others.\n\nIn very rare cases additional shipping fees may apply for larger orders. This includes orders to The \u00c5land Islands, Svalbard, Corsica, Madeira, The Azores, The Balearics, Canary Islands. But don't worry, we will reach out and find a fair solution.\n\n If you have any other questions regarding shipping, feel free to ask us.\nWe are completely devoted to this project, and every penny leftover from pledges will be reinvested  into making your experience even better. Therefore we commit to following stretch goals if we reach more pledges than our funding goal:\n\nREACHED: \u20ac10,000 - Storage box\nHydrogen comes in a white cardboard storage box with graphics.

But it is far from that. Through half a year of collaboration with Kastaplast on his bachelor's project in mechanical engineering, founder Niels S\u00f8rensen developed the beginning of what today is our flight path simulator. With the assistance of good friend, economist and founder, Asger Sandahl, they succeeded in actually simulating flight paths of discs in 3D. This sparked the idea of using the tool to develop discs, instead of relying solely on assumptions and epxperience. \nSoon the idea of optimizing a putter with regards to flying as straight as possible was born. They joined forces with Kasper Jakobsen, who, with his education in IT and product development and experience in video production seemed like the perfect match.\nSince then, it has been all hard work, and L\u00f8ft Discs is more than ready to present their ideas to the world!\n\n\nL\u00f8ft discs is much more than a kickstarter project. Our vision for the future is to make the highest quality discs for all purposes and push the boundaries for disc golf discs. \n\nNew Molds\nWe have already started the design phase on our next 3 molds launching as soon as we have the resources to do so. The more support we can get through Kickstarter, the quicker the world will see our next discs. \nOnline Flight Path Simulator\nNext year we launch the Beta-version of our 3D flight path simulator for everyone to try out. You will be able to compare every L\u00f8ft disc with the most popular discs on the market. We will over time grow the disc library of the tool, but it can take several days of work to extract data from one single disc.\nTournaments\nwe are commited to grow the sport. Therefore we strive to help organizers make great tournaments, both smaller and bigger ones. We have already co-sponsored two danish tournaments and are planning more for the future. \nMaterial Research\nThe \"Solid\" part of Alpha-Solid and Beta-Solid refers to the relative stiffness of the material. We plan to expand with Alpha-Liquid and Beta-Liquid - Softer and even more grippy variants of the  two plastics, that will also have much less rebounce against trees and other obstacles.  Furthermore, we will start researching for the next generation of plastics: Theta-Solid and Theta-Liquid - Environmental friendly materials that will be bio-based and/or bio-dgradeable, so that we in the future can reduce the environmental footprint of the sport. The name, \"Theta\", is a hint to the Ecology Flag that has the greek letter Theta on it.\nIn 5 years\nWe love disc golf - and we believe that we can help the sport to grow even more. Our hopes and expectations are therefore to be one of the major golf discs producers within the coming 5-8 years. We have so much to offer that the sport haven't seen before and we hope to be able to share our ideas with the amazing disc golf community. We see no limits for neither us or disc golf as a sport - Even though there are only 118 elements in the periodic table ...so far.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs of now (Dec 17) the molding tool still need one iteration including embossment and polishing.

It all depends on your appetite for thrill...Still looking at you, kid wearing aviator goggles!      \nKeeping the Slide Secure \nStairslide's patent-pending design uses unique features to prevent it from moving during use.  Made with durable, high-tensile strength plastic, Stairslide can withstand frequent use. It's surprisingly light weight, which makes it easy to adjust or reposition on stairs. We chose this material over less durable (and less expensive) options that would otherwise be discarded after normal wear and tear. Providing a long-lasting solution allows our customers to add additional Stairslides to their collection as little ones grow and become more adventuresome. Collect all colors!\nStairslide Dimensions\nStairslide is over 40 inches long and approximately 20 inches wide with a 14 inch seat, leaving room to use the adjacent stairs (most stairwells are at least 36 inches wide). We recommend placing Stairslide against one wall and using the space next to Stairslide to climb the stairs. Please measure your stairwell to ensure sufficient space before purchasing Stairslide. A single Stairslide weighs over five pounds. \nHow Many Stairslides Do I Need?\nNot all stairs are alike. But start with the number of stairs you're trying to cover and divide by three (round up, of course) since Stairslide covers approximately three steps and they are designed to overlap a bit! Get two or three Stairslides for six steps. Get three or four Stairslides for nine steps. Etc. We recommend placing the bottom of Stairslide on the first step above ground floor to allow your child to step off at the ground floor.  \n How Did We Get Here? \nThe process started with a simple, rough sketch. Then we worked with an industrial engineer to create a small model using a 3D printer. But the pieces would not fit together in a way that allowed the slide to stay in tact on the stairs. \n3D Printed Model\nThen we tried to scale Stairslide with a few adjustments that were meant to duplicate what we see on the playground. Clearly, this was not going to work because it was too heavy and too bulky.\nStairslide Prototype 1.0\nWe realized not all stairs are created equal. Stairs' rise and tread measurements can vary. And we wanted a solution that would accommodate a variety of stairs. So we started playing around with the \"telescoping\" feature. And the first prototype had curved handles at the top of the slide (see image). But it was too heavy and it frequently fell down the stairs during use.\nSome stairs are carpeted. Some are wood. And we were determined to create something that can be used on just about any size or construction material.\nAfter a little tweaking we finally figured it out! We finalized the design and had the final prototype made for testing.   \nRewards\nBack us early and score up to 40% off the expected retail price of Stairslide! The standard color is white and additional colors were unlocked as we achieved our stretch goals. Shipping costs are not included. We will handle shipping after our crowdfunding campaign ends. We're still looking into estimates.\nStretch Goals\nThanks to our backers we've achieved all of our stretch goals and unlocked four new color options! Thank you! Backers can select their color after our crowdfunding campaign(s). We'll reach out and get your selection.\nOther Ways You Can Help\nWe realize some wish to contribute to our Stairslide campaign but cannot make a financial contribution. There are still numerous ways you can help. And we would be ever-so grateful!\nGet the word out and make some noise for us! Share the Stairslide campaign with you friends and family on all of your social media accounts using the Kickstarter share tools!\nReport counterfeit products or fraudulent copy-cat sites. Our patent-pending Stairslide is such a great idea that disreputable people will pretend to offer it and steal your money. Report them to PayPal, Facebook, Instagram, etc.\n\n When Will I Get My Stairslide? \nFulfilling orders may take some time. We want to deliver Stairslide to you by mid-April. But first, we need to finish our 40-day Kickstarter campaign. Then wait for funding. Then create the mold. Then bulk production. Then shipping.\nThe production lead time for a mold is about 45 days and bulk production lead time is approximately 55 days. That means we need funding from Kickstarter by November 15 and orders need to ship out to you by April 01 if we are to achieve our mid-April delivery goal.\n\n Who's Piloting This Project? \nJacob is a family man--a father to five amazing kids and second in command to his super supportive wife. He's an entrepreneur with executive experience starting and operating product-based companies.\nCraig's also a family man with four darling children and a very patient wife, whose orders (requests, really) he tries to follow with exactness. Craig has helped build several companies, leading marketing and product innovation. Check out his other successful Kickstarter campaign: PEEjamas!  \nOur story is simple. Jacob's kids love to slide down the stairs. They used to use sleeping bags. Jacob's wife was concerned about their safety. One day she asked Jacob to invent something safer that could be stored when not in use. Jacob reached out to his neighbor, Craig. He loved the concept. They launched Stairslide. The end.   \nAs one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management and more.\nWhy Do We Care?\nWe care about families. We care about preserving the carefree innocence of childhood. And we care about safety. We designed Stairslide to be as safe as possible without compromising important features like the ability to easily store it when not in use, durability, nesting, etc. \nSome backers have asked about a weight limit. Ongoing field testing has yielded promising results. Stairslide can support a person up to 175 lbs without signs of structural weakness when used properly. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to make recommendations that help ensure the safety of our users.\nUsing Stairslide in any way other than its intended use may result in injury. Such risks simply cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential qualities of Stairslide. Stairslide may need to be adjusted slightly after repeated use. We recommend inspecting Stairslide's position on the stairs after each use; if it has moved away from the back side of a stair's tread simply reposition it to help ensure safety. \n Tell Me About The Budget!\nDelivering on time and as promised is important to us. We sourced multiple manufacturer quotes for Stairslide's components and concluded that single-sourcing Stairslide will give us the highest chance for success. The quote we agreed to includes cost of materials, labor, assembly, and shipping Stairslide to a place where the bulk order can be broken down for individual shipments. Naturally, the mold tooling is the largest expense.\nWe've further broken down the categories into individual components. It's likely we'll be able to find more cost effective suppliers over time, however the budget provides a reasonable basis for determining a ceiling on our funding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe need your help to take Stairslide to market. We will do our best to deliver Stairslide as promised, but our project has some risks that include:\n\n1) Manufacturing Delays: Our timeline is a conservative estimation that includes a few \"buffer\" days in the event of unforeseen delay. We want to under-promise and over-deliver. But there is no way to guarantee Stairslide will be produced by our published date.\n\nWe can, however, guarantee transparency and accountability so that backers are not surprised by bumps in the road.\n\n2) Product Design Changes & Product Challenges: Stairslide's final prototype works. We've used it ourselves. But there are always limitations to testing; not all stairs are the same. And feedback from backers or customers may result in the need to adjust the design down the road. If there are ways to optimize packaging by changing the design then we may consider that. We may need to alter our design to compensate for alternative components. Since we have limited control over the raw material suppliers that our manufacturer uses there is a risk that Stairslide's structural integrity could be compromised.\n\nWe will work closely with our supplier(s) to ensure Stairslide is manufactured according to specification.\n\n3) Shipping: Stairslide is a relatively heavy and bulky item. And expected shipping costs will be consistent with its weight and size. Shipping costs are not included in any of the pledge-reward tiers and will be added after the campaign ends. We appreciate backers' understanding since our shipping costs are likely dictated by the order quantity and the order quantity is not known until after our crowdfunding campaign(s) ends. Once the campaign(s) ends, backers will be contacted about how they would like Stairslide shipped to them. Naturally, shipping costs will vary by delivery location.\n\nWhile we cannot guarantee that shipping costs will be favorable for all backers, we can assure backers that we will work to reduce shipping costs as much as possible. We intend to do this by sourcing multiple options for fulfillment partners who can be as competitive as possible.\n\n4) Product Safety: We designed Stairslide to be as safe as possible. And we did it without compromising important features like portability, durability, nesting, etc. Stairslide is intended to be used by only one person at a time, weighing not more than 175 lbs and in a sitting position. Using Stairslide in any way other than its intended use may result in injury. Such risks simply cannot be eliminated without jeopardizing the essential qualities of Stairslide. Stairslide may need to be adjusted slightly after repeated use. We recommend inspecting Stairslide's position on the stairs after each use; if it has moved away from the back side of a stair's tread simply reposition it against the stairs to ensure safety.\n\nWhile every attempt is made to embody the highest degree of protection, we cannot guarantee freedom from injury. The User assumes all risk of injury due to use, assembly, or transportation. All merchandise is sold or distributed on this condition. No representative of Stairslide LLC can waive or change disclaimer condition.\n\nDO NOT slide down head first. Landing on the head or neck can cause serious injury, paralysis, or death, even when landing on a (tumbling) mat.\n\nDO NOT allow more than one person on Stairslide at a time. This could result in serious injury.\n\nDO NOT use if your weight exceeds 175 lbs.\n\nDO NOT use if the rubber strip underneath Stairslide has been removed.\n\nDO NOT use if Stairslide is not securely positioned against the stairs.\n\nDO reposition Stairslide back up against the stairs after every use to ensure it is in a secure position.\n\nDO slide down in a sitting position with legs pointed straight down.\n\nDO use Stairslide with adult supervision always. We recommend using Stairslide on stairs with at least one foot of landing space for every stair covered.\n\nLegal Stuff & Liability Disclaimer (\"Waiver\")...\n\n1.

In other words, how much we consume, how much we generate and how much time we spend on our different daily activities in the course of our lives. In short, all those little big details that define us as one of the most peculiar species on the planet, among all the particularly strange species that exist.\nIf you have ever wondered which is the footprint you leave on the planet simply by existing, this game may bring you some answers, while also providing you with some good laughs with your friends and family.\nIf you are familiar with our previous projects, you may know that we are a publishing house which specializes in flipbooks, so we couldn't help including a fun little flipbook feature into the card deck. To discover the animation that we have hidden for your entertainment, you just have to arrange the cards in the right order, slide your finger as if it were a flipbook and that's it! Magic Flipboku style! :)\nThe animated sequence was created by our great friend and incomparable animator Nacho Rodriguez. An animation genius with a hypnotic and organic style. The sequence is also in a loop, so it doesn't matter when you start turning pages, in the end it will work as long as you keep the cards in the correct numerical order. The sequence is based on a continuous transformation of elements from different illustrations that you will find in the cards. A real treat for the eyes and thumb. \ud83d\udc4d\nIt's very easy. The player in charge of asking the question in each round takes the first card from the deck, chooses one of the two questions and reads it out loud. Then, he/she and the rest of the participants have 1 minute to write down their answer. When the time is up, each player reveals his/her bet. The person in charge of that round reads the answer on the back of the card, and the player with the closest number to the correct answer, wins.\nObviously, you will sometimes be way off track with your guess, but what is better than laughing at yourself (except of course laughing at others :D). There are detailed instructions offering variations of the game and score, although the objective is always  the same: to come nearest to the correct value to win each round.\nTo allow as many humans as possible to play, Do You Realize How Much? will be available in 3 languages: English, Spanish and German. You will be able to choose the version you want after the campaign, when leaving us your shipping details in our pledge manager.\nWe do not rule out developing possible future editions in other languages, as this would allow us to reach even more humans. :)\nWe affectionately call them Human Zero. They are the result of a match between a man and a woman, inhabiting a developed Western country with a life expectancy of 79 years. All numbers correspond to an average of this Human Zero, the Frankenstein of Do You Realize How Much?.\nSince humans are not the center of the universe (or at least shouldn't be), we have designed 2 more fabulous extension packs that can be perfectly combined with the Human Edition: The Animal Edition and the Space Edition. Each edition contains 200 more questions and answers: together the 3 editions make 600 questions and answers - a real number madness!\nThe ANIMAL EDITION includes 200 questions and answers from the animal world, all kinds of interesting data, incredible facts and extraordinary curiosities, in short, everything the amazing world of the animal kingdom has to offer.\nIf you are a space lover or would like to know more about its incredible mysteries and dimensions, then this is for you. The SPACE EDITION is all about spaceflight, rockets, galaxies, moons and stars, planets and the amazing facts and conditions with which man went to the Moon for the very first time.\nBoth the Animal Edition and the Space Edition are not only fun and entertaining but also very informative and great learning tools for both, adults and kids (recommended minimum age is 12 years).\nAll the numbers that you will discover in this game are the result of the investigation and research of multiple sources, which were reviewed, compared and processed until we reached the most accurate result possible. Therefore they are approximations or averages based on statistical data. They do not represent an absolute truth, they are figures that reflect the footprint of an average human (the Human Zero exposed above) and obviously can vary over time (hopefully they will change for the better).\n\nEach answer is complemented with additional information such as an equivalence, fun facts, shocking revelations or comparisons that help you visualize the magnitude of the numbers in our human footprint and their impact on the planet.\nThrough this comparison, the number, which at first is merely abstract, takes on another meaning and we can picture the distance in our minds since we have a reference to compare it with.\n As we know that not all countries use the same units of measurement, to facilitate the understanding of the game and avoid you having to make tedious conversions, all the answers are expressed in the two most important units of measurement: pound-kilograms, inches-centimeters, yards-meters, miles-kilometers, gallons-liters, etc. \nYou are right! Indeed, the pair of humans featured in the illustrations are the same ones that were etched into a metal plate and launched into space in the early 1970s on Pioneer probes 10 and 11. The idea was that if the ship was intercepted by extraterrestrial intelligent life, they would be able to decipher where the artifact came from and which creatures sent it - our first business card sent into space!\n48 years later we are looking for the same thing, but instead of wanting to be discovered by aliens we are hoping to rediscover ourselves! And what better than to have the fearless couple of the Pioneer probes as reference models in this journey of discovery of our own human footprint.\nGood design and packaging are always of great importance in our projects. So we have developed an attractive and handy box that, apart from helping you to arrange the cards while you play, will protect them when you take the game on the road.\nAll three editions include 100 cards each, featuring two questions and answers as well as two unique illustrations per card. Each card has a small number in the upper left corner. More about that in the next chapter ;)\nOur fascination with the human footprint goes back years, and we have always had  the idea of making these breathtaking numbers visible through different formats. Over time we have come to the conclusion that the best way to do this is through a card game. A unique card game that will make you think, take a wild guess, discover, imagine, estimate, laugh, reflect, marvel at and become aware of the astonishing numbers that our nature and human footprint reveal!\n\nIn addition to having a great time with friends or family, our ultimate goal is to help raise awareness of our human footprint. And who knows, maybe push you to modify some consumption habits, make better decisions and thus become better and more sustainable human beings. And if we are lucky, contribute a tiny little bit to building a better planet for future generations, because the way we are going, we will clearly not get very far.\n\nA card game is an excellent learning tool; it\u2019s portable, handy and in this case, it\u2019s a game with very simple rules that does not require any complex instructions.\n\n\nShipping will be charged AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d stage.\nBelow, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. These are only estimates, however we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay. All shipments will include tracking.\nADDITIONAL COPIES: All cards and flipbook editions will be available as Add-Ons in our pledge manager, after the campaign. For each additional copy there is a 2\u20ac shipping fee, for smaller flipbooks like Molecularis or Blanko that you might like to add to your pledge, the shipping fee is 1\u20ac.\nFlipboku is a publishing house located on the beautiful island of Mallorca, specializing in one-of-a-kind flipbooks. The project is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and film music composer Julie Reier. We have both been working in the world of animation for many years now and love all things related to animation, books and design. We loved the idea of having our own flipbook publishing house, so we started the project in 2016 and it has grown steadily since then.\nThe Flipboku team is completed with our illustrators and graphic designers Noemi Aiolo and Erika Godino, besides our irreplaceable production team lead by Gustavo, Tom\u00e1s and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n. Our last addition to the team is Ricardo Espinosa, writer, old friend and collaborator in the development of this game project. We also thank Nacho Rodr\u00edguez, Andy Bernstein, Victoria Amengual and Mat\u00edas Ar\u00e9valo for their continuos support!\nThis is our 4th Kickstarter campaign with Flipboku, and we have successfully completed 3 more with our studio Zumbakamera, so you could say we are already Kickstarter veterans. Crowdfunding allows us to finance the production of our publications in advance - which is a huge advantage for us. Kickstarter is also a great platform to reach more people all over the world and to make our project known internationally. Not only have we been able to make our dream a reality, but we have also gained a loyal and growing community that has been supporting us over the last few years. We think this is the best gift you could ever imagine.\n\nDo You Realize How Much? is our first card game after having published 10 flipbook editions, however the goal is the same: to create unique formats that are not only fun, but also useful whether in a creative, artistic or educational way.

We're Misen.\nWe design and make premium kitchen tools at fair prices. To preorder our Dutch Oven and make it a reality, click Back This Project. Or read on!\nAll backers receive 7qt Dutch Oven base and their choice of grill OR traditional lid.\n The Misen Dutch Oven offers premium durability, updated features, and superior cooking \u2014 at a reasonable price. \nThe dutch oven is a workhorse. It can saut\u00e9, sear, boil, fry, bake, and braise, from the stove, to the oven, to the table.\nUnfortunately, premium dutch ovens that last a lifetime are insanely expensive and overpriced. And cheaper, low-quality ones are prone to chipping and scratches \u2014 making them useless in just a few years.\nWe think there should be a better option. Premium quality and durability that will last forever, but sold for a fair and honest price.\nHigh-End Protection Against Chipping & Cracking\nWe used 4 layers of FERRO enamel (the strongest enamel available) to prevent chipping, scratching, and cracking. It\u2019s the luxury brands\u2019 secret to life-long reliability.\nCheaper brands have hand-dipped enamel, creating uneven coatings that crack and chip more easily. Our modern spray application ensures an even coat that\u2019s consistent down to 0.02 mm. Zero imperfections make for a lifetime of toughness.\n4-layer FERRO enamel system prevents chipping.\nSuperior Durability: The Ball Drop Test \nWe dropped a 2 lb. metal ball from a 3 ft. height into each dutch oven to simulate metallic impact.\nWe wanted to make sure that our dutch oven was the most durable on the market, so we put it to the test.\nWe dropped a 2-pound steel ball from 3 feet in the air to simulate the dutch oven owner\u2019s worst nightmare: a hard metallic impact. Cheap dutch ovens chipped and flaked almost immediately. But drop after drop, Misen's enamel coating remained chip-free and outlasted the competitors. Including the most expensive ones.\nOur enamel outperformed the cheap brands, and matched or exceeded the expensive brands.\nGrill Lid Makes This Dutch Oven Even More Versatile\nDutch ovens can already do almost anything in the kitchen. We wanted to make ours even more versatile.\nSo we designed a grill top lid that provides the same tight seal as our traditional lid, but can also be used alone as an indoor grill. The same premium cast iron and enamel layers help create a nearly-nonstick grilling experience and perfect browning.\nIf you prefer the traditional knob-style lid, don't worry \u2014 we offer those too.\nExtra Versatility and Protection\nThis added silicone lid creates an airtight seal on your Misen Dutch Oven \u2014 handy if you\u2019re using the grill top lid and base at the same time. It\u2019s highly durable, PFOA-free, oven-safe, and made from platinum-grade silicone.\nPlus, it stacks neatly between the lid and base when you\u2019re storing them away. \nPremium durability, at a fraction of the price.\nWe don't think you should have to choose between wildly expensive \u201cpremium\u201d pieces and the lower-quality cheap dutch ovens.\nLuxury brands are durable, but carry unnecessarily high price tags thanks to clever branding. By working closely with our factories and selling directly to you, we're able to offer the same quality (or better!) at a much more reasonable price.\nOur goal was simple. Create the most durable dutch oven possible, and sell it for a price that\u2019s fair and affordable.\n Nearly Nonstick, Zero Maintenance Needed, Dishwasher Safe \nOur enamel is smooth enough to be nearly nonstick without any maintenance.\nMost messes just need a gentle soak and scrub to wipe away. Our dutch oven is also dishwasher-safe (though we\u2019d prefer you hand-wash)!\nThoughtful design updates to a classic piece make this dutch oven even easier to use at home\n The Millimeters Matter \nWe spent over 18 months researching and developing the Misen Dutch Oven. We asked questions and received tons of feedback from our community on what they liked (and didn\u2019t like) about these pieces.\nWe didn\u2019t want to reinvent the wheel. Dutch ovens are already amazing cookware pieces, but we found a few small ways we could update the traditional design for an even better cooking experience.\nFinally, we\u2019ve got something we\u2019re proud of. Design and tooling are complete, and we\u2019re ready to go into production. But we need your help to make it happen!\nHelp make the Misen Dutch Oven a reality by picking a reward tier below, and backing this Kickstarter!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,400+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $500M raised in total.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo project is risk-free, and as with most projects, our biggest risk is timing.\n\nFortunately, this is our 6th Kickstarter campaign, so we have a lot of practice delivering on exciting campaigns for thousands of people.

Inside, there's a printed strip of paper with an equal number of images in sequential order. As you spin the zoetrope and look through the slits, they act like a camera shutter, or a strobe, causing the images to flicker and come to life with a phenomenon known as \"persistence of vision.\" The animated strips are easily swapped out for other strips, like going through animated gifs on instagram or twitter.\nIt's the physical interaction of early cinema devices like these, (the analog in a digital world) that makes people smile and connect to them. My artwork ( artnofood.com ) has turned flipbooks into sculptures, brought the mutoscope out of it's clamshell and even added gears to the ph\u00e9nakisticope (hard to say, but oh so much fun to play with). I love it when my work takes a simple gesture, design, or even a story, and presents them in new/old ways. And then I started to look at what I could do with a zoetrope... \nThis lamp is called \"SpermatoZo\u00ebtrope.\" It will also be available in baby blue.\nFor my updated version of the Zo\u00ebtrope I wanted to honor the original concept: a hand powered animation device with changeable art. First I replaced the slits with some invisible tech such as LED's, magnets, custom electronics... That allowed me to put the art on the outside and light the Zo\u00ebtrope from within (lamp). And with more room, came more frames \u2013 hundreds of frames. Now, armed with a larger canvas and more frames, the fun was just starting. \nI soon discovered new ways to create animations that are linear, cyclical, up, down, backwards, forwards, and sometimes all at once. I look at each Zo\u00ebtrope Lamp like a short, recuring film. I have so many ideas that I can't wait to bring to life. All that's needed is a simple twist and suddenly, it\u2019s more than just a beautiful lamp. It\u2019s an animated work of pre-cinema art.\nAnd, while not really needed, I added an umlaut above the \u201ce\u201d in Zo\u00ebtrope. My niece, Zo\u00eb, also has an umlaut.\nWhat will the funding be used for? \nFunds raised will be used to produce all the custom electronics, the tops, the bottoms, the specialty printing, and all the other parts needed to bring these Zo\u00ebtrope Lamps into the world. \nTHE TIMELINE\n September - Launch Kickstarter.\n October - Campaign ends.\n November - Ship Flipbooks. Ship Ph\u00e9nakisticope.\n November - January - Manufacturing, printing, assembling and, packaging of the Zo\u00ebtrope Lamps. \n February - Ship the Zo\u00ebtropes. The spinning begins.\nPlease note: The hope is to ship sooner, and we will if we can. Just wanted to give more time for any possible Covid related delays. \n AND NOW, THE REWARDS: \nThis the ph\u00e9nakisticope in action  \nPLAY\n\n\nI like to use friends as models. That's Kent murdering Annabelle 10 minutes after they met. No worries, she\u2019s fine, the knife was cardboard covered in aluminum foil. Besides, Kent's a really nice guy and wouldn't hurt a fly. Maker's fun fact, I shot my model friends on a green screen so I could change the apartments behind them. But Kent was stabbing so fast it was difficult to silhouette the arm with the knife, and it was my favorite take of the \"murder\" My solution? A mostly green abstract painting on the wall, no need to silhouette.  \nBehold the Spinning Magrittes. That's Cheng by the window and in the sky. George on the bottom and near the roof. And that's me as the littlest Magrittes.\nThis is Sloane Rocking in Slow-Mo. Video by her dad Dan. (Try following one column as it rises.)\n WHY 2 LAMPS?  \nSo you can share the magic that we create together. Most of the work, from editing to the design of the Zo\u00ebtrope Lamp Shade goes into creating the first one. Why should one set of grandparents get a lamp when the other set is just as worthy? \nPongo thinks this is a great idea. FYI: There is over 201 Dalmatians on this lamp.\n\nMAGNET POWER!!! (A goal of $25,000)\nIn keeping with the original hand spun way of the Zo\u00ebtrope, I chose not to motorize this lamp*. The thought was to keep it simple and not have a constantly animated object. To create a cool object with a secret. By spinning it with your hand, you become a part of the action, as it becomes an \"event\" rather than a constant display of animation.\nWith a good spin, the Zo\u00ebtrope lamp can spin for several minutes until it stops and becomes a just a good looking lamp again. I want to add a magnetic assist that would keep it spinning for up to 10 minutes with just a slight twist of the lamp.\n*In the future, as I make larger Zo\u00ebtropes, I will be adding motors and/or hand cranked gears.\nPrototypes, experiments, behind the scenes\nthe abduction cow during a break in filming\nWhile it's nessecerry to show how my Zo\u00ebtropes Lamps spin in real life. Filming them creates rolling black bars and excessive flickering. It's an issue with syncing the Zo\u00ebtrope \"shutter speed\" to the camera film speed. So, I tried stop motion animation to film some tests. I turned each lamp 24x while stopping to take a photo at every 15 degree turn. \nHere are some tests, they are not for sale yet. I would need a license to sell these.  But, I look forward to talking to the fine folks at Disney, Pokemon, Warner, Sony, NFL, NBA, MLB, MTV, the Olympics. Reach out to hear more about ideas for content, how to bring them to life and would love to talk to someone about a license deal or two.\nPLAY\n\nHere's a Bruce Lee test.

Feel free to use the materials in our press kit. Every post, share, and pledge counts!\nOUR STORY : HOW BLOCC WAS BORN\nThe three wise monkeys using Blocc\nOur team is based in South Korea\u2014one of the first countries to be hit hard by the pandemic.\nWe often noticed people wearing masks and habitually touching their face out in public. After looking into this further, we found that the average person subconsciously touches their face 23 times an hour (source: https://bit.ly/2APII4I) and that this is an innate habit very difficult to break. Therefore, it only seemed logical for us to create a face shield that would block (hence, the product name) the hand from touching the face. We noticed that some people had already been using them, but none of them seemed to look comfortable or well-designed. This is why we decided to make one ourselves\u2014one designed for the average person to wear in public without feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable.\nOur sincere hope is that Blocc will help you become wary of your face-touching habit. With your help, we can make Blocc a reality.\n As one of the first crowdfunding marketing agencies, Enventys Partners has brought more than 750 crowdfunding projects to life through lead generation, campaign page creation, public relations, email marketing, Facebook Advertising, campaign management, and more.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is unique in that it began with us delving into a current, universal problem. We sincerely want to see people using Blocc ASAP, meaning we will not deviate from our published timeline and stay laser-focused on reaching the finish line as scheduled.\n\nWe have 6 years of experience in designing, testing, manufacturing, and shipping products globally. Therefore, we can say with confidence that we know the entire process from A to Z.\n\nHowever, no project is without risk, especially if it involves unexpected occurrences. Should a problem arise that may put us off track, we will make sure to fully brief you of the situation through the backer updates section, act promptly to solve it, and brief you again in detail of the outcome.\n\n\n\nRegarding refunds and cancellation\n\nKickstarter is not a store and it does not issue refunds.

It had to be: \nLIGHTWEIGHT\nBREATHABLE\nMACHINE WASHABLE\nand above all else\nCOMFORTABLE\nAnd while we were at it, we thought we'd try to make a shoe that would be good for the Earth too. \nInterested? \nBreathable\nYour beautiful leather shoes don't breathe, \nand that STINKS (literally). \nThe key to cool feet that don't stink are shoes that breathe. We designed the SUMMIT SHOES with a high-performance breathable mesh fabric. In fact, our whole clothing line is based on a stretchy, breathable fabric with a SECRET. \n OUR SECRET: Water bottles. \nYup, tons of water bottles. Americans use roughly 50 BILLION water bottles every year and only recycle about 23%. We want to make something that's not just useful, but AMAZING out of that recycled plastic.  \nOxford Wingtip Design (to look like a dress shoe!)\n WASH THIS WAY\nToss 'em in the wash. Can your leather oxfords say that?   \nMachine Washable\n Our wingtips will make you FLY!\nWe designed our SUMMIT SHOES with an oxford wingtip design. In a leather shoe, those holes are dead ends, but in our shoes, they are ventilated windows. Our lightweight shoes are lighter than leather and more breathable than wool. We are releasing our first shoes in the most needed colors for work: black and brown.\nUltra-lightweight\n  We KNOW where you walked last summer. \nYou may forget about comfort for a few steps when you are trying on shoes, but we don't. And your feet never forget an uncomfortable shoe. That's why we use customized memory foam insoles that make the SUMMIT SHOES comfier than your mattress. Trust us, your feet will thank you. \nComfort of a running shoe\n Do you know what else is a pain? \nUntying your shoes at the end of the day is a real downer. Our stretchy shoes can be pulled on and off. We started as a shirt company, but our stretchy shoe collars stay true to our &Collar name. \nStretch Collar\nYup, we thought of everything. \nThe perfect shoe for work and for play.  We just need your help to make it a reality.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGood news! Our first 1000 pairs are already manufactured and arriving to our warehouse here in the United States the week after launching this campaign. Those are ready to be shipped out, so don't wait on them. \n\nAs for the rest of the shoes, we know that there are sometimes circumstances out of our control (ie COVID-19), but we have proven that we can move beyond those by successfully fulfilling all orders on three past Kickstarter campaigns as well as over 5000+ orders and 30,000+ items since we've started.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe have designed our products to last years by using sustainable, high-quality materials.

If a product breaks down, we as a company take it back, inspect it, and then repurpose and reuse it.\nReusability and recyclability\nPackaging to date has been 100% recyclable, recycled, and reusable.

Yeah...they\u2019re awesome, even if you can\u2019t pronounce it. The magnet snaps the buckle in perfect place...oh and you can unlatch with one hand.. Just listen to that SNAP. If you have an ASMR fetish, try to hold it together. These bad boys snap and latch instantly. Honestly, latching your belt is now more addictive than Joe Exotic\u2019s tiger meth.   \nPLAY\n\nStretch-Tech\u2122 (aka just the right amount of stretch)\nYou know the deal. Your belt is either too tight or too loose (neither is a good situation). The Groove Belt\u2122 is comfier than the sweatpants you wore for 3 weeks during the Corona Pandemic.  These bad boys have just the right amount of stretch to keep you feeling comfortable and flexible.   \nPLAY\n\nSecure-Tech\u2122\nSet it and forget it design. Once you adjust the belt to the proper length, never worry about it again. Unless you go really crazy next Thanksgiving, just use our easy adjust to give yourself a little extra. \nStiff-Tech\u2122 (aka won\u2019t fold in your belt loops)\nYou know that belt you bought last time? The one that folds over at the back of your pants? The Groove Belt\u2122 doesn\u2019t. Whether you\u2019re climbing Mount Everest, attaching your tactical gear, or just grilling hotdogs in your backyard (let\u2019s be honest, the most likely), this belt is made with the perfect blend of durable, stiff webbing and stretch. It\u2019s going to stay on you like that bad tattoo from your last bro-country concert, without losing its form. \nSpace-Tech\u2122\nMade from recycled space shuttle cladding...Okay maybe not but we used the best materials on earth to make this the best belt EVER. Between our proprietary webbing, rare-earth neodymium magnets and A380 aluminum alloy buckle, you\u2019re basically ready for an apocalypse. Or for simply pulling up your pants an average of 5.24x per day.  \nPLAY\n\nWon't flap and get all loosey-goosey Tech\u2122\nNo one likes the end of a belt flapping around all loosey-goosey (please put that away.) That\u2019s why we designed the end to neatly tuck behind the belt. For the occasional rogue fly-away, we\u2019ve added our secure keeper loop. No more flap. \n94-Year Warranty\nYep! Just like our rings and watch bands, this belt is covered with a lifetime guarantee. So if you break it, you\u2019re good for a return free of charge for life (unless you make it past 94 years from now, but let\u2019s be honest\u2014your diet is not up to par for that).  \n\n\n\nJust in case you thought we threw this together over the weekend... here\u2019s a glimpse into the last 12 months. \n\n\nIf everything else didn't convince you to back the Groove Belt\u2122 maybe some photos of this sexy, beast of a belt below will seal the deal. \nAlmost as sexy as the Groove Belt\u2122 are our amazing ads.

Lose the weight of your thick wallet but never compromise on performance. With a few specialized pockets and cutting-edge technology, you have everything you need and more.   \nYou\u2019ve been telling us what you want, and our development team has been working hard every day to make it real. And now we bring you Blaze Wallet evolved form, the Strapo Wallet. With it, our new company name, Valmor Design.\nWith The Blaze Wallet, We Invite You To Be A Part Of Our Story Again\nThe story of the Blaze Wallet is a story of doing more with less -- of having a wallet that is sleek and thin but does just as much or more than a regular wallet.\nOur designers have pulled out all the stops to create something we dare to call revolutionary in wallet design.\nGone are the days where you have to carry around a thick, fat brick of a wallet that bulges and makes you \u201csit crooked\u201d all day.\nAlso gone are the days when a minimalist wallet is nothing more than a glorified money clip. We\u2019ve invented a wallet that truly does allow you to do more with less.\nWalk away from tradition and join the Valmor Design movement with your Blaze Wallet today!\nCrafted from classic top-grain leather that will patina beautifully -- each crease, nick, and mark burnishing it with one-of-a-kind highlights showing every step of your journey.\nCrafted from premium top-grain leather that will patina beautifully\n2 cards in front pockets\nCentral pocket that holds 3-4 cards, which is RFID protected\nPull tab strap to easily access cards\nHighly durable elastic band stores up to 3-4 cards\nDrop-free coin pocket\nLanyard loop/keyring attachment\nGPS tracker pocket\nBuilt-in NFC\nRFID protection\nWork ID or transit card easy scanning slot\nSlim, low-profile design\nEco-friendly packaging\nDavid vs Goliaths\nThe day was October 4th, 2017 - the evening before our first Kickstarter launch. We were done with all the work leading up to this big moment\u2026 and we were all super NERVOUS.\nAt that time we were going up against some of the biggest names in wallet design with huge corporate backing. From all appearances, we didn\u2019t stand a chance of becoming successful.\nOur Miracle -- The Underdogs\u2019 Comeback\nTowards the end of October, something amazing started to happen. Our Kickstarter got picked up by one big media outlet, and then we got picked up by another, and then another. Lifehacker, Kotaku, Gizmodo, and many more!\nBy the end of our campaign, we were over 7,000% funded. We had a big celebration the night after our Kickstarter.\nAnd all throughout 2018, while we were fulfilling orders -- emails were pouring in from people about the direction we should go next. Along the way, we learned some very important lessons.\n How we created Blaze Wallet \n Founded on a Dream and Passion alone \nIn the past 2 years, our company has been growing immensely and we were able to ship to 65 Countries. With the STRAPO wallet, it was always our mission to revolutionize ordinary purchases by providing extraordinary value.\nIn the midst of evolving our company, we wanted a name that clearly communicates our brand values. That\u2019s the reason why we chose the name VALMOR DESIGN for ourselves. It combines the words \u201cValue\u201d and \u201cMore\u201d and represents the marriage of so-called \u201cordinary\u201d products with a new standard of practical usefulness.\nIf you rewind our story all the way to the beginning, you\u2019ll see us making our first wallet prototypes out of duct tape. \nShipping: We are ready for production, As planned our first batch rewards will be shipped by the end of May 2020. We will ship V3 Minimalist Wallet to our backers worldwide. The shipping cost varies base on your location. You can find out the shipping cost in each pledge. However, there may be additional duties and taxes you might have to pay. In any case, we recommend checking your country\u2019s tax and customs laws. If we reship your package, the backer has to pay for the new shipping.\nReturn/Refund: While all of our products have a 1-year warranty, we do not offer refunds, returns, or exchanges on items received as Kickstarter rewards. The support we get from our Kickstarter backers is what enables us to run and grow our business, gather customer feedback, design new products and improve existing ones. In the Kickstarter community, the items that you receive after making a pledge are referred to as \"rewards\" because they are not purchases in the traditional sense. Think of rewards as gifts.\nWHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET\nAs a small business, it\u2019s often very difficult to secure enough capital for larger projects, especially one that requires such quality materials and craftsmanship. We\u2019ve turned to crowdfunding to help keep costs as low as possible, removing the strain of investor returns which would send the cost of the product higher. Once our funding goal is reached, we will be able to carry out our first production run, fulfilling the preorders made here. Please see our reward tier to secure yours today. It would also make a wonderful gift.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the experience of our previous project, we learned throughout this process. Learned from our mistake, now we know how to build quality products and deliver on time.\n\nDelays and unforeseen obstacles are an inevitable part of product development. Fortunately, most of the process is already complete. \n\nWe created multiple prototypes, tested for quality and durability. we have received production-ready prototypes that were made by the actual manufacturers that will be producing the final goods, so the processes and tooling used for production have been completely worked out. our final design is ready to start manufacturing. We learned a lot during our prototype phase, We\u2019ve got a lot of the hard work done, \n\nSupport us by backing this project and sharing on social media is equally important. Back us now.

The story follows Marie, a young woman who uses her secret passion for taxidermy to cope with debilitating anxiety.  \n Not just any anxiety--but the kind that can really knock you flat. In portraying characters with these issues, we are hoping to reduce the stigma around mental health and get people thinking and talking more about it. To start some conversations. We are also aiming to use the musical elements of the show to help us all better understand what it's like to live with anxiety. We have done our best to be careful in doing so--consulting with two fantastic therapists: Tony Overbay (check out his podcast \"The Virtual Couch\") and Paul Peterson.\n And not just any taxidermy--but an art form that uses only found animals (the kind you find on the side of the road) and antiques (the kind you find at a garage sale). If you're curiosity is piqued, Google \"Rogue Taxidermy.\" It's a whole artistic movement we stumbled upon last fall. We've since collaborated and consulted with two artists, Hollie Dilley & Jillian Abernathy, for two commissioned pieces for the pilot episode. \n*No squirrels were harmed in the making of this pilot.\n**But two were scavenged off the highway. \nThrough the combined efforts of an incredible team (see list below), plus some extra help from friends and family, we wrapped production of the twenty-minute pilot episode on September 20. The footage looks incredible, the three studio recorded songs sound amazing, but we need your help to finish things up and spread the word! \n Our goal with this Kickstarter campaign is to cover:\n $1500 in construction materials \n$2500 to cover post-production costs--everything that will make the final film look and sound amazing\n$500 to cover the rewards \nAnything beyond that will go towards festival submissions & additional recording for the score. \n Long term, our goal is to build an audience & support system that will allow us to carry the story beyond the initial pilot episode. \nTHANK YOU for contributing to The Anxious Taxidermist in whatever way you can!

It makes it possible to fly with ease and smoothness in a variety of conditions. \nSay goodbye to nosedives and choppy flights. We\u2019ve added a new on-board flight computer and 2 new sensors: gyro and accelerometer, combined with 2 thrust vectoring motors. That means flying POWERUP 4.0 is smoother than ever, and can now do all this:\n\nThat\u2019s right. POWERUP 4.0 can auto-loop. So you can master tricks and awesome aerobatics by simply pressing a button.\n\n\nWe\u2019ve added 2 high speed motors to POWERUP 4.0. That means you\u2019ve got double the thrust, additional maneuvering possibilities, and sharper turns. \n\nAnd together with the flight assist, you can fly just about anything\n\nNow you can learn to fly like a pro. We\u2019re showing you real-time analytics including heading direction, thrust level and turning angles.\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made it a lot easier and way cooler to fly POWERUP 4.0 at night. Optional LED lights will enable you to light up the night - making for awesome visuals and round-the-clock fun.\n\n\n2 rear wheels and 1 front wheel give your paper plane more style and make for easier takeoff and landing. They also make it possible to launch off of a surface rather than hand-launching. \n\n\n\nWe partnered with the best RC hobby vloggers on the planet \u2013 FliteTest! They have put together their incredibly creative minds to develop a foam jet inspired by the F22 for the 4.0. It is made from a special laser cut foam board they created and make in the USA.\n\n\nIntuitive control makes it easy to fly. Simply tilt your phone in the direction you want your plane to fly. It\u2019s really that easy.\n\n\n\n\nThanks to 3 super successful Kickstarter campaigns,400K+ happy customers, and more than $3.5 million in funding, we decided to bring you a new and improved paper airplane kit to add to your collection.\nShai Goitein - pilot, industrial designer, CEO and founder - decided it was time to level up again. So we listened to feedback from our POWERUP 3.0, POWERUP FPV and POWERUP Dart users, and made this the most powerful, most intuitive, and overall best version yet. Our brand new Autopilot Assist feature makes every flight a smooth one-- even in bad conditions. Real-time analytics help you become a better pilot, and two high speed motors mean you can get super creative with your plane designs. We\u2019ve even added optional LED lights so you can fly at night.\nPOWERUP 4.0 is breaking paper plane barriers, and we\u2019re excited to share this badass edition with you all.\nPOWERUP is an incredibly helpful tool when it comes to teaching and learning aeronautics. Students can test multiple designs, analyze their work and improve their planes. Through trial and error, they can understand what makes their plane fly smoother, longer and farther- key lessons in airplane design.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTross is a data driven Crowdfunding company", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're confident in our ability to deliver POWERUP 4.0 on time.

You and I would not be here today were it not for kimmel\u2019s feature on my project \u2013 I would like to thank everyone at ABC for giving me this opportunity. So! The magic recipe that gives rise to this campaign puts a walkie-talkie inside an avocado - this gives us a Guac-e Talk-e! I will be offering the devices themselves as well as t-shirts, stickers and pins all in support of generating enough money to startup device manufacture. Extremely important to note is that the promotional materials I\u2019m using presently were created with a different manufacturing platform in mind \u2013 namely creating the avocado enclosures by hand using an acrylic resin system in Guatemala City. This time around however, I will rely on a much more traditional approach. Please follow my project\u2019s progress on instagram @andysguacbar !

The search for a partner is still in the exploratory phase, quotes I\u2019ve received vary widely but basically the heart of the matter is that I\u2019m looking for a good teammate to take on this project with. That being said, if you are involved in an organization that would like to work with me please send me a message \u2013 we might be a fit. \n-------Radio Specs-------\nThe radios themselves are your standard license-free two-way radios; you\u2019ve likely used this class of radio going camping with your family or at a theme park. The government has guidelines on antenna power output and frequency allocation for FRS radios so in brief the technical details of this class of radio, albeit with some differences, are similar between one radio and the next.\n--------Prototype-------\n The guac-e talk-e prototype is made in two parts. The devices were initially created in Guatemala City using an artisanal, piecewise process. The radios themselves were purchased from a third party and I personally made all the somewhat rustic looking avocado shells. The guac-e\u2019s in the photos serve as proof of concept - what\u2019s clumsy and rustic-looking now needs some hard work and what comes out is an elegant walkie-talkie.\nThe Guac-e Talk-e Walkie-Talkie\nPLAY\n\nMerch\nguac pins!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe human capacity is boundless, a group working in concert to meet those needs is made up of individuals each doing their part to achieve that common goal.

We're working with the finest toy manufacturers in the world to make sure that we deliver the best materials that are fun to throw (not too light) and don't hurt when they hit you (not too heavy).\n\nIt's also very important to us that everyone gets their game on time. We don't want this to be a campaign where you spend the next two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want you to start throwing burritos at your friends as soon as possible. This is why we're not offering t-shirts or other non-game related reward tiers that would make the distribution process take a lot longer.

No need for expensive new hardware and software.

Then download the free Rocketbook app. When you scan your whiteboard with the app, the space aged machine vision will \u201csee\u201d the Beacons and quickly capture your whiteboard from any angle. \nRocketbook Beacons can modernize any size whiteboard you have hanging around. If your surface area is small, and every inch of writing space counts, simply cut the beacons to size and the app will still capture your work! The majority of whiteboards (over 3 feet wide or high) will work great without trimming!\nThe Rocketbook app will instantly adjust and visually enhance your scans so the digital version is light years ahead of the real thing.\nThe Rocketbook app allows you to assign 7 shortcut symbols to \"destinations\" in the cloud which could be any folder inside Dropbox, Evernote, Google Docs, your email address, and many other popular services.\nSet up the app to instantly beam your notes, diagrams, and big ideas. And save precious time by transcribing your handwriting with powerful optical character recognition (OCR) technology.\nFor crucial missions with a scattered crew, the app allows you to stream your whiteboard in real-time. Switch to \u201cBroadcast\u201d mode, share the unique URL and get ready to collaborate with your team anywhere in the world. Your private, real-time page is updated every time you scan your whiteboard. Or simply prop your phone facing your whiteboard and set the app to auto-scan every 5 seconds. \nRocketbook Beacons are made with space aged micro-suction technology that is specially designed to stick to whiteboard surfaces. This synthetic and durable material acts like millions of microscopic suction cups that cling to your whiteboard and won't deteriorate over time like other sticky adhesives.  The beacons can even be cleaned to ensure a quality bond with each use! \nThe Rocketbook app can transcribe your handwriting with OCR or \u201cOptical Character Recognition\u201d technology. Transcription allows you to send a digital text version of your whiteboard, or even search through all of your scans with keywords and phrases. You can even auto-name your files by placing two hashtags \u2018#\u2019 on either side of a title like ##THIS TITLE##.

SEND YOUR FRIENDS TO FUNDREIGN.COM!\nHello Champions of Liberty,\nHappy Independence Day to our USA supporters!\nMy name is Darin Southam, Writer and Director of Reign of Judges: Title of Liberty-- a breakout concept short film, like Braveheart, based on a $40M major motion picture.\nThe first North American (Book of Mormon) war epic set in the pre-Columbian New World.\nLate last year, we closed a record-breaking campaign as the Third ALL-TIME Highest Funded Short Film on Kickstarter. If you haven't seen it yet, please stop and watch our first Kickstarter below, before continuing:\nOk, so what's happened since then?    \nWe used the providential resources from our first Kickstarter ($171K+$50K raised outside Kickstarter) to over deliver on our campaign promises. In less than 2 months, we assembled an all-star cast and crew, including actors Ben Cross (Star Trek), Eugene Brave Rock (Wonder Woman), and Karina Lombard (Legends of The Fall). \nName actors weren't expected or promised at our budget level but we went ahead and got them anyways (fist pump). \nIt was a collaborative effort involving many different creeds, ideologies, and talents coming together to make an EPIC concept short film that will change the world and the face of cinema. Now, I\u2019m Mormon and I love Mormons, but for the skeptics who think this is just a Mormon film, it may interest you to know... \n90% of our cast and crew were NOT Mormon.\nWe completed post production on our concept film in record time (a month early, in fact!) and premiered it on March 15, 2018. Over 700 people attended. Check out the audience reactions from our first premiere:\nLos Angeles was next at the iconic Fox Village Theatre April 12th 2018 for another 700 people.\nThe response from our first two premieres was so tremendous it inspired us to a bold, first-ever (by demand) worldwide theatrical exhibition of a concept short film:\nSo, what happened next?     \nWell... \nWe sold nearly 10,000 tickets worldwide (most at $12 USD/each) in 34 U.S. States and 4 different countries. \nWith 425 ratings in three months, our concept short film has...\nRead IMDb Reviews\n80% of all our ratings are a full 10 stars.\nFor comparison, the top-rated full length films on IMDb rank at 9.2 Stars. \nSee full list\nHere are some of our favorite reviews: \n\"A worldwide phenomenon in the making!

Blu-rays and DVDs weren't offered during our first Kickstarter so this brings us to today.      \nOur SECOND Kickstarter. A campaign to fund our FULL feature by selling, for the first time on Blu-ray/DVD, our breakout concept short film and behind the scenes in...\nA Limited First Edition Blu-ray/DVD combo\nLimited First Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo\nNow, what makes these Limited First Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos so special?     \nWell, for starters, this is the FIRST and ONLY major Book of Mormon war epic concept film ever made and owning a physical Limited Edition copy will be cherished forever.\nWe're only doing this once and these Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos will be NUMBERED sequentially in order of of your pledges, so get yours early for a lower number!\nLike First Edition copies of The Book of Mormon, we're only printing 5,000 LIMITED EDITION Blu-ray/DVD combos. Can you imagine how much you'll treasure a Limited First Edition copy of our breakout concept short film and behind the scenes when our FULL feature hits theaters worldwide as a blockbuster hit? \nUnlike HD Downloads, which tend to collect virtual dust in cyberspace, these Limited Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos are great tangible GIFTS. There's no better way to introduce this EPIC Book of Mormon war story to friends than with a riveting visual spectacle, action-packed and gripping, which instantly captivates even the most skeptical viewer. \nOur preferred media company (which does all the big Hollywood shows) can create 5,000 Limited First Edition Blu-ray/DVD combos uniquely numbered in order of purchase for $15,000. This is our base goal.   \nBut... our real goal is to pre-sell, right here on Kickstarter, 100,000 or more Blu-ray/DVD combos. \nNow, let's pause here for a moment. \nThe entire purpose for which our initial 1,601 backers funded our concept short film was to inspire the funds for our FULL feature. \n100,000 Blu-ray/DVD combos sold represents over $1M toward our FULL feature and it could realistically propel us into full funding! And what if we sold 200K copies ($3M toward our full feature funding)? Or 300K copies ($4M toward our full feature funding). Now, it's far from likely we'll sell 2M Blu-ray/DVD combos here on Kickstarter and hit the $40M needed for full feature funding, BUT, can you see-- with your support-- how our concept short film can quite literally fulfill its intended purpose in a way none of us may have ever imagined?\nLet me tell you why this matters and just how critical your support is right now. \nWe've worked night and day, since our first campaign funded, hiring the right people, coordinating volunteers, reinvesting every dollar to keep our momentum healthy and we still have a long ways to go. I have not paid myself a salary since we began this wild ride. So, if you're wondering, rest assured, I'm in the trenches right beside you.\nTypically, money raised privately for major films cannot be accessed until the full budget is obtained.  \nBut we need funds right now to hire additional writers and producers necessary to ready our full feature for production.  \nAt minimum, this Kickstarter will give us critical resources we can use immediately for these and other needs.  \nI'm going to open the hood right now and tell you something that, I hope with all my heart, will make you stand on your feet and join me.\n1,601 backers funded our concept film to inspire the funds for our FULL feature and, guess what-- It worked!! Yes, you heard that right, it worked. We have a small studio anxiously waiting to fund our full feature in 60-90 days. There's just one caveat. They require full creative control.\nWhat's creative control?\nIn movies, it's the authority to decide the final cut of the film. Whoever has creative control decides all content that makes it into the final edit. For our concept short film, we shot over 6 pages of action in a day and a half! The pace and energy with which we executed all decisions during production would NOT have been possible had we not had full creative discretion. \nIf Reign of Judges: Title of Liberty was just a film I invented in my head, I would've signed over creative control, collected a nice check, and moved on to my next film. I'm not so married to myself that I couldn't give up my life's work if it meant it was going to reach the world-- and this film isn't the only film I'm ever going to make. The fact is, this project isn't my \"baby\", it's God's. And I have a responsibility to make sure it's done right-- to honor the record it comes from while reaching the largest mainstream audience possible.\nI've been at this long enough to know there's only two ways a film gets made. \nPrivate money or studio money; sometimes a combination of both, but whenever a studio funds a project they require creative control.  \nWith your generous pledge today, our FULL feature WILL be made and it will be one of the greatest epics this world has ever seen-- a film you and I, TOGETHER, will make. A film you and I, TOGETHER, can be proud of.  \nWe can either sit back and watch Hollywood feed us whatever films they want or we can unite behind a powerful film that has every potential to be one of the greats.\nStand with me and help us make the first North American war epic set in the pre-Columbian New World. Make your pledge now. Make history.\nSincerely,\nDarin Southam\nWriter/Director \nFACEBOOK | INSTAGRAM | TWITTER | YOUTUBE\nJOIN OUR EMAIL LIST\nORIGINAL KICKSTARTER VIDEO MUSIC BY: Greg Dombrowski \"Before Time\"\nENDORSEMENTS\nBEN CROSS on IMDb\nKIETH MERRILL on IMDb\nDAVID ATHERTON on IMDb \n CLIFTON CHIPPEWA on IMDb\nPAMELA CONN on IMDb \n PHILIP NIU on IMDb\nWe have ONE paramount goal with this campaign: \n1. RAISE $1,000,000 OR MORE IN PLEDGES BEFORE AUG. 18TH (both in and outside of Kickstarter) through Blu-ray/DVD combo sales and other rewards offered. If we reach this goal, there's a 99% chance it will propel us into production on our FULL feature THIS YEAR. How? \nWith tax incentives and foreign distribution commitments we can likely make our $40M film raising just $5-$8M privately. \n$1M puts us closer than you think!! Every Kickstarter reward offered is a vehicle to help us reach full feature funding. Believe me, we know $1M is lofty, BUT reaching it will allow us to make some critical hires NOW, instead of waiting till the full budget is reached. It will also prevent discouraging and costly delays to our full feature. So, there is much at stake.\nThe average budget for period-action war epics is $100-150M. Our budget at $40M is actually extremely low. Shooting 6 pages of action in a day and a half for our concept short film should engender confidence we can keep costs down but real Hollywood professionals aren't cheap. Writers with bankable credits charge between $150-$500K+ for feature writing. Producers charge even more. We have a 115-page budget that shows exactly where all production money goes but it's not something we can post publicly.\nTo be candid, I'm championing this movement full-time, reinvesting all profits toward our full feature and taking no salary, but it has (in all sincerity) reached the point this film needs to be my only focus. This means we need development funds (from this Kickstarter) to also allow me to start paying myself :).\nFinally, here are some other costs we need to cover from our Kickstarter funds. Prepare yourself, it's pretty boring (and a little disheartening) but very important.\nWe don't get to keep all the money we raise on Kickstarter.\nLet me break it down:\nCAMPAIGN FEES: Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5%. At our goal of $1M that's $85K! \nREWARDS & FULFILLMENT: We have to design, print, organize, and pay for rewards to be shipped. This includes paying someone else to fulfill the orders (so we can be off making the film you've helped us fund). That's why we appreciate you paying the extra shipping cost. That said, Kickstarter charges their fee on shipping costs too :(. So we're charged the fee on shipping costs even though we have to use those costs for, you know, shipping. Go figure. Total order fulfillment costs come to roughly 25%. At $1M raised, we'll get discounted bulk rates, but its still about $200,000. \n\"DEATH AND TAXES\": Kickstarter funds are taxable. Unfortunately, we do have to plan for the worst and the tax gorilla still remains at about 15-18%. At $1M raised that's $165K-- yikes! Believe me, we\u2019re pulling out all the stops to keep tax liability low but we\u2019re also above board around here so everything's gonna be legal.\nDEVELOPMENT COSTS: As mentioned, hiring bankable writers and producers could cost upwards of $300,000+. Of course, we'll work our magic to keep costs down. We have a great track record so far, getting 3 name actors on our concept short film :)!\nWE ARE NOT A CHARITY. We've tried hard to give you awesome reward choices.  \nWe\u2019ve tried to give you as much reward value as possible while also considering that Kickstarter order fulfillment can be a nightmare. Of course, we have systems in place to fulfill all orders like champs (and we WILL just like we did in our first campaign), but it should be mentioned, several notable Kickstarter campaigns, including some of the highest-funded, have been unable to fulfill their orders. Yikes!\nWe will NOT be one of those campaigns. Ever.\nBut we are also not store owners\u2014we\u2019re filmmakers. We want to use your hard-earned pledge funds to make an amazing film short we can all be proud of.\nSo, have fun choosing, and above all, we\u2019re grateful for your support in making the loudest statement you can. Remember, Kickstarter only allows you to pledge once-- so make it count! You can also increase your pledge any time before the campaign ends, as well as in your exit survey.  \nPLEASE NOTE: ALL DIGITAL REWARDS WILL BE DELIVERED WITHIN 3-5 BUSINESS DAYS OF OUR CAMPAIGN SUCCESSFULLY CLOSING.\nOur featured product is a LIMITED EDITION Blu-ray/DVD combo of our concept short film and behind the scenes. 24 minutes of EPIC content. We have 3 categories. Limited Edition numbered 2-100 ($30) (SOLD OUT!), Limited Edition numbered 101-1K ($20), and Limited Edition numbered 1,001-5K ($18). We also have REGULAR EDITIONS for $15. Our 10, 20, 50, & 100 packs are REGULAR Editions. HD Downloads are included with ALL Blu-ray/DVD combos, however, with bulk packs, only ONE HD Download will be issued to the purchaser of the pack. The package design isn't quite finished but it will look something like this:\nWe're still working on the design for our new shirt as well but it will have the imagery from our poster and Blu-ray/DVD combo packs. Here are the other T-Shirts, back by popular demand: \nAnd here is our vintage style T-Shirt from our initial launch four years ago today, also back by popular demand at a much lower pledge point than our first campaign! \nOur NEW design will also be White on Black. We may also do a Black on White option if we have enough demand. \nHere is our Key Chain with Moroni's Medallion Image, limited supply left from our first Kickstarter:\nFinally, our stunning new poster, shot and designed by Chad Keyes. This is the first time we've made these available outside of our premieres so grab as many as you can. Save when you buy 5 or 10 at a time. Pay a little more and have them signed as well! Check it out, full size, glossy and beautiful 27\"x40\". \nNext is our cover art for our mp3 original concept short score download. Kyle Warr is Thomas Newman meets Hans Zimmer. Have a listen and see why people are raving about our concept short score.\nLast but not least by a long shot, Associate and Executive Producer credits are honorary designations, which do not entail filmmaking but we are happy to talk movies and show you around the business if you're unfamiliar and have an inkling. These producer rewards do require that we complete our full feature, which, until this campaign blows up :), is still uncertain. When we produce the feature, you're name will be on the credits! You'll also be on a cell phone bases with our producing team and you'll get to meet and mingle with movie stars-- more than you already do I mean :). \n Obviously we want to get green lit on our full feature ASAP but our timeline, as of now is, end of 2018 or beginning of 2019 we would like to be in production so we can release next Christmas. This is why our Kickstarter campaign is so critical. The funds we raise here will speed things up dramatically. If we all come together, this campaign will be a game-changer for our funding.  \nWe came in ahead of schedule on the timeline from our last campaign, so, you're support is in good hands.\nCheck out some amazing facts about The Book of Mormon on our BOOK OF MORMON SHOWSTOPPERS LIST:\nI know what you\u2019re thinking-- After reading this list, can you believe Reign of Judges: Title of Liberty stands to be the first Book of Mormon war epic ever made??", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to fund our full feature in whole or in part through the creation and sales of Blu-ray/DVD combos. If we meet our goal, Blu-ray/DVD combos will be created, per the pledges made. We also have a track record of delivering on our campaign promises. We mentioned in our last Kickstarter that we could not control how our concept short film was received but we could control it's quality. We have delivered a product of substantial quality that has garnered exceptionally positive reviews. This also minimizes your risk. \n\nThat said, this film project has the same risks as any other TV/Film project. Particularly, at this stage, there is a risk the full feature will never be made do to lack of funding. In such a case, all respective rewards tied to the completion of the full feature (Executive and Associate Producer credits, for example) will not be able to be delivered. In such cases, by pledging to this campaign, you are agreeing to consider those pledges a donation in the event we are unable to fund our full feature.\n\nIf we reach our goal, with the exception of rare extenuating and unforeseen circumstances, we GUARANTEE the fulfillment of all rewards not tied to the completion of our full feature within no more than 3 months from successful campaign close. We have already made a powerful and epic concept short film which has been received tremendously well. We partnered with the best talent in the industry to ensure our concept short film meets the absolute highest production standards and it definitely paid off.\n\nWe promise to our supporters to pour every bit of passion we have into this undertaking (just like we have done and demonstrated thus far). At the end of the day, if it isn't enough, the chips will fall where they may. This much we can tell you: The louder the statement our supporters make through this campaign the easier our job becomes.\n\nThe writer/creator of this project, Darin Southam, has written and directed over 30 successful film projects. He's never gone over budget and has always met his deadlines. Consequently, he also completed the concept short film for Reign of Judges early and under budget.\n\nOur ongoing commitment is this: we will, in good faith, advocate the production of our full feature until it is produced and made available with an intended worldwide theatrical release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "Don't have a lot to give?

Two years ago, we came up with an idea about how to create a new kind of flip book. We wanted to upgrade the classic format and bring it to a whole new level, and this is the result:\nMolecularis is also an animated coloring book. You can use it in plenty of ways, by coloring, redrawing and varying its content with an endless number of possibilities. Use pencils, markers, watercolors, graphite, brushes, technical pens or whatever technique you prefer. \nBy alternating the colors gradually from one picture to the next and using your favorite color palette, you can not only give the sequences their very own personality, but also bring them to life \u2013 as you see them \u2018move\u2019 when you flip through the pages.\nInside Molecularis, you\u2019ll find a group of small and restless organisms that interact with each other as if they were being observed through a microscope.\nLike all flip books, Molecularis relies on the principle of persistence of vision, which in other words, is exactly what your eyes and brain do when you watch a movie. In a flip book, every picture varies gradually from one page to the next, so by flipping the pages with your thumb, they generate the illusion of movement. This simple technique has been around since 1868 and played an important role in the birth of cinema.\nBecause the sequences are loop animated, after coloring or redrawing, you can create GIFs like this!\nThe sequences were designed and animated by Jossie Malis, co-founder of Flipboku and best known for his award-winning animated series Bendito Machine. Maybe you've come across this video from the first flip book we created for the show a couple of years ago. Find out more here.\n                         If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives Molecularis its unique feature of showing you six different animations in just one flip book. You'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see Molecularis for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D\nAnd here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book.\nAs there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on one side and 4, 5 and 6 when you turn the book around. To proceed with the coloring simply follow each sequence by jumping every 3 pages. You will have better control of the coloring process if you follow each animated element in every sequence. \nEvery single Molecularis is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision. We spent a lot of time testing different paper qualities and consulted with several experts until we found the perfect match: high quality 100% recycled heavy paper with a semi-rough surface and a nice smooth finish. It's suitable for all kinds of different techniques and prevents colors from passing through it. Each Molecularis comes with 180 pages (90 sheets). \n We have a weakness for good packaging, and that\u2019s why we included a sleek slip case to keep your Molecularis safe after you use it. It prevents the pages from wearing out and by the way, it looks awesome on your shelf or wherever you want to keep it.\nAs a perfect complement to Molecularis we have created a learning flip book for anyone who wants to try \u2018freestyle\u2019 animation::  \nBlanko is a flip book that contains 320 blank pages on which you can animate whatever comes to your mind. If you're new to animation, learn how to get started with 6 of the basic principles we have included: squash and stretch, anticipation, ease in - ease out, arcs, timing and exaggeration. You can use both sides of the flip book.\nWatch this terrific animation by our good friend Nacho Rodr\u00edguez created on Blanko, featuring his character Mr. Coo:\nPLAY\n\nMolecularis and Blanko make a great couple, that's why we have bundled them up in a practical and sleek protective sleeve. You can also choose between several combinations:\nWe have partnered with Winsor&Newton, leading Brithish color-maker for more than 180 years, to create an awesome limited edition reward that includes a set of 12 assorted Watercolor Markers. This is a top quality marker set that will suit either the casual artist or the professional.\nEach pen has a fine point tip on one end and a flexible brush tip on the other end. The colors are bright, lightfast and highly pigmented and they're designed to make gorgeous washes when combined with water. Because they have dual nibs, you can also use them for fine detail and sweeping line thicknesses. You won't find another marker quite like these ones.\nNEW REWARD UPDATE!\nMany of you asked us for more Winsor & Newton sets so we just unlocked a new limited edition reward! Those of you who have tried the Cotman Water Colours will agree with us, they are simply the best. Inside of this set you\u2019ll find 12 high-quality, vibrant Cotman colours, an ergonomically designed brush pen with its own water reservoir and a mixing palette inside the lid. All packed into a slim, beautifully curved case that fits in your pocket, together with your Molecularis and/or Blanko. \nDespite its small size, a lot of work goes into creating a flip book like Molecularis. We've spent hours and hours on the design board, working hand in hand with our local printing house, cutting, binding and testing to achieve this result. Printing projects such as this one are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold, which is why we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to finally bring the flip book to life and get it into the printers.\nFlipboku is a project which comes straight from the hearts of animator and designer Jossie Malis and music composer Julie Reier. We love animation, design and flip books and we are thrilled at the idea of creating something you can manipulate with your hands, without any need for cables or batteries, just by using your thumb! \nBased on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, Spain, Flipboku is meant to grow slowly as a side project, while we continue making films and sounds in our studio, Zumbakamera. The team is completed with the invaluable hands of illustrator, designer and official coloring artist Noemi Aiolo, and in the near future, with the collaboration of independent animators from planet earth.\n                                                       We are extremely grateful for your support and would love to see you on board.\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped over 5,000 creators make their projects a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have over 15 years of experience in the fields of animation, design, and printing.

Diving compressed air can be very dangerous and always a good idea to be certified for your own safety.\nNever ascend to the surface without releasing air from your lungs to avoid Over Lung Expansion \nPulmonary Barotrauma: During rapid ascent the air in the lungs expand, causing lung over expansion and rupture releasing bubbles into the bloodstream.\nIf you are not a certified diver: Practice in a pool until you get comfortable with breathing underwater \"it is a mental training\" to avoid underwater panick\nNever Dive Alone: safety procedures that are intended to improve divers' chances of avoiding or surviving accidents in or under water by diving in a group of two\nWater Pressure Compresses Air: Air in a diver's body air spaces and dive gear will compress as pressure increases (and expand as pressure decreases). PRESSURE AFFECTS MANY ASPECTS OF DIVING \n Equalization As a diver descends, the pressure increase causes the air in their body's air spaces to compress. The air spaces in their ears, mask, and lungs become like vacuums as the compressing air creates a negative pressure. Delicate membranes, like the ear drum, can get sucked into theses air spaces, causing pain and injury. This is one of the reasons that a diver must equalize their ears for scuba diving. On ascent, the reverse happens. \nDecreasing pressure causes the air in a diver's air spaces to expand. The air spaces in their ears and lungs experience a positive pressure as they become overfull of air, leading to a pulmonary barotrauma or a reverse block. In a worst case scenario this could burst a diver's lungs or eardrums. To avoid a pressure-related injury (such as an ear barotrauma) a diver must equalize the pressure in their body's air spaces with the pressure around them. To equalize their air spaces on descent a diver adds air to their body airspaces to counteract the \"vacuum\" effect by breathing normally, this adds air to their lungs every time they inhale adding air to their mask by breathing out their nose adding air to their ears and sinuses by using one of several ear equalization techniques To equalize their air spaces on ascent a diver releases air from their body air spaces so that they do not become overfull by breathing normally, this releases extra air from their lungs every time they exhale ascending slowly and allowing the extra air in their ears, sinuses and mask to bubble out on its own Manuel will be included how to use properly \n When purchasing the Dive Portable Lungs Kit you understand that you are using it at your own risk. fully understand the risks and challenges of diving READ over FAQ and Manuel 'Included with package'\nhttps://www.instagram.com/diveportablelungs/ https://www.facebook.com/diveportablelungs/", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "Dive Tank", "descp": "Get your extra Dive Portable Lungs tank\n1 aluminum Dive Tank\n48cu\n3000 psi\nRefill adapter for hand-pump\nPressure gauge\nUnscrew your regulator and easily attach to your other tank\nFill up extra tanks for continuous diving\nHappy Diving!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (9 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 395 or more", "title": "Early Bird Scuba Starter Kit", "descp": "Includes:\nDive Portable Lungs Tank\nCross Body Bag\n4 stage regulator\n3-Stage 3000psi Hand pump With case\nReady to Dive Package\nGet the offer before its gone!

However, if you are not a trained scuba diver there are restrictions on use and risks to be aware of. Misuse of the Scorkl can be dangerous. Whilst decompression sickness (more commonly known as \u201cthe bends\u201d) isn't much of a risk because of the depth and time restrictions of such a small cylinder, pulmonary damage (chest expansion injury) is nevertheless a risk if a user holds their breath during ascent or ascends too quickly.\nNon-scuba trained users should not use the Scorkl below 3m depth or more than five times in one day. Staying above 3m dramatically reduces this risk of pulmonary damage (although does not eliminate it entirely). Each purchaser will be provided with an information kit informing them of this (and other) risks of using the Scorkl as well as strategies to avoid them. These strategies will include, but not be limited to, staying above 3m in depth and not holding one's breath and/or exhaling during ascent, and not ascending too quickly.  \nScuba-trained users will be able to use the Scorkl below 3m at their discretion but they too will be warned of the same risks.  \nThe Scorkl is only intended for shallow water use. We recommend that scuba-trained users not use the Scorkl below 10m and that non-scuba-trained users stay above 3m in depth as mentioned above.  \nEach Scorkl comes fitted with a pressure gauge so that the user can know how much air remains in the cylinder at any time.  \nAIR QUALITY\nThe Scorkl can be filled either directly from a scuba tank or from our high-pressure hand pump. If filled from a scuba tank that itself has been filled by a commercial compressed air supplier, the air can be assured to be of good quality because of industry supplier standards. These standards are concerned mainly with carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oil and water levels. Since the Scorkl hand pump doesn't have as many working parts as a mechanical dive compressor, and is muscle-powered rather than petrol powered, the risk of contamination from latent carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide is dramatically reduced. This is the same for oil contaminants. Notwithstanding this, each Scorkl pump comes fitted with an air filter which is comprised of the same materials, and performs the same function, as a filter fitted to a mechanical dive compressor. The Scorkl filter should be replaced after fifty refills and extras will be available for purchase after the conclusion of the Kickstarter campaign.  \nEQUIPMENT STANDARDS, CARE AND MAINTENANCE  \nThe Scorkl cylinder and regulator are made to the same international specifications and standards as normal scuba cylinders and regulators and need to be visually inspected and/or tested as regularly as the guidelines in your country require (some are different). This may be as regularly as every year or every one hundred dives.  \nThe information kit provided to each purchaser will include information regarding recommended best practice methods for care and maintenance of each of the Scorkl components (cylinder, regulator, filter, hand pump, case).\n                      The Scorkl cylinder is manufactured to the same specifications and manufacturing standards as a normal SCUBA cylinder\nThe Scorkl regulator is an always-on, breathe-on-demand, balanced single stage regulator and uses the same time proven technology found in regulators used by SCUBA divers around the world. Each Scorkl comes with a pressure gauge which tells you how much air is left at any time\nEach Scorkl comes with a FREE scuba tank refill adapter which enables you to refill the Scorkl from a scuba tank in seconds.\nIf you want to be able to refill the Scorkl whenever and wherever you like, we have developed a high-pressure hand pump option. See below for how it works.\n  The hand pump filter (below) filters air moisture and impurities\nAdventure Case to transport and store your full Scorkl kit safely \n  High-pressure hand pump can pump to 3,000psi+, filling the Scorkl with enough air to last up to 10 minutes underwater. It achieves these extreme pressures by using an intricate four-stage system:\n  The Scorkl regulator and high pressure hand pump have been in development for the last twelve months, with multiple sample orders manufactured and refined.\n    FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n FREE SHIPPING GLOBALLY\n  We will endeavour to manufacturer and ship within a four month timeframe from the end of the campaign period\n  This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ac response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges\n\nThe Scorkl and hand pump require high-precision manufacturing and high-quality materials since they both operate with air stored at high pressures. The primary components are: the Scorkl cylinder, Scorkl regulator, hand pump chambers, hand pump rods, scuba tank refill adapter and hand pump air filter. All components have already been manufactured to high quality during sample runs.\n\nThe primary risk is of production delays. Coordinating with an overseas factory and maintaining quality throughout every step is a challenge. Fulfillment and shipping becomes a hurdle when dealing with thousands of orders. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. We will take the Scorkl to the \"design for manufacturing\" step soon, and the target is to ship out units in October 2017.\n\nThere is some risk that items will not come exactly as pictured, due to manufacturing considerations.

It superimposes an image of your subject onto your paper. You see your pencil and your subject at the same time. Trace what you see!\nBack on Kickstarter!\n In 2013, along with fellow Art Professor Golan Levin, I launched the NeoLucida project on Kickstarter. Our goal was to make this amazing\u2014but obsolete\u2014tool available again. We hoped there was a small group of art/tech/history nerds like us who might want to try a camera lucida, but couldn\u2019t afford a vintage one. To our surprise, over 11,000 (!) backers helped us make many more NeoLucidas than we ever planned. Most had never heard of a camera lucida; they just wanted to draw and the NeoLucida gave them an entry point. We scaled up production by bringing Kickstarter veterans Big I Design on board as manufacturing partners. We even won a prestigious Core77 Design Award along the way! There are now over 25,000 NeoLucidas helping people in 90 countries draw from real life. \n\"Um, this is hard!\"\nOne thing became clear from the feedback. People said, \u201cThis is harder than I thought!\u201d We said, \u201cWe know!\u201d After all, the original NeoLucida copied the prism design of vintage 19th century camera lucidas, which made sharp, clear images, but has a tiny viewing area. To us, it supported the idea that great artists of the past were still incredibly skilled; using a tool wasn't \"cheating.\" This was a provocative media archeology project: NeoLucida users could test what it was like to be an artist 200 years ago. \nBut thousands of people were just excited by using a tool that might make drawing a little less frustrating. Many people appreciated the art history story, but they just wanted to draw. Maybe they used to draw and gave up as a teenager. Maybe they never learned to draw but always wanted to. Many parents wanted to support their kids' creative impulses. The NeoLucida offered an accessible and inexpensive motivation to draw. \nI was inspired. Years of lecturing and running NeoLucida drawing workshops in a half-dozen countries gave me direct exposure with hundreds of aspiring artists. With all the feedback in mind, I went back to the drawing board. \nAfter two years of research and testing prototypes, the NeoLucida is back! People asked for a larger viewing area, but why stop there? The all new design has an extra large viewer to make drawing from life just a bit easier. Say hello to the NeoLucida XL.\n  First, A Little Art History.\nIf you wanted to make a realistic image in the days before photography was invented, you had to draw it.\nFor centuries, artists and inventors developed clever optical drawing instruments to assist with the difficult task of drawing from real life. Devices with mirrors, lenses, and prisms helped with the most challenging part of drawing: flattening a three-dimensional world into the two dimensions of your paper.\nPortrait of Mrs. John Mackie, by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1816 (Photo by me while doing research at The Victoria & Albert Museum, London). Ingres' drawings are meticulous but tiny, leading some scholars to suggest Ingres used a camera lucida\nDrawing would be so much easier if you could hold up a piece of glass to your subject and trace its likeness directly onto the flat glass. Your page and your subject would be aligned; you wouldn't have to look away from your subject to see your drawing. Simple devices like the Sighting Grid did precisely this. Instead of glass, a grid of wires made a reference plane. \nSighting Grids by Robert Fludd (Left) (1617-21) and John Bate (right) (1634). The simplest of drawing instruments, the Sighting Grid provides a flat reference plane for translating the 3D world to the 2D page\nSighting Grids were accurate, but slow and cumbersome. As optical technology advanced from the early 17th century onwards, artists and inventors found ways to project images onto paper for tracing. The most advanced of these technologies was the camera lucida, invented by scientist Sir William Hyde Wollaston in 1807. A prism acts like a beam-splitter: part of your vision is directed towards your subject, part towards your paper. This overlap makes it possible to trace directly from real life. \nThe NeoLucida XL borrows from this tradition of simple, effective drawing instruments, but leveraging some modern technology to make a simple and inexpensive version of these ancient tools. \nWant a little more history and a look at the vintage tools that inspired the NeoLucida? Check out this chat and demo with Norman Chan of Adam Savage's Tested.com: \nHow does it work?\nThe main suggestion we got for the original NeoLucida was: \"Can't you just make the prism bigger?\" Actually, no. When you look into the prism, you look at the exposed edge of the prism. It doesn't matter how big the prism is, you still look at the edge. And as the prism gets bigger, the more the image shifts when you move your head. This is bad for tracing (trust me, we made and tried larger prisms. No good). To make the viewing area bigger, the NeoLucida would have to be completely redesigned. Ditch the prism and find other materials to create the ghost reflections.\nThe NeoLucida XL setup: Clamp to a table, position the viewer over your page with your subject in front of you.\nThe NeoLucida XL uses mirror and glass to combine a virtual ghost image of your subject and the real view of your hand. Setting it up is easy: \nClamp the NeoLucida XL to a table or sturdy drawing board. \nBend the adjustable gooseneck so that the viewer is facing your subject and positioned over your paper. \nLook straight down into the viewer to see your page and a ghost image of your subject superimposed. \nTrace what you see!\n  Part of your vision goes through the glass to your pencil. Simultaneously, part of your vision bounces off the glass, then the first-surface mirror, then out to your subject. The result is a ghost image on your page. \nLook down into the NeoLucida XL and a ghost image of your subject appears on top of your page.\nHere's an actual view through the NeoLucida XL. You can see your hand and your subject superimposed. This drawing only took 4 minutes, but proportion and perspective are rendered accurately. Tracing really works!\nNo matter your skill level, the NeoLucida XL helps you make more accurate drawings. Proportion\u2014the relationships between elements of your subject\u2014and perspective\u2014accurate rendering of space\u2014are laid out for you in the ghost image. You can even compose your scene before you draw so your subject fits on your paper the way you want it to. All of this means you can focus on the most important part of drawing: putting pencil to paper. Controlling a pencil to make beautiful lines takes practice. With the NeoLucida XL, you spend less time on laying out your drawing and more time drawing. \nSpecial Features\nThe basic elements in the NeoLucida XL are simple enough: A piece of glass and a mirror placed at a certain angle to each other. This arrangement is the same as it was in the early 19th century. After testing dozens of samples and prototypes, we've developed the NeoLucida XL to be the best version of the glass-and-mirror camera lucida ever made. \nGlass and Mirror. The quality of the glass and the mirror are key to make the camera lucida ghost image as sharp and clear as possible. The mirror we use is a First Surface mirror. Typical mirror is made with a reflective surface applied to the rear of a piece of glass. This is how most commercial mirrors are made. Because the light travels through the glass to get to the mirror, there are additional reflections from the glass surface and tiny distortions from scattering light. This isn't usually a problem for your bathroom mirror, since the mirror is thin and you're not standing that close to it. But if you want a precise reflection with your eye up close to it, you need a sharp reflection. Usually used in scientific applications, a first surface mirror has only one surface reflecting light rays. One surface exposed, one crisp reflection. \nTypical mirror (left) has a reflective surface on the rear face of the glass. This causes minor distortions and soft reflections as light bounces and scatters between reflective layers.\nPortability. Making the NeoLucida viewer larger makes drawing easier, but it also makes the device bulkier. To make the NeoLucida XL as portable as the original NeoLucida, the glass-and-mirror viewer neatly folds into a flat package. Slide it into the custom pouch provided, and toss it in your bag with your art supplies. Easy! The folding action also protects the glass and mirror inside a sandwich of hard plastic to keep the delicate optics safe while in transit. \nThe NeoLucida folds up for easy storage.\n  At just 10 ounces and slim in profile, the NeoLucida XL fits in the handy custom pouch provided. Easy to toss in your bag!\n  When folded, the NeoLucida XL is only 1 inch at its thickest. Compact!\nLegacy Support. The NeoLucida XL is an all new optical design, but it uses the same adjustable gooseneck from the original NeoLucida. If you have the original NeoLucida, you can swap viewers between the gooseneck stands. Save space! Carry both NeoLucida viewers but only one clamp!\nLighting Control. The NeoLucida XL comes with a removable shader to help balance the lighting. It's like custom sunglasses for your NeoLucida! Is the page too bright to see the ghost image? Insert the shader in the bottom slot to dim the image of your page. Is your subject too bright and you can't see your page? Insert the shader in the forward position. When you're not using it, store the shader in the rear of the NeoLucida XL viewer.  \nIf your subject is too bright and it's hard to see your page, use the Shader in the front slot. This will dim your subject view to make your page easier to see.\n  If the page is too bright and it's hard to see your subject, use the Shader in the bottom slot. This will dim your page view to make the subject easier to see.\nA little easier for the little ones. I have two daughters who love to draw, but they couldn't use the original NeoLucida. At 8 and 4 years old, the NeoLucida's requirements of precise eye placement with a tiny prism made it frustrating to them. The NeoLucida XL isn't a toy, but it was made with kids in mind. I've tested it with kids and found that, depending on the skill level, children as young as 6 and 7 can draw with the NeoLucida XL! \nThat's my 8-year-old daughter using the NeoLucida XL to draw her favorite teddy bear. Fun!\nAlmost every child draws. But many give up in their teenage years when drawing skills don't seem to improve. Practicing with tools like the NeoLucida XL to advance skills can help keep kids drawing into adulthood. \nBacked by Primary Research\nThe NeoLucida XL isn't just a product, it's the result of years of primary research. As an art professor, the NeoLucida is part of a decade of research into the relationship between technology and art history. I have one of the most complete camera lucida collections in the world, and have used this personal collection to reverse engineer both the original NeoLucida and the NeoLucida XL. \nOne idea, a century apart. The Magic Art Reproducer (left) from 1952 and A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (right) from 1840 both use angled glass and a mirror to create the ghost image.\nThe glass-and-mirror design is inspired by several different historical designs. The desire to draw more accurately from life is an old one; 19th century finely crafted brass devices and mid-20th century toys all responded to demand from aspiring artists. \nVintage glass-and-mirror camera lucidas from my personal collection provided primary research for developing the NeoLucida XL. At left, the 1952 Magic Art Reproducer. Center, A. Alexander's Graphic Mirror (1840).\n  Two years of NeoLucida workshops gave me first-hand experience with users. Clockwise from top left: Demo at Open Hardware Summit, MIT; Manifest Drawing Center, Cincinnati; Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Aspen; Children's Camp, Valdai, Russia.\nRewards\n(Prices include WORLDWIDE shipping!)\nLet's get drawing!\nWho's behind this? \nI'm Pablo Garcia, Associate Professor at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) and the history of drawing and technology is my life. I've spent a decade researching historical and contemporary drawing techniques and tools. I have over 30 different camera lucidas spanning 200 years, making it one of the largest and most complete private collections of its kind in the world. I also run drawingmachines.org, a growing archive reference site covering 600 years of drawing technology. With Golan Levin, I made the award-winning NeoLucida in 2013, earning over $424,000 from 11,406 backers in our first-ever Kickstarter.

We've got our manufacturing process down, and I have been to China several times to oversee production. So are we confident that the NeoLucida XL will be delivered as promised? Yes. But there are some new challenges we have our eyes on: \n\n\u2022 The new NeoLucida XL has some moving parts the original NeoLucida didn't have. When we get to producing molds there is a chance that parts don't fit or move smoothly.

I animated on the movies ParaNorman, The BoxTrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings. One of my favorite types of animation (and one of the ways I learned to animate) is flip book cartoons.\n(Above: by Danie Townsley)\nI love how simple flip books are--you don\u2019t need a computer, TV, or app--you just flip the paper and get to see your drawing come to life right in front of your eyes.\nBecome a backer by pledging to this project and receive your own kit plus extras!\nNote that the Light Pad pictured here is a prototype, and the final version may vary in appearance, due to design improvements--All for the better of course!\nBelow is a breakdown of each pledge level:\n  2 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper \n(The Standard Kit makes a total of FOUR 60-page flip books or TWO 120-page flip books.*)\nLED Light Pad \nUSB Power Cable \nBinding Screws in Two Sizes \nHex Key \nPencil \nPencil Sharpener \nEraser \nPlus An EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Andy Bailey\n  Includes all of the items in the Standard Kit\nPlus TWO ADDITIONAL Large Paper Packs with Binding Screws\n(The Deluxe Kit makes a total of EIGHT 60-page flip books or FOUR 120-page flip books.)\nIncludes the EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Andy Bailey\nPlus an EXCLUSIVE Printed Flip Book by Another Professional Animator\n   2 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper\n(Makes a total of FOUR 60-page or TWO 120-page flip books.*)\nNo Kit, Light Pad, Extras or Exclusives\n   4 Large Packs of Blank Flip Book Paper\n(Makes a total of EIGHT 60-page or FOUR 120-page flip books.*) \nNo Kit, Light Pad, Extras or Exclusives\n      PLAY\n\n Above: by Graham Annable\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Anthony Straus\nPLAY\n\n  Above: by Dobrin Yanev\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Kevin Parry\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Malcolm Lamont  (Note: This one is a bit \"gross\" and may not be suitable for all kids, but the animation is awesome!)\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Jeff Riley\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Andy Bailey (This is one I made as a kid.)\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Andy Bailey\nPLAY\n\nAbove: Simple Bouncing Ball Demo\nPLAY\n\nAbove by: Adam Fisher\nPLAY\n\nAbove: by Kim Slate\nInternational Shipping?\nWe are working to find a good option for international fulfillment.

Our experienced team has already developed a few working prototypes, which have been tested and perform well, providing us with feasibility of the product. This gives us confidence in SELFLY and its development.\nMini drones have become quite popular in recent years, and SELFLY is a very simple one, so the technological challenge isn\u2019t high. Since it uses existing technology in order to enable a new kind of mini drone use, compacting it into a phone case is possible to implement - we've done it!\nOur products prime purpose is providing the user with a convenient and available option of taking photos from a new different angle. The 1st pilot view video stream is recordable, but its primary purpose is to control the camera in order to choose the perfect angle for a selfie picture. Our drone is VERY stable, however, a 99$ product obviously does not include a stabilizing gimbal. If you are looking for a drone to capture professional stabilized video you will have to spend 600$ and more, this is beyond the scope of this product. \n\nWe do not aim to replace, nor compete with large and complex drones. However, if you are looking for a great affordable replacement for a selfie stick to take an exciting new angle for your photos, this is the product for you. \n\nSELFLY\u2019s main clip shows the target of the final product. With your support we will get there. Although we have several working prototypes, the current prototype is yet to include the full and final functionality and components to be included in the product, and in order to reach the manufacturing stage further development should be carried out. However, full functionality as described is fully feasible.\nOur subcontractors are well-known companies, and are quite experienced in the mini drone tech field, making our work plans and budget expectations well-planned in order to accurately estimate the development process through to shipping.\nWe are sure that our product will meet your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Be a SELFLY fan!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting us\nJoin us for updates, and news.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera Kit", "descp": "Receive one SELfly Camera kit\nfor 99$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $139)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,383 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera with two phone cases", "descp": "Receive one SELFLY Camera with 2 phone cases (any two models) for 109$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $149)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal phone case for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["355 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 119 or more", "title": "SELFLY Camera Kit + 1 SELFLY power bank", "descp": "One SELFLY Camera + one phone case (any model) + one SELFLY power bank\n(Expected retail $169)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,539 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 185 or more", "title": "Double Pack - 2 SELFLY Camera Kits", "descp": "SELfly Double Pack - Receive two SELfly Camera kits.

Constantly on the go, we don\u2019t always have time to find a wall plug, or space to carry a pocket full of power banks. So we created a new type of battery case that brings power and photography together like never before.\nPower To The People\nStarting with the battery, we wanted a case that let you shoot all day. One that delivered on the promise of power without the extra bulk.\nUsing a custom design, the iPhone 7+ Case packs a 3500 mAh battery and the iPhone 7 carries a 2500 mAH battery. This translates into more than a 100% recharge of your phone. Using all the available length and width within the case, we focused on adding the thinnest possible battery with maximum performance.\nBeyond battery size, we wanted to make the case easy to use. It automatically keeps your phone charged whenever it\u2019s inside. Because we like to provide a little extra control, you can turn charging settings on and off inside the Moment App, something most other battery cases don\u2019t provide.\n A Fast, DSLR-Like Shutter Button\nShooting with a button can be faster than tapping the screen, especially if your subject is moving. When you\u2019re shooting with one hand, it\u2019s always awkward trying to hold onto the phone and touch the screen at once.\nUsing the Moment App, you can half-press the shutter button to lock the subject and full press to shoot. In the Apple camera app you can full press to shoot. In both apps, pressing and holding unlocks burst mode.\nIn the first Moment Case we had a bluetooth shutter button. In this case, we got rid of bluetooth and redesigned the experience to use the lighting connector. This makes the Moment Shutter button 75% faster than our previous case, now matching the speed of the native camera app.\nOur engineers have worked hard to make the shutter button incredibly responsive, just like you would expect from a high end camera.\nAttach The World\u2019s Best Glass\nWe made the mounting of a Moment lens easier, stronger, and more reliable.\nThe larger lens diameter on the iPhone 7 and the dual lenses on the the 7+ forced us to redesign the Moment lens interface. Slightly larger, we now have enough room to make an interface that clicks into place. Not only is it easier to mount a Moment lens, but for the first time you can put our glass over the Wide or Tele lens on the iPhone 7+.\nThis opens up the ability to take even more creative shots.\nWear Your Camera\nCameras are meant to be worn, and a phone camera is no exception. No longer stuck in your pocket, you can wear your case on your wrist, around your neck, inside your jacket, or outside your dress.\n Thin, Strong And Easy To Shoot\nWhen designing the Battery Photo Case, we wanted to create a camera body that added minimal bulk to your phone, provided enough protection for adventure, and enabled one handed shooting.\nThe location of the shutter button is always within reach, even for \u2018tiny hands.\u2019 While the finely textured surface provides better grip in every kind of weather.\nHaving spent months iterating on the smallest of details, we believe this the thinnest, most usable battery case for people who love to take pictures.\n Works With Your Apple Accessories (except lighting headphones)\nWhere other battery cases use a micro-USB connector and their own power cables, we designed the Battery Photo Case with a lighting connector, enabling you to use your standard Apple cables. Plug your case into the wall to recharge or into your laptop to recharge and sync.\nThere is one universal limitation for all third party battery cases... audio can not pass through the connector. This means you can\u2019t use headphones that plug into the lightning port. You can use wireless headphones, which Apple already recommends for the new iPhone 7 devices. We are sorry in advance, as we would have loved to support this.\n No random USB cables to forget, just plug in and hit the road.\nThe Details\n    iPhone 7 Case Comparison\n   iPhone 7+ Case Comparison\n             Photo Case\nThe Photo Case is everything we love about minimal photography. Adding only 3mm in thickness to your phone, this is the thinnest lens mountable case we\u2019ve ever made. It\u2019s slim and unobtrusive in your pocket, yet readily available when you want to shoot.\nTo all the customers who asked for a thin, non-electronic Moment case \u2014 this one\u2019s for you.\n         Wide Lens\nMoment lenses have always been about combining world class lens design with cinema quality glass, to create the best image possible. Our new Moment Wide is without a doubt the best lens we\u2019ve ever made.\nWhen Apple introduced iPhone 7, they changed the landscape of mobile photography. Their use of high speed F/1.8, next generation 12MP sensors, and optical image stabilization brought a new level of image quality to your pocket. Although our existing lenses will work with iPhone 7, we ultimately learned that we were maxing out their optical capability. In order to deliver the best quality imaginable, our only choice was to redesign our glass from the ground up.\nSharper Edge To Edge\nUsing our proprietary design process, we have created a stunning aspheric lens that delivers exceptional edge to edge image quality. This all-glass asphere improves on our already class-leading distortion correction and maintains razor sharp images on iPhone\u2019s F/1.8 aperture.  \nWe went through many design iterations until we came to what we believe is the best mobile photography lens in the world.\n Photos by: Jonathan Sweet, Alex Tran and Matt Rick\nA Touch Bigger\nIn order to accommodate the larger iPhone aperture, we made this lens slightly bigger, enabling us to take advantage of every photon without compromise. A larger lens also makes the optics more tolerant to misalignment, so unwanted dark corners are a thing of the past.\nBy opening up the optics with this lens, we are now able to deliver edge to edge clarity on iPhone 7, Google Pixel, and the Galaxy S7.\nEasier To Align\nThank you to our amazing customers we received plenty of feedback about how to make the new lens interface easier to use. With slightly larger tabs, better visual markings, a spring loaded detent, you will have more confidence when installing and shooting with Moment.\nThe new lens interface doesn\u2019t just apply to the new Wide Lens. We\u2019ve brought this new interface to our Tele, Superfish, and Macro Lenses.\nBut don\u2019t worry, if you are an existing Moment lens owner we have created a custom adaptor so your existing lenses will now work with the new cases.\nNew Wide Lens Specs\nExisting Moment Lenses\nSame glass, better mounting interface.\nAlong with the new Wide Lens we are upgrading all of our existing lenses to the new mounting interface. This means if you select the Tele, Superfish, or Macro lens with your backer level, it will include the new and improved V2 interface.\nIf you are an existing Moment lens owner, don\u2019t worry. We have created a small adapter which you can permanently attach to your existing lenses, making them compatible with both the Photo Case and the Battery Photo Case. If you back the project, we will provide this adapter free of charge.\n          Design Process\nEvery Moment product starts with the customer.\nFrom capturing to sharing, we\u2019ve spent the past three years connecting, listening and learning from thousands of our own customers. Each with slightly different needs, but all with a shared desire to capture better images, faster.\nThis research started in the field with people who love to shoot with their phones. From amateurs to professionals, picture takers to filmers, we studied their entire customer journey well before we started designing any solutions.\nOur research resulted in a few consistent patterns. It gave us the insight that customers either wanted their case to do more, or they wanted it to do less.\nFrom this, two new projects were born\u2026 the Simple Case and Super Case.\nImproved Ergonomics\nPhones continue to get thinner and thinner, which is perfect for our pockets but challenging for those of us who like to take pictures. The thinner they get, the harder they are to hold, especially in varying weather conditions.\nGoing back to original cameras we spent a lot of time re-studying how people hold a camera versus a phone. How they use a button versus their fingers. And when they shoot in landscape orientation versus portrait.\nWe created dozens of different prototypes, testing button locations, sizes, orientations, shapes, and forms. We looked at sharp phone edges versus rounded curves. Pronounced grips versus subtle ones. We also spent time testing these in the wild, to understand how they worked in various temperatures and weather conditions.\nMinimizing Size\nDifferent from traditional cameras, thickness is everything when it comes to mobile photography. Because the phone lives in our pocket for most of the day we realized that every millimeter added to the back of the phone would matter.\nThe Simple Case was a study in subtraction. Starting with the thickest part of the case, the lens interface, we started concepting a new interface that was both thinner and stronger. Next we rethought the strap attachment, creating solutions that made the attachment easier to use while the phone is inside. Lastly we explored how much plastic versus TPE rubber would be required to provide enough protection from the occasional drop, without adding unnecessary bulk.\nThe Super Case started with a study of batteries. The entire architecture of the case was based on the different battery shapes available and how we could minimize thickness. Going through dozens of off-the-shelf batteries, we came to realize that a custom solution was the only way to achieve the thinness we desired.\nFix What\u2019s Weak\nIn making the first Moment Case, one of the core lessons we learned is that reliability is everything. Moments can\u2019t be missed because a lens doesn\u2019t attach or a case doesn\u2019t connect. Tearing down our own products and reading through hundreds of customer emails, we looked at every weakness in our current user experience.\nOf everything we decided to tackle, the lens interface and shutter button were our biggest design challenges.\nThe wider lenses on the iPhone 7 and the dual lenses on the 7+ forced us to rethink our metal on metal lens interface. A solution that enabled Moment lenses to work with and without a case, its limitations could be seen over time. Now by removing the thin metal plates were free to rethink how we could make the interface easier to use, stronger to locking a lens into place, and less likely to wear over time.\nWanting to deliver the speed of a DSLR shutter button we started over with the Moment shutter button. From the shape of the button, to how it sits in the phone, to the technology behind it, we iterated through dozens of electro-mechanical solutions. The addition of a battery enabled us to explore the lighting connector, something that dramatically improved speed and removed any potential issues with connectivity. At the same time, we looked at new parts and a different mechanical structure to deliver the half-press and full-press that we know and love from our DSLR cameras.\nLet The Glass Speak\nWhen designing mobile lenses, size is the number one discussion. The larger the lens, the more glass you can use, and the better the image quality. The desire for more glass is in direct contrast to the convenience for your pocket.\nLooking at our current lenses we went back to making models of different lens sizes. From small to really large we put these models in pockets, hands, and bags to see how their size impacted the user experience.\nAt the same time our lens engineers started redesigning the wide lens against the new F1.8 aperture. By being able to widen the first element, we had a lot more opportunity to improve the quality of the lens. Battling with size versus image quality, we went through many design iterations until we came to what we believe is the best wide angle mobile lens in the world.\nProject Status\nThis is the most ambitious project we have ever embarked upon at Moment. Our team has made more complicated products at previous companies, but manufacturing hardware is still hard. We recognize that not everything will go according to plan. Our promise to you is that we will always be transparent and honest about the details of the project.\nBefore coming to Kickstarter we made multiple prototypes of each product, went through rounds of manufacturing feedback with our partners, and built out a detailed schedule. All of this work gives us confidence in our ability to deliver the project.\nDespite all of this, there are still risks ahead. The Battery Photo Case is the most technically advanced product with complicated tooling, rigorous testing, certifications, and MFI compliance. We have attempted to layer in sufficient time for each phase, but if we fail along the way it could delay our delivery date.\nWe are now ready to kick off tooling and start the manufacturing process.\nWe Are Moment\nWe love Kickstarter. \nThis amazing community enabled us to turn an idea into a small company of 20. Each of us from different backgrounds, we hold a shared purpose to empower the creative in everybody. \nComing back to Kickstarter to launch our latest project is both exciting and nerve racking. The next chapter of Moment has been a work in progress for many months, and we\u2019re excited to hear what you think about it.\nWe have poured our hearts, minds, and weekends into this project because deep down we believe that once you use these products you will fall in love with mobile photography all over again.\nWe hope you join us on this journey to make your phone an even better camera.\n\nManufacturing a new product is the riskiest and most expensive phase of the journey, so the money we are raising goes directly towards covering our tooling and upfront manufacturing costs.\nWith your support, we can take the next step together in making it even easier to take better pictures with our phones.\nWe would love to thank our family, friends, and everyone who has helped throughout the journey. Your feedback, support, and positive encouragement has been incredibly inspiring.\nJames Barkman, Henry Romano, Nathan Yoder, Garret Van Swearingen, Jamie Finch, Kari Davidson, EJ Haynes, Kyle Babcock, Jessica Vorng, Jessie Zou, Ma\u00efka Collette, Casey Warren & Mindcastle\nVideo Credits\nLead Camera: Caleb Babcock\nSecondary Camera: Zach Reed\nEdit: Caleb Babcock\nMusic: Icelanders, Utah\nPhotography Credits: Julia Manchik, Erica Simas, Zach Reed, Melissa Leith, Audrey Louchart\nDisclaimer - iPhone, Apple, and Apple logo are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProducing a hardware product is never easy. \n\nOur previous experience in manufacturing waterproof action cameras, wearables, and cinematic lenses makes us better prepared for the unforeseen challenges we may encounter during the tooling, manufacturing, testing, and certification processes. In addition, we have previously manufactured Moment Lenses and Cases with these same suppliers. This means we already have pre-established relationships to ensure consistent quality and testing processes. \n\nDespite the familiarity with our supply partners, there is still risk in successfully tooling, assembling, and producing these products. In addition to the challenges that present themselves with manufacturing, the Battery Photo Case also requires external certifications for the battery, electronics performance, and MFI compliance. Failure could result in significant delays in troubleshooting, redesigning, and retesting. \n\nOur target shipping dates are by the end of May, June, and July, depending on which level you back. We would love to ship earlier and we will do everything we can to make this happen. \n\nKeep in mind we will also trade quality for schedule as we are committed to making the best products we possibly can for mobile photography.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Photo Case (7/7+)", "descp": "Receive ONE Photo Case for iPhone 7 OR iPhone 7+ in either Walnut Wood OR Black Canvas.

No electronics - some paper, a pair of lenses and a cartridge for instant mini photos. Environment friendly - we use less materials than used in the packaging of a regular camera. The camera body, the shutter and aperture are made of thick paper and laminated cardboard.\nStretch Goals:\nVintage Design - retro with a little steampunk.\nFoldout and Compact - a little bigger than an iphone box.\nA Great Gift - can be used immediately and instantly.\nA Great Toy - Jollylook is a great teaching toy for children. Your kid can take it apart and see how it works.\nA Great Souvenir - even after use Jollylook is beautiful on the shelf!\nFun - entertaining and positive emotions.\nBeautiful Photos - using Instax mini film you get 10 instant classic color or monochrome analog unique photos. (the cartridges can be changed many times easily and quickly )\nEnvironment Friendly - easily recyclable, as dangerous to the environment as a banana peal!\nThe Magic\nWhen moments of life that we see freeze on paper - it is magic. Imagine the people who saw it happen for the first time nearly two hundred years ago! Year after year, many people learned \"freezing\" moments of life on paper. Take what we made for you and create the magic for yourself, learn and experience some part of what had to be done, all the effort to freeze a moment.\nThe Magic!\nHow does it work?\nJust as an analog plastic and metal camera! Set the lens position to landscape, group, portrait or macro:\nChoose the aperture  (f/8, f/11, f/16, f/22; f/32; f/45; f/64; pinhole)\nPull out the viewfinder:\n Look through the viewfinder:\nPress the shutter-release button!\n  Then roll out the exposed photo by turning the handle for developing - the rollers break the capsule with the processing liquid, and initiate the developing process.\nAfter a few minutes you have a unique photo in your hands\n Jollylook uses Fujifilm \u201cinstax mini\u201d instant film cartridges which are available worldwide\n  The cartridges can be changed many times!\nHow it all began:\nOnce I was showing my son what's inside the analog camera and how analog photography works, I thought then - \"what if the package itself transformed and fulfilled the function of the camera and the picture turned out immediately?! There was no problem with instant photo technology, people solved this problem long time ago. What remained to create was an analog camera that would be simple and contained in the package, worked properly and allowed to take photos and get instant results.\nI had to study the structure of many analog cameras, before being able to make the shutter - the most difficult part in the development was the shutter (no existing structure worked for Jollylook, so I had to invent a new shutter). After construction and testing of many prototypes we made it, a shutter which works perfectly and consists of only four pieces of thick paper and two tiny circular rubber bands. After picking the right lens and calculating the aperture, we created a folding \"accordion\" camera body from paper, then the case where the cartridge is placed, and we moved to the design, here there where no doubts - it had to be retro with a little steampunk look. Then we had difficulties with the unit for getting the photo out from the cartridge but after testing many options, we achieved a perfect result, photographs are now developed and pulled with a rotating handle.\nAnd of course, drawings and mockups ...and then the development of the production technology, the development of the equipment necessary for manufacturing, the selection of materials, the search and selection of contractors, and many other important little things that make up the production preparation.\nSome photos taken with Jollylook:\n    You can take close-ups from a distance of 50 cm (20 in) and you can take photos with a pinhole.\n  A pinhole is a tiny hole that acts as a lens, you only need accuracy and patience. When taking photos with the pinhole - exposition can be up to a few minutes long!\nYou can take photos with a manually operated shutter speed and you can take double exposed photos\nP.S. The photo with the dog is the first ever photo made with Jollylook!\nJollylook consists of:\nTechnical specifications:\nLens - a meniscus lens with a focal length of 110 mm ( 4.33 in ), allows to take photos from portrait to landscape. can be moved up to shoot through the pinhole.\nViewfinder - a Fresnel lens \nAperture - a switchable diaphragm with manual adjustment for the seven values: f / 8, f / 11, f / 16, f / 22; f / 32; f / 45; f / 64 + pinhole.\nShutter - automatic with shutter speed of 1/250 or 1/160 and manual shutter mode with the possibility to control the exposure time manually.\nPinhole - a round hole in a copper foil 0.6 mm (0.023 in) in diameter, located on the diaphragm disk\n10 shots per instax mini cartridge (the cartridge can be changed many times)\nStorage conditions - store in a dry and dark place at room temperature.\nconditions of use - use at temperatures between 10 - 35 \u00b0C (50 -95 \u2109) in dry weather.\nSize when folded 85 x 127 x 48 mm ( 311\u204432 x 5 x 157\u204464 in )\nFujifilm \u201cinstax mini\u201d instant film cartridge\nPhoto size 46(W) x 62(H) mm\nThe Rewards:\n The Jollylook Team:\nOleg Khalip - the author of the idea - a designer and inventor with 30 years of experience in organization and design of production facilities in the field of engineering.\nYuri Sibiryakov - an experienced designer with 40 years of experience in aviation engineering, design of devices and equipment. in Jollylook he is in charge of product design and production equipment.\nEvgeniy Ivanov \u2013 a film director who loves instant photography and film. Our internet man, takes care of marketing, PR and social networks.\nAnna Gorbenko - organizes cooperations and procurement, monitors the delivery and saves our money. Also many times she reminds us to eat!\nMariia Khalip \u2013 creates computer graphics and artwork. Inspires us with her neatness and greate sense of style.\nWhat is done:\nDeveloped, manufactured and tested several dozens of prototypes\nWe have developed various versions and tested the tooling for production\nWe applied for a patent in the US and globally\nWhat has to be done:\nOrder the production of molds for the lenses and the developing unit\nOrganize a large-scale production\nMarketing\nWhy do we need you support?\nWe chose Kickstarter because this is where people who are interested in everything new and unusual are, they are positive and supportive.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo. We've brought several Kickstarter projects to life in the past, and have learned from our experiences.

None of it actually considers the needs of your head.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re bringing you the Purple\u00ae Pillow, the world\u2019s first pillow that\u2019s more like a bed for your head! \n   How Does It Work? \nThe Purple\u00ae Pillow is made of three parts:\nPurple\u2019s patented Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 (the stretchy purple stuff) is organized in hundreds of little triangles. Unlike most pillows that might go flat and lose shape, the triangles give the core of the pillow lateral strength so it retains its oh-so supportive, head-cradling comfort all night. You never have to readjust or fluff, and your head doesn\u2019t sink or shift. SCIENCE! \nPurple includes an adjustable air booster if you want to add a little extra height to your pillow. This is great for side sleepers and snorers, making the Purple\u00ae Pillow perfect for just about anyone. \nThe Purple\u00ae Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and air booster fit perfectly inside a super soft cover. The cover is made from polyester to make it gentle on your face, breathable so you don't sleep hot, and stretchy so your head can sink into the squishy Purple goodness.\n Every time you share Purple on social media, the Sleepy Scientist will save a Wookie! Support Purple (and Chewbacca) by taking 2 seconds to share the Purple\u00ae Pillow with your friends! \n               Who Needs a Purple\u00ae Pillow? \nAnyone who sleeps or has a head.\nThe traditional idea of a \u201cpillow\u201d isn\u2019t working. They\u2019re lumpy, flat, hot, and lack proper neck support.\nWe didn\u2019t treat the pillow like an accessory to your mattress, but as a mattress in and of itself\u2014a bed for your head.\nThe head has its own set of needs: \nYour 8-10 pounds of precious cargo need to be supported and comfortable \nYour shoulder needs some strain relief \nYour neck needs gentle, yet firm support \nYou need breathability so your head stays cool all night \nYou need a pillow that keeps its shape so you aren\u2019t waking up and readjusting \nWe reimagined the \u201cpillow\u201d as a \u201chead bed\u201d and used the same revolutionary material that has worked so well for so many people in our Purple\u00ae Bed to create it.\nWhat\u2019s the Purple\u00ae Bed? \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed is the first product we launched on Kickstarter exactly one year ago. The response to our launch has been so overwhelmingly positive, and the warm welcome we received on Kickstarter encouraged us to come back with our new, game-changing product.\nThe mattress is made with a layer of Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122\u2014a super stretchy, super durable, non-toxic, food-grade material that we invented to give people the perfect balance of support and comfort they need in a mattress.\nThe Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 is arranged in a grid system we call the Smart Comfort Grid\u2122. This grid system creates small columns all over the mattress that help support your body while allowing your pressure points to relax into the mattress.\nThis is all wrapped in a super stretchy and soft cover to make the perfect mattress. And now we have the perfect pillow to match! \nRevolutionary Technology & Design, You Say? \nIndeed!\nUnlike most pillows, our Purple\u00ae Pillow isn\u2019t a bunch of old, ineffective materials smashed together in an uncomfortable, lumpy rectangle. Instead, we took the game-changing material in our mattress, Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122, and optimized it for your head.\nThe pillow is 24\" long, 16\" wide, and about 3\" tall without the booster. The optional air booster adds up to two extra inches of height. \nWarning: This pillow is not for pillow fights! It weighs about 10 pounds, and that\u2019s a good thing because weight equals quality. Purple is heavy because we use the highest quality materials to make our ultimate comfort technology. \nPurple believes all sleepers deserve a great night\u2019s sleep, so we wanted to make the Purple\u00ae Pillow customizable. That\u2019s why we included an air booster that can be inflated to raise the pillow to your desired height. \nThis is great for side sleepers or snorers who need a little extra boost (see what we did there?) when they sleep. No matter how you sleep, your neck should always be in beautiful alignment with the Purple\u00ae Pillow!\nThe material on the outside of the pillow (or head bed, as we like to call it) is super soft and comfortable. It is made from polyester. This fabric makes your pillow ultra-touchable and super stretchy, so your face feels like it\u2019s being hugged by a panda bear while your head comfortably relaxes into a pool of Purple awesome. \nPurple vs. Other Pillows \nNeck support completely evacuates to either side of your head, forcing you to fluff all night.\n  The Wedge causes neck strain so your spine can't be in perfect alignment. Ouch!\n  Too much neck support means neck and shoulder pain so you look like an evil henchman the next day.\n  Not enough or too much neck support\u2014either way you wake up sweaty from the hot memory foam.\n  The Purple\u00ae Pillow perfectly cradles your cranium while supporting your neck without you needing to readjust.\nWhat\u2019s In It For Me?\n   What Are Other People Saying About Purple? \n\"Purple is one of the most unique mattresses I have tested to date. A combination of a Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 and two layers of polyurethane foam come together for a feel unlike any other. There are great levels of support, comfort, bounce, and exceptional cooling. Purple does a nice job of relieving pressure points in addition to minimizing motion transfer across the mattress.\" - Sleepopolis Review, 4.7 Stars\nHow Purple, Uber and Airbnb Are Disrupting and Redefining Old Industries - Entrepreneur\n3 Highly Memorable Product Demos That Made Their Brand - Inc.\nCan't Fall Asleep or Stay Asleep? 6 Products That Will Change Your Life - Lifehack\nPurple Is Better Than Any Mattress at Macy's, Walmart or Costco - Clapway\nWhy Kickstarter? \nStep one in our mission to bring comfort to everyone in the world was the Purple\u00ae Bed. We were blown away by the incredible support we got from the Kickstarter community and for the mattress after our campaign ended. Clearly, we are addressing a problem millions of people are experiencing every day: bad, uncomfortable sleep that affects their health, productivity, and happiness.\nWith the Purple\u00ae Pillow, we begin step two. We are calling on our community of innovators on Kickstarter to help us launch this new, unique product. We can\u2019t do this without your support, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve come back to Kickstarter, to share the next step in our comfort mission with you first. \nHistory of Purple \nIn 1989, two brothers, engineers Tony and Terry Pearce, partnered to change the world.\nTony\u2019s 13 years of experience in advanced aerospace materials, and Terry\u2019s 20 years of experience in manufacturing, design, and project management, led to a partnership creating high-tech carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs.\nThe Pearce brothers created technology that was used in products by Nike, Johnson & Johnson, and Hill-Rom. But, eventually, the Pearces set out to create a technology that could revolutionize cushioning at a much lower cost. Purple began to evolve through a series of discoveries and product developments. The first breakthrough came in 1996, when the Pearces invented Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122.\nThis amazingly soft, yet strong material could stretch 15 times its resting size, was uber-durable, and never took a body impression. The key discovery came when Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 was molded in a shape that could \u201crelax\u201d under pressure points, redistributing the pressure to other areas. The same feature turned out to give amazing back support in mattresses.\nThree years ago, the Pearces set out to combine all their knowledge of cushioning into the world\u2019s best mattress. The Pearce brothers use custom designed and built machinery to make Hyper-Elastic Polymer\u2122 in the USA at production rates that allowed them to significantly cut the cost of this miracle material to consumers. \nThe Purple\u00ae Bed was born! And just as the Pearce brothers dreamed it would be, it is better than any $4000 mattress and costs significantly less. That was the goal, and Purple achieved it!\nWhy Purple? Well, why not? It is an awesome color, and it signifies treating everyone like royalty. The Pearces have spent most of their high-tech careers advancing the world of cushioning. With the Purple\u00ae Bed, and now Purple\u00ae Pillow, they have put all they\u2019ve learned into the world\u2019s greatest sleep products, and they figured out how to do it so everyone can afford it.

We\u2019ve built the molds and machinery for our initial launch, and a portion of the money we raise here will go to fund the production of more molds and machinery so we can continue making Purple in the USA at our Alpine, Utah factory.\n\nProduction time will be our biggest challenge, as we do make all of the Purple for all of our products at our factory. However, we are guaranteeing the first 1,000 will be delivered by Christmas! Another portion of our funding will be used to grow our Purple team to meet production demands.\n\nAnother challenge might be working with our product partners to get certain international components to the factory in time to hit delivery deadlines. However, we\u2019ve worked hard over the last several months to build up these relationships and plan accordingly.

A zoetrope is an animation toy developed prior to film animation. These toys create the illusion of movement through a rapid succession of images. The original zoetrope was designed using a cylindrical device where the viewer is stationary and the images are in motion. Later variations of the zoetrope evolved into the lateral zoetrope where the images become stationary and the viewer is in motion. The lateral zoetrope has been incorporated into the mass transit systems of multiple urban cities. The use of zoetropes in this manner creates a novel and exciting experience for the riders.  \nLife Turning is the meaning of zoetrope in Greek.

Good for you. Good for the planet.\nThe biggest ever breakthrough in the way we use toothpaste, Poppits softgel pods melt right in your mouth! We have eliminated the need for plastic tubes or pumps that create messes and gunky buildup over time. \nNot to mention, toothpaste tubes sit in our landfills for over 500 years before they decompose. Poppits packaging is 100% biodegradable- now that\u2019s something to smile about!\nPoppits comes in two varieties: Whitening Poppits\u2122 for adults and Kids Poppits\u2122\nEach softgel pod is made of an edible plant-derived cellulose film that melts in the mouth. The toothpaste inside is fluoride-free and made from natural ingredients. There are no animal fats anywhere in our products.\n\nOur future phases of manufacturing will include additional flavors and formulas including a natural fluoride version.\nPoppits in the news:\n    Sure, there are fun toothbrushes out there, but what about the actual toothpaste?\nKids love Poppits and the sensation of popping it in their mouth and the burst of fun fruity flavor. Poppits are a fun and easy way to get kids engaged in oral care.\nEach Kids Poppits\u00ae box contains three fun fruity flavors; Sweet Strawberry, Green Apple and Merry Berry. \nLearning good oral hygiene as a kid carries over to adulthood. Poppits has the dentist-recommended amount of toothpaste in each pod, so kids learn the safe, effective amount they need to have healthy teeth.\n    Traditional toothpaste tubes get sticky residue all over the sink or over the top of the tube when caps get lost. With Poppits, these messes are a thing of the past.\n  It makes perfect sense. There\u2019s no more squeezing that gunky toothpaste tube into the bristles of your brush! Effectively reducing cross-contamination, Poppits are the most hygienic way to get a healthy, pearly white smile.\n  Breathe a breath of fresh air! Whitening Poppits come with 90 softgel pods. Each one contains fresh minty toothpaste sealed in a water-soluble whitening film to brighten your smile! \nIt\u2019s always hard to get that last bit of toothpaste from a rolled-up squeezed tube but with Poppits you get it all! Right down to the last fresh pod! \nPoppits are the perfect travel accessory because they are small, convenient and most importantly, meet TSA requirements for your carry-on luggage.\nNo more wrapping a toothpaste tube in a plastic bag and having it burst! \n  Poppits\u2122 are bringing a revolutionary change to the way we brush our teeth. This is the biggest breakthrough ever in the toothpaste industry. No more plastic tubes! Good for you. Good for the planet. \n   Our custom-designed paperboard packaging is environmentally-friendly and biodegradable.

Cooler than Willy Wonka\u2019s Chocolate Factory, we think! The manufacturing plant that produces Poppits also produces many other household consumer goods. \nStay tuned! In the coming weeks, we\u2019ll post a wee video in our updates to show you Poppits being made.\nWe are proud to partner with the most trusted manufacturers and suppliers in the USA to bring you the very best.

At first glance En Route appears to be very light and simplistic. That is not true. This game has a level of suspense and energy only exceeded by social deduction games.\nI have struggled to convey what makes this game interesting. This game is intense and creates a lot of suspense as you race to finish your objectives before the other players. Since the goals are hidden you don't know when your opponents will take take resources you need or even when someone else will win the game. I really love the energy of the game, I would like to convey that message to you, the viewers of this campaign.\nThis is a gateway game. You can play it with your non-gamer friends.\nPledge $1 for immediate access to the print-and-play\nEasy to Learn, Easy to Play\nEn Route was designed to enjoy with your family and friends. It only takes a few minutes to learn and less than an hour to play. Yet it still requires strategy and engages players of all levels.\nRules\nDownload the instruction booklet to see the rules. All backers get immediate access to the print-and-play game. Which includes PDFs for the instruction booklet, game board, cards and tokens.\nHere is a brief overview of the rules:\nPlace the board in the center of the table (I know all the podcasters out there love this rule. Ahem, Rolling Dice & Taking Names)\nPlayers have a hand of 4 action cards and 3 goal cards. The hand is secret.\nThe goal is to deliver the 2 goods indicated on the goal card to the indicated city for each of your 3 goal cards.\nThe cards in hand can be played to move items from adjacent cities or to produce the good that city produces.\nUp to three goods tokens can be moved when transiting between cities.\nWhen a city has goods on it, it's considered open and you can move to it or produce its good without playing a card from your hand.\nThe goal card can be played as an action card, but beware if you play it before completing it you'll show your objective to your opponenets.\nThe goods are limited and the conflict becomes real when your opponent takes advantage of the pile of goods you are move toward your own goal.\nBeautiful Components\n A lot of attention was given to the design and layout of the components. The cards are easy to read even when fanned out in your hands. The board is elegant and simple. The tokens are marked and easy to distinguish.\nGame Play\nEach player begins the game with three hidden goals. Players take turns playing cards to produce goods or move them between cities. As the game progresses the players will reveal their completed objectives. The game will keep you on the edge of your seat as you try to be the first to complete all three goals.\nComponents\nWe have received and tested several variations of components. All final components will be high quality and durable. The box and cards will have linen finish. The cards will be poker quality, ivory core cards. We continue to look for ways to improve the quality and experience of the game. We hope to upgrade the paperboard tokens to printed wooden tokens with our first stretch goal.\nDevelopment\nEn Route has already been prototyped, play tested and edited. The game play and mechanics are solid and the art is finished. We've enjoyed developing this game and playing it with our friends and family. We hope you have the chance to enjoy it as much as we have.\nEn Route has easy to understand instructions so it's easy to get going and start having fun.\nShipping\nWe are working with fulfillment companies to provide Canadian and European Union backers customs-free shipping. We know you don't want to pay extra customs or VAT and you won't have to.\nCreators\nEn Route was created by Nathan and Jake Jenne. Both Jake and Nathan enjoy designing games together. They have spent many years working through various projects together and hope you'll enjoy this game as much as they have. Nathan and Jake sincerely appreciate your help.\nImportant Stuff\nThis game is friendly to the colorblind. We don't exclusively rely on colors to distinguish tokens, cards or placement. Additionally, the text is easy to read and high contrast.\nWe really focus on keeping our games family-friendly. This means we don't use questionable graphics. We don't use suggestive content. We keep the language clean and friendly. This doesn't mean we neuter the experience for adults or make games devoid of strategy. This simply means we want to reach the largest audience possible and we don't want you to be embarrassed when your kids, friends, parents, spouse walk into the room.\nWe strongly support women in gaming. Nothing we do will indicate otherwise.\nTrack this project on kicktraq", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risks and challenges are the typical risks and challenges associated with sourcing and printing the game in volume and the logistics of delivery.\n\nWhile we don't expect huge problems we are preparing contingency plans for some of the more common issues.\n\nThe biggest risk is delayed delivery. As you are probably aware many projects run into this problem. We are trying very hard to meet our projected dates.

After lift-off from Cape Canaveral as a secondary payload on an Atlas V rocket, our ground stations at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and Georgia Tech communicated with LightSail as it deployed its solar sails and captured images. The LightSail test mission ended there, but with your help we can make our second spacecraft truly sail on sunlight during its primary mission in 2016.\nGoal Update: Next Destination \u2013 $1,240,000!\nThe milestones keep falling away, and our biggest milestone, the BIG stretch going from $550,000 all the way to $1 million, is now behind us. And this is because of you, our backers. Thank you! \nIn the months ahead, we're going to be really busy applying lessons learned from our test flight. The LightSail project team will make critical investments and apply the lessons learned from our test flight and ensure success of the primary mission in 2016. We completed the original construction of the spacecraft four years ago, so some updates are now warranted. The LightSail flight system electronics and software will be upgraded to the most current versions to ensure that they are reliable and thoroughly tested. We will also be examining and revising the power system (batteries and electronics) to avoid the types of problems we encountered during the test flight. The on-board cameras will also likely get an upgrade to the most current versions. \nOn the ground, we will put the LightSail spacecraft through an extended series of tests and simulations to drive out issues related to long-term flight, and we will be bringing in a number of highly experienced expert consultants to thoroughly review the LightSail design and operations plans. \n We will provide resources to better support the network of volunteer observers, which was invaluable during the test flight. With them, we will improve our ability track and observe LightSail while directly involving amateur communities in mission operations. \n The list of our best ideas at this stage include: \nFlight Upgrades\n Avionics Upgrade Power System Revision \nCamera Upgrade \nRedundant Burnwire system \nGround Station Upgrades \n Add & Validate 3rd Ground Station \nEnhance Ground Station for Testing \nContract for Subsystem Experts \nDuplicate Benchsat \nSet-Up Dedicated Operations Comms Network \nCrowd Sourced Mission Operations \nStaffing - create a part-time liaison position \nDedicated Web Portal \n\"How-to\" videos on setting up ground stations as well as processing and delivering data to mission control \nGrants for Amateur Ground Observers \nThe full plan for upgrades will be developed and presented at a major project review meeting scheduled for mid-July. The Flight System Upgrades are still being pulled together, and more information is yet needed on those costs. However, the Ground Station Upgrades and Crowd Sourced Mission Operations pieces are budgeted and are estimated to cost $186,000 and $54,000, respectively. These two pieces, then, comprise our $240,000 stretch goal. \nThis past year, I had some fun learning a new strategic planning term\u2014the BHAG or Big Hairy Audacious Goal. I changed it up a bit to the BHAAG, or Big Hairy Audacious Achievable Goal. Yes, $240,000 is a big number, but it's achievable if the backer community supports us. We have over 19,500 backers (soon to be 20,000?) which means that if everyone added just $12 to their pledge, we can make this goal. \nHow amazing is that? Over 19,000 backers and another 42,000 Planetary Society members joining together to power a mission to demonstrate a CubeSat propulsion system at a fraction of the cost of a government program. With each of us doing just a little bit more, we can make big thing happen. That's the power of democratized space exploration! \nWhen we hit $1,240,000, we will also unlock our next stretch goal reward for all $35+ backers. But guess what? We didn't have a plan for a post-$1 million stretch goal! So, we are improvising because you pushed us farther and farther. If we get to the $1.24 million stretch goal, we will put everyone who has backed us for $35 or more into a giant pool and randomly select one of you to join us for our post-LightSail symposium to fulfill and critical task\u2014you will become a volunteer blogger for us and attend our symposium as a representative of the backer community. \nIt is important to note that the winner will have some very real responsibilities. We will expect you to post and/or tweet about what you are learning, and to post updates for the project backers. We can't bring all 20,000 backers to the symposium, but be can bring one of you to represent the community. How cool is that? And there will have to be some legal \"fine print,\" of course. You will have to be an adult. And, we will limit airfare to the value of a domestic US fare, and we will cover food and lodging for the trip, only. If you are an international backer, you will still be eligible, but you will have to be responsible for all passport and visa issues (though we will provide any necessary administrative support). And last, the we will cap the total costs that we will provide or reimburse at $2,500. If unforeseen legal issues arise, then we will make a good faith effort to resolve them while reserving the right to offer a different stretch goal reward to this community in place of this one. So, with those caveats, we would like to offer this outstanding stretch goal reward opportunity. Make sure you can qualify for this reward by spreading to word! \nThe final days of the campaign are just ahead of us. It's exciting!

I invite you to come along on a cosmic journey with me by participating in a mission to sail a spacecraft, a tiny CubeSat no bigger than a breadbox, on beams of light. Imagine it: unlimited free energy from the Sun will provide CubeSats with propulsion and revolutionize access to space for low-cost citizen projects\u2014projects like ours or by teams of students and faculty at universities. This means that spacecraft, especially small ones like CubeSats, won't have to carry heavy fuels into orbit, and that the acceleration will be continuous. Even better, this is a journey that is directly funded by the world\u2019s citizens, like you, rather than by governments. LightSail\u2122 is truly \u201cthe people\u2019s spacecraft.\u201d\nOur LightSail mission will be the culmination of the hopes and dreams of our visionary founders, Louis Friedman, Bruce Murray and Carl Sagan. Some of you may remember Carl famously promoting solar sailing on Johnny Carson\u2019s The Tonight Show.\nLightSail is a huge contribution to space science and exploration. To learn more about this amazing project, check out our dedicated website at sail.planetary.org. Through this proof-of-concept mission, we will use CubeSats to open new paths beyond Earth and, one day, potentially to other planets with an inexpensive, inexhaustible means of propulsion: photons, solar energy in its purest form. We need backers like you to join us in getting to this epic point in space exploration history. LightSail propulsion truly holds the promise\u2014dare I say it?\u2014to change the world!\nTo tweet this, click here.  \nTo post on Facebook, click here.   \nLightSail\u2019s Moment in the Sun\nIt\u2019s going to be a big year for LightSail\u2014we\u2019re headed to space! First, we will test our prototype this month and next by flying it in low-Earth orbit for about 30 days. While our Kickstarter campaign runs, you\u2019ll be able to follow along in real-time as we validate the deployment of our sail booms in zero gravity as well as other key spacecraft characteristics. This is a huge opportunity for us to learn and apply lessons from the test program to the primary mission currently scheduled for fall 2016.  \nHere\u2019s where you come in. The final bill for LightSail is projected at $5.45 million, of which we have just over $1.2 million left to raise. We\u2019re nearly there, but our final push will be critical to getting to the launch pad next year. So we\u2019re reaching out to the Kickstarter community for backing at this key moment. We invite you to get on board the mission and help LightSail soar. Without your support, the project can\u2019t happen.\nWe don\u2019t expect to get this all from one source at one time, but you can put us on the trajectory to launching in 2016. We are setting an ambitious Kickstarter goal of $200,000, with stretch goals that take us all the way up to the $1 million mark. These goals will take us from 1) spacecraft construction, integration and testing; 2) through orbital operations (actual solar sailing!); 3) to data collection, analysis, and publication of results; and 4) a slew of public awareness and education activities to make sure solar sailing is widely noticed and adopted.\nAnd as we reach our stretch goals, we will unlock special digital-only rewards for all backers of $35 or more, like a video of our day-in-the-life test, an image from space, LightSail spacecraft schematics, and a copy of our symposium publication. Please be sure to share this project with your friends and fellow space-enthusiasts! \nThat\u2019s Right, There Are Rewards!\nWe invite you to join the LightSail mission team as a backer who supports space science and exploration. YOU can help unleash the potential of low-cost, citizen-funded exploration. When you get on board, we\u2019ll send you some fantastic rewards such as a \u201csquare centimeter of sail,\u201d an exclusive mission patch, LightSail t-shirt, a LightSail-gazing kit, limited edition LightSail poster, and lots, lots more including even sending your name to space on LightSail in 2016! We've worked with Planetary Society partners, a couple of which may be familiar to the Kickstarter community, like Chop Shop, ISS Above and Celestron to create these opportunities. All backers of $35 or more who are not already members will get a one-year individual membership in The Planetary Society\u2014the world's largest space advocacy organization.

The spacecraft is undergoing modifications and integration at Ecliptic Enterprises. Subsystems checks are underway, with functional testing scheduled to be complete by the end of June. Upcoming milestones for the primary spacecraft, all subject to change as the work unfolds, include:\nMay - July 2015\u2014Prototype flight operations and analysis\nJuly 2015\u2014Test readiness review for system level testing  \nJuly 2015\u2014Final subsystem and software tests\nAugust 2015\u2014Day in the Life test (a run-through of all mission-related activities for the spacecraft)\nSeptember 2015\u2014Vibration and T-Vac Testing\nOctober 2015\u2014LightSail readiness and pre-ship review \nOctober 2015\u2014integrate into launch canister\nDecember 2015\u2014LightSail craft completed; ready for launch!\nDetails on the Mission \nLightSail is a citizen-funded project that will make solar sail propulsion a reality for CubeSats and other small spacecraft!\nTest Flight \nMay 2015 We are flying our prototype right now, this very month! And you can follow along on by becoming a backer for our Kickstarter project, or by following us at sail.planetary.org.\nFollowing three years of painstaking design and testing, we\u2019re testing to see how LightSail flies. This month and next, May and June 2015, the first prototype LightSail CubeSat will hitch a ride to orbit aboard an Atlas V rocket for a shakedown cruise. This flight is sponsored by NASA\u2019s Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program which helps CubeSat operators find free rides to orbit. The Atlas V rocket's primary payload is a classified U.S. Air Force mission called AFSPC-5 (an Air Force Space Command acronym). \nWe won\u2019t fly high enough above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere for solar sailing, due to atmospheric drag, but we\u2019ll do critical tests of several systems over a 28+ day mission, including a zero-gravity test of our sail deployment sequence and attempt to snap pictures documenting the operation of the booms that support the sails. About one week after sail deployment, with its work finished, LightSail\u2019s orbit will decay due to atmospheric drag, and it will burn-up on re-entry into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \nThe purpose of this first flight is to \u201cbuy down risk,\u201d as NASA might say. There are bound to be hiccups, and that\u2019s the point\u2014to learn and apply lessons from the prototype to the primary mission scheduled for 2016. For a detailed timeline of events during the test flight, check out Jason Davis\u2019 blog.\nPrimary Mission: Flight 2016\nThe 2016 mission will mark the first controlled, Earth-orbiter solar sail flight and we'll ride along with the first operational launch of SpaceX\u2019s new Falcon Heavy rocket. LightSail will team-up with Prox-1, a small spacecraft designed by Georgia Tech to demonstrate automated rendezvous and inspection techniques.\nTogether, LightSail and Prox-1 will be released into an orbit with an altitude of 720 kilometers (447 miles), high enough to avoid atmospheric drag. Prox-1 will gently eject LightSail into open space, and a few days later will rendezvous with LightSail to inspect it from all angles. When LightSail unfurls its sails, Prox-1 will be nearby to capture images of the big moment. \nOperations 2016: Solar Sailing \nOnce in space, LightSail\u2019s solar arrays will swing open, revealing the inside of the spacecraft. On command, four metal booms will slowly unwind, just like a tape measure, unfolding four triangular, Mylar sails. Each sail is just 4.5 microns thick\u2014one-fourth the thickness of the typical trash bag. Together, the sails span over 32 square meters\u2014large enough to provide real propulsion using only sunlight. \nWhen the sails deploy, the real action will begin as the mission control team puts LightSail through its paces. As LightSail soars around Earth, its shiny sails may be visible to the naked eye. Thanks to the folks at N2YO.com, our LightSail dashboard webpage (you can see our beta-version here) will provide status and telemetry data, and we'll organize viewing campaigns to show people where, when and how to look. Our researchers and others around the world will follow our progress as we experiment with and demonstrate this new technology. This operations phase will provide critical data to be used in the design and engineering of future solar sailing spacecraft\u2014and a new era in space travel will be born! \nPost-Mission LightSail Review\nWith the mission complete, it will be time to assess the performance of LightSail and to share it with NASA and private industry partners for adoption into other space exploration efforts. The LightSail team already meets regularly with NASA to compare technical notes, and the space agency will be watching with the rest of the world when LightSail\u2019s first images are downloaded.\nThe team and other partners will collect data for analysis, and team members will present findings in a variety of academic and industry forums. The Planetary Society also has plans to host a LightSail Symposium to summarize and share key lessons learned and to actively promote the further adoption of this technology by NASA and other space organizations.\nThe Impact  \nLightSail represents a major leap forward in the concept and technology of solar sailing. Through this program, we're making it possible for other groups, including NASA, to utilize this innovative propulsion technique on CubeSats and other small spacecraft\u2014opening the door to a huge variety of low-cost missions throughout the solar system. With LightSail as the pathfinder, CubeSats propelled solely by sunlight will be able to regularly leave Earth for interplanetary destinations.  \nThe next few steps are already within view. In 2018, the Space Launch System\u2019s inaugural flight will send the Orion spacecraft on an uncrewed lap around the moon. Hitching a ride to lunar orbit will be two NASA-built solar sail CubeSats: Lunar Flashlight and NEA Scout. Lunar Flashlight will circle the Moon, adjusting its position via solar sailing, and using its sails to reflect sunlight into the Moon\u2019s permanently shadowed craters for scientific observations. NEA Scout (the NEA stands for Near Earth Asteroid) will use its solar sails to spiral out of lunar orbit entirely, heading for a rendezvous with an asteroid.\nLightSail in the News \nBecause of its revolutionary approach, LightSail has inspired a great deal of attention from the media, with over 200 stories generated since January of this year alone. Worldwide, it has appeared in outlets such as the Los Angeles Times, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the industry-insider SpaceNews, and CNET.com, just to name a few. \nRecently LightSail made an appearance on national television during a segment by CBS Evening News. \nFeatured in the video was Planetary Society Chief Operating Officer Jennifer Vaughn, who spoke about LightSail\u2019s mission to demonstrate the viability of solar sailing for small spacecraft. \u201cWe really hope to kick-start a process where others now take the technology and make it better,\u201d she said. Also speaking about the project was Ecliptic Enterprises Corporation CEO Rex Ridenoure, who hosted CBS News during a recent tour of his company. Ecliptic is LightSail\u2019s integrating contractor for testing and flight readiness. The spacecraft shown in Ecliptic\u2019s clean room was actually the primary vehicle, dubbed LightSail-B, which is being prepped for our primary mission in 2016\u2014a ride to orbit on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy next year. The LightSail prototype has actually been shipped to Cape Canaveral, Fla., where it awaits a May 20 launch aboard an Atlas V rocket. \nHere\u2019s a short list of more news stories covering LightSail in the US and around the world: The Verge, TechTimes, Huffington Post, engadget, blastr, slashgear, IGN, Mirror, Adrenaline, webwereld, MOBILEGEEKS, cnBeta, ExtremeTech, Gizmodo, and NPR.  \nCool LightSail Extras\u2014Videos & Selfies\nWhile there a lot more great videos at planetary.org/tv (check out The Planetary Society SciTech Channel in particular), check out Light Sail - Flight by Light here:   \nAnd while LightSail may be too small to carry an astronaut, it's not too small to take YOU!

It is involved in research and engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, exploration, public outreach, and political advocacy. Founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, it has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world. The Society is dedicated to the exploration of the Solar System, the search for Near Earth Objects, and the search for extraterrestrial life. The society's mission is \u201cTo empower the world's citizens to advance space science and exploration.\u201d To learn more, visit www.planetary.org.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou may have heard this before, but it bears mentioning here: space is hard. Indeed, the entire LightSail project is a proof-of-concept experiment, and there is no guaranteed outcome. Despite genius engineering and painstaking work, failure could come at various stages\u2014at launch, at release, during radio/attitude control testing, and at sail deployment. Or, we could just be delayed in our launch\u2014a day, a week or a month or more due to technical, weather or other scheduling issues. \n\nOne of the great storylines in the LightSail saga is the project rising from the ashes (or in this case, the waters) like the Phoenix of Greek mythology. The Planetary Society lost our first solar sailing prototype spacecraft, Cosmos 1, in June 2005 (almost exactly 10 years ago!) when the Russian Volna rocket that was lifting it into orbit failed and went off-course, landing somewhere in the Barents Sea. The Atlas V and SpaceX Falcon Heavy rockets promise more reliable rides to the stars, but things can always take a turn because, well, space is hard.\n\nThe Society will keep project backers informed about progress\u2014both accomplishments and challenges\u2014right here on our Kickstarter Updates page. Even better, we have dedicated reporter, Jason Davis, embedded with the project to really dig in on what's going on. His blogs are available at www.planetary.org/blogs/jason-davis and much more information is available on our dedicated micro-site, http://sail.planetary.org. Not only will you be monitoring our progress, but NASA and other researchers will, too! \n\nWhat's not at risk is the incredible opportunity that we have to experiment with solar sailing for CubeSats, to demonstrate the process of science, and to share the passion, beauty and joy of space exploration.

In the 1930s-50s they became the go-to camera for press photographers and artists, with American photographer Ansel Adams becoming a pioneer in landscape photography. \nSince then this branch of photography has defiantly continued to produce some of the most important and beautiful pictures ever created. It has resisted the digital revolution and continues to attract new, passionate photographers despite the technology being over 100 years old. This attraction is for one simple reason, large format photography is as far away from digital photography you could possibly get, there is 0% automation, your camera does not have a microchip for a brain. It has you. \nIt is entirely pure photography and allows maximum creative freedom. The large format camera is a tool for art, not convenience. The images have warmth to them akin to the sound of a vinyl record, and a quality to them you just can\u2019t quite put your finger on. So maybe it isn\u2019t one simple reason, maybe I don\u2019t really know exactly why these cameras are so special. I do however know they are manifestly important to the future of photography, and to us! \nSo why redesign this \u2018perfect\u2019 camera? Well, we feel there is a need for an affordable non second hand camera that is simple to use, lightweight, compact, and most of all a great tool to get new photographers passionate about large format photography. This fantastic art form will only live on if people continue to discover and enjoy it. I hope the Intrepid Camera can help people do just that. \nFinal camera will be made from high quality Birch Ply Wood milled using a CNC Router with Aluminium supports and hinges, so it will look slightly different to the one above. \nGround Glass focusing screen that lets you compose and focus your image by moving the lens with the rack and pinion mechanism. \nTakes 75-300mm lenses in Linhof/Technika style lens boards.\nFull movements on the front standard.\nThe design gives the camera excellent strength and rigidity, whilst keeping the weight low at around 1.2kg.\nCompatible with standard film holders as well as the 405 and 545/545i (if funding is successful some of the funds are earmarked for the development of a Graflok back).\nChoice of four bellows colours Black, Blue, Red and Green.\nStandard Tripod mount\nPortrait and landscape rotating back \nPlease note the camera does not come with a lens, please see the lens buying guide bellow for help.\nCamera folds down to 190mmx190mmx120mm.\nCompact and light weight enough to not be a burden whilst out in the field.\n4x5 is an amazing format. The film comes in sheets that are much larger than your standard 35mm- 13x larger in fact. This lends an incredible amount of clarity and depth in your images.

This being said there are elements of the design that can only realistically be tested once we have been funded; for example changing the support struts and hinges to aluminium instead of wood. \n\nThe manufacturing method has been tested on a small scale, but obviously not on the scale that will be required if we are successful. However this has been very thoroughly worked out and we are confident it will scale up with no big problems.\n\nAs with all Kickstarter projects, customers are exposed to the process of product development and this has its risks attached. Saying that, we are fairly late on in the product development stage, which gives us slightly more confidence in when we can deliver this product.

Follow along with all our production news and updates at www.coolest.com/countdown!\nA 21st Century Cooler? It's about time!\nRegular coolers are boring, break easily and are a hassle to haul around just to carry the ice. The COOLEST cooler is 60 quarts of AWESOME packed with so much fun you'll look for excuses to get outside more often.\nMaybe you want to use the built-in ice crushing blender to whip up some margaritas or smoothies on your next boat trip or tailgate?\nMaybe you just want to always have music on hand with the waterproof bluetooth speaker or want to recharge your electronics with the built in USB charger?\nWhat else?\nREWARDS:\nUPDATE:  Color Voting Complete! \nHere are the Final Coolest Color options. When you pledge for a Coolest we'll send you a survey after the campaign to make your color choice.\nScroll on down for more details...                     \n      BLENDER\nNothing is more refreshing on a hot day than a cold blended cocktail or smoothie.  The 18 volt ice-crushing beast built into the COOLEST will power through more than 6 gallons of blended goodness on a single charge.\n WATERPROOF WIRELESS SPEAKERS\nIf life is supposed to be a party, then you better bring the music. You\u2019re gathered around the cooler anyway, but now you can DJ the music right from your phone or Bluetooth-enabled device directly to your COOLEST. Just turn your phone on, match it with the COOLEST speaker, and rock out with your bad self.\n                        USB CHARGER\n Since you\u2019ve got that 18 volt battery for the blender, why not get the most out of it? Maybe your camera battery is low or maybe you have an iPhone you just want to use after 3:00 in the afternoon... Re-charge your gear wherever you are with the waterproof USB charger.\n                          LED LID LIGHT\nThe party doesn\u2019t stop just because the sun goes down, and you shouldn\u2019t have to freeze your fingers searching endlessly for your favorite drink.  The COOLEST has unbreakable lights embedded in the lid so you easily find what you\u2019re looking for with the push of a button.\n                       GEAR TIE-DOWN\nCarrying your gear to and from your destination is a hassle, and your old cooler isn\u2019t doing you any favors.\nThe COOLEST's locking tie-downs are like having a roof-rack on your cooler so three trips can be done in one. Easily secure your lawn chairs, blankets, towels, toys, fishing tackle, or grill.\n                         BEACH TIRES\nOne of the worst unintended workouts can be had by trying to drag a conventional cooler through a sandy beach.  The COOLEST wheels are twice as wide so they roll easily and don't sink in.\n               ESSENTIAL STORAGE\nThere are certain essentials you need for any outdoor gathering so why not have a built in cubby to store them?  The COOLEST has storage for a half dozen reusable plastic plates, which also double as a cutting board for the ceramic rust-proof pairing knife.  \n                SPLIT LID and DIVIDER\nThe COOLEST has a split lid design so you can get access to ice for the blender without letting too much warm air in.  This also lets you keep your cups in the cup holders so you don't have to put everything on the ground just to grab another cold drink.\nThe split lid design and removable divider give you some great packing options.  You can keep your cocktail ice separate from your regular ice. Or you could put ice only on one side, pull the drain plug and the other side becomes a totally dry refrigerator, perfect for keeping sandwiches and any other perishable food cool and dry.\n                       BOTTLE OPENER\nHow many hours of your life have been wasted or teeth chipped because someone walked off with the bottle opener.  My grandpa's cooler had a bottle opener and so does the COOLEST.\nTHE STORY\nI\u2019m always looking to maximize my fun when I get together with my family and friends. That\u2019s why I am so passionate about the COOLEST. I invent lots of things, but other than my Jello-shot catapult very few have brought so much fun to my life. ;)\nI know firsthand how much fun it is to have a cooler with speakers, and a portable blender for beachside margaritas, because I built myself one of each around ten years ago. Last year I reexamined these well-loved creations and realized just how much room for improvement there was. \nWhat's next?\nI have manufactured and brought other products to market, but for a project of this size and complexity I'll be using a pool of experts in the field to make sure the COOLEST lives up to it\u2019s name.\nThe professional sourcing company I've partnered with has manufactured other coolers, as well as high tech gear. They have an experienced team in the field to assist with quality control, shipping and and other logistics. \nWe want you to have your COOLEST as soon as possible. Here\u2019s our plan to achieve that:\nJuly/August: Make lots of new Kickstarter friends, execute manufacturing agreements/standards\nSeptember:Finalize the engineering and prototype iterations and place the tooling orders\nOctober:  Tooling build-out and procurement of raw materials and components\nNovember: Part qualification and pre-production builds, pilot production, quality assurance and product validation\nDecember: Begin manufacturing for the injection molded and blow-molded parts\nJanuary/February: Finalize the assembly and shipment process and begin fulfillment", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one called the COOLEST. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:\n\n\nMANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturers partners with a track record for prompt quality.\n\nPRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the COOLEST gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.\n\nFULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can\u2019t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and my product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.\n\nWe will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our COOLEST customer.\n\nAny pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal.

This eliminates the need to have a separate photographer to take the picture for you so that everyone in your group can get #inthepicture.\nHello Kickstarter!\nWe are excited to be here with our first project. We invented CaseCam to enable users to get the very most out of their mobile devices.\nThe case and app were born out of a desire to be included in group photos of friends and family and to enhance the phone\u2019s capacity for capturing hands-free pictures and videos. CaseCam solves a problem faced by students, moms, dads, travelers, video bloggers, and anyone who uses their phone to snap group photos or take video.\nThe scenario is very familiar. You are with a bunch of friends or family, in a special, memorable place and you want to capture that moment, but no one is around to ask, \u201cHey, can you take our photo?\u201d So you, the photographer, get left out of the photo. CaseCam puts everyone back #inthepicture by eliminating the need for a photographer.\nCaseCam also makes taking video much simpler, allowing you to set your phone on any surface and just press record. This allows users to record the moment without having to hold up their phone and watch it through their phone\u2019s screen.\n\u201cI have a tripod with an iPhone attachment but never use it because it takes forever to set up and it\u2019s a lot to carry around. CaseCam is a quick and easy solution to this problem. Now I can film my swing whenever and wherever.\u201d\n- Ryan Young, Golf Professional\n-\u201cIt is a versatile and innovative product that helps capture images in so many practical situations. Taking Pictures with friends has never been easier.\u201d\n- Nick Schonewald, College Student\n-Whenever I travel, it's almost impossible to take group photos without leaving someone out - usually myself. CaseCam makes it easy to take photos of my friends no matter where I go.\n- Allie, Mullen, Student/Traveler\nCaseCam uses a flip-out mirror kickstand to allow you to take pictures and video without having to hold up your phone. The mirror reflects the light into the iPhone camera and the kickstand clicks into the case when you don\u2019t need it. It also works as a horizontal kickstand to prop up your phone for viewing videos.\nThe CaseCam App inverts the images and video that you capture so that they appear right-side-up again after being reflected off of the mirror.

We live in Kirkland and two kids Gia (6) and Rocco (4). I currently work as a Managing Real Estate Broker at a small real estate office in downtown Kirkland, WA. We have been thinking for years about how a product like CaseCam would improve the day-to-day lives of other parents like us.\nLast year I was looking across the sea of parents sitting on bleachers watching their kids in the preschool holiday show. It seemed like every 3rd parent was, like me, unsuccessfully trying to control their wobbling iPhone camera in their hand while their elbow was uncomfortably propped up on their knee. CaseCam's retractable mobile stand would enable all those parents to shoot better, more stable videos while actually being able to watch firsthand and enjoy the show.\nWe love taking our kids on adventures and vacations. Looking back through the photo album there was only one parent, either my wife or myself, in every family photo. It's just too inconvenient to find a trustworthy impromptu photographer at the beach, zoo or Disneyland that has the patience to frame the shot the way you want. I'm excited to immeasurably improve the quality of the family photos for myself and others when out together having fun.\nWith CaseCam's Bluetooth pairing and screen sharing, our photos will always look the way we want and with everyone included in the picture. We want our kids and our grandkids to look back at these photos and see that we were all there together.\n- Justin Cicero, CaseCam Co-Founder\nGarett Ochs \u2013 Mechanical Engineer & Entrepreneur\nJustin Cicero \u2013 Real Estate Professional & Entrepreneur\nWe would love to thank our family, friends, and everyone who has helped along the journey.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

From hobbyists to semi-pros to aspiring photographers, Flekt helps you take your photography to the next level. \nWhen you love photography like we do, why settle for good when you have the power to be great. Until Flekt, there wasn't a camera accessory that gave you high quality light for affordable prices. \nNatural light in the room vs. Flekt lighting\nNow you can forget fancy and expensive equipment because Flekt gives anyone who loves photography the power to create professional photos. Whether you're in a studio shooting products, at home with the family or on location capturing an indoor or nightime wedding, bring out the inner pro-photographer in you by getting lost in the fun, inspiring and creative world of your very own photo shoot. \niPhone - natural light\nDSLR - cFlekt with silver Exciter Technology\u2122\nWe weren't kidding when we said Flekt was simple and hassle-free. With just THREE parts to the Flekt system, it's easy to create high-quality lighting:\nSimply slip the magAttach into your hot-shoe, lock it down and you're ready to go - it's that easy. It's called magAttach because all attachments connect with magnets to allow fluid pivoting to direct light onto your subject.\nFlekt's ignitor reflector attaches to the front of the magAttach and redirects the light from the pop-up flash 180 degrees back into whichever attachment is on your system. Designed after a right-angle prism, but with concave reflectors, it is an efficient way to redirect light without losing it. \nWe've created the first attachment and we call it cFlekt. The c stands for concave because we designed it around a modified concave reflection principle.  It attaches magnetically to the magAttach and can utilize white, silver and gold removable reflectors.  We are open to any user designing new, exciting attachments for the photography community.\nOur attachments magnetically grip to the magAttach, and have fluid movement to add soft light to your subject.  Use the wall, use the ceiling, anything you can dream of to help you create the photo you want!  With each of the systems, you can have multiple texture and color choices to enhance and change your light. \nOur first inserts will be white, gold and silver.  Choose gold to warm when shooting against the sun, or choose silver with high contrast to kick up the specular highlights for fashion.  Additional inserts will come in the future as well as any other surface and color we can all think of!!\nThese attachments help you create high-quality photos without the hassle or expense of professional equipment.  Simply use the Flekt System with your DSLR to capture beautiful, inspiring pictures that you're extremely proud to call your own.\nBecause we reflect light, we have the opportunity to shape photons in ways that no other product can do. Imagine nano-structured fresnels, retroreflective focusing elements, colors, anything is possible. Our first two coatings will be Lambertian White\u2122 and silver/gold metals with Exciter Technology\u2122 enhancement.\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with silver Exciter Technology\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with gold Exciter Technology\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\ncFlekt with Lambertian White\u2122 insert\nAs a photographer, I got to a point where I wanted to start taking better photographs, so I got into studio photography. One of the products I used to rent all the time was a beauty dish - it was consistently the best form of light I got, so I started wondering if I could create the same quality of lighting from the pop up flash. That's when I met with Impact Design Associates and we got started working on a prototype.\nWe came up with several different design concepts, ensuring we exercised both visual and functional ideas.\nOnce we had our first working prototype, we sent out a bunch of photographers for some beta testing. Using all of their feedback and data, we were able to refine the product even more.\nWe've been designing and refining Flekt for 7 years now but we haven't had the funds to bring it to market - tooling and production can be very costly. So, we turned to Kickstarter because we feel that what we're offering is mutually beneficial - you support our project and help us raise the funds we need to produce Flekt.  It's a win-win, right? \nThe quote from our manufacturer has given us a number we are comfortable with considering our Kickstarter funding goal. We are considering a minimum of 1,000 units - the lead time for 1,000 units is 6 weeks and for 50,000, it's 3 months. We tried to reflect maximum delivery time in our promises to deliver and want to keep a realistic view of over-estimating, not over-promising. We will, of course, keep our backers informed along the way, and will be working to save time anywhere we can without compromising the quality of the product. Flekt is a long-term product with global reach and we want to keep our customers happy for the long term.   \n\nIn terms of shipping and fulfillment, we will use Amazon FBA MCF and Fulfillrite. Fulfillrite will be our kitting facility where the coated reflectors and final Flekt units will be boxed and shipped. Logistics for time frame of arrival of these elements are still being figured out, but we will advise as they get dialed in.

As each part goes through this process, we are getting the 3D CAD files ready, along with some very detailed part design drawings that include incredibly specific callouts.

I have personally had more time to deal with major issues regarding Flekt and am glad to say that solid progress is being made. I am liking the current momentum and will strive to maintain it to get Flekt into your hands.\nSince our last update, we have made two sets of fit and function prototypes to test design modifications. We made an exciting change that we think you\u2019ll really enjoy. Once we received and played with the fit and function prototypes, as well as our CNC machined test prime reflectors, we realized that the friction method we settled on to hold our prime reflectors in place may wear out over time causing the reflector to fall out. One early prototype we created had a magnet system to hold the reflectors in place, so we took that and implemented a new magnet concept into our current engineering and we are proud to say, it rocks! Now the reflectors seat firmly and have a satisfying \u201cclick\u201d when the prime reflector locks into place, and a similarly satisfying separation of the magnets when taking it out!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Post Holiday Update", "update_content": "Hi Backers,\nIt\u2019s been a couple months since we last posted an update, and I am sorry about that.

Once we funded on Kickstarter and then subsequently discovered this, it took us over half a year to complete the detailed engineering work.

This whole project is still being worked on by just two people.\nThe good news is that all of the engineering for Flekt is complete and the 3D models look amazing!

This is where we could use Time and Money: \nIf funded, we want to use our Kickstarter funds to purchase a 3D printer so we can more rapidly prototype some different ideas and parts for the universal support feature, as well as future add-ons for the dock. Corey has the 3D skills to be able to perfectly utilitize this tech to make our ideas into reality. Once the part is finalized, we can quickly mass produce and implement it into all the models.\n.\nProduction Plan\nThe production will be handled here in Burbank, California by ourselves in collaboration with a local laser-cutting workshop.\nCurrently, we're building all of our test models out of a 500 sq. ft. apartment and driving our neighbors crazy with power tools in our storage space (complete with 100ft extension cable haphazardly strewn about the lawn).\nIf we're funded, we'll be renting out a small industrial workspace for our tools and assembly process. We'll need to store a lot of lumber, woodstain and painting materials, and power tools in order to get this wacky thing off the ground. Fortunately, we already have a few places lined up and ready to go.\nInitially, we'll have a crew of 4 people building the docks. If we receive (squee) overwhelming support, we'll give ourselves high-fives all around, and hire on additional help to complete the orders. Fortunately, we have worked out a process that should allow us to get quite a few of these made quickly and efficiently, so our manpower needs will be relatively low.\nRewards\nMinidesks\n\u00bb Paintings from My Cat ($1)Exactly what it says.

More funding means better tools\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe've been working on this by ourselves for months. We love the product. We created it because we want to have one on each of our desks. However, we need to establish that there's a market for this thing.\nWe're animators and designers. We've done game design, programming, studied Arduino, worked in stereography, and generally just attacked whatever we decide is the next thing we want to do. In short, we're detail-oriented control freaks... in a good way. We want to make something great, the right way, and for the right cost.\nFrankly, we don't have a huge savings account, and we don't think we need one because we have plans to keep our overhead low. We don't want to involve investors, simply because we can't afford to lose any percentage of control over this thing to someone who won't understand why we're making this and why we don't want to overcharge everyone for it. We're perfectionists and weirdoes, and we'd like to think we know exactly where these products can go.\nThat's where Kickstarter comes in. For one thing, you all can help us prove that there's still a market for this kind of thing. There's something beautiful about hand-drawn animation, and we think we're not the only ones who see it and still get excited about it.\nSecondly, having the money up front allows us to really push our production into full swing. We're going to need a reasonable amount of money to buy the bulk materials, rent the buliding space, and pay any helping hands we may need along the way.\nLastly, we believe this has the potential to be the beginning of something great. We're not looking for a pile of money to run off into the sunset with. We have plans, designs, and a pile of ideas sitting on hold at the moment, waiting for their time to shine. Some of these are features we'd like to develop and eventually add to the dock's functionality. Some of them are still animation-related but entirely different products altogether. If this thing manages to take off, you'd better believe that money will going straight back into new products for animation lovers everywhere.\nWho Are We\nWe are a couple of animation nerds. We watch documentaries about the multi-plane camera and argue about whether or not something we're watching is rotoscoped. Animation and its history has always played a large role in forming who we are as both humans and artists. We like to take our love for animation and art and share it with our friends, and we always geek out out on things like old animation desks and art supplies. If you're interested in more specific information about us, here's a quick breakdown of our two project leaders.  \nCorey & Tammy\n\nTammy Smith is a native Floridian who grew up with an above-average dose of the Disney channel and the Walt Disney World theme parks. Thanks to her family, she always had a strong background in science, arts, history, and sassy lady-ness. A winner of Terrible Timing, she made it to college just at the 2D animation programs were shelved. Ever since graduating from UCF as a Digital Media major, she has never stopped advancing her education on her own. She is a self-taught Illustrator, web designer, animator, model builder, & cat-enthusiast, and has more Twitter followers than her husband can understand.  \nTechnical background with 14+ years experience in IT including web, app, game design, & UI/UX\nArtist & Producer - Experience running & supporting creative events, conventions, & more\nHobby Collector - Never afraid to teach herself a new skill to achieve a goal\n  Corey Smith is a country boy from Southern Illinois. He went to school for digital animation and spends most of his time working in the VFX industry. He lends some construction experience and power tool knowhow to the mix, having worked on two Habitat for Humanity projects, as well as building his parents' home in Southern Illinois. Whenever Tammy dreams up an idea, he provides a functioning 3D model of it. He also likes coffee, waffles, and pie.\nVFX stereo-conversion vet with credits like The Avengers & Star Trek Into Darkness\n3D generalist - Modeling, Texturing, Animating, & more\nVoice actor & general film production guy", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we are veteran artists, we don't claim to be product designers. One thing we've been lacking is solid input from experienced veterans regarding product design, manufacturing, package design, and shipping/storage methods.\n\nNone of that is going to stop us, of course. We've spent buckets and buckets of time doing research in any fields that we're lacking in. We feel like we've settled on an excellent design that's easy to reproduce, even if we have to build them in our garage. \n\nIt is conceivable (and likely) that we'll run into some sort of trouble along the way in one of these areas. However, six months ago, we'd never used a laser cutter before. Today, we have a slew of product templates designed for laser printing, and a pile of beautiful laser-cut desktops. This is the natural order of things for us, and we tend to find a way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Air Compressors and You!", "update_content": "The final surveys requesting your color preferences and current addresses have been sent, meaning great things are coming your way soon! :D\nThank you all so much for voting on the stains.

This film tells the story of Philip Johnson's New York State Pavilion during the glory days of the fair, and chronicles its demise over the past 50 years. The film details its post-fair use as a 60s concert venue and 70s roller rink, including the years of neglect and the recent growing advocacy efforts to save and repurpose the structure.\nPresent day- Photo by Marco Catini\nTo learn more about who took this \"Present Day\" picture, check out Update #3.\nMODERN RUIN: A World's Fair Pavilion documents what this iconic structure symbolized at the 1964-65 World\u2019s Fair, and preserves many of the fascinating stories that are woven into the fabric of the building\u2019s history. Few people remember that in 1969, some of the greatest musicians of the 20th century - The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Fleetwood Mac, Santana and many others - played in a summer concert series inside the Pavilion\u2019s Tent Of Tomorrow. \nCirca 1964\nBy the early 70's, it had already been neglected for almost a decade when a young couple from Cleveland came upon it and decided to turn the building into a roller skating rink.  By 1975, as the city spiraled into economic crisis, they were kicked out and Philip Johnson's pavilion was left virtually untouched for almost 40 years. \nMitch Silverstein & John Piro (The Painters of the Pavilion)\nIn 2009 a group of fair goers, led by John Piro and Mitch Silverstein, decided to take matters in their own hands by sprucing up the Pavilion with a fresh coat of paint.  This has helped to spark national interest in the New York State Pavilion, as well as a desire to develop an adaptive reuse for the structure. \nThe Vintage Robot T-Shirt\nPhil Buehler is a huge fan of modern ruins and the New York State Pavilion.

This includes acquiring music and archival footage/photographs, image licensing, audio mastering, and DVD replication and packaging.  \nSince February of 2013 I have conducted almost 2 dozen interviews with authors, historians, architects, architectural critics, fair goers, post-fair concert goers, the operators of the roller skating rink and many more interesting individuals. I have traveled across the country and criss-crossed the New York Metropolitan area documenting their experiences in an effort to preserve the rich story of this visible ruin.\nWorking on this film has been an incredible experience due largely to the overwhelming support I have received over the past year.  The film is truly the product of a community effort and the generosity of many who are passionate about learning more about this building and seeing it put back to good use.\nPeople have donated money, time, photos, home movies, and so much more to help this film become a success.\nAny amount you can contribute is greatly appreciated, and by backing this project, you are making a statement about how you feel about the historical and future importance of the New York State Pavilion.\nCheck out the rewards in the panel to the right, and consider becoming a backer of this project.

Why, you ask? Well, the pinhole camera breaks down complex photographic concepts into their basic foundation: Light. How much to let in, and for how long?\nHand-constructing a camera that can take real photographs, using the simplest method possible, transforms these abstract photographic concepts into hands-on understanding; giving both beginners, and veterans, a valuable tool for learning, exploring and creating their art.\nWhy create a pinhole camera from a shoebox or paint can that requires special photographic paper and a darkroom? With the Original Pin you can simply build a quality camera that takes standard 35mm film.\nEnough of that: What you get and how it works.\nThe Original Pin will arrive as a flat-pack kit of parts, that you will assemble. The \"basic\" kit of part includes: (1) set of camera body parts, (1) faceplate, (1)shutter, (1)lens housing and (1) lens kit; which consists of a square piece of recycled aluminum, a size 22 sewing needle, a piece of 400 grit sandpaper and instructions for making the pinhole and assembling the Original Pin.\nWE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!

This project has demanded extensive passion and I am overjoyed to be able to share it with the world.\nFrom the first moment of inception, over two years ago, I have labored to bring this idea to life. I feel truly grateful that I/we live in a time and place that allows an individual to dream, and do, what otherwise may have been impossible. The perfect nexus of affordable local prototyping (thanks, Metrix:CreateSpace, Seattle), manufacturing on demand, and crowd-funding, is truly a dream to behold.\nFor all of you dreamers, I say \"Aye.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe inherent risk is not being able to gauge the level of interest that may be shown in the Original Pin project. The biggest challenge would be an exponentially higher interest than I have anticipated. If that were to occur, I have contacted alternate producers that can help me deliver and distribute an overload of requests. As a result, I have identified a price point that will cover potential disruption.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Holy smokes.", "update_content": "Hey Original People!\nWow.

I wonder what the moment would have been like - the people, the food, the smells. As with a time machine, photographs allow us to see directly into the past to experience a moment in time.\nPhotographers like Carlton Watkins, Edward Muybridge, and Ansel Adams among others, used the camera as a vehicle to show their love of place. Each of them worked in large format to get the sharpest, finest prints available at the time. I have been using a 4x5\u201d film camera for over 25 years. Recently I have chosen to go back in time to an early photographic technology\u2014that of wet plate collodion. \nWhat is wet collodion?\nThe following video gives an overview of the wet collodion process.\nCollodion can be used on glass to make negatives or on tin to make tintypes.  I plan to make both as part of this project.\nThe Project\nMy project will involve making a small, but powerful, body of images of the Northern California Coast using 12x20\" glass negatives and wet collodion. From these mammoth negatives, I will print directly on to albumen silver paper, resulting in stunning prints. At 150 times the size of a 35mm negative, the resolution is unsurpassed, allowing the viewer to visually step in to the photograph. How spectacular to be able to continue the tradition started in 1851 by early photographers and share these unique images for many years to come.\nThe Plan\nClick to see project's regional scope.\nI plan to visit at least ten locations between Monterey and Mendocino, and make several images in each location.  I have the fortunate ability to take my darkroom with me, as I have converted a travel trailer to allow me to make images wherever my truck and trailer can take me.  I will update you on where I have been or plan to go, and may post some of the images from time to time.  The more funding the project gets, the more places I can go.  Once the campaign reaches $5,000, or the project book level sells out, I will publish a book of select images, which will be sent to those who have contributed at each level that identifies a project book as a reward in the description.  A tour of my darkroom and ability to make a tintype yourself is even offered as a reward.\nThe Reality\nMaking collodion negatives and albumen prints can be quite costly. Beyond the cost of equipment, chemistry is expensive and each sheet of glass or plexiglass for the negative and each sheet of paper for printing can cost more than developing an entire roll of 35 mm film.  From start to finish, a 12x20\" albumen print costs roughly $18. The negatives and prints are delicate and can break, scratch and spoil.  The chemistry, waste and time can add up quickly.  Contributions will be used to offset these photographic costs, as well as travel costs associated with the project.  The $5,000 campaign only begins to cover the expenses, so I encourage you to contribute at any level and spread the word!  Every bit counts, and is so very much appreciated.\nStretch Goals  \nWhile I have set my campaign at $5,000, I would love to raise at least double that amount.  With additional funds, I can expand the project by visiting more locations and producing more beautiful images.  I might even be able to buy additional lenses for my camera.  Rest assured that funds raised will go to pay for equipment, supplies, expenses and production of rewards.  If I reach $7,500 in funding, everyone who has contributed to the campaign at a reward level will get a 12x20\" digital print of an image of my choosing.  If I reach $10,000 in funding, everyone who has contributed to the campaign at a reward level will receive a signed 18x30\" digital print of an image of my choosing (as an upgrade to the $7,500 stretch goal rather than a second print).  For contributions on or after 2/7/2014, contributions must be at or above the $100 level to receive a print.\nJoin Me\nWith your help, this journey of presenting the Northern California Coast through an historical photographic process can become a reality.  If you are interested in the project but can't contribute, please share it on Facebook, Twitter, or email it to a friend.  I hope you will join me.\nThank you\nChris Honeysett", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges associated with this project are in making the negatives and photographs themselves \u2013 I don\u2019t foresee many issues with completing the project once it is funded. Making a negative plate is an extremely time-consuming process and can be quite costly. Each negative plate has to be coated, sensitized, and exposed within the 10-15 minutes that the collodion is wet, or else the collodion hardens and the negative becomes unusable. Collodion is not like conventional film-because of the process and time involved. Each plate is totally unique, which in my opinion is one of the things that makes this such a rewarding art form. It can take half a day to get one good plate. I am thankful to have a supportive family that will allow me the time necessary to produce a beautiful body of work. I have a lot of patience and determination, and with over 30 years of experience in photography, I am confident this project will yield strong imagery that many will be able to enjoy.\nShould fulfillment get delayed, I will make sure to stay in touch with my supporters and keep them abreast as to what is going on and why. I know from experience that a little information goes a long way to keeping clients happy.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 3, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/273224914/a-moment-in-time", "project_name": "A Moment In Time-California in 12x20\" Wet Collodion"}}]
