[{"backer": "Danielle Ackley-McPhail", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "CORVID-19: A RavenCon Anthology\n2020 has been a challenging year for all of us. No one expected the world to come to a grinding halt. No one expected stores to run out of toilet paper, or the Tiger King to be a thing on Netflix, but here we are.\nAfter planning, prepping, and purchasing all of the supplies for our 2020 event, the pandemic hit. Everything started shutting down. Conventions and all in-person events were cancelled.  RavenCon led the way, putting our guests' safety above all else, and we were one of the first to cancel\u20143 weeks before the convention. We had spent eleven months purchasing supplies for an event that wasn\u2019t going to happen. \nAs a fan-run convention, we pride ourselves in being there for emerging artists, writers, and vendors. We may be small, but our heart is mighty.\nWe know the community is vital to many of you. Conventions are a way to meet with your friends, to make new friends and new connections. To boldly go where you haven't been before, and to come together as a family. We don't want this to end, but 2020 was certainly bent on it. This is where we need your help.\nMichael Pederson had an idea (a lot of RavenCon stories start with this sentence, by the way).  Why not make something everyone can enjoy? We are all home much more often now; what's better than reading a good book? So, we reached out to our past guests, and began collecting our \"tribute\" to 2020: CORVID-19, an anthology. Yes, you read that right. CORVID-19. An anthology themed around the corvidae family of birds\u2014ravens, crows, bluejays, magpies, etc.\nOur generous and talented author friends have donated their stories, now we need your help to get this published. You can also support the convention so we can thrive for years to come. \nWe have something for everyone! You can choose to be a major or minor character in a book! Maybe you want to be a Red Shirt and get killed off? We have that too. Want stickers? We have that. Want help with the story you're writing? We got you! Mad for music? We hear you. Take a look at the list of pledge levels and for ways to help support us. \nWe couldn't run RavenCon without you. We thank you for everything you have helped us with over the last 15 years, and we don't want this pandemic to take that away. \nThank you for sharing our project, for supporting us, and we look forward to seeing you when we can be face to face again. \nWhat exactly are the nineteen corvid-filled stories in this 210-page volume of awesomeness? Just look at what we\u2019ve got\u2026\n\u201cWindows to the Soul\u201d by Danielle Ackley-McPhail\n\u201cRaven\u2019s Sacrifice\u201d by Heather Ewings\n\u201cThe Cruelest Team Will Win\u201d by Mike Allen\n\u201cJenny\u201d by Debbie Manber Kupfer\n\u201cDaughter of the Birds\u201d by Maya Preisler\n\u201cKvetina and the Crows\u201d by Rhys Schrock\n\u201cCorvus Monitus\u201d by Cass Morris\n\u201cIf the Moon is Real\u201d by Samantha Bryant\n\u201cLife in a Moment\u201d by James Maxey\n\u201cCrows\u2019 Feet\u201d by Diana Bastine\n\u201cA Warning of Crows\u201d by Jennifer R.

Once we reach our first stretch goal of $4000, everyone who is getting the book will get a digital copy of The Second Wave. \nMy feathers are a flutter just thinking about this! Or maybe that\u2019s just a bad hamberder.)\n\n*Update! Our second stretch goal of $4500 wil get everyone who supported us at the $10 or more level will also be getting a limited-edition bookmark and button made exclusively for this kickstarter! \nCORVID-19 Button\n*Update!

Last year, to honor those halcyon days, I conceived of Thrilling Adventure Yarns and invited a ton of friends, old and new, to join me in this celebration.\nI then turned to you, the discerning reader, for support. I was stunned and gratified to not only meet my objective but far, far exceed it. We earned 248% of the goal, which allowed me to bring our readers a number of attractive and exciting options I would not have been able to provide otherwise.\nWe had fun producing the book, and our reviews and personal comments were almost all laudatory. The common question was, \u201cWhen is the next book?\u201d The answer is February. \nThe second common question was, \"When is the next Thrilling Adventures Kickstarter?\"\nThe answer is: NOW!\nAs part of Crazy 8 Press\u2019 10th-anniversary celebration, we will release a second volume, once more packed with all genres of pulp goodness, with several returning authors along with new ones. Several characters from our first volume will be making second appearances here, including Cannon Belle! Other Crazy 8 characters will also be appearing here, including a tale from the Crimson Keep and Angela Hardwicke, private detective!\nJoining me on this journey will be C8\u2019s Aaron Rosenberg, Michael Jan Friedman, Glenn Hauman, Mary Fan, Paul Kupperberg, and Russ Colchamiro.\nReturning will be David Mack, Paige Daniels, Will Murray, and Karissa Laurel.\nNew to this volume will be William Leisner, Danielle Ackley McPhail, Dayton Ward & Kevin Dilmore, Greg Cox, Heather E. Hutsell, Kelli Fitzpatrick, Michael A. Burstein, Richard White, Scott Pearson, and Sherri Cook Woosley.\nAnother Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished detective tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign.\nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns\u2014in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable artist Gary Carbon. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur Goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $6000, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la Carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package\u2014to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up, and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page  $10.\nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.  $35.\nE-book package #1 $20.\nE-book package #2 $20.\nE-book package #3 $20.\nPackage #1 includes Lost Days by Michael Jan Friedman, Cats Triumphant by Jody Lynn Nye, The Wild Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Will Murray, Harbinger of Darkness by Richard C. White, and Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn by Day Al-Mohamed and Danielle Ackley-Mcphail.\nPackage #2 includes Transcendence and The Halfling's Court by Danielle Ackley McPhail, Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil, by Mary Fan, Altered States of the Union, edited by Glenn Hauman, In the Services of the Guild by Tina Closser, and \"Midnight Rider\" by David Mack.\nPackage #3 includes In My Shorts by Paul Kupperberg, Crackle and Fire by Russ Colchamiro, One Haunted Summer by Aaron Rosenberg, Eternal Wanderings by Danielle Ackley-McPhail, and \"Our Possible Pasts\" by David Mack\nFor $25 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course).\nStretch Goals!\nUNLOCKED! At $7000 we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns 2021 (see A La Carte menu above).\nUNLOCKED! At $7250, I will be able to include a story from Stuart Moore, an editor/writer with credits from St. Martin's Press, Vertigo Comics, Marvel Comics, and currently Ahoy! Comics. His previous prose works include collaborations with Stan Lee and several Marvel novels.\nAt $7500, I will be able to include a story from veteran comics writer Ron Marz, whose credits span from Witchblade to Green Lantern, from DC vs. Marvel to Batman/Aliens. His work speaks for itself and here he'll be making a rare prose appearance.\nAt $7750, I will be able to include a story from Jody Lynn Nye, the prolific author of over 40 books and more than 120 short stories, spanning genres. \n$8000, I will be able to include a story from the possibly even more prolific Jonathan Maberry, he of V-Wars and Joe Ledger fame. The multiple Bram Stoker Award-winning author continues to write and edit across genres.\nAt $8500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors. (See Risks and Challenges for options.)\nAt $9000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper.\nAt $10,000, it will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. Last time, we had work from Mark Wheatley, Peter Krause, Jerry Ordway, Karl Kesel, and Tom Mandrake. We're already lining up several new names should we reach this level!\nAt $10,500 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs. (See Risks and Challenges for options.).\nAt $12,000 we will have a Kickstarter-exclusive cover from Richard Pace, who has illustrated for Vertigo and Marvel and has also co-written Dale Keown\u2019s Pitt and Batman: The Doom That Came to Gotham and is the co-creator, with Mark Russell, of the hit indie AHOY Comics series Second Coming. Only backers will receive this exclusive edition in softcover and/or hardcover.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops.

Butler & Joshua Palmatier (WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE).\nTHE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY:\nIn this follow-up to THE MODERN FAE'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY, we switch our attention to how the deities of old have managed to fit themselves into today's modern world! Is Narcissus an Instagram influencer? Is Coyote playing the stock market? Does Ra own a solar panel company? Was Dr. Ruth really Venus? How have the gods and goddesses managed to survive alongside cell phones and computers and social media influencers? We invite authors to explore how the immortals have changed with the times.\nEdited by Patricia Bray & Joshua Palmatier, THE MODERN DEITY'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING HUMANITY will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors (and the gods they may use) include:\nAlma Alexander (Freyja: Nordic),\nDavid Farland (Woden/Odin: German),\nTanya Huff (Hera: Greek),\nJuliet E. McKenna (Nemesis/Themis: Greek),\nPhyllis Irene Radford (Anshar/Tiamet: Babylonian),\nLaura Resnick (assorted),\nKari Sperring (Cigfa, Goewin, Gwydion: Welsh),\nJean Marie Ward (Dionysus: Greek), and\nEdward Willett (Ninkasi: Sumerian)\nDERELICT:\nNo one can resist the mystery of the abandoned ship--whether it's the ghost ship found afloat at sea in the Bermuda Triangle or the spaceship drifting in the depths of space a la the movie Alien. What happened to the crew? What horror forced them to abandon their vessel and flee\u2026or are they still on board, trapped or even all dead? In this anthology, we want authors to explore all of the possibilities when one runs across\u2026a DERELICT.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, DERELICT will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford,\nAlex Bledsoe,\nGerald Brandt,\nJulie E. Czerneda,\nKate Elliott,\nJohn G. Hemry/Jack Campbell,\nD.B. Jackson,\nGini Koch,\nSharon Lee & Steve Miller, and\nKristine Smith\nWHEN WORLDS COLLIDE:\nThroughout history, different cultures have collided in different ways, whether it be the peaceful contact between Rome and Han China in the second century that established the Silk Road, or the more violent interactions between Europe and the Americas thirteen hundred years later. Such first contact stories have long been a staple of speculative fiction. The stories featured in WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will continue this long tradition as the authors explore the myriad ways in which two cultures\u2014alien or fae, machine or human\u2014can clash. Will the colliding societies manage to peacefully coexist after they finally meet? Or will they embark instead on a path of mutual self-destruction? Find out\u2014WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE.\nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nS.C. Butler,\nEsther Friesner,\nAuston Habershaw,\nSteven Harper,\nNancy Holzner,\nHoward Andrew Jones,\nStephen Leigh,\nViolette Malan, and\nAlan Smale\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition!\nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors.

The cover art for \u201cThe Modern Deity's Guide to Surviving Humanity\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"The Modern Deity's Guide to Surviving Humanity\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nThe following is a Reward Level Rundown for most of the rewards where the backer will get all three of the three anthologies in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback format. There are a few reward levels not listed, such as those where the backer gets only one or two of the anthologies in either format, as well as a few special reward levels where the backer will get ALL of the currently-available backlist from Zombies Need Brains in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback--those three levels are ZNB Ebook Zombie, ZNB Kickstarter Zombie, and ZNB Ebook Kickstarter Zombie.\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2020.

Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2021. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

I hope this gets you excited for what's coming next and that I'll see you all as backers when the time comes!

I'll be working on the cover art in the meantime, so that hopefully we'll be able to hand the anthologies off to the printer sometime in April. Finger crossed we get them back by June. Once I hand them over, it's more or less out of our hands and up to the printer's schedule."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "COVER ART!!!!", "update_content": "So I've got cover art to reveal for the WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE and DERELICT anthologies!

You can get prints of the art at the Zombies Need Brains online store for $10 each, wallpapers are also available at $2 each (3 sizes), and of course you can preorder the Kickstarter edition and the ebooks for any of the three new anthologies as well.\n\nWe've narrowed the slush stories down and picked what we want to fill out the anthologies as well.

You have one week to download them before the link expires! So download them NOW, rather than later.

Remember, the three new anthologies won't go out until summer next year, so these surveys are more for those that got add-ons or special rewards that need to be shipped now rather than later (for holiday gifts or whatever).

They send out a couple messages, but if you haven't fixed the problem by a certain date, your pledge gets dropped.\nAlso wanted to remind everyone that if you included some extra money in your pledge for an add-on, you should send me a message NOW about what those add-ons were. Experience tells me that by the time all the money changes hands and I get around to sending out the surveys, most people have forgotten exactly what they'd planned on getting with that extra money.

This book has been long delayed due to health concerns and issues with the past publisher of the series. After long last, and thanks to the help of author Keith R.A. DeCandido, we bring you the final installment of this hard-core military science fiction novel where humanity fights for its very existence. (For those new to the series, books 1 and 2, ISSUE IN DOUBT and IN ALL DIRECTIONS, are available through the add-on section or via specific pledge reward levels.)\nIn addition, we also present a brand-new series by veteran Star-Trek author Christopher L. Bennett. ARACHNE'S CRIME--the first book in a planned duology set in in a universe of the author's original creation--sets out to explore deep space and ends up in a harrowing encounter with new races, in a twisted tale of blame and redemption where responsibility and motives are not as clear as they may seem.\nWon't you help us make these books a reality?\nThe primary goal for this campaign will fund the production of both books and the fulfillment of pledge rewards. The authors receive an equal share of 50% of the profits raised thereafter, with 50% invested in the press to meet promotional and operational needs.\nIf science fiction isn't your thing, you can still help support us. You can choose the IMPARTIAL OBSERVER reward level and pledge a sufficient amount to claim the book or books you would like from our Add-Ons section below.

He has written about US Marines in Vietnam (the Night Fighters series and three other novels), and the DemonTechseries about Marines in a fantasy world. The 18th Race trilogy is military science fiction.\nOther than military, he wrote a non-conventional vampire novel, The Hunt, and a mystery, Dead Man's Chest. He has also released a collection of short fiction and non-fiction from early in his writing career, Sherman's Shorts; the Beginnings.\nWith Dan Cragg he wrote the popular Starfist series and its spin-off series, Starfist: Force Recon\u2014all about Marines in the Twenty-fifth Century.; and a Star Wars novel, Jedi Trial. His books have been translated into Czech, Polish, German, and Japanese.\nAfter going to war as a U.S. Marine infantryman, and spending decades writing about young men at war, he's burnt out on the subject and has finally come home. Today he's writing short fiction, mostly steampunk, and farcical fantastic Westerns.\nHe lives in sunny South Florida, where he doesn't have to worry about hypothermia or snow-shoveling-induced heart attacks. He invites readers to visit his website, novelier.com.\nKeith R.A. DeCandido is a writer and editor of more than three decades' standing (though he usually does them sitting down). He is the author of more than 50 novels, more than 100 short stories, around 75 comic books, and more nonfiction than he is really willing to count. Included in those credits is fiction in the worlds of Star Trek, Alien, Farscape, Doctor Who, Andromeda, BattleTech, and many other science fiction milieus, as well as in universes of his own creation (such as the \"Precinct\" series of fantasy police procedurals, also published by the fine folks at eSpec).As an editor, he has worked with dozens of authors, among them Mike W. Barr, Alfred Bester, Margaret Wander Bonanno, Adam-Troy Castro, Peter David, Diane Duane, Harlan Ellison, Tony Isabella, Stan Lee, Tanith Lee, David Mack, David Michelinie, Andre Norton, Robert Silverberg, Dean Wesley Smith, S.P. Somtow, Harry Turtledove, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and Roger Zelazny. Having edited David Sherman's first two 18th Race books, Issue in Doubt and In All Directions, he is honored to assist him in finishing the trilogy by coauthoring To Hell and Regroup with him. Keith is also a martial artist (he got his third-degree black belt in karate in 2017), a musician (currently with the parody band Boogie Knights), and a baseball fan (having avidly followed the New York Yankees since 1976). Find out less about Keith as his cheerfully retro web site at DeCandido.net.\nChristopher L. Bennett is a lifelong resident of Cincinnati, Ohio, with a B.S. in Physics and a B.A. in History from the University of Cincinnati. A fan of science and science fiction since age five, he has spent the past two decades selling original short fiction to magazines such as Analog Science Fiction and Fact (home of his \"Hub\" series of comedy adventures), BuzzyMag, and Galaxy's Edge. Since 2003, he has been one of Pocket Books' most prolific and popular authors of Star Trek tie-in fiction, including the epic Next Generation prequel The Buried Age, the Enterprise -- Rise of the Federation series, and the Original Series prequel The Captain's Oath. He has also written two Marvel Comics novels, X-Men: Watchers on the Walls and Spider-Man: Drowned in Thunder. His original novel Only Superhuman, perhaps the first hard science fiction superhero novel, was voted Library Journal's SF/Fantasy Debut of the Month for October 2012. He has three collections reprinting his original short fiction, Among the Wild Cybers: Tales Beyond the Superhuman from eSpec Books (containing an original Only Superhuman prequel novelette) and Hub Space: Tales from the Greater Galaxy and Crimes of the Hub from Mystique Press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of the books proposed in this campaign have already begun production.

She loves stories about brave princesses and spends a lot of time with her imaginary friend, Waldo. But one day her friend goes missing, and no one will believe her or take her growing concern seriously. Marymae can feel something is not right, and so decides she must go find him. But there\u2019s something odd happening in the Forest of Make-Believe; those that were noble are now hiding away, inky shadows snake through the trees, and a growing darkness threatens to engulf even the bravest heart.\nThis illustrated novelette is filled with colorful characters, whimsical and crazy situations, and a powerful theme of having hope - even when surrounded by despair. Marymae has the sweetness and straightforwardness that only a child could have - which makes for many touching and hilarious moments as she finds herself gallivanting through the ever darkening Make-Believe Forest. Enjoy the journey with her as she discovers how to be a light to inspire courage in those around her, and how to love even the most broken heart.\nIt's a book that will uplift and inspire you with touching moments, while it makes you laugh at the absurdities of little girls and pirates wielding chainsaws!\nWho will love Marymae and the Nightmare Man?\nAnyone who enjoys a good story!\nWhen writing Marymae, I wanted to capture that feeling of imagination and simplicity of childhood. Something that as adults we can get lost in, and enjoy the flow of the dramatic and the silly, to join the characters on their journey as they spring from one thing to the next. A refreshing light to illuminate the mundane every day.\nChildren and Parents!\nReading to your children has endless benefits:\nIt builds listening skills and imagination.\nReading comprehension.\nMakes reading fun and something they\u2019ll want to do.\nA wonderful time to bound.\nSo many wonderful things! Even if your child can already read, don\u2019t be afraid to read them books above their level. Good stories are meant to be shared, and there\u2019s no age restriction on a good story!\n\nWhat will the book look like?\nThe story runs about 11,500 words, will have a minimum of 10 illustrations, and be approximately 50 pages. It will be printed in 6x9, making it easy to store on your bookshelf.\nOne of the goals of this campaign is to provide the funding to commission more amazing art, which will increase the illustration and page count. See more details below.\n\nThe Stretch Goals:\nStretch Goal #1 $3,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 18 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS 1 bonus Art Print added to all Physical Perk tiers!\nStretch Goal #2 $5,200 - +7 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 25 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS every backer will receive a digital file with the concept art and character designs of: Marymae, Waldo, the Noble Pirates, and the Nightmare Man.\nStretch Goal #3: $6,600 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 33 pieces of art to enjoy! PLUS all books will be upgraded and printed on Premium Paper\nStretch Goal #4 $7,900 - +8 new illustrations will be added to the book - making a total of 41 pieces of art to enjoy!

When you look at stories\u2014and the way we talk about stories\u2014there\u2019s this sense that when a woman becomes a mother, she ceases to be the heroine. Instead, she\u2019s relegated to a supporting role for her children, who are now meant to be the center of her life and the only reason for her existence. There are exceptions, as there are in everything, but overall, we\u2019re left with the impression that once a woman becomes Mom, her tale ends. Mother figures also rarely figure into fiction the way father figures do. It\u2019s not often that the wise or experienced elder sought out by a young protagonist is a woman.\nHere\u2019s the thing, though: A heroine doesn\u2019t stop being a heroine because a kid came into her life.\nSo I'm putting together this anthology to turn the spotlight on bad ass moms. This is inspired in part, of course, by my own bad ass mom, who emigrated from China to the U.S. fresh out of school, got her PhD in statistics, and named me after her personal heroine and another bad ass mom, Marie Curie (Mary and Marie are the same name in Chinese).\nSince moms and badassery come in infinite forms, I gave the contributing authors only one criterion: that their story be about a bad ass mother or mother figure. We\u2019ve got moms across the age and experience spectrum, from grandmas to new moms. We've got warrior moms and moms who are bad ass in a quieter way. We\u2019ve got biological moms, adoptive moms, and mom figures. A mom who runs a space colony, a hard-boiled detective mom, a witch mom, a coach who\u2019s a mom figure to her students\u2026 and much, much more.\nTo bring these stories to life, I've partnered with the Crazy 8 Press crew: Russ Colchamiro, Peter David, Michael Jan Friedman, Robert Greenberger, Glenn Hauman, Paul Kupperberg, and Aaron Rosenberg. \nI've also assembled a fantastic line-up of additional authors (some of whom are bad ass moms themselves!): Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Derek Tyler Attico, T. Eric Bakutis,  Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Heather E. Hutsell, Kris Katzen, Karissa Laurel, Khaalidah Muhammad-Ali, TJ Perkins, Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg, Joanna Schnurman, Hildy Silverman, and Denise Sutton.\nAnd who am I? Hi, I'm Mary Fan, author of sci-fi/fantasy books about intrepid heroines, including Stronger Than a Bronze Dragon, Artificial Absolutes, and Starswept. Publishers Weekly, School Library Journal, Booklist, and Kirkus liked my books, so I guess I get to call myself \"critically acclaimed.\" I'm also the co-editor of the Brave New Girls anthology series about girls in STEM.\nOur awesome cover art is the work of Sean \"MunkyWrench\" Eddingfield (background art) and Streetlight Graphics (design and layout).\nThis a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package. Just take any existing package of $35 and up and add the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list.

If we reach this goal, every backer receiving a physical reward will get a BAD ASS MOMS bookmark and fridge magnet! We will add the following BAD ASS MOMS swag options to the rewards: mini poster of the cover, enamel pin, t-shirt, tote bag.

My back-up plans have back-up plans.\n\nI'm also very familiar with marketing and giveaways. Brave New Girls was the product of a crowd-funding campaign (meant for a single anthology, but we out-raised our goal and found a publishing model that meant we could publish several more).

This marks my 17th published novel and my 7th crowdfunding campaign. I'm thrilled that two books in the series have made the New York Times Bestsellers list, three of the books became USA Today bestsellers, and three have made it onto the Washington Post Hardcover bestseller list on multiple occasions. This campaign has become the third most-backed and fourth most-funded fiction Kickstarter of all time.\nWell, we are down to our last one hour of the Kickstarter, and Robin and I wanted to say . . .\nto all backers old and new.  Your support of our work is truly amazing and we appreciate the faith you have put into the series and us in making this our best Kickstarter yet.  \nAnd for anyone who might have missed this Kickstarter, we have your back!  You'll be able to join the fun through the manual add process of Kickstarter. Just use this link and we'll get you added.\nAnd keep your eyes open for updates from Kickstarter and emails from BackerKit as we start rolling out the rewards!  We'll keep you in the loop!\nWhat is the book about? Here's the marketing copy from the back cover:\nA DOOR OPENS. AN ARMY OF DRAGONS ADVANCE. AND THE FATE OF THE LIVING RESTS WITH THE DEAD.\nAfter obtaining the secret to creating dragons, the leader of the Fhrey has turned the tide of war once more--but gaining the advantage has come at a terrible price. While Imaly plots to overthrow the fane for transgressions against his people, a mystic and a keeper are the only hope for the Rhunes. Time is short, and the future of both races hangs in the balance. In this exciting conclusion to the Legends of the First Empire series, the Great War finally comes to a climactic end, and with it dawns a new era in the Age of Empyre.\nFor returning readers, recaps are available so you can be reminded about what has happened so far. \nWant to check out my writing style? Well, it's a bit tricky because this book opens in the middle of the story, and I didn't want to expose people to spoilers. So to help mitigate that, I took the sample chapter and redacted the names by doing substitutions. I should note that this sample hasn't yet gone through copyediting, but it should be in relatively good shape.  Another spoiler-free option would be to read from the start of the series, so I included a sample chapter to Age of Myth (the first book of the series) as well.\nAge of Myth Sample Chapter\nAge of Empyre redacted Sample Chapter\nThis project mirrors my other Kickstarters, but for new people, I'm summarizing some important aspects of what you'll receive.\nAll physical books come signed: a perk for ordering the books directly from me.\nAll ebooks are DRM-free, which means you can load them on any device: computer, smartphone, and tablet without any locking feature preventing you from moving it from place to place.\nFor backing this project, your name will be printed in the Acknowledgment Section so everyone will know that you are an awesome supporter of the project (you can, of course, opt-out if you choose)\nThe official release through the retail channels is May 5, 2020, but all levels with ebooks will receive the story in March.\nFor the levels that provide a physical book, we've bundled the ebook to ensure early access to the story. If you don't want to pay for the ebook (for instance you only want a physical copy), there will be a process for you to pre-order just the hardcover after the Kickstarter is over.\nAnyone receiving the physical book will also receive a matching signed bookmark. If you choose a reward level with multiple books, each of them will also have a matching bookmark.\nIf you are missing one or more of the previous ebooks, you can purchase some of them here (use DIGITAL DOUBLE TROUBLE, DIGITAL THREE BOOK NIGHT, or the \"add-on\" feature) to get copies of Age of Legend, Age of Death, or extra copies of Age of Empyre for a friend. Unfortunately, we can't make the other ebooks available (Age of Myth, Age of Swords, and Age of War) because the rights are owned by Penguin Random House, and only they can sell copies of those titles. So, you'll have to buy books #1 through #3 from your favorite ebook retailer.\nIf you are missing one or more of the prior hardcovers, this Kickstarter is the best way to get them. Not only will they be signed, but they are sold at a discount ($25 rather than $27 or $28). Also, we have significantly discounted the shipping costs for people located outside the US, and future purchases won't have the \"bulk shipping\" advantage that a Kickstarter provides.\nThe Legends of the First Empire series is a six-book epic fantasy, and the first three books have been released by Del Rey (a fantasy imprint of Penguin Random House) from 2016 - 2018. The remaining three titles have been self-published and released on an accelerated schedule (3 books in a 10-month span: Age of Legend - Jul 2019 | Age of Death - Feb 2020 | Age of Empyre - May 2020).  \nLike my best-selling Riyria novels, these books are also set in the fictional world of Elan, but the events occur 3,000 years in the past. It IS NOT necessary to know anything about the other stories, but for those who do read both, you'll learn the truth about a number of lies regarding various historical figures. \nAt the time of this Kickstarter launch, Age of Death hasn't officially \"hit the street,\" but here is some data regarding how readers have rated the books in the series on Amazon, Goodreads, and Audible.com.  I'm proud that only 2.2% have had poor ratings (1- and 2-star) and the vast majority (nearly 90%) have garnered 4- and 5-stars.\nIn case you are not familiar with the other books in the series, here is a bit about each.\nAge of Myth:  Since time immemorial, humans have worshipped the gods they call Fhrey, truly a race apart: invincible in battle, masters of magic, and seemingly immortal. But when a god falls to a human blade, the balance of power between men and those they thought were gods changes forever. Now, only a few stand between humankind and annihilation: Raithe, reluctant to embrace his destiny as the God Killer, Suri, a young seer burdened by signs of impending doom, and Persephone, who must overcome personal tragedy to lead her people. The Age of Myth is over; the time of rebellion has begun.\nAge of Swords:  Raithe, the God Killer, may have started the rebellion by killing a Fhrey, but long-standing enmities dividing the Rhune make it all but impossible to unite against a common foe. And even if the clans can join forces, how will they defeat an enemy whose magical prowess makes the Fhrey indistinguishable from gods? The answer lies in a faraway land populated by a reclusive and dour race. With time running out, Persephone leads a small band of misfits in a desperate search for aid, a quest that will take them into the darkest depths of Elan. There, an ancient adversary waits\u2014an enemy as surprising as it is deadly.\nAge of War:  The alliance of humans and renegade Fhrey is fragile\u2014and about to be tested as never before. Persephone keeps the human clans from turning on one another through her iron will and a compassionate heart while Nyphron, seeks to advance his own nefarious agenda. Old loyalties will be challenged while fresh conspiracies will threaten to undo all that Persephone has accomplished. In the darkest hour, when hope is all but lost, new heroes will rise . . . but at what terrible cost?\nAge of Legend: After years of warfare, humanity has gained the upper hand and has pushed the Fhrey to the edge of their homeland\u2014but no farther. Now comes the pivotal moment. Persephone\u2019s plan to use the stalemate to seek peace is destroyed by an unexpected betrayal that threatens to hand victory to the Fhrey and leaves a dear friend in peril. Humanity\u2019s only hope lies in the legend of a witch, a forgotten song, and a simple garden door.\nAge of Death: Winter blankets the land, and more than hope has died. Barred by the tower of Avempartha, the western army cannot invade the Fhrey homeland. So it must seek a way across the Nidwalden River before the fane obtains the secret of dragons. As time runs out for both humanity and the mystic Suri, the only chance for the living rests with the dead. Having made their fateful choice, can a handful of misfits do the impossible, or are they forever lost to an inescapable grave? As in Virgil's Aeneid, Dante's Divine Comedy, and Milton's Paradise Lost, the most epic tales transcend the world of the living. It's time to see what lies in Elan's Age of Death. \nOkay, so we've learned a bit about the book and the series, but what about me? Well, my name is Michael J. Sullivan, and I\u2019m a full-time novelist. To type those words is kind of surreal, as writing isn't a career that most can make a living at. I'm eternally grateful to all my readers who make it feasible to live a dream I never thought would be possible.\nLike many (too many), my road to authorship wasn't an easy one. I wrote in a variety of genres from 1979 to 1994, and after thirteen novels and more than a hundred rejections, I quit after vowing never to write creatively again. Well, never turned out to be a bit more than a decade, as I couldn't suppress the itch to write any longer. Over those years, a story had been growing in my head, and I decided to write it but with a condition: I wouldn't seek publication. I hoped that a few friends and my dyslexic daughter (who had always struggled with reading) would take a look, and that would be good enough for me.\nAfter reading the books, my wife made it her mission to make sure they saw the light of day. She willed them into existence, first with a small-press (who was well-intentioned but ultimately provided us no income nor any substantial readership), later through self-publishing (which worked much better), and eventually, she attracted the interest of Orbit (the fantasy imprint of a big-five publisher, Hachette Book Group). The rest, as they say, is history.\nIn the publishing business, I'm what's referred to as a \"hybrid\" because I've released books through traditional publishers as well as utilizing self-publishing.  If you want to learn why I do that, you can look at the Why Self-Publish section below.\nAll told, I've written 32 novels: 13 are sitting in a trunk never to see the light of day, 12 are released by a traditional publisher, 11 are currently or previously self-published,  1 is releasing soon, and 2 more are written (these are books in my next series, The Rise and the Fall). \nSome of my publishing accomplishments include:\nNew York Times Bestselling Author (twice)\nUSA Today Bestselling Author (3 times)\n3 books with multiple appearances on the Washington Post Hardcover Bestseller list\n2M+ English language books sold\n90+ foreign language contracts in 14 languages\n2,200+ days (6.0+ years) on the Amazon Top 100 Fantasy Author list\n8-time Goodreads Choice Award Nominee\n4 Earphone Award Wins and one Audie Award Nomination\nOne of the Top 50 most-followed authors on Goodreads\nNamed by io9 as one of the most successful self-published science fiction and fantasy authors\nNamed to more than 260 best-of or most-anticipated lists including those compiled by Library Journal, Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Audible, and Goodreads.  \nThis handy chart provides a quick and easy way to determine what you receive at the various reward levels.  \nAs you can see, we offer a wide range of pledge levels from the low-level $5 to the comprehensive \"All In\" ($25 per book + $10 for ebook) which provides all six novels of the series as well as early access to the story via the ebook. For the multi-book levels, you'll be able to select which titles you desire for each book and you can even use it to buy multiple copies of the Age of Empyre book.\nBecause we will be using BackerKit to fulfill the project, this allows backers to customize their pledge to get exactly the items they are interested in. To receive these \"Add-ons\" you should do the following:\nSelect the reward level that covers the largest number of items you want to receive.\nSelect the \"Add-ons\" from the table below and note the cost of each.\nIncrease your pledge amount to include your pledge level plus the costs of the desired add-ons.\nWhen the Kickstarter is over you'll be able to \"distribute\" that excess money to the various desired add-ons.\nBelow is the list of add-ons available:\n\nIn addition, we'll also continue Robin's Tip Jar (as it was missed in recent Kickstarters, and people appreciated its return in the last Kickstarter. Some notes about a few of the add-ons.\nMontemorcey Bag - for the last Kickstarter, we offered this in black but the supplier has had problems keeping that color in stock. So, this time around we switched to a \"natural\" color with green handles (which we have never seen go out of stock). All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\nSullifan Bag - One of the stretch goals was an alternate bag design and we decided to make a heraldic crest for \"Sullifans\" The design is a work in progress, but I wanted to show you the direction we are going. This crest features items from both series (the Tower of Avempartha and a Gilarabrwn. Then also images specific to Legends (Magda) and Riyria (Hadrian's swords, and Royce and Hadrian riding into Medford). Like the other tote bag, this will also be a \"natural\" color with green handles. All other aspects of the bag will be the same. The size is 12\" x 13\" x 5\".\n We suspect that many of the backers of this Kickstarter also backed the last one (and as such you already have a set of 5 bookmarks). So as to not kill a bunch of trees, and double up EVERYONE who buys a book on this Kickstarter) we are ONLY   adding the new bookmark (Age of Empyre) to the single book orders (multiple-book orders will have a bookmark that matches each book).  But if you missed getting the \"5-set bookmarks\" you can order a complete set separately. NOTE: Only the Age of Empyre bookmark will be signed.\nHere are some examples to help you figure out how to calculate various orders with \"Add-ons\" included. \nYou missed the Age of Death Kickstarter, so now want to get ebooks and hardcovers for both it and Age of Empyre.  You should choose the pledge level \"DOUBLE TROUBLE\" ($60) and add $10 (total of $70 + shipping) to get the Age of Death ebook.\nYou generally read ebooks but you like the design of the bookmarks and would like to get a set. Plus you also want the tote bag. If you are in Canada you would choose to make your pledge $10 (digital delight), $5 for the bookmarks, and $40 for the bag. That's a total of $55. If you also wanted the hardcover you would pledge $35 (Hardcore), $5 for the bookmarks, and $30 for the bag. That's a total of $70.\nYou live in the US, read ebooks, and you would like to get the tote bag. You would pledge $35 ($10 for the DIGITAL DELIGHT level) + $25 for the tote bag. \nSTRETCH GOAL #1 - $100,000 - short story bundle (12 tales) (UNLOCKED) - So, I did a little analysis from one Kickstarter to another and discovered there was 29% carryover from HW to DoD, 32% from DoD to DoWD, 28% fro DoWD to AOL, and 39% from AoL to AoD. That means there is a good number of backers who haven't received various short stories. So I'm going to make the first goal a HUGE set every short I've written so far. Including: \n Riyria: The Thieves, The Viscount and the Witch, The Jester, Professional Integrity, The Ashmoore Affair\n Legends: Little Wren and the Big Forest, Pile of Bones\n Tales from Elan: Traditions\n Unrelated Shorts: The Game, Burning Alexandria, Autumn Mists\n Comic book Short: The Jester\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $119,338 or 3,103 backers  - the untold story (UNLOCKED)-  With the entire tale told, it's possible to talk about the series without fear of spoilers if we meet this level, Michael and Robin will produce a free ebook which will peel back some of the hidden gems of the Legends of the First Empire and delve into the decision making progress regarding how the story was told, and even discuss the road to publishing. Why such an odd reward level? Well those are the number needed to move this project from 7th to 6th (in most-funded) and from 4th to 3rd (in most-backed)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $125,000 -  A second tote-bag design (UNLOCKED). If we reach this stretch goal we'll have Cory Freeman (the man that designed the Montemorcey label), design up a new image related to the world of Elan. When buying a tote bag you'll be able to decide which image you want. Or you can add it to your order and receive two different bags.\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - $155,367 -  Free Anthology: Heroes Wanted. Best Anthology winner on reddit /r/fantasy for 2019. 19 short stories by some of the best new voices in fantasy. Each is centered around heroes of all shapes and sizes, including a Royce and Hadrian short story (which is already included in Stretch Goal #1.\n Unfortunately, I'm not able to offer the audiobook as part of the Kickstarter (it's under license to Audible Studios, and only they can distribute it), but that doesn't mean you can't join the fun. You can back at either the SOUND ADVICE level (no ebook) or the DIGITAL DELIGHT level (includes ebook), and you'll still get exclusive bonus perks that only backers of the Kickstarter will receive. Oh, and the audiobook will be available on release day, so be sure to pre-order the audiobook now to receive it on May 5th.  \nWe have no desire to make a profit shipping the books, so we have priced our shipping fees at cost. That said, all the fees do add up. Here are some of the things the shipping costs cover: postage, insurance, packing material, fulfillment company picking and packing fees, and shipping the books to the fulfillment company.  Shipping is automatically added to your pledge and is based on your country. We've deeply discounted foreign postage rates so that the shipping for a single book is $7 - $9 regardless of your location.\nUS: $7 - $14\nCanada: $8 - $15\nMost foreign countries: $9 - $16\nNote: Some foreign countries have higher shipping, but we have applied discounts to keep this expensive as low as possible. \nNormally when buying directly from us, we ship via the USPS, and this is very expensive. But doing a Kickstarter allows us to consolidate a number of orders, send one large shipment, and utilize fulfillment partners in various overseas markets (like Canada and Europe). Shipping locally means that backers will not have to pay VAT, customs, or import fees (we'll absorb those costs), and it also helps to keep the overseas shipping costs down. Even with all those efforts, postage can drive up the cost to non-us backers, so we're taking some of our profits and using it to drive down the shipping costs further. Here are the discounts we have applied:\n1 book: $7 - $13\n2 books: $5 - $18\n3 books: $5 - $25\n4 books: $5 - $28\n5 books: $5 - $28\n6 books: $5 - $30\nIf you are outside the US and want to get hardcover copies, there will never be a better time than now.\n If you've read or listened to any of my books in the past, many of these names will be familiar to you as I've developed a finely tuned team that has been with me for years. It includes:\n Marc Simonetti (cover artist) - Marc has created 15 covers for my books (for both the US and foreign translations) and also has illustrated covers for some of the biggest names in the business including George R.R. Martin, Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, Terry Pratchett, and dozens more.\n Tim Gerard Reynolds (audiobook narrator) - Tim has recorded 14 novels of mine, and he's also narrated books by Pierce Brown, Mark Lawrence, Larry Correia, Edward W. Robertson, Jonathan Renshaw, and Gail Z. Martin. He's won multiple Earphone Awards and has been nominated for several Audies.\n Laura Jorstad (copy editor) - works for multiple fantasy publishers (Del Rey, Ballantine Books, St. Martins, and Sterling Publishing just to name a few). She's edited books by David Gemmel, Naomi Novik, a number of the books in the Star Wars franchise, two New York Times Bestsellers from Steve Berry, and eight of my novels.\n Linda Branam (copy editor) - has been editing for 20+ years and has a passion for fiction. This is my seventh project with her.\n Shawn Speakman (publisher/distributor) - Shawn started up Grim Oak Press to help pay medical bills after beating cancer a second time. Generally, he's produced anthologies and premium hardcovers, and Age of Empyre will be the third time he's releasing a trade publication. Some of the authors Shawn has worked with include: Terry Brooks, Brandon Sanderson, Raymond E. Feist, Pierce Brown, Naomi Novik, Jacquelin Carey, Jim Butcher, Stephen R. Donaldson, Mark Lawrence, Janny Wurtz, Peter Orullian, and Barbara Hambly.\n BoxInBoxOut - is an order fulfillment company based in Madison Virginia. They've been shipping books ordered from our website for more than a year, and they expertly handled the shipping for our last Kickstarter Age of Legend. I've found them to be professional, conscientious, and hardworking. They've shipped more than 9,500 books for us and they make running a Kickstarter so much easier than when we used to do all the shipping ourselves.\nAs I mentioned, this will be my 7th crowdfunding campaign, and I'm proud to say they have all been a huge success. In fact, several of them rank on the top of the charts both in the number of backers and the funds raised.\nRanked #3, #4, #5, #7, and #9 of the most-backed fiction projects of all time.\nRanked #4, #5, #7, #9, and #13 when looking at the most-funded fiction projects. \nIf you want to check out what people have said about the past projects and explore our track record for delivery and service,  you can see them at the following links.\nAge of Death\nAge of Legend\n Age of Swords (Indiegogo)\nThe Disappearance of Winter's Daughter\nThe Death of Dulgath\nHollow World\nI think it's important that backers know where their hard-earned cash is going. The price of each component is shown below.\nWe set the goal of the Kickstarter at about half that amount, so if we end up \"just squeaking by, the costs of the hardcover will be split between the supporters and us. If past performance is any indication we should be able to clear that bar easily. \nSince 2011, most of my books have been traditionally published, and so you may be wondering why I'm self-publishing this title. There are a few reasons. The first has to do with audio rights. When we signed the original contract for the first three books in the Legends of the First Empire series, the rights included just ebook and print, which was good because the audiobook rights for the entire series had already been sold. When it came time to negotiate for the last three books, a change in corporate policy from Penguin Random House required audiobook rights as well, so for this reason, it became impossible for us to publish those books with Del Rey.\nBut aside from that, we've been self-publishing since 2009, and it's an approach we really enjoy. Age of Empyre will be my 12th indie novel (I released 6 books from 2009 - 2012 and another 6 from 2014 - 2020). Having done both self and traditional, I find producing the book myself is (a) easier (b) creates a better product (c) is more profitable and (d) offers me greater freedom. With all those advantages, it's little wonder why I'm going to be self-publishing all my titles from now on.\nNow, for all the good things about self-publishing, there are some downsides as well. First, it's the publisher that pays all the out-of-pocket expenses. Hopefully, the Kickstarter will help on that front. Second, traditionally-published advances ensure a certain amount of guaranteed income to the author.  With self-publishing, you could end up losing money, and again the Kickstarter helps with this. Third, self-published titles rarely make it onto shelves in bookstores and libraries.  To solve this last problem, I'm partnering with Shawn Speakman at Grim Oak Press who will be using his distribution contacts to get Age of Empyre into bookstores worldwide.  I had the same arrangement for Age of Legend and Age of Death, and so far it's been working wonderfully, but my contract with Shawn is quite unconventional. Basically, I'm assuming all the capital expenditures, and he'll take a cut of each copy sold through the retail chains. My hope is this will work well for both of us, and if so, then it may open a whole new business model for Shawn, someone who is already a publishing veteran and thinking outside the box. \nOkay, so that's why the book is self-published, but why do a Kickstarter? The obvious answer revolves around the high cost of a large print run, but as I already mentioned, we could take out a loan for that. But having done six other crowdfunding projects, I can honestly say that we love how this platform is democratizing the creation of art. It's an incredible experience to be part of a group who are all pulling for the success of a project and spreading their enthusiasm to others. Plus, getting the story in people's hands early can help build excitement before the books ship to the population at large. Also, Kickstarter provides a system for me to offer additional perks to the people who are financially backing my project. Without Kickstarter, getting people's names in the book, and providing bookmarks would be difficult or impossible.\nI also love the fact that Kickstarter removes middlemen. For instance, Amazon takes 55% off the top for any print books sold, and when you factor in the costs of the distribution partners that can mean 80% of the list price goes to others. Ebook margins are better. I only lose 30% with them, but that's still much more than doing a Kickstarter. Yes, Kickstarter is a middleman, but their fees (including BackerKit and credit card processing) are just 10%. That's a huge difference. So by running a Kickstarter, it ensures the highest percentage of your purchase comes directly to the person who created the book. \nWell, that's all I can think of for now. I'll be updating the FAQ's as the project continues and adding stretch goals if the project funds. If you have any questions, just drop me a line. I'd also like to take just a minute to thank those who have been reading my books over the last decade. It's because of you that I'm able to live my life-long dream, and it's something that I'm always grateful for. I'll keep writing, and hopefully, you'll continue reading.\n-- Michael & Robin Sullivan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally, the most significant risks with novel projects are (a) will the author finish the book (b) can they write well and (c) can they handle the logistics of distribution?

In a world where what we see and experience is driven by want and immediacy, No Business Magazine encourages readers to slow down while exploring stories of artists and art-making. The No Biz Mag team is intentional in how we present these stories in our arts and culture publication, and we spend quality time conceptualizing every issue to make sure we\u2019re truly incorporating the people and their knowledge within the book.\n\nHow can we make interactions and \u201cconsumption\u201d of art and culture more meaningful? How can we move away from art conversations starting with \u2014 \u201cHow much is that piece?\u201d\nHOW IT CAME ABOUT\n\"No Business Magazine grew out of an earlier concept-based publication. It was a very special project, and now I get to revive it with good friend and highly talented designer, Hanna Peterson. About two years ago, my partner Eli Show (an artist) and I started a concept-heavy arts and culture publication (self published, often screen-printed in our basement) called Sound + Color and published three issues over the year, but things slowed down with a toddler in tow. I also realized that I wanted to use this collaborative project to work with another friend. Hanna is the absolute best!\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari, No Business Magazine.\nINTENT\nWe have visited at length to see what form this publication could take and we've fulfilled a lot of those goals with our first issue, Identity. We\u2019re committed to making something good and memorable. We want to encourage people to slow down and interact with the printed matter, but also empower them to have more honest conversations about art and culture, outside of art events. \"No Business Magazine\" because we won\u2019t deal with the business side of art/culture, won\u2019t look at art as commodity, but we'll actively try to talk about concept, art practice, and an artist\u2019s work as is. We want to learn about the ideas behind bodies of work. Basically, we don\u2019t want art conversations to start with \u2014 how much is it? Yes, to make more art, artists have to sell work, but we want to dwell more on artists and the works they\u2019re making. We want to lift up the ideas behind art. So, no business, just broad themes we\u2019d visit with each issue.\nThe themes help us narrow down and zero in on artists, art practices and concepts we want to visit as No Business Magazine. Our curation of artists and concepts in each issue spans United States, and we are continuously working to connect with people from around the world as well. We can't exist or thrive in silos, and we whole-heartedly embrace intersectionality, hybridity, and fluidity in people, ideas, and practice.\nOur design, editorial guidelines and concept for No Business Magazine follow a similar path of how we approached Sound + Color. We\u2019re intentional in what we\u2019re doing, the people we\u2019re connecting with, and how we\u2019re presenting all of it in each issue of the publication. Our plan is to have a limited print run for each issue which will be distributed in conjunction with two other things we're working towards: artist open studios and curated house art shows. Our timelines are a little loose as compared to standard publications, as we depend on donations or grant funding. And also because we want to be truly intentional in what we produce \u2014 sort of like creating an art object. This is truly a labor of love.\nISSUE ONE: IDENTITY\nFor No Business Magazine, we developed an approach to make our scope wider (in relation to our last series of zines) \u2014 in artists and writers we connected with, art that we talked and wrote about, and geography. For our first issue, we decided to explore identity in various forms and concepts \u2014 how identity has formed art and art choices, how choices and art has impacted identity, or how an identity is formed and/or presented through concepts in art. We produced Identity, our first issue last June, with launch events in Omaha (NE) and Sioux Falls (SD) in conjunction to a curated art show and artist open studios. \nThe people featured in Identity touch on very different things, from photographing a Burmese refugee community in Zomi Town aka Tulsa, a popular American sport influencing art practices, exploring identity as an outsider, looking at hybrid identity through art, how fan fiction manifests itself in art, to finding community within a subculture. So, we decided to use these ideas to inspire our approach for designing the whole publication. Our intention with every issue is to make it an immersive and interactive experience for the reader, with a hope that it will lead to more nuanced conversations / interactions with art.\nFor our first issue, Identity, we used various printing methods and interactive printed materials alongside varying layouts to relate to the content, concept, and artist.\nOur first issue wouldn't have been possible without the energy, time, knowledge, and opportunity shared by Daniel Mung, Amelie Mancini, Paul Dressen, Marsha Mack, Lorraine Rubio, Brian Bieber, University Libraries at the University of South Dakota, Amy Jarding, Eli Show, Amanda Smith, and Amplify Arts. The launch of No Business Magazine and limited run of Identity was through grant funding from AIGA South Dakota and Sioux Falls Arts Council. \nISSUE TWO: POWER COLORS\n\"When I\u2019m looking at art, I think of it as a friendly and passionate conversation with the artist. It becomes a layered interaction. Art-making embodies so much of an artist\u2019s history, personality and aesthetic. And, as a viewer, we often project our experiences and understanding of things onto an artist\u2019s work.\" \u2014 Angela Zonunpari\nPower Colors is a tiny intersection of individual histories, perception, and manifestation of personalities. Our intention with the second issue of No Business Magazine is to present artists and works that push us to look beyond their surface value and survey how / why they find power within color.\nWe're pretty excited about our line-up for Power Colors, slated to go to print at the beginning of April 2020.  We're hoping to step it up a notch with artists we connect with and the final book we produce! With your support and encouragement, we'll be able to produce a wonderful and cherished art book that aims to add value to our art interactions.\nPEOPLE\nNo Business Magazine is a collaboration project between Angela Zonunpari and Hanna Peterson, with support from Amy Jarding and other artists across the country.\nAngela Zonunpari is an arts writer, based in Sioux Falls, SD.

That\u2019s about 1 out of every 145 U.S. citizens. Each of these prisoners has a network of friends and family members that all have one question on their minds; \u201cWhen my loved one gets out, what will prevent them from reoffending and going right back into jail again?\u201d Get Out for Good gives practical, biblical advice to address this question.\n\nScott Stroud, was incarcerated in 1991 for four years as the result of an armed robbery he committed at the age of twenty-one. While in prison he placed his trust in Jesus as his personal Lord and Savior. Since his release he has successfully stayed out of trouble with the law, owned his own business, and is currently an ordained pastor. This did not occur by accident, but rather was the result of certain practices he was taught by mentors after regaining his freedom. He now desires to share these practical steps with those who are facing release from incarceration. \n\nHe also writes to their families and friends regarding pitfalls they can avoid as they encourage their loved ones upon reentering society. Drawing from his ministry experience of working with hundreds of prisons, Scott knows that by implementing these simple practices into everyday life the chances for success on the outside increase exponentially. Additionally, each chapter contains discussion questions for group study. \nPlease support this critical project! One pastor tried to help his uncle get readjusted to society upon his release from prison and couldn't find any resources available online. He even went to two prisons and spoke with the chaplains there. They just stared at him blankly never having heard of such a book.

The moment the words were out of her mouth the title came tumbling out of mine: Gaslight & Grimm! At the same time, I already knew exactly which tale I myself wanted to tell. Growing up, I had a record album that played an audio version of Beauty and the Beast on one side and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves on the other. I wore out the side with Ali Baba...and oh, what a rich tale to tell, with so much potential for a steampunk spin.\nI wanted to do it right, though. I wanted to capture the culture and the storytelling traditions of the Middle East. This is why I made the best decision of my literary career: I asked my good friend Day Al-Mohamed to be my cultural consultant. In the end, she turned into my co-author.\nThe irony? Between us, Baba Ali grew so large that it turned into a novel, one that published two years before Gaslight & Grimm. \nThe original cover by Autumn Frederickson.\nUnfortunately, the publisher who published it had some management issues and ceased to be...which means so did Baba Ali, at least from a commercial standpoint. \neSpec Books wants to rectify that, reissuing the book through our Paper Phoenix Press imprint. Could you help us make that happen?\nCome, Best Beloved, and sit you by my feet. I shall tell you a tale such as sister Scheherazade could have scarce imagined\u2026\nIn the Nejd there is nothing at all\u2026except secrets. A band of thieves wishes such secrets to remain hidden.\nIn England, far from his desert home, Ali bin-Massoud serves as apprentice to the famed Charles Babbage. One night a mysterious box is delivered by a clockwork falcon and Ali\u2019s world is never the same again. Heartache, danger, and thieves mark his journey as Ali is summoned home at the death of his father.\nIt will take faith, knowledge, and yes, love to realize his destiny, and more than a little skill with steam-driven technology. Can he unravel the mystery of the puzzle box and the clockwork djinn before it is too late? An ancient legacy and Ali's very life depend on his success.\nHear you the tale of Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn.\n___________________________________________\nPraise for Baba Ali and the Clockwork Djinn:\n\u201cRich with steampunk, magic, and an enchanting setting, this story casts a spell and won\u2019t let go until the very last page!\u201d \u2014Maria V.

There was a time when traditional publishers would happily go out on a limb, trying shared-world anthologies and other innovative approaches to the literature. These days, they have to play the game much closer to the vest.\nHowever, you and I--and writers and readers all over the world--aren't bound by the same limitations. We can create, support, and enjoy science fiction that goes directly from creator to audience, taking all the chances that audience can handle.\nAnd in Pangaea, there's plenty to enjoy.\nOne Land\nAt least four times in Earth\u2019s history, the continents have come sliding together. Over millions of years, separate and distinct landmasses have crawled across the planet's surface on immense tectonic plates to form a single mass--a super-continent. Geologists have dubbed the most recent such formation Pangaea.\nOf course, Pangaea broke up a long time ago, and because it did, mankind developed in drastically different climes and circumstances. But what if we twenty-first century types were living in one of the super-continental periods--those characterized by \u201clid tectonics\u201d rather than \u201cplate tectonics?\u201d What would it be like if all of humanity was confined to a single landmass...and had been so confined for all of our recorded history?\nThat's the ever-so-tantalizing axis on which our Pangaea anthologies turn.\nIt's an exciting and original idea, one that deserves the best shared world-building talent available. So to explore this world on your behalf, we've harnessed the word-smithing abilities of some of science fiction's most inventive writers.\nThe Pangaea Publishing Model\nIn a traditional publishing arrangement, less than 10% of the proceeds from a book go to the author. Hard to believe, isn't it, considering the author is the one providing 100% of the insight and wit? The lion's share of the cover price goes to the book store and the publisher, to cover both their costs and their profits.\nIn the case of this anthology, all proceeds after production and distribution costs go to the writers whose work drew you to the book in the first place--which, after all, is how it should be. When you support Pangaea, you're supporting a new and infinitely more equitable publishing model. You're saying that writers should finally enjoy the fruits of their labor.\nIt's a subversive idea, no question about it. But we believe it's an idea whose time has come.\nWho's We?\nSome of the most respected writers in science fiction and fantasy today. Ilsa J. Bick. Michael A. Burstein. Russ Colchamiro. Peter David. Keith R.A. DeCandido. Kevin Dilmore. Mary Fan. Michael Jan Friedman. Robert Greenberger. Glenn Hauman. Paul Kupperberg. Ron Marz. Aaron Rosenberg. Lawrence M. Schoen. Geoffrey Thorne. Tiffany Trent. Marie Vibbert. Dayton Ward.\nNot just great writers, by the way. They're also people who love and respect their craft and their chosen genre. If you get a chance to speak with them, you'll hear the excitement in their voices as they talk about their contributions to the Pangaea series.\nA La Carte Menu\nRather than ask you to read every possible combination of reward components, here's a handy menu for add-ons. Remember, these are additions to the rewards you'll see on the right side of the web page. All you have to do, when you pledge, is send me a message as to which add-ons you'd like and I'll take care of the rest.\nFor $11 more, you can add an 8\" by 10\" suitable-for-framing print of the cover of Pangaea III, which I'll autograph at no additional charge. \nFor $15 more, you can become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the book's Acknowledgements page.\nFor $18 more, you can add one of our two author sampler packages of five e-books each, culled from the best work of the writers contributing to Pangaea III. ($36 more for both packages. Packages to be announced.)\nPACKAGE #1\nDragon Precinct By Keith R.A. DeCandido\nCabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of the Muse by Michael Jan Friedman\nToo Tall for Small by Aaron Rosenberg\nLove, Murder & Mayhem: Cosmic Tales of the Heart edited by Russ Colchamiro\nThe Camelot Papers by Peter David\n\nPACKAGE #2\nUnicorn Precinct by Keith R.A. DeCandido\nLost Days by Michael Jan Friedman\nIn My Shorts: Hitler's Bellhop and Other Stories by Paul Kupperberg \nFlynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan \nDarkness of the Light by Peter David (Book 1 of 3 in Peter\u2019s Hidden Earth Chronicles) \nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a second Pangaea III trade paperback to your reward at the $25 level or higher. Both books will be signed by at least three of our writers. \nFor $20 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of the original Pangaea anthology OR Pangaea II: The Rise of Dominjaron to your reward at the $25 level or higher. This book will be signed by at least three of our writers.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your Pangaea III trade paperback to a hardcover edition.\nFor an additional $20, you can add on a physical copy of one of my other Crazy 8 Press books: The Hammer and The Horn, The Seekers and The Sword, The Fortress and the Fire, Fight The Gods, Aztlan, I Am The Salamander, Lost Days, Cabal and Other Unlikely Invocations of The Muse, and Headless and Other Improbable Excitations of The Muse. Any two would be $40, three would be $60, four would be $80, etc. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign these books at no additional charge.\nFor an additional $25, you can add on one of my bestselling hardcover Star Trek novels: The Valiant or Death In Winter. Together, they would be $50. If you're outside the U.S., please add $23 to each book for postage. Of course, I'll be happy to sign them for free. (These are limited to five of each title, so if you're interested don't wait too long.) \nFor $30 more (plus international shipping of $23 if you're outside the U.S.), you can add a trade paperback copy of Altered States of the Union, Glenn Hauman's wild and wooly alternate history anthology. Positing a slew of Americas that might have been if history had taken a different turn here or there, it features the work of David Gerrold, Peter David, Keith R.A. DeCandido, yours truly, and many others.\nFor $22 more, you can name a business, a street, or a one-time bystander (phonetically, of course, since this is not our world)--and also become a patron of the anthology and see your name on the Acknowledgments page.\nFor $700 more, you or someone you love will receive a large print of an alternate cover to the anthology suitable for framing -- a one-of-a-kind, custom treat created with your input and signed by talented Brazilian painter Caio Cacau -- as well as smaller prints of the sketches that went into the development of the alternate cover. (No additional postage necessary within the U.S. Outside the U.S., add $50.)\nStretch Goals!\nAt $8,500, we add a fourth author signature to every copy of Pangaea III that we send out to our backers.\nAt $9,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Tales of the Crimson Keep (the Newly Renovated Edition), a shared world anthology produced by the unlimited miscreants at Crazy 8 Press (a cadre to which I am proud to belong).\nAt $10,000, we send every backer from $8 on up a DRM-free e-copy of Fight The Gods, \"a contemporary fantasy with its roots sunk deep into the soil of Greek mythology.\"\nAt $11,000, we unlock an additional value: Caio Cacau, our cover artist, will provide a black-and-white illustration for each of our stories, to be included in every edition of the book.\nAt $12,000, every physical-reward backer from $25 up receives a 5\" by 8\" copy of one of Caio's black-and-white illustrations.\nAdditional stretch goals will be announced as we go along (It's more fun when we keep you in suspense)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've done a bunch of these Kickstarter campaigns now and I've always sent out all the rewards I said I would.

We're now trying to stretch go further goals (like a FOURTH anthology if we hit $30K), but the open call for submissions to our three current anthologies of APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK is now...well, open!!! Go to  https://jpskewedthrone.dreamwidth.org/499730.html   to read the fine print on how to submit your story and possibly end up in one of our anthologies, including contract terms, payment, timeline, etc.  Then write, revise, polish, and submit!\nThis project will fund THREE science fiction and fantasy anthologies, titled APOCALYPTIC, GALACTIC STEW, and MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK, containing approximately 14 all-original (no reprint) short stories each from established SF&F authors in the field and new voices found through an open call. The books will be edited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier (APOCALYPTIC), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (GALACTIC STEW), and Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier (MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK). \nAPOCALYPTIC:\nWho doesn\u2019t love a good apocalyptic story? They come in all kinds, from the straight up SF/horror of Stephen King\u2019s superflu in \u201cThe Stand\u201d and the zombie apocalypse in \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d to the quieter, more reflective tales of loss and survival in \u201cOn the Beach\u201d and \u201cChildhood\u2019s End.\u201d Tales that feature people struggling through the end of the world--or fighting to survive in what remains--are always compelling. What better way for readers to safely explore the extremes of the human condition without actually having to fight off the ravening hordes themselves? For this anthology, we\u2019ll be looking for unique takes on how the world ends, both during and after the apocalypse. So bring on your asteroids, your plagues, your solar flares! And ask yourself, would you survive the apocalypse? Would you even want to?  \nEdited by S.C. Butler & Joshua Palmatier, APOCALYPTIC will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include: \nStephen Blackmoore, \nJames Enge, \nNancy Holzner, \nTanya Huff, \nViolette Malan, \nSeanan McGuire, and \nS.M. Stirling\nGALACTIC STEW:\nFood is an essential part of life\u2014not just for energy and exotic flavors, but as a unifier during social events, a focal point for establishing culture, and shared experience to put people at ease. In GALACTIC STEW, readers will sit down at the communal table and sup upon stories centered on food.  Whether it\u2019s a tense treaty negotiation over a full course meal or a trap devised by the fae to chain you to their realm, these stories are certain to be delectable.  Come and savor these delicacies\u2026and hope the taste doesn\u2019t mask a deadly poison!\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, GALACTIC STEW will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each. Anchor authors include:\nRod Belcher, \nAndy Duncan, \nEsther Friesner, \nD.B. Jackson, \nHoward Andrew Jones, \nGini Koch, and \nLaura Resnick \nMY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK:\nWhen NASA's Opportunity rover sent its last message from Mars--loosely translated by scientists as \u201cmy battery is low and it is getting dark\u201d--many of us paused in a shared moment of sadness and gratitude, aimed at a robot left alone on a faraway planet. That moment inspired this anthology. We want stories about technology that has operated long past its time, but we want to give these lost spirits new life, whether it be rescue, a new purpose, a new beginning, or a simple homecoming. What happens to the robots and rovers and AIs and more after their original purpose has faded? What is the next chapter of their story?\nEdited by Crystal Sarakas & Joshua Palmatier, MY BATTERY IS LOW AND IT IS GETTING DARK will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of 6,000 words each.  Anchor authors include:\nJacey Bedford, \nTroy Carrol Bucher, \nJohn Hartness, \nJos\u00e9 Pablo Iriarte,\nAlethea Kontis, \nStephen Leigh, \nMerc Fenn Wolfmoor, \nKari Sperring, and \nEdward Willett\nBackers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade paperback edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run. \nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! \nZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors.

And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)!  With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you!

The cover art for \u201cApocalyptic\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter. \n\"Apocalyptic\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nThe following is a Reward Level Rundown for most of the rewards where the backer will get all three of the three anthologies in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback format. There are a few reward levels not listed, such as those where the backer gets only one or two of the anthologies in either format, as well as a few special reward levels where the backer will get ALL of the currently-available backlist from Zombies Need Brains in either ebook or limited-edition mass market paperback--those three levels are ZNB Ebook Zombie, ZNB Kickstarter Zombie, and ZNB Ebook Kickstarter Zombie.\nKickstarter Reward Level Rundown\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2019. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2020 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2020. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 8 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising. \nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far: \nStretch Goal: At $27,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Daughter of the Sands\" by Joshua Palmatier. \nStretch Goal: A FOURTH ANTHOLOGY!:  At $30,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, RAMMING THE RAMPARTS in ebook format. This anthology asks authors to explore these and other absurd, surrealistic alternate histories.  The inspiration comes from our current President's recent commentary on the Fourth of July, including the idea that our Army \"took over the airports\" during the Revolutionary War.  What if there had been airports during that war?  Absurd!  George Washington was not a fighter pilot!  There was no \"Battle at LaGuardia Baggage Claim\"!  And yet...  The anthology will contain 12 stories by Gerald Brandt, David B. Coe, Esther Friesner, Elektra Hammond, Nancy Holzner, Walter H. Hunt, Gini Koch, Kristine Kathryn Rusch, Rhondi Salsitz, Steven H Silver, Alan Smale, and Harry Turtledove.  It will be edited by Joshua Palmatier.  Details about how to add the ebook version of this anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.  This anthology will NOT have an open call UNLESS we reach $35,000 in the Kickstarter.  It will NOT be produced in paperback UNLESS we reach $40,000 in the Kickstarter.  (See the later stretch goals.)\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series AND every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"An Alewife in Kish\" by Benjamin Tate (aka Joshua Palmatier).\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will do an OPEN CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS for the RAMMING THE RAMPARTS anthology for a minimum of four additional open slots (more than likely a few more), bringing the anthology up to a minimum of 16 stories.  Details about the open call will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pledging $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.  In addition, we will produce limited-edition Kickstarter paperback versions of RAMMING THE RAMPARTS.  Details about how to add this paperback version of the anthology to your reward level will be announced once we reach this stretch goal.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.  \nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FIFTH themed anthology, title and details to be announced as we approach the stretch goal. \nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues. \nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level. These would include ZNB cover art prints, stuffed animals representing each of the ZNB editors, t-shirts and hats with the Zombies Need Brains LLC logo, etc. Add-ons can be added by backers at any reward level by simply clicking \u201cManage My Pledge\u201d and adding on the amount of the add-on to their initial pledge.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2020. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

You should be getting them within the next week or two, if you haven't gotten them already. A note about postage: I mailed them using media mail, which requires the postal worker to mark it media mail in some way. I try to watch if they're stamping it so they don't miss anyone, but sometimes one or two slips through unstamped as media. YOU SHOULD NOT GET THESE BOOKS POSTAGE DUE! If the post office says there's postage due, tell them it was media mail, that it contains books, and hopefully that resolves the issue.

Born from the mind\u2019s eye of, award-winning artist, Jeff Sturgeon. Last Cities of Earth is a stunning collection of tales and imagery. For years, Jeff envisioned entire cities floating above the clouds. At first, a single metropolis emerged. Then, over time, more and more massive structures seemingly rose into the sky. As Jeff revealed his vision to colleagues in 2014 of lofty, floating civilizations, six fateful words were uttered: \u201cJeff, why aren\u2019t you painting them?\u201d After decades bringing other creators\u2019 dreams from aether to reality, Jeff picked up his brush to breath life into this new world swirling in his imagination. For the next two years, paintings were exhibited. Other creators fell in love with Jeff\u2019s vision and found inspiration to create within his mythology of Last Cities of Earth. There is no end to the creativity sparked by Jeff\u2019s striking images. Short stories, novellas, coloring books, illustrations, schematics, novels, digital fusions of his paintings\u2026 The World, it seemed, was endless. \u201cThe beginning stages of the project consumed me,\u201d Jeff said. \u201cIn creating Last Cities of Earth - the paintings and their stories - I found that there was no clearing my mind after creating a single image. The world was too big and the stories, too many.  \nHelping Jeff to tell those tales, the anthology will include stories by Kevin J. Anderson, Brenda Cooper, David Gerrold, Jim Wright, Mike Resnick, Andrea Stewart, Jody Lynn Nye, Steve Perry, Raven Oak, J.A. Pitts, Cat Rambo, Peter J. Wacks, Danielle Ackley-McPhail, Steven Lee Sears, and Todd Lockwood, with editing by Manny  Frishberg and Jennifer Brozek. \nOn March 15th of 2085, a shocked world listens as global news sources report that the world is on a timer. Increased seismic activity beneath Yellowstone National Park heralds a pending volcanic eruption. In less than a decade, mankind will be facing an extinction-level event...   \nThe soil humanity relied on for its crops, fossil fuels, manufacturing resources would be covered in ash. Sunlight would barely penetrate the lower altitudes and the life humanity drew from the earth would be extinguished. With a six-year timer ticking down, governments and corporations set aside their conflicts and worked together to equip major population centers with massive anti-grav engines.  \nThose with the means headed for space, settling on Luna Prime or the Mars colony. Nations and powers that couldn\u2019t reach space turned their eye toward genetic manipulation, with the idea that they could adapt the human form to make it better suited for surviving the coming eruption. The tentative peace negotiated for the sake of survival broke. Those who couldn\u2019t make it into the floating cities, or find a path to salvation, used the coming eruption to settle old scores. Mankind fell into chaos as the super volcano erupted. The early post-eruption decades of 2090-2134 are considered lost to history.  \nFor the next 80-plus years the cities sent out newly designed airships, designed to have a low technology footprint for easier field repairs. Rebuilding civilization with intercity commerce and shared discovery, was a long, painstaking process. In the 2250s, America reconnected to itself, then reached beyond its borders and established trade routes to Europe. Global culture was finally reestablished.  \nIt is now YE (Yellowstone Eruption) 210, the Gregorian 2300 AD, and global trade routes exist. The 'golden age' of Lost Earth echoes in the modern day as more and more cities become connected. But the technology is beginning to fail, and many cities have lost the knowledge to repair their own anti-grav engines. Ideological wars are resurfacing. Threats are abundant from both ground and sky. If colonies still exist in space, they are silent....  \n...Welcome to the new world. Will humanity survive?  \nNOTE: The following images represent the original Last Cities of Earth artwork by Jeff Sturgeon that will be available as rewards for those who back at the Art Aficionado Pledge Level, on a first-come basis.

They were partly right: she had grander plans than a world, though, she was already creating the universe of the Sholan Alliance, where Magic, Warriors, and Science all co-exist.\nShe began writing when she was eight because she couldn't find enough of the books she liked to read.  How difficult can it be to write them myself, she thought with all the confidence of a child.  After all, the libraries were full of books.  It must be easy.\nReal life took over as she entered college and began to work for the first time, but thanks to the constant nagging of two very good friends, one of whom is the sister of her editor, she finished a novel she'd started back in 1979. It was called Turning Point, and her friend's sister at DAW bought it. The Sholan Alliance Series is now nine novels long. She also has several short stories out in DAW anthologies, and one in Defending the Future series number IV, \"No Man's Land\" called \"Valkyries\".\n Jody Lynn Nye lists her main career activity as \u2018spoiling cats.\u2019 When not engaged upon this worthy occupation, she writes fantasy and science fiction books and short stories. \nHer newest books are Moon Tracks (Baen), a young adult hard science fiction novel, the second in collaboration with Dr. Travis S.

She also runs the two-day writers workshop at DragonCon. She and her husband are the fiction reviewers for Galaxy\u2019s Edge Magazine. In 2016, Jody joined the judging staff of the Writers of the Future contest, the world\u2019s largest science fiction and fantasy writing contest for new authors. \nJody lives in the northwest suburbs of Chicago, with her husband Bill Fawcett, a writer, game designer, military historian and book packager, and three feline overlords, Athena, Minx, and Marmalade.

Players can choose from all the beloved tropes of the genre. Will you be the Delinquent, the Elite, the Adorable, the Rep? Pick from 10 social roles to form your character's day-to-day life.\nNo one, though, is just their role. Everyone has a larger and more fraught destiny. Are you a Night Hunter, a Creature Summoner, an Alchemical Witch, a Secret Monster? 10 destiny playbooks await.\nThis is the playground where your Secret Monster can ask out the Reincarnated Soul to prom, while fighting on the moon for the fate of the universe. You can be an Apprentice Reaper trying to stay awake in class, or a runaway extraterrestrial princess who wants to make friends. You can even combine your powers in an ultimate showdown. Have you formed a giant pink skeletal unicorn summon, aglow with searing sparkles and wearing a jeweled crown of soul energy? Go you.\nThis game joins a constellation of great indie gaming options in the Powered by the Apocalypse family. Our small design team has enjoyed and drawn inspiration from Monsterhearts, Masks, Fellowship, and Monster of the Week, among others. \nWe have been inspired by more anime, manga and JRPGs than we can list, but a few are: Escaflowne, Digimon, Ressha Sentai ToQger, Little Witch Academia, Yu-Gi-Oh!, the Final Fantasy franchise, Sailor Moon, a lot of Gundam series, Ouran High School Host Club, My Hero Academia, Yu Yu Hakusho, Kill la Kill, and Cardcaptor Sakura.\n Here's some of the things that make Super Destiny High School Rumble!! fun:\nPlay your favorite anime type with moves like \"Proclaim your Feelings,\" \"Your Opponent is Me,\" and \"Believe in Yourself.\"\nFast character creation and rules-light play. It's an easy game to run and doesn't need a lot of prep time.\nMix and match your student and destiny playbooks for dozens of playable possibilities.\nYou and your fellow players create your world, starting with your classmates in homeroom, and expanding to the school, town, and beyond. Players make statements that become part of the truth of this world--\"We live on a floating island of skyscrapers,\" \"We're on a space station,\" \"Music creates magic,\" \"Powers are common\", or \"Powers are rare\", \"This is the afterlife\", \"This is Neo Okinawa,\" \"This is Verona Beach.\"\nForm Bonds with teammates and boost your own and others' abilities with the power of love, friendship, and teamwork.\nBalance student life with your super-powered secret identity.\nUnlock powerful limit breaks and expend them in extraordinary circumstances.\nCombine your team's powers to make an ultimate form and defeat evil. You get to describe what the combination looks like. Is it a giant robot? A special summon? An amazing mashup of your diverse power sets?\nFight villains in ascending tiers of power: minions, lieutenants (are there four god-generals? There could be!), and bosses.\nPlay in lots of different ways. You can all use different destiny playbooks, or you can decide to build an entire team of Mech Pilots or Transformation Warriors. You could be students at a magic school, or Otherworldy Royalty who use your powers openly in a multiverse crossroads station instead of having secret identities.\nWe are publishing Super Destiny High School Rumble!! in PDF and softcover Print on Demand versions, both fulfilled by DriveThruRPG, that trusty bastion of roleplaying game downloads. The book will have a color cover and black and white interior illustrations by Amanda Williams. It will contain sections for the students (the players) and the Principal (the DM) and have twenty playbooks, ten for student types and ten for destiny types. You will also get printable PDF versions of the playbooks, the homeroom seating chart, the Principal's cheat sheet, and a fill-in character sheet- everything you need to play the game. Except for a pair of six-sided dice. But what are the chances you have those?\nFor a preview of what the book will look like, head over to DriveThruRPG and download our free promo. It contains two sample playbooks to whet your appetite.\nHere's a mini-preview of two of the playbooks.\nCheck out Amanda Williams' awesome illustrations for the book! We'll be posting more art as the Kickstarter continues.\nOur design team is a found family of friends, gamers, and artists who have collaborated in past on two funded Kickstarters, a successful line of t-shirts, and a 16-year-old small geeky business called The Five Wits. You can find out more about us here!\nBesides the publishing end of things, we also sell nerdy tea blends and other treasures, and cosplay wigs!\nOur business takes us on long trips to and from conventions, and to visit out-of-state gaming friends. We constantly brainstorm new game and story ideas while driving. This project began in just such a way. We've been having the time of our lives playtesting it, and look forward to sharing it with more gamers. Thanks to all our playtesters so far!\nBesides the book itself, you can get rewards inspired by our playbooks, including hand-made one-of-a-kind creatures by Ruth Lampi, witchy gear, or cool hair. \nAll backers will have their names included in the digital thank-yous.\nShipping is not included and will be added to all reward tiers that involve a physical object.\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Alchemical Witch\"\nthe sorts of things you can expect as rewards from the tier \"Creature Summoner\"\nThe art and layout for the book will be complete by the end of May, allowing the PDF to be up on DriveThruRPG by June 2019. The print on demand version will be ready by August 2019. We plan to have copies of it for sale at our booth at GenCon Indy 2019. Because one-third of the art is already done, the book is written, and we've done layout for six of the playbooks, we're confident that this is a reasonable timeline for the additional art and layout, plus the editing. \nOver half our funding goal goes toward the art (we love paying artists!), and the rest is for layout and for the cost of, and shipping for, the books we will be sending directly to backers in the wholesale reward tier and other tiers that involve additional physical objects.\nhandy chart of what the funds will be going towards\nGlad you asked! There sure are!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've funded the printing of two books in previous Kickstarter projects, so we're familiar with the process of editing, layout, and fulfillment. This project is a little larger than those were, but we're making fulfillment easier on ourselves by using DriveThruRPG's distribution channel for PDFs and for print on demand books. This will also make it possible to scale up easily no matter how many backers we get.\n\nThis is our first published game system, though we've been homebrewing all sorts of systems for years. We decided to use the template of Powered by the Apocalypse so that we can be confident we're building on a solid rule base. We've also been playtesting with many groups of varied backgrounds for the last half year.\n\nFor the wilder reward tiers, we have the fortune of being the same team working behind the scenes at The Five Wits, and having access to the costuming and apothecary supply chains that let us provide customized and magical reward options. We also have a daily shipping operation we can piggyback on, so backer fulfillment can dash along smoothly. The risks we are facing go hand in hand with the above. Our team doubles as the staff for a busy little traveling business, and rolling game design and distribution into our portfolio is no small feat. It is, however, one we have long been dreaming of and planning for. Our reputation is on the line to deliver, and we take that very seriously.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't. Just take any existing package of $25 and up and add to it the dollar amount associated with any item or items on the following list. Then send us a message letting us know what additional reward or rewards you've qualified for. (International backers, there will be some additional postage; if you're interested in an add-on, shoot us a message and we'll figure it out.)\nGet listed as a patron on the acknowledgments page                                     10. \nReceive a one-time mention as a character, street, company, etc.             35.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #1                                                                                   20. \nCrazy 8 e-book package #2                                                                                   20.\nCrazy 8 e-book package #3                                                                                   20.\nPackage #1 includes Six Scarlet Scorpions (a Pat Savage novel) by Will Murray; No Small Bills by Aaron Rosenberg; In My Shorts (a short story collection) by Paul Kupperberg; Pulling Up Stakes by Peter David; ReDeus: Divine Tales, and The Fire Dragon by Mary Fan.\nPackage #2 includes The Camelot Papers by Peter David; Finders Keepers by Russ Colchamiro; Flynn Nightsider and the Edge of Evil by Mary Fan; a collection of five short stories by Keith R.A. DeCandido; For This Is Hell by Aaron Rosenberg and Steve Saville, and Fight The Gods by Michael Jan Friedman.\nPackage #3 is a Crazy 8 Press Anthology pack that includes the entire Latchkeys series; ReDeus: Divine Lands; Love, Mayhem, and Murder; They Keep Killing Glenn, and Tales of the Crimson Keep.\nFor $20 more, you can upgrade your trade paperback to a hardcover edition (after the option is unlocked, of course). \nStretch Goals!\n$5,000 will allow me to include stories from three long-time reader favorites: Keith R.A. DeCandido, Will Murray and Peter David.\nIn many ways, Will has been almost single-handedly keeping the pulps alive with his articles and short stories throughout the years. He's also been writing authorized novels featuring Doc Savage, Tarzan, and others. He knows his way around a good yarn.\nKeith is the award-winning author of more than fifty books, including some of the best Star Trek novels around. And his Dragon Precinct books have a cult following all their own.\nPeter is the famed Writer of Stuff whose pulp-inspired works include several Zorro stories. But really, we know and love him for his runs on The Incredible Hulk, Young Justice, and Star Trek. His original works range from science fiction to satirical vampire tales.\nNew! At $6,000, we unlock \"the hardcover option,\" allowing any backer whose reward includes a paperback copy on to upgrade to a handsome hardback version of Thrilling Adventure Yarns (see A La Carte menu above).\nNew! At $6500 we will upgrade those receiving one signature to three signatures from our illustrious cadre of authors.\n$7000 will allow me to hire a cadre of talented artists to render a black and white illustration for each and every story in the collection. \nAt $8,000 we can send everyone a digital art set of images, suitable for your digital wallpaper. \nNew! At $9000, we will send every backer a digital copy of Peter David's Sir Apropos of Nothing, his critically acclaimed humorous fantasy novel. It's the first in a series and the long-out-of-print second and third volumes will finally be available once more in the summer so now's a great time to get introduced to the series.\nNew! At $10,000 we will up our guarantee of three autographs per print edition to five autographs.\nWe'll be announcing other stretch goals as our campaign develops. We don't want to give away all our secrets!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is nearly complete already, with 90% of the stories in and more than half of them already edited.

Awkwardly, of course, because this is me we're talking about. But then I said, \"No! If I become a publisher, I'll never have any time to write.\"\nShortly after that, I established the Realm Makers Conference, because that definitely hasn't cut into my writing time. But it's been worth every hour of planning, traveling, and instituting of plans B, C, and D, because Realm Makers has become so much more than an annual writers conference. We're a modern-day tribe, in the best sense of the word.\nAnd where writers gather, ideas for books grow. In 2016, we partnered with Brimstone Fiction to publish our first anthology of fantasy and science fiction, entitled Realmscapes. \nToday, we're stepping up our game to bring to you our first PAID anthology, RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm. \nWith the assistance of editor Danielle Ackley-McPhail, we're looking forward to bringing you a collection of some of the best fantasy and sci-fi by authors of faith. RealmScapes: Heroes of the Realm will feature stories from established, bestselling authors from every corner of the genre.\nOur core book will feature stories from L. Jagi Lamplighter, Wayne Thomas Batson, Kathy Tyers, James Chambers, Steve Rzasa, Paul Regnier, and Jeffrey Lyman.Your pledges fund every detail of this anthology's production, since there's a huge investment of time and skill that make books a reality. A fully-funded campaign will pay for the anthology's flashy cover art by Kirk DouPonce, the skill and precision of our editor, Danielle Ackley McPhail, market-rate compensation to each author for their fine words, book formatting and layout, and the initial print run of the books, among other administrative costs associated with publishing. (They are small, but many, like a legion of goblins that creeps up on you and overwhelms you, even though you've got a massive sword and plate armor.)\nEspecially for our first 50 backers: You'll receive a digital, DRM-free ebook of Danielle's Yesterday's Dreams, (in addition to the perks that come with whatever backer level you choose) because early adopters are the people who make tomorrow's dreams come true! \nSo grab your cloak, your blaster, and a cup of coffee, and join us for the adventure of building the second Realmscapes anthology, Heroes of the Realm.

Since September 2000, we have been publishing new issues every Monday, including fiction, poetry, reviews, essays, and interviews. In 2017, we published almost 1,000,000 words over 51 issues, all paid to our contributors, and all paid for by you, our supporters.\nWe're entirely funded by voluntary contributions. We pay all our contributors fair market rates for their work, but our (frankly enormous) volunteer editorial team does it out of love.\nWhy support Strange Horizons?\nBecause we believe that in the twenty-first century, speculative fiction must be an open, global tradition. For over fifteen years, we have showcased work that challenges us and delights us, by new and established writers from diverse backgrounds and with diverse concerns. \nBecause we have a record of finding and supporting exciting new voices in SF: writers who got their start in Strange Horizons include N. K. Jemisin (\"The You Train,\" from 2007), Justine Larbalestier (\"The Cruel Brother,\" from 2001), Ken Liu (\"The Algorithms for Love,\" from 2004), Nnedi Okorafor (\"The Palm Tree Bandit,\" from 2000), John Scalzi (\"Alien Animal Encounters,\" from 2001) and, in more recent years, G. V. Anderson (\"Das Steingesch\u00f6pf\", from 2016).\nBecause we're a multiple Hugo-shortlisted magazine (for six consecutive years!) and we've published stories that have been shortlisted for or won Hugo, Nebula, James Tiptree Jr., Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards.\nWhat We Need\nWhat we need to raise:\nWe need $13,000 to fund the basic running costs of the magazine for 1 year\nAt $14,500 we'll run a special issue packed with international SFF \nAt $16,000 we'll run a special issue focused on web comics \nAt $21,000 we'll be able to \ud83c\udf89 pay our staff \ud83c\udf89for the first time in our history\nIf we hit $23,000 we'll unlock the first stretch goal \nAnd at $25,000 we'll unlock the second secret goal!\nWhat You Get\nWhat do you get out of this?\nIf you donate $25 you get access to all of 2018's Strange Horizons ebooks \nIf you donate $40 you get the above and digital wallpaper of our 2018 artwork for your computer/phone/device.\nIf you donate $50 you get the above and a mug, t-shirt or tote bag branded with the Strange Horizons logo\nIf you donate $75 you don't have to choose!

The books will be edited by Patricia Bray & S.C. Butler (PORTALS), David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier (TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED), and Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier (ALTERNATE PEACE).\nUnlike the first two Kickstarters run by Zombies Need Brains, we are NOT using the Kickstarter to help set up and solidify the small press. Backers of this project will essentially be generating the base funds needed to produce these three anthologies\u2014including payment for the contributing authors, payment for the cover artist, production costs for producing the anthology, etc. Because of this, the reward levels for the anthologies have been set to more closely resemble the cost of the final product when it goes on sale to the general public. In essence, backers of the project are simply \u201cpreordering\u201d the anthologies, although there will still be a special mass market Kickstarter edition produced for backers who help fund the project at the paperback level. This special edition will have a limited print run to cover the orders made by the backers and will not be printed again after the Kickstarter print run. After that, there will be a trade edition issued to the general public that will have an unlimited print run.\nSo get in on the Kickstarter now and get the special mass market Kickstarter edition! Help the small press Zombies Need Brains LLC expand! ZNB produces quality anthologies from leading authors. Check out our current offerings: \nTemporally Out of Order \nAlien Artifacts \nWere- \nSubmerged \nAll Hail Our Robot Conquerors! \nThe Death of All Things\nGuilds & Glaives\nSecond Round: A Return to the Ur-Bar\nThe Razor's Edge\nat https://squareup.com/market/zombies-need-brains-llc. You can also find them online at Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble; they are available in trade paperback format as well as on almost all ebook platforms (Kindle, Nook, Kobo, Scribd, etc.).\nWe offer professional pay rates and feature stellar cover art. As we did in our previous anthologies, we plan to include the very best stories we can find, spanning the gamut from bestselling authors to new, previously unpublished voices, including an open submission window if the Kickstarter is successful, where anyone can submit their stories featuring the current themes for a chance to be part of the anthologies. And Zombies Need Brains is officially a \"qualifying market\" for the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA)! With your help, we hope that ZNB will then be able to expand into novels and other projects in the future. We can't do this without you! Consider backing our Kickstarter and then help spread the word. Just as Zombies Need Brains, we need your support to make this new small press a success. So what are the current projects? Here are the details:\nPORTALS:\nIn the blink of an eye, the familiar disappears as you step into the unknown. What new creatures will you meet? What strange planets will you explore? Will you find happiness, or doom? Open the pages of PORTALS, the newest anthology from the small press Zombies Need Brains, and you just might find out.\nFrom wardrobes to monoliths, wormholes to fairy rings, there is a rich tradition of stories in both science fiction and fantasy that explore what happens when--by accident or design--characters are transported from one world to another. Join fourteen of today\u2019s leading science fiction and fantasy authors as they offer fresh takes on this classic theme. Whether a routine trip or unexpected journey, each tale will explore new worlds of adventure, mystery, humor, and horror, with stories for every taste and fancy.\nEdited by S.C. Butler and Patricia Bray, PORTALS will contain approximately fourteen stories with an average length of up to 6,000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nJacey Bedford\nF. Brett Cox\nJames Enge \nEsther Friesner \nNancy Holzner \nGini Koch \nViolette Malan \nJaime Lee Moyer\nIan Tregillis\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nTEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED:\nIn our spam boxes today, we both received notices that our bank accounts required resolution, and the content of the spam contained the following sentence: \"We have noticed that you need to resolve important security issues on your account to prevent temporal deactivation.\" Of course, our immediate thought was of a new anthology called TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED!\nFor this follow-up to 2015\u2019s TEMPORALLY OUT OF ORDER, we are looking for stories that take a person, object, event, or phenomenon and somehow, during the course of the plot, \u201ctemporally deactivate\u201d it, whatever that may mean in the context of the story. \u201cTemporal deactivation\u201d should refer to something more than a simple death, malfunction, or termination, and instead should touch in some way on issues of time \u2014 its flow, distortion, dislocation, etc.\nEdited by David B. Coe & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by:\nC.S. Friedman \nFaith Hunter \nD.B. Jackson\nGini Koch \nStephen Leigh \nMisty Massey \nJenna Rhodes \nEdmund R. Schubert\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nALTERNATE PEACE:\nAll too often, alternate histories are based on a battle or assassination. We\u2019re looking for stories where change grew out of more peaceful activities\u2026science, business, and culture. Imagine a world in which the branch point from our own was caused by scientific endeavor, social change, natural forces, or other points of divergence which don\u2019t rely on military activity or violence.\nEdited by Steven H Silver & Joshua Palmatier, it will contain approximately 14 stories with an average length of up to 6000 words each. It will include short stories by: \nD.B. Jackson \nStephen Leigh\nIan R. MacLeod\nKristine Kathryn Rusch\nKari Sperring\nHarry Turtledove \nRick Wilber\nAll other slots aside from the named authors will be filled by the open call for submissions following the successful completion of the Kickstarter.\nThe images that will be used to design the cover art are commissioned pieces created by Justin Adams of Varia Studios. The cover art for \u201cPortals\u201d has been completed (see below for the image). The cover art for the other two anthologies will be completed and revealed at a later date. The official covers for the anthology based off this artwork will be revealed sometime after the end of the Kickstarter.\n\"Portals\" by Justin Adams of Varia Studios\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, the intention is to have all stories handed in by the end of December 2018. We expect the editing and revision process to be finished by the end of February 2019 and the ebook and physical books to be designed, produced, and ready for release by the end of August 2019. Funding will cover the costs of producing the ebook in all standard formats (MOBI, Epub, PDF), producing mass market paperback versions of the anthology for the backers, cover art commission, payment of the editors, advances for the authors (at a minimum of 6 cents per word), and advertising and promotional expenses. Funding above the minimum would be used to increase the advances of the authors, allow for higher production values for the ebooks and books, increase the number of stories in the anthology, and increased advertising.\nStretch goals would include production of promotional bookmarks, an increase in pay for the authors, adding additional story slots to the books, etc. We will be adding more stretch goals as those at the lower levels are achieved. Here are the stretch goals so far:\nStretch Goal: BOOKMARKS! At $27,500, every backer pledged at $20 or more will receive a free promotional bookmark for PORTALS, TEMPORALLY DEACTIVATED, and ALTERNATE PEACE.\nStretch Goal: At $30,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology that is really a THREE-PART STORY cut up into three sections, each section written by the editors of the appropriate anthology (see Update #15 for more details), so each anthology will feature 15 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"The Royal Scam\" by Gini Koch, the first installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $32,500, every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"When Josie Comes Home\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the first installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $35,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Three Card Monte\" by Gini Koch, the second installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $37,500, every backer pleding $7 or more will receive the ebook \"Deacon's Ark\" by A.E. Stanton (aka Gini Koch), the second installment of THE NEW WEST series.\nStretch Goal: At $40,000, we will add an additional story to each anthology using the submissions from the open call, so each anthology will feature 16 stories minimum AND every backer pledged at $7 or more will receive the ebook \"A Bug's Life\" by Gini Koch, the third installment of THE MARTIAN ALLIANCE CHRONICLES series.\nStretch Goal: At $45,000, all authors will be paid an additional 1 cent/word.\nStretch Goal: At $50,000, Zombies Need Brains LLC will produce a FOURTH themed anthology, title to be announced as we approach the stretch goal.\nOther stretch goals will be added as the Kickstarter continues.\nAdd-ons are extra items that current backers can add to their current pledge level.

Every effort will be made to have the books ready for release and in backers\u2019 hands by August 2019. Also, there is always a slight chance that life and circumstances will force a confirmed anchor author to drop out of the anthology. In the unlikely event that an author cannot deliver a story for whatever reason, their slot would be filled with an author from the slush pile. Since everyone involved\u2014both anchor authors and editors\u2014are professionals in the field already, there is no real expectation that there will be a delay or that the confirmed authors will not deliver, but it does happen on occasion.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 7 or more", "title": "Electronic Zombie", "descp":

(And for those of you who Kickstarted Mermaid Precinct, that is still in progress, and should be done in the next few weeks, with the book itself ready some time after that. You'll be seeing more in-progress chapters this week.)\nOne of those stories I did via Kickstarter, entitled \"Gan Brightblade vs. Mitos the Mighty.\" The response to that story -- which didn't actually include any members of the Cliff's End Castle Guard -- was strong enough that I've wanted to write some more stories that look at the greater world of Flingaria beyond Cliff's End and the cops who maintain law and order therein.\nTo that end, I've written a story called \"The Fall of Iaron.\" It tells a story of the history of Flingaria, in particular a battle that took place in Iaron, one of the other human city-states that's is allied with Cliff's End under the rule of King Marcus and Queen Marta. \n\"The Fall of Iaron\" is about history, about storytelling, about political machinations, and about what makes a hero and what makes a tyrant and what makes a villain. I'm quite pleased with it, and I hope you'll enjoy it, too.\nThe story is already written, and the only changes still to be made to it are the names of up to ten of characters in the story who will be renamed based on who pledges at the $65 level. Aside from that -- and adding the acknowledgments to include all you kind folks who pledge -- the story is done and edited, so as soon as the project is funded, I can start sending out the main reward, to wit, the story itself. The eBooks should also go out in relatively short order as well.\nIf you just want the story itself, it's only two bucks, but there are other nifty rewards at higher levels, including swag, me reading the story, other books of mine, and a new one, offering my editorial services! I've been a professional editor for almost thirty years now, and I'm offering editing of either your short fiction (20,000 words or less) or your novel (100,000 words or less) at a lower rate than my usual.\nSo please, fund this project, and get a nifty new story in this fun universe I've created.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe story's already written, so the risks are minimal.

The best of games capture the tried elements of 40 years of fantasy roleplaying evolution: balance, flow of play, a smooth learning curve, and system that well-serves setting.\nIn 2007, Metal, Magic and Lore was introduced, with its powerful system with emphasis on realism and grit with speed of play. MML developed a loyal, passionate following that has stayed with it ever since. And NOW based both on the desires of those players and critics of the game, we are proud to integrate a number of upgraded improvements, and introduce the  Metal, Magic, and Lore Revised Edition.\nAre You One Of Us?\nFollowing the traditions of Tolkien, Howard, Brooks, and Abercrombie, in Metal, Magic and Lore nearly any literary character can be brought to life due to its class-less, level-less character system. Here you\u2019ll find Men, Dwarves, Elves, and others locked in struggle against adversaries common and fantastic. MML is for a particular kind of fantasy gamer: a lover of fantasy, but also a lover of the rich experience of simulation and realism; mature role-playing at its best.\nNew to the game? Eight reasons to try it -\nThis is traditional fantasy, a time of Men, Dwarves and Elves. There are 3 other offshoot races, which do not deviate far from these classic archetypes which shaped the very origins of the genre! \nCharacters are created by allocating Attribute points to nine attributes. Secondary attributes are calculated from these, so all of them are important; Min/Maxing has been proven to be nearly impossible within the MML architecture. Characters are class-less and level-less, and are created by selecting skills as negotiated by the player and GM to form the character composite. The revised addition adds clarity and definition to this to make it easier to start, as well as some pre-assembled templates. Characters get better by improving skills, making them more effective at interaction, better at attacking and defending, and casting spells.  \nSkill checks are a percentile-system based. Roll dice under the percentage for success. All task attempts in the game are given by the same universal formula: combat, magic and social interaction are all resolved as a combination of skill and the difficulty of the task attempted. GMs add/subtract modifiers as per situation. Characters skills are developed only by them being used, and all types of skills are needed for survival!\nEconomics in the game are dramatic as seen with character Social Class - the Commoner, the Merchant Class and the Lesser Noble, akin to the castes of Medieval Europe at about the 12th century, so coin and provisions are key to adventure. Travel is part of the adventure, as is the countryside and rumors that it contains.\nCombat is deadly. Initiative matters because striking first can mean not being attacked. Character A attacks, character B defends, then a position is chosen on the body, over which there may or may not be armor. And well, with a sword against no armor - you can imagine what happens. Hit Points are location based and never increase (only by a point or two in the advanced rules).  Characters become no tougher in the game, just harder to hit while they hit others better.\nMagic has lower power than many other fantasy games, but is as effective due to the game setting. Regardless of the type of magic, a point pool system is used to determine amounts of spells. The method of casting uses the same percentile system as is described above. Players do find this approach refreshing, though in the revised edition we will be correcting some scaling errors and rounding out the magic so that it better reflects the lore of the game as is intended.\nBeasts are creatures foul and feisty, but there are not many. We look to publish about 50. Beasts are tied to the ecology, which will be portrayed in future regional atlases. Most current fans and gamers have not gotten through using even 20 in a multi-session campaign. Orcs, Ogres, Goblins, Giants, and many traditional archetypes is what you will see here.\nIf you like mature storytelling, literary fantasy which can easily mimic any HBO episode of Game of Thrones, the idea that it only takes 7 or 8 orcs to present an experienced set of characters with a problem, then you will probably want to try Metal, Magic and Lore.\nPledge Levels\nEach Pledge Level includes all rewards of any of lower dollar value, so your collection will accumulate with your pledge!

Colonists must depend on their grit and ingenuity.  \nWhen a garbled message is received by unconventional means, warning of an alien attack, many on Morrow think it a joke, or spotty communication. No one can believe what they are hearing.  \nThere is no time to reconsider as flashes light up across the planet\u2019s horizon. Not even knowing they aren\u2019t alone in the universe, humanity falls victim to first contact and very few on Morrow are left alive, somehow overlooked by an alien force bent on their destruction.

Sure, I'd still love to get more reviews for Familiar Spirits, and for Frame Shop, which I Kickstarted before that (heck, for all of my books and stories), but that's not the purpose of this update. The reason I'm contacting you at the moment is because I want to bring somebody else's Kickstarter to your attention.\nYou see, my company used to own a time travel roleplaying game and I wrote a number of adventures for it. I've also written a number of time travel tales in my time, so I couldn't help but be intrigued when I ran across Singular Irregularity, a Kickstarter for an anthology about time travel gone terribly wrong. Better yet, I knew some of the authors from other projects. But, best of all, when I contacted Kimber Grey, she gave me a chance to join the project, adding my story \"Standing Still\" to the temporal mix. And ... since I used to run those time travel adventures I wrote for the Timemaster Roleplaying Game at conventions, she added a pledge level whereby I will run one of my old time travel adventures for the backer of that reward and five of their friends.
