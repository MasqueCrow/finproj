[{"backer": "Michael Garlick", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Livestream recording demo on Youtube @ 8 AM EST January 24th 2020. \n Sound is all around us, all the time. Sometimes we ignore it, sometimes we cherish it. \nBut why is sound so important?\nWe spend everyday hearing and listening, it is part of our lives.  Sound is influential, it can be informative, educational, conclusive, emotive, and many other things for us.\nThe problem is people remember only 30% of what they hear. Smartphones can do the \u2018work\u2019, they are certainly not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSo why not try the better solution?\nBorn from a team of researchers and engineers who spend many hours in front of a computer, TileRec is our constant reminder to take a walk and \"stop and smell the roses\", so to speak.\nWe designed TileRec to exceed even our own extremely high personal standards.  \n\n Thin: Only 1/4 inch thin. Fits easily in the slimmest wallets.\n Small: As small as a piece of a chocolate bar ( 2.48 square inch).\n Light:  The same weight as a US penny (0.5 oz).\n Simple: Simple everything! Easy to use, easy to recharge and easy to playback.\n Long-lasting Battery: 24 hours on one charge. Designed to be used the entire day.\n Surround Recording: 360 degrees recording in a 15 feet range. Meeting, lecture or simple discussion - all sounds are easily captured with HQ clarity.\n Resistant: 100% recycled aluminum casing. Sleek design that blends discreetly in the everyday setup.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 1.6 inch in length, and 1/4 inch in height, weighing only 0.5 oz nothing else on the market comes close with the discreet portability offered by TileRec.  \nTileRec is so slim and small than it can fit almost anywhere you can think of. It blends discreetly with everyday objects - in your pocket or wallet, between the pages of an agenda, on your desk or even on your child's backpack.\nTraditional voice recorders were bulky and uncomfortable, limiting day-to-day activities.   \nThe idea of a voice recorder so slim and thin that it can be used as a  personal assistant is to improve the daily productivity of its user. And is practically indestructible.\nYou can drop it, step on it, even run the car over and then resume recording. \nThe aluminum casing ensures complete protection for worry-free use.\nWhen you combine these benefits with excellent audio quality, you get a voice recorder that is perfect for lectures, interviews, meetings, and dictations too! \nMost smartphones have a built-in voice recorder app that you can use anytime, so they can do the \u2018work\u2019, but certainly are not built to be digital voice recorders. \nSmall, discreet and efficient, Tilerec is the latest voice recorder designed by ATTO DIGITAL, created to encompass the ideal balance between form and function. \nSo, what makes TileRec so superior to smartphones when it comes to recording?  \nTileRec is perfect for anyone that wants to work simpler, faster and better \u2013 without compromising quality. \nTileRec is recording Hi-Q MP3, using a 128 kbps bit rate. You can choose to set it to record in continuous mode or in voice-activated mode to capture sounds in a 15 feet range (360 degrees).\nIn voice-activated mode, the ultra-performant sensor of the microphone will initiate ad start recording only when sounds are detected in the range of the recorder (15 feet) thus avoiding recording long silent periods and saving memory time.\nThe built-in Li-Po 3.7 V battery (240 mAh) needs only 1.5 hours to fully charge (DC IN 5 V 500mA), even when connected to a computer and will be up and running for more than 24 hours.\nRecord the entire day then just plug & play all your recordings. \n*no additional software needed\n TileRec can also record while charging so you will not miss any information that matters to you.\nLet\u2019s get nostalgic for a hot second. Reflect on a childhood memory, recalling an exact time or event \u2014 what you were wearing, who you were with, the sights, smells, tastes. Try to remember how you felt, specific noises like, I don\u2019t know, shrilling crickets layered under siblings\u2019 laughter or, the sound of your mother's voice.\nIt\u2019s difficult, right? Unless the event was recorded, the memory is likely pretty hazy.  \nTileRec is designed to record your daily meetings, activities, and ideas in a non-intrusive way and carries our belief that \u201cwear-ability\u201d is the utmost goal in the design of everyday carry technology. \nYou live in a fast-paced world where TIME is MONEY and you are searching for the best tool to improve productivity and save time?  \n Here are  some situations  TileRec can help you with:  \nThe perfect solution for professional use\nLawyers may use them to take voice notes while preparing cases, while criminal investigators record digital notes in the field, and doctors use it to record important info about cases. If you make a living in one of these fields, you may find a portable voice recorder invaluable.  \nUsing a voice recorder has never been easier. \nSo why not take the leap into the digital era? Stop wasting time and paper trying to keep track of all the information. \nJust slide one button to record and enjoy the Tilerec experience.\nUse the USB cord to connect your TileRec to any computer and select the audio file you need to playback.  It's just that simple: \nPLAY\n\nCheck on Soundcloud the audio sample recorder with TileRec.\nThe Li-Po built-in battery of TileRec is re-chargeable for more than 1000 charging cycles. It takes only 1.5 hours to fully charge the battery, then it can record continuously or in voice-activated mode, for more than 24 hours. \nHave you ever wondered how much paper we use yearly? \nAmericans use 85,000,000 tons of paper a year; about 680 pounds per person. The average household throws away 13,000 separate pieces of paper each year. \nUsing TileRec for your daily notes and meetings saves time, effort and also 1 tree/ person/ year from becoming paper. \nAll this while increasing productivity, saving time and keeping all your information organized with time and date stamp!\n\n Find a reward that works for you and your family, office or team, there's something for everyone.  We are particularly excited to offer fast shipping in the US and EU.\n This is ATTO DIGITAL's  2nd product launched via crowdfunding.  We always deliver. We've learned a ton over our first Kickstarter, helping develop a good sense of our capabilities and timeline.\nThe satisfaction of our users is paramount!\nThat is why we want to make sure that when you enter the ATTO  family you feel the care and support.\nOur Customer Service team is  24/7 available to offer support in more than 5 languages. And because we really do believe in the manufacturing quality of our recorders, we offer lifetime warranty for TileRec.\nWe, the ATTO DIGITAL team, have more than 10 years of combined experience in designing, producing and selling sound recorders and surveillance equipment.\nDownload Press Kit \nOur mission and passion are to listen, so it is also paramount for us to listen to our customers' feedback to better understand how the ideal mini voice recorder should be. \n Our team is ready - so is the manufacturing - now we just need you! \nIt has been a long adventure. From brainstorming to product design, engineering, and branding, it has been a trying, monumental amount of time, conviction and expertise.\nIt has been a stressful, exciting and thrilling experience to design a product from scratch. We want you to be part of our experience! \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working non-stop the for last 3 years developing this product and we feel that the amount we are trying to raise is realistic with what is needed for fulfilling the project. We know that the Kickstarter journey is a long one and that there might be several surprises along the way - including foul weather, or maybe even (shock!) our phones running out of battery.\n\nUnfortunately, there are always risks involved in getting a product from the prototype phase to the market, but we have done everything possible to minimize these risks for our backers. Extensive planning has gone into the costs needed for raw materials, labor and shipping and we feel confident we will be able to meet our outlined delivery goals.\n\nOur biggest challenge is the timely delivery of all of our components. In order to keep TileRec at such a small size, parts must be assembled simultaneously, meaning if one shipment gets delayed, our entire process may get slowed down. Hopefully, everything goes according to plan, but if not, we have multiple suppliers for each component, always ready with a plan B!\n\nThe second biggest concern is quality control. While we are using the best manufacturer in China who was the previous supplier for one of the top international consumer electronic brands, we need to inspect each TileRec to guarantee 100% satisfaction. This dedication to detail is time-consuming, yet necessary to ensure a quality product.\n\nWe promise to keep all of our backers informed if anything happens or our timeline changes! If we encounter anything that might affect the product, its development, and/or shipping date, we will make sure to notify you about it with frequent updates. This project is our #1 priority and we will do everything we can to bring the TileRec to its full potential.\n\n_\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nThe TileRec has a rechargeable battery that lasts more than 1000 charging cycles.

With 15mm scale miniatures I could get in full sized games on a table roughly half the size!\nFor this Kickstarter I've molded up and cast a bunch of my favorite Rat-Men Sculpts and plan to add more as stretch goals as the campaign proceeds.\nThe initial Core Set includes 12 unique hand sculpted miniatures, cast in high quality resin. These include:\n 4x Gas Rats (2 with Gas Guns, 2 with Globes and Daggers), \n 3x Book Rats (Champion, Tome Bearer, and One with Staff and Sword)  \n 3x Spear Rats, \n 1x Sword Rat, \n 1x Mighty Ogre Rat,\n AND as a Bonus a Kickstarter Exclusive Halfling Miniature\n AND every Core Set comes with all the Stretch Goals Unlocked over the course of the Kickstarter Campaign.\nAll Models Supplied Unpainted,  The pictures here are of the finished models. (for pictures of rough sculpts and more check out my instagram )\nWhat is a 15mm Miniature?\nMost commonly 28mm scale is associated with fantasy miniatures, but fantasy miniatures can be found in many different scales.  So what determines the scale of a miniature?\nThe distance from the bottom of the feet to eye level of the miniature is often the value used when talking about it's scale.  In the example below is a 28 mm human miniature standing beside a 15mm Ratman miniature.\nMy Goal\nMy intentions behind this kickstarter are to use the funds generated to continue sculpting and producing highly detailed hand sculpted miniatures for hobbyists and miniature gamers alike.  By Backing this kickstarter you are helping ensure that I will have the tools and materials needed to continue to do so.\nStretch Goals\nADD-ONs\n This Kickstarter Campaign is using Backerkit to handle Reward Fulfillment and Add-Ons so that you can custom tailor your rewards to get exactly what you want for your pledge.  Additional Core Sets(including stretch goals), Add-Ons, and Individual Sculpts will be available for selection at the end of the campaign via the Backerkit Survey that will be sent to your email shortly after the campaign concludes. \nBackground\nI started Hand sculpting miniatures in 2014, making Character Figurines for my Friends Dungeons and Dragons Games.  My interest in old, out of production miniatures also encouraged me as the miniatures I was interested in collecting became harder to find.  Recently the discovery of wonderfully sculpted 15mm scale miniatures has been a huge inspiration and making these miniatures and games to go with them has become a passion of mine.\nCasting and Resin\nI've been molding and casting miniatures with silicone and resin for over a decade.  I use a durable Urethane Resin with high heat tolerance to cast my miniatures.  This resin, when cast, is easy to work with and provides excellent detailed castings that take paint well.   \nBefore painting your miniatures they should be washed to ensure that no mold release remains on the miniature.  You can do this with a small amount of dish detergent and warm water.  The mold release comes off easily and shouldn't cause any problems.  After washing and drying entirely the miniature must be primed with an Acrylic Polyurethane primer or other suitable primer for priming plastic miniatures.\nLive-Stream\nSince February 2017, I've had the pleasure of sharing my hobbies through live-streaming on my Twitch channel.  A huge amount of thanks go out to the people who come by on a regular basis with their encouragement and support.  If you want to come see how I sculpt and paint these miniatures stop by and say hi!\n https://www.twitch.tv/mallius \nThank-You For Your Support!\n --Gallery--\nShipping\nBacker rewards will be shipped between the months of July and September depending on the volume of miniatures that need to be produced.  This time frame is based on the production of 100 core sets, if more than 100 core sets are needed then rewards may need to be shipped in 3 month waves per additional 100 sets of miniatures.\nShipping information and fees will be collected through the pledge manager after the campaign has concluded.\nEstimated Shipping Fees (Fees in Canadian Dollars, large orders may be subject to additional shipping fees)\nCanada : $18 CAD (Includes Insurance and Tracking number)\nRest of the World: $12 CAD (Standard Air Mail. Insurance and Tracking Number Extra)\n CLICK HERE for a list of destinations I CAN'T ship to.  Backers who request their rewards to be shipped to these destinations will not have their rewards shipped.\nDisclaimer\nThese miniatures are not toys and not intended for children, they are very small and may pose a choking hazard.  The miniatures are supplied unpainted and may require some level of skill to achieve the results as seen in the painted examples.  If you have any questions feel free to contact me directly through this Kickstarter and i will gladly answer them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDelays may occur if additional materials are needed to complete the production of the miniatures.

Using your miniatures' plastic base and some green stuff (Kneedite Hobby Putty) it is easy to make fantastic sculpts like these!\nBasius enables you to easily enhance your armies and collections in awesome ways\nHow do I use BASIUS?\nBASIUS is quick and easy to use - All you need is:\nsome Green Stuff\na squirty bottle with tap water in it\na pair of hobby pliers\nan edged tool (we use a pound-shop clay sculpting tool)\nMix your Green Stuff into a ball, squirt water onto your pad, drop the Green stuff ball onto the pad and press onto it with your base, pull off the base using your pliers\nThen either trim and shape your edge right away using any edged tool (you don't need to use a sharp knife) or wait until it is dry to trim it.\nWatch the full video at the top of the page to see how easy it is to make a base! \nWHAT CAN I DO WITH BASIUS?\n\nBase 1000's of miniatures with stunning unique sculpting\nBy choosing a new spot on the pad each time you make a base, no two bases in your collection need ever be identical - and as each pad is double-sided you get twice as many options!\nAdd narrative to your collection\nBasius pads are chock-full of story telling elements that can add extra character to your miniatures\nUse ANY shape of base\nBasius works with any base material - even wood!\nMake HUGE bases\nYou can use Basius to sculpt texture for any size of base!\nMake flight sticks and thin models safe and secure\nBy using a thicker quantity of 'green stuff' to get a deeper sculpt, you can press & remove your flight stick or thin model foot in the sculpt before its dry to produce an exact slot to use once its painted.\nProduce your own spot scenery\nYou can make custom scenery elements easily by placing Green Stuff on the sticky side of tape.  Just push it into the pad and use a book or similar to press it flat, remove it & leave it to dry - easy!\nProduce your own Dungeon\nTaking the above one step further... it's entirely possible to use Basius to produce your own realm sections for Hero Questing & D&Ding, and we happen to know a brilliant team who make just the right kind of dungeon furniture to go with flooring like that...\nMagnetize your miniatures\n(A clever idea sent to us by a clever backer) By gluing a magnet to your base before applying your putty, you can stop your collections from falling over in your toolbox / drawer / carry container etc whilst having fantastic looking bases for your miniatures!\nand most importantly of all...\nMake your miniatures look really real\nHow many people charge around on the tips of unbent grass blades and unpressed leaves when they have a battle in a field?  How often would a real warrior stand on a bumpy or rocky area with only 1mm of his foot connecting with the floor, balancing like crazy whilst waving his gun and sword in the air? My guess is never - it just doesn't happen... so why would you want to model your miniatures like that?\nBasius is designed to enable you to press your miniatures feet into your texture at any point during the drying time of the putty, enabling you to get all kinds of realistic results. \nYou can sink your miniatures feet right in on muddy and plague ridden areas (and cut the feet off and push the ankles into water textures!).  You can press them in lightly on leaves and grass.  You can even press them onto rocky textures (very lightly!) to make it look like your miniatures feet are flexing to match the surface of the base (ok ok - this one may be an optical illusion as your miniature's sole does not really reshape, but it does look like it once its based this way).

All of these groups are well worth looking into and joining in with.\n... and of course - all our BRILLIANT BACKERS!\nNewbie Hints\nIn order to capture all the detail use a good sized blob of Green Stuff, wet the pad surface, drop the putty onto the texture and press into the Pad hard until the resin pad texture touches the plastic base, then pull it off. Most of the Green Stuff will then be overhanging the edges of your base - slice this off and use it on the next base you make. We also recommend using hobby pliers when pulling the base off the Pad and trimming the overhanging putty off to avoid fingerprints getting on your sculptures. How Do I Select The Pads I want?\nOnce the project ends there is a couple of weeks pause required by Kickstarter while funding is processed, then we will contact you to find out which pads you want. We will not be able to add items to this later on, so make sure you have pledged for what you want before the project ends.

You become a member of the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence (BPRD), ready to investigate occult threats that threaten our very existence. You will explore gothic locations, hunt down clues, discover artefacts, fight horrific creatures and face off against terrifying bosses.\nFor more details about the 'Box Full of Evil' click here.\nFor full details of what's included in the Darkness Calls expansion, click here.\n For full details of what's included in the Hellboy in Mexico expansion, click here.\nRESIN MINIATURES\nFor more details on the resin miniatures, please check here.\nDesigned by James M. Hewitt - the brains behind the likes of Blood Bowl 2016, Necromunda: Underhive, and Warhammer Quest: Silver Tower - Hellboy: The Board Game features incredibly detailed, pre-assembled PVC plastic miniatures that capture the unique look and feel of Mike Mignola\u2019s visionary work.    \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nHellboy: The Board Game gives you the chance to take control of an iconic member of the BPRD. Choose from Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Johann Kraus before equipping your agent with additional items that will help in the mission ahead. Each trinket, charm or weapon costs money though, so you\u2019ll need to spend wisely.    \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nEach of the missions in the core game begins by reading a BPRD Case File. This will set the scene for the investigation ahead and give hints about what threats you may encounter. The contents of each Case File are top secret, so the first time you play you'll have no idea what you're about to face!   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nDuring play, agents must carefully balance the Information Gathered track against the ominous Impending Doom track. Information Gathered represents the clues you uncover about the monster you\u2019re hunting, while the Impending Doom track marks how close humanity is to the brink of destruction.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nDo you spend valuable time investigating the scene to find a vital piece of the puzzle that could expose a crucial weakness of your foe, but risk the Impending Doom track reaching its devastating finale? Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required. See below regarding import duties and taxes.   \nWe currently estimate that the shipping costs for the pledges will be approximately:\nUK: \u00a39\nUSA: \u00a312\nEurope: \u00a312\nCanada: \u00a314\nAustralia/New Zealand: \u00a325\nRest of World: \u00a325\nAll add-ons outside the core pledges will have their shipping calculated and charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign has finished.\nPlease note, we are unable to ship to these countries: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nWe are dedicated to our retail partners worldwide therefore we are delighted to offer you a retail pledge for our new Kickstarter.    \nInformation about the Hellboy retailer pledge can be found here.\nHellboy\u2122 \u00a9 Mike Mignola. All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Rewards have changed since the beginning of the campaign because we reached stretch targets and added new rewards. This list includes my thoughts on which kits are the better value.\nFrom day one, Snatoms backers have requested more features. I am excited to deliver on all the things you've been asking for, announcing...\nHalf the size, not half the fun, MICROSNATOMS are my idea of the pro version of Snatoms. They make building bigger molecules possible, so it's only fair that this kit include more atoms and elements. \n3D Printed Prototype (Phosphorus Not Pictured)\nEach kit includes 26 hydrogen, 12 carbon, 12 oxygen, 4 nitrogen, 4 halogen, 2 sulphur and 2 phosphorus atoms. The kit will also include double and triple bonds if and when we reach our stretch goal. Let\u2019s get those bonds!! See the video in update #9 for a closer look at Microsnatoms.\nWe have a full-sized Snatoms EXPANSION kit! Each expansion kit includes: \n26 hydrogen \u2022 12 carbon \u2022 12 oxygen \u2022 4 nitrogen \u2022 4 halogen \u2022 2 sulphur \u2022 2 phosphorus \nPLUS this kit will automatically include double and triple bonds when we reach our stretch goal - I'm confident we'll get there.\nThis is my early prototype of what the double bonds may look like. The bonding objects will not be suitable for young children (choking hazard).\nSnatoms are a molecular modeling kit where the atoms snap together magnetically. Kits will include the three most important atoms for life: carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen to make glucose - the basic sugar molecule. \nThe Snatoms kit includes six carbon atoms, six oxygen atoms and twelve hydrogen atoms. From these basic building blocks you can build tons of different compounds from water and hydrogen peroxide through to cyclohexane and glucose.\nSnatoms allows people of all ages to learn chemistry hands on. By supporting Snatoms, you'll be funding the production of the best molecular modeling kit from start to finish. If you agree that this is an awesome educational tool that should exist in the world, help me kickstart it and tell your friends! \nYou all have BLOWN past our funding goal! I'm amazed and grateful. I've read your stretch goal suggestions and have taken your awesome ideas into consideration. Behold. Your stretch goals. Let's get that nitrogen!\nSnatoms are an improvement over traditional ball and stick sets for three reasons:\nThe model is more realistic (it doesn\u2019t require sticks as bonds) \nIt's quicker and easier to construct and break apart molecules \nYou can feel the attraction between atoms \nThe H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) shows that single bonds rotate easily just as they do in nature, which is hard with ball and stick kits.\nI have designed and built prototype Snatoms over the past two years. They will be made of high grade injection-molded plastic and contain super-strong spherical neodymium magnets.\nSnatoms: Foam and 3-D printed prototypes\nAs a teacher I have always wanted to convey some important concepts about atomic bonding. Snatoms allow me to do that like no other modeling kit. Here\u2019s why:\nBonds do NOT store energy! One of the most persistent misconceptions is that energy is stored in bonds. Atoms release energy when they bond - and this is why they stay stuck - you have to put in energy to separate them. No kit currently demonstrates this like Snatoms does.\nBonds are the overlapping of electron orbitals. Previously it has not been possible to represent this in a realistic way (hence sticks representing bonds), but now we can. Snatoms provide a more realistic depiction of molecules. \nAs a teaching aid, Snatoms will make building molecules fast. As a teacher I know speed is everything. Models have to be ready to go and be manipulated on the fly. Snatoms make learning about atoms and molecules fun!\nI'm Derek, the creator of Veritasium, a YouTube channel about science with over 3 million subscribers and 220 million views.

A city of beauty and unspeakable horror. A city built for the Old One Kraal. Unearth bizarre technologies and creatures not of this world. Delve deep into Namaset's twisted history, and make its future.\nMark of the Old Ones Chapter 1: The Overseer\nMark of the Old Ones tells the harrowing story of Thomas Lyle. While soaring above the Brooks Mountain Range on the North Slope of Alaska, disaster strikes. His plane is grounded. His pilot killed. His legs mangled.\nDauntless, Thomas drags himself from the wrecked carapace of his single-engine surveyor's plane. Drawing on his experience from World War I, he ties off the stump of his bleeding right leg. Knowing the cold of Alaska will kill as sure as any wound, he seeks shelter in the foreboding mouth of a nearby cave.\nDrawn forward by evidence of habitation, Thomas crawls farther into the cave. Skylight fades behind him. The grainy texture of loose dirt is suddenly replaced by a smooth and cool surface. The hair on his neck and arms stands on end as he advances across the exotic surface. Startled, he turns toward a slithering sound, then whips back as he hears it again behind him.\nThe first searing pain shoots through his spine as he feels himself paralyzed. A puncture at the base of his skull follows, and his pain dissipates in a cool wave. With fading vision, Thomas watches chitinous tentacles surround him as he welcomes unconsciousness.\nWhile Thomas is the star of Mark of the Old Ones, two characters support his narrative. The first you've heard in our video: Kaya.\nKaya descends from cultists who fled Namaset as it starved to death. Raised by her father to revere Kraal even from exile, Kaya dreams of once again rebuilding her people. Her visions of Thomas serve as the framing device for the game's events.\nDr. Charles Wentworth offers the distinct 19th century viewpoint of a true Lovecraftian hero. He speaks to Thomas (and the player) through the numerous journal fragments he left during his 1850's exploration of Namaset, then in decline. Where Kaya sees grandeur and divinity, Dr. Wentworth sees only a barbarous sect with baffling customs.\nJust for flavor, here is one of Wentworth's journal entries from early in the game:\nThis is the log of Dr. Charles Wentworth, late of Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nI hope that this account finds you in a comfortable reading room at Miskatonic Library, where I will file it upon my return from Russian America. While I give little credence to the native superstitions regarding this mountain, and I fully expect to safely emerge with reports of the tribe dwelling within, I will leave behind carbon copies of my journal entries in case I am met with accident or misfortune. I pray that you are not piecing together my words from those scattered facsimiles.\nThis is the kind of game that we want to play and we hope that you will love it too.  It focuses on a few core game mechanics for you to master; use them as you conquer a challenging world of 2d physics puzzles and harrowing boss fights.  You are going to experience a deep, multi-layered story that stays true to HP Lovecraft and that encourages you to explore, discover, and unwind the lore and dark secrets of Namaset. \nOur intention is to make Mark of the Old Ones horrifying without being horrific.  For example, in good Lovecraft fashion, we don't show you a guy getting his face ripped off by ancient demons, but, in the next room over, you really think that you can hear...\nMetroidvania\nMark of the Old Ones will have multiple pathways through the game.  We hope that you will want to explore all of the paths to collect upgrades for your abilities, and to unearth the full story of Namaset.  Spoiler alert: when you enter Namaset, it is very much a sleeping city.  As you progress through the game you awaken the city, and the terrors that dwell within.  The way we are designing the levels is going to give you a different playing experience as you do your Metroidvania backtracking: as you awaken Namaset, the environment will attack, puzzle, and challenge you in new ways.\nCore Mechanics\nTentacle Arms\nAt its core, MotOO is about a unique and coherent movement mechanism. Thomas\u2019 tentacles provide a totally unique way to experience an environment, evoking novel feelings of strength, momentum, and power. Basic movement has a relaxing rhythm that quickly feels natural, but gracefully navigating a dynamic environment challenges preconceptions of character movement. Thomas doesn\u2019t swing like Spider-Man; Thomas moves like the eldritch abomination he has become.\nBehind the scenes, these arms are using real time multi-threaded dynamic IK, solving at 720 ticks/second. Thanks to MotOO\u2019s physics-first design, the tentacles are \u201creal\u201d in a way we typically don\u2019t see in games. The tentacles can interact fully with the world: grasping, manipulating, and throwing objects. While alien in form, players easily interact with the world as motion planning and inverse kinematics algorithms map intuitive control inputs into coordinated movement.\nBoost\nThe boost gives you a sharp vertical thrust.   You will have a limited number of boosts that you can use before you must refill your reservoir.  You can upgrade the size of your reservoir.\nChronition\nChronition slows time and zooms the camera out so you can see more of what is around you.  It's excellent for scouting out the obstacles ahead.  You've got a freakish parasite dug into your spine, but, at least it comes with a few perks!  You will be able to upgrade the amount of time you can use chronition before you have to let it recharge.\nIncrease Mass\nYou are wrapped in a protective shell and you get more massive.  Getting heavier lets you smash into things with more force and affect physics obstacles.  For example, as you are landing on a trampoline you hold the increase mass button, when it's fully compressed you let go and get maximum bounce.  We can also use it in physics puzzles, i.e. something is being held in place by a magnet, you aren't strong enough to pull it free, the extra mass gives you the additional force that you need.  This ability will also protect you from certain environmental hazards.  At the moment, we are not quite sure what aspects of this will be up-gradable. \nKey Personnel\nThere are currently 8 core-team members doing pre-production on MotOO.  If we reach our funding goal, the team will ramp up in size as we enter production.  We expect the full team size to be 11 individuals (adding: 1 environment artist, 1 character artist, and 1 QA tester).\nHere is the team so far:\nJordan Brock  @justtactics\nPresident / Producer.  Jordan wears many hats.  But, basically his job is to make sure that the office is always stocked with coffee.\nAubrey R. Jones  @aubrey_r_jones\nDirector / Programmer.  Between all of the IK algorithms, differential equations, and vorton fluid simulations, no one knows what this guy is doing.  Aubrey is smart.\nJustin Juner  @jmjuner\nLevel Designer.  Justin was our QA lead on Just Tactics, but he is a mad scientist, so now he is our level designer. \nOleg Danilchenko\nCharacter Artist.  Oleg loves anime, bad movies that \"look awesome,\" being awful at League of Legends, and blasting dubstep out of his car at 120 decibels. \nChristian Plummer\nProgrammer.  Christian is a habitual 'game jammer.'  He is also a fire extinguisher and fire safety expert...\nDave DeLizza\nMusic and Sound Design.  Dave is willing to smash, drop into a food processor, or drive over anything with his car if it will create a cool sound effect. \nCarol Do\n2D Artist.  Carol put \"guild leader\" on her resume.  You're hired.\nHenry Alex Martin  @Imjustsomeguy55\nEnvironment Artist.  Alex is a burrito connoisseur.  And he's a master of karate and friendship.  But, really, his work gives us the goosebumps:\nIn addition to the core team, there will be people doing bits of work here and there; which includes our cast of characters.  We have cast one role so far:\nStephanie Yuhas Conant  @stephanieyuhas\nas Kaya, a leader of the ancient cult of Kraal.  Stephanie is one of the stars of the Cinevore Studios series \"Nerd vs. Geek.\"  Stephanie has appeared in \"Limit Break,\" \"OverAnalyzers,\" \"Living in 8-Bits,\" \"The Game Chasers\" and \"Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie.\"  And she appreciates good onigiri.  \nSoftology\nGet Gosu - Aubrey and Jordan worked on 'Get Gosu' together.  Get Gosu was an online tournament hosting platform.  It facilitated the running of fully automated CS 1.6, CSS, and TF2 tournaments.  Get Gosu required an extensive amount of modding to the Valve games that were offered.  Ultimately, the platform was abandoned for the simple fact that the high level of competition attracted an inordinate number of cheaters, and no amount of anti-cheat measures can stop cheating where code is being executed on an un-trusted platform (the end-user's PC). \nJust Tactics - Most of the core team doing pre-production on MotOO has worked together before.  Jordan, Aubrey, Oleg, Christian, Dave and Justin all worked on Just Tactics together.  We leveraged the networking and matchmaking knowledge that we picked up from Get Gosu to deliver an online multiplayer turn-based strategy game that features a unique teleporter-based movement mechanic.  Given that Just Tactics was built on a shoe string budget, it turned out quite well.  The game is exactly what we set out to build, however, it doesn't have a single player mode.  The game is pretty complicated/strategically-hardcore and the lack of single player makes it daunting to learn how to play.  In retrospect, not developing single player was a pretty big mistake, but we learned, oh we learned.\n'AAA Quality' -  Although we have not worked on \"AAA\" titles, we do appreciate the level of quality that is required of MotOO in order for it to be a successful game.  Through Just Tactics, we have demonstrated our team's ability to develop 3D games.  Aubrey's previous experience at LightningGaming, where he wrote code for slot machines and electronic poker tables, demonstrates his ability to deliver code that passes extremely rigorous quality assurance testing.  Additionally, Justin's three years at Intertek as a QA lead means we will not release anything that is not amazing.  Knock on wood.  \nStretch Goals, Budget, and Episodic Content:\nInitial Goal -- $225,000 Chapter 1: The Overseer\nStretch goal --  $550,000 Chapter 2: The Blacksmith\nStretch goal -- $875,000 Chapter 3: The High Priest\nStretch goal -- $1,200,000 Chapter 4: Kraal\nStretch goal -- Stretch goals beyond $1,200,000 will be for localization in many languages and PlayStation 4 support.  We have already pitched MotOO to Sony and they said: \"it's on like Donkey Kong.\"  Well, they didn't actually say that, DK is a Nintendo property, but I'm sure that's what they were thinking.  They said yes.\nNo doubt, some people will be asking \"why is there episodic content? That sounds dumb.\"  Here is the answer:\nWe could have not mentioned the episodic content at all, we could have just said: \"our goal is $225,000 and we are going to give you a great game with a couple hours of game play.\"  But, we really don't like it when we see Kickstarter campaigns that are not up front about their stretch goals, then when they post them, they sometimes seem unplanned.  We see stretch goals that we know are going to blow the project way out of scope and make it impossible to deliver (i.e, \"for $5,000 more, we will add online multiplayer and online co-op\"...uh, sure).  We are just being up front.  We've been doing pre-production on MotOO for awhile now, and  we have a much larger vision, and much more story to tell than we can possibly pack into a few hours of game play.  We want to make all of the Chapters, and we've got it all planned out.  Say you make the minimum $10 pledge and we only hit our initial target, you are still going to get a game well worth your $10.  If we reach some stretch goals, you are going to get a ton more content, and for $10 it will be quite a steal!  We just want you to know we have this planned, we are not going to be scrambling to invent stretch goals in the middle of this campaign. \nSo why did we choose to do episodic at all?  Why not make the target $1,200,000 and never mention Chapters at all?\nHonestly, it's a bit of apprehension on our part.  We are a relatively unknown indie studio.  Raising that much money sounds daunting.  If we can raise $225,000 and people see how awesome Chapter 1 turns out, we can fund Chapter 2 via the revenue it generates, and or private investment, and or another Kickstarter campaign.  Breaking it up just seems more doable. Crawl before you run.  Another mild benefit of episodic content is that instead of waiting a full 2.5 years for the game, you only have to wait 1 year for Chapter 1, and then you will get more content every 6 months after that. \nWhy do you need all of this money?\nA lot of indie developers work regular 9-5 jobs and, fueled by passion, make their games on nights and weekends. We are not working on MotOO on just nights and weekends. MotOO is our full time 9-5 job, and, fueled by passion, we also work on MotOO nights and weekends. Because we are putting ALL of our time and energy into MotOO, you are going to get an awesome game. And that's why we need the money, to pay ourselves, so we can eat and live. We also have to pay for rent, insurance, middleware licenses, tools, and of course, coffee. There are 8 of us on the team now, there will be 11 of us when we are in full production. Subtract Amazon's and Kickstarter's cuts, subtract the aforementioned costs, and there is not much left to split between the 11 of us. Luckily, we already have some funding from private investors, but we still need this $225,000 to give us a full year to build Chapter 1 of MotOO.  We are lean and mean, I don't think anyone will accuse us of having \"a bloated AAA budget.\"  \nWe could get day jobs, ask for less money, and work on MotOO remotely on nights and weekends. The result will be that the game will take much longer to make, and it will not be nearly as good as it could have been. So, what it really boils down to, is that we are asking you to give us the opportunity to fully dedicate ourselves to this game, and really make it the best game possible.  \nSummary: Lean and mean + ALL of our time and effort = MotOO is going to rock.\nRewards Chart\n\nTry the Demo\nPlease feel free to try out the core game mechanics demo for yourself.\nYou can grab it at:  http://markoftheoldones.com/\nDisclaimers:\n1.  You need a dual analogue controller to play.  \n2.  What you are looking at is not art.  It's basically just debug lines. \n3.  This is a pre-production build, it's likely that it will not run on every computer.  We have not done thorough QA testing.  In a year, when the game is done and we have gone through QA, it will work.  \n5.  Let's please not do troubleshooting in the comments section.  Please send an email to info@htssoft.com or tweet to @htssoft. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a solid team. We have been together for awhile and work well together. We don't work remotely, we are all here in the office, so we have good communication. We all totally believe in the project, the art, story, and game play, and we all love Lovecraft. The hardest technical bits are already done, mainly the IK system (which we will continue to polish), so we've already done the heavy lifting. \n\nDespite all that, there are risks. We are a small team. If something unexpectedly happens to any one of us, our progress will be hampered while we find a new team member and bring them up to speed on the project. \n \nAs with any company, a big concern is having the capital to sustain business operations. Our solution to that is this Kickstarter campaign. We are taking to Kickstarter for funding because we would prefer to stay \"indie.\" We are also taking to Kickstarter because we want to build and engage with MotOO's community from as early on in the development process as possible. That is why we feel comfortable coming to you with a wire-frame demo, and not a full \"vertical slice\" of what the final 3D game will look like. We wanted to share our game play mechanics and ideas for the game with you as soon as possible. Doing this is also mitigating a risk, the risk that we spend a lot of time and money developing MotOO \"in secret\" and, when we finally show it to you guys, we discover that no one likes it. We are going to execute our vision for the game, we cannot listen to every piece of feedback that we get, we have to maintain \"artistic integrity\" (otherwise we might as well have a publisher). So, a challenge is balancing listening to and integrating your feedback, while still executing our vision.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Hit the Sticks\n2 created \u00b7 5 backed\nHit the Sticks is a tightly knit team of software engineers and digital artists.

Spark can make your life simpler, more streamlined and \u2014 just maybe \u2014 a little more fun.\nHere are some of the great things that Spark can do:\nTurn on your lights before entering a dark house\nUse your bedroom lights as a \"sunrise\" alarm clock, slowly fading on over 10 minutes to help you wake up naturally\nTurn off every light in the house with a push of a single button\nDim the living room lights when you're watching TV or eating dinner\nTurn your lights on and off while you're on vacation so it looks like someone's home\nFlash your lights to let you know that you've received a new email or text message\nAutomatically dim your lights when it's bright outside to save energy\nSpark sets up in minutes over Wi-Fi and is easy to use, easy to install, and just plain simple. And the \"enlightenment\" of your home (pun fully intended) will not end there. Spark has a software development platform that will allow people to create apps for Spark. The possibilities for Spark are endless.\nThe Spark Socket is a sleek device that sits between a dimmable light bulb (incandescent, dimmable CFL, or dimmable LED) and a standard light fixture. It connects to the internet over Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n), so as long as you already have a Wi-Fi router, there's no need for any additional hardware besides your Spark Socket. How many people does it take to screw in a Spark-powered lightbulb? Just one.\nUsing Spark is just as easy as installing it. The attached light bulb can be controlled or programmed using an iPhone, Android smartphone or your home computer by logging into our website or using our native mobile apps.\nSpark's most basic use is as a portable light switch, but it can do so much more. After all, we already have The Clapper for those times when we don't want to get off the couch. \nWhat makes Spark really powerful is our open, RESTful API that allows any software developer to create apps that can interact with your lights. This means that any app on your phone, on your computer, or on the web can be connected to your lights. Your lights could change based on the weather, based on how far you are from home, or based on your Twitter feed.\nFor the techy folks out there, here's an example of one of our API calls:\nThis may look like gibberish to most of you, but the important point is that it's easy to create great apps with Spark. Want to know more about our API? Get more info here.\nThis isn't just about lights. The Internet of Things is coming, and it's being driven by hardware start-ups, many of which were funded right here on Kickstarter. We're partnering with as many of these companies as possible to create an ecosystem of products that work together through open standards and collaboration.\nSo far we've partnered with Twine, so that you can use sensors around your home to control your lights (see Update #1), and Pebble, so that you can control your lights from your watch, without even taking out your phone (see Update #4). We've got more partnerships coming, so stay tuned!\nSome of the Spark's abilities wouldn't be out of place in The Jetsons' futuristic home, but unlike George Jetson's flying car, Spark is already working and is only months away from arriving at your doorstep. We already have a working prototype that can be operated from our website; also, check out the video of Spark in action at the top of this page.\nSpark has been developed over the course of the last year from a very basic concept using an Arduino and an LED all the way to a fully functioning prototype of the final product. Check out our progress:\nSpark (formerly known as SWITCH): First Prototype (January 29, 2012)\nSpark (formerly known as SWITCH): Second Prototype (March 27, 2012)\nSpark (formerly known as SWITCH): Third Prototype (June 28, 2012)\nSpark: Fourth Prototype (November 2, 2012)\nWe need your help in three important ways:\nBack our campaign! Of course, in typical Kickstarter fashion, backers will earn various rewards depending on the size of their contribution. Pledge levels are detailed in the right-hand column.\nSend us ideas!

If you have feedback, questions or ideas, we would love to hear from you!\nThank you to the amazing people who have devoted their time and energy to making this product a reality. If you count the many wonderful people who gave me some quick advice over the phone (each of whom I am grateful to), the number of contributors would be in the hundreds. A special thank you to those who truly went above and beyond with their contributions:\nStephanie Rich (community management); Zac Crockett (software development); Tim MacGuidwin (supply chain); Jordan Husney (advisor); Jay Schrankler (advisor); Betsy Ziegler (advisor); Jordan Dalton (advisor); Justin Grammens (advisor); Scott Herbst at Herbst Produkt (industrial design); Bill Drislane and Scott Miller at Dragon Innovation (supply chain); Jim Meyer, Joe Tretter, and Glen Schlegel at North Pole Engineering (electrical engineering); Paul Detjen (video production); Sean Martin (animations); Chris Reynolds (script writing); Andy Timko (Kickstarter preparation); Keith Schreer (software development); Ryan Scherf (UI design); Ilya Mikhelson (electrical engineering); Greer Karlis, Gaby Berger, Kevin Alley and Dan Farkas (video cast); Jess Porter, Jafar Owainati, Nilam Shah, and Ben Bonnet, who helped me write the original business plan; Brian Vaughn, Aaron Gough, and Vikas Checker for helping me revise it; the great folks at The Mill, CoCo, and 1871 (the various co-working spaces we have used), my parents for their inspiration and support, and my fiancee Ashley Soloff and her family for supporting me and putting up with me when all I do is work.\nFAQ\nWill Spark work in my home? Three things must be true for Spark to work for you:\nFirst, you must have Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n) wireless internet in your home.\nSecond, you must have a light fixture that takes medium-sized Edison screw bulbs (E27 in the US, E26 abroad), or as most people call them here in the U.S., \"standard light bulbs\". If you are anywhere in the world other than the UK, Australia, or New Zealand (where bayonet-style fixtures are common), you're probably good here.\nThird, you must use a dimmable bulb. This includes any incandescent bulb, any CFL bulb that is labeled \"dimmable\", and any LED bulb that is labeled \"dimmable\". Most LED bulbs for residential lighting are dimmable; in contrast, most CFL bulbs are not dimmable, so please check the packaging before using a bulb with a Spark Socket. If you're concerned about what bulbs to use, we'll be making bulbs that pair well with Spark available for sale on our website, and we will keep a running list of all the bulbs that we have successfully tested with the Spark Socket.\nWhat is the range of the Spark Socket Wi-Fi? The range of the Spark Socket is comparable to the range on a smartphone (100-300 feet, depending on the home). In other words, if you have a Wi-Fi connection on your smartphone from a particular spot in your house, the Spark Socket should work fine there. If you need more Wi-Fi coverage in your home, there are plenty of Wi-Fi range extenders available.\nWill the Spark Socket fit in my lamp or light fixture? The Spark Socket fits in most lamps and light fixtures without issue. The Spark Socket is 54mm wide at its widest point (a little more than 2\"), and adds 32mm to the height of your bulb (about 1.25\"), so you can check your light fixtures and lamps to be sure. If the Spark Socket won't fit in your fixture with a normal bulb, we'll be selling smaller bulbs on our website, as well as \"lamp harp extenders\" that can give you a little more clearance for lamps that use lamp harps.\nDo I have to pay anything for Spark service or Spark apps? Our software and apps are free! However, developers who create Spark apps may choose to charge for them, by selling their apps through the iPhone App Store, Google Play, or on their own websites.\nWill I still be able to use my regular light switch? Yes! A quick toggle of your lights (turning them off and then on again) will either turn your lights on or off, while keeping the Spark Socket powered up and letting you still control your lights through Spark. Also if you want to deactivate the Spark Socket for normal control through the light switch, you'll be able to do so without uninstalling it.\nWhat happens if the internet goes down? You'll always be able to control your lights from the light switch. We're also working on a back-up system that uses local communications when the internet is down.\nWhat if I want more than one Spark Socket? If our Kickstarter project is successful, we will provide our Kickstarter backers an opportunity to expand their orders as we approach our delivery date.\nIn what countries will Spark work? The short answer is that it will work everywhere. However, Spark will initially be certified only in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. If you'd like to see Spark in other countries, please contact us and let us know!\nWhere shouldn't I use Spark? Spark Sockets should not be used with bulbs greater than 100W when facing up (like in a lamp) or 60W when facing down (like in a recessed light fixture). Spark Sockets should not be used outdoors.\nWhat will the Kickstarter funding be used for? If we can reach our target of $250,000, the money will be used for the following purposes:\nManufacturing: First and foremost, the majority of the money that we receive in our Kickstarter campaign will go directly to paying our manufacturing partner to make and deliver the Spark Sockets.\nTooling: The biggest up-front development costs are tooling costs for the plastic parts. This basically involves paying an extremely skilled engineer to make a \"tool\" out of very hard metal that can be used as a mold for the plastic parts.\nCertification: A product of this nature must be certified by the FCC (and equivalent international bodies) for RF emissions, and UL (and equivalent international bodies) for safety. Safety and reliability are paramount for a product like this, and we'll go through the rigorous testing to ensure a high-quality product.\nWho are you guys, anyway? We're a team of engineers, designers, and creatives who wanted to create something new and exciting. Many people have been involved in various ways, but the core team is as follows:\nZach Supalla. Built the first four Spark prototypes using Arduino, Node.js, and a soldering iron with a steady hand. Worked in operations and product development at McKinsey & Co. Loves gadgets, coffee, arcade games, tinkering, and his dog Hunter.\nZac Crockett. Making Spark a secure, reliable, and scalable software platform. Professional software developer for 10 years. Has a Ph.D in music composition, and bikes everywhere when his leg isn't broken. Ask him about his earworms.\nStephanie Rich. Spends every day thinking about you, our community of users and supporters. Worked in international sales and marketing in the film industry. Wrote a book about her grandfather where she re-traced his steps through Europe and re-took his old pictures eighty years later. \nWhat is the current state of the prototype? Our current prototype that is featured in the video and pictures is both fully functional and a good approximation of the appearance of the manufactured product. The shell of the prototype is an SLA model that has been painted to look like the final product; if you look closely in the pictures and the videos you will see some scratches and imperfections from the sanding and the painting. The finished product will be injection molded plastic. As for the electronics, the PCB in the prototype was manufactured at a quick-turn PCB house in the U.S. and the components were hand-soldered onto the board by Zach and his trusty sparkfun tweezers. The final boards will be mass-manufactured using pick-and-place technology. The circuitry will likely go through a couple of rounds of revisions to optimize the design, but the functionality will be the same as today.\nWho did your video? We worked with a dear friend of Zach's, Paul Detjen of PCD Productions. He's awesome, go check him out if you need video support. Also amazing is Sean Martin, our animator - he did 2D work for us but is equally talented in 3D.\nWhat happens if I plug one Spark Socket into another Spark Socket? You will tear a hole in the fabric of space and time. Or something like that. Don't do it, anyway.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Mass manufacturing isn't the same as prototype development; besides making our products work, we have to make sure they're safe and reliable, and that they can be manufactured cost-effectively in large quantities. We also have to go through expensive processes like tooling development and certification.\n\nLuckily, we're working with the right people. Our team includes a number of experts, including Dragon Innovation, a manufacturing consultancy that has supported great products like MakerBot, Sphero, and Pebble. Dragon's experience in factory selection, sourcing, and quality assurance will be instrumental to Spark's success.\n\nWe're also working with North Pole Engineering, an electrical engineering firm in Minneapolis with extensive experience in Wi-Fi communications and embedded systems design.

Each faction has around 20 little plastic figures, in 5 different shapes. For instance, the Black Goat faction has cultists, ghouls, fungi from Yuggoth, dark young, and Shub-Niggurath for its units.\n\nWe're currently working on the art, going through more vigorous play testing, and are getting close to a final prototype.\nWe have big plans for this game and really want to make something the fans of H.P Lovecraft, and strategy games are going to be excited about.\n\nWe hope to see your support again for the board game.\nFollow us at CthulhuWorldCombat.com for upcoming news on the board game!\n\nThanks,\nSandy Petersen and the Team!\nWe've listened to your outcry!

We want to provide an opportunity for as many fans to be able to enjoy the game as possible.\nHere's a link to our official update page, feel free to leave comments. We want to make this game the best that it can be, your feedback is important to us!\nCthulhu World Combat Updates\n\u201cCthulhu Still Lives \u2026\u201d   H. P. Lovecraft\n\nMore than a half-century ago, Howard Phillips Lovecraft changed the face of the horror genre forever. Since then, Lovecraft\u2019s works have influenced or inspired every modern horror writer as well as hundreds of horror films, from Alien to In the Mouth of Madness to Hellboy. His most famous creation is the Cthulhu Mythos, a cosmos filled with alien and interdimensional horrors. Lovecraft encouraged other authors to use the Mythos in their own writings, and it has spread like a fungal growth, inspiring books, comics, movies,      and of course, games. \nIn the Mythos, a terrifying variety of alien entities, species, and even gods are constantly threatening humanity\u2019s existence. But humanity is not seen by these beings as an enemy \u2013 more of an irrelevance. These alien horrors do not even always obey the natural laws of our universe, and have inconceivable powers. To our perception, they seem foul and horrible, but their actual motivations are unthinkable.  \n\nInspired by this work, Sandy Petersen got his start in gaming by developing a tabletop roleplaying game based on the Cthulhu Mythos. This game was named Call of Cthulhu after one of Lovecraft\u2019s stories and has proved a cult success over the years. His upcoming game, Cthulhu World Combat,           is the next chapter in this beloved mythos.\n\nWith your help, we hope to expand the game to other platforms someday,   and this process will be greatly accelerated if we meet the appropriate   stretch goals. \nToday, our mission is to create a great strategy/horror game for the iOS system (iPad/iPhone) that Lovecraft himself would be proud to play.     Cthulhu World Combat is the first Cthulhu Mythos product in which YOU play as one of these alien gods yourself. The game takes place after the Old Ones have returned to the Earth. You strive to occupy the world for yourself, and compete with the other forces of destruction A.K.A. your friends.        Only one can control the ruins of Earth in the end.\n    \nLike the Cthulhu Mythos, turn-based strategy gaming has survived the test of time. From Empire to Civilization to Heroes of Might and Magic, we have enjoyed these games. The idea behind Cthulhu World Combat is to take this basic game system and apply it to the Cthulhu Mythos. In terms of gameplay, Cthulhu World Combat probably resembles the Nintendo product Advance Wars more than any other game, but, predictably, Sandy Petersen\u2019s twisted mind has added some significant innovations. \nIf you are not familiar with Advance Wars, it is a top-down turn-based strategy game in which the players produce aircraft, tanks, and ships and then try to destroy their enemies and capture their base. The most obvious difference in Cthulhu World Combat is that you are producing monsters, cultists, and other such creatures instead of mechanized weapons. In Advance Wars, all factions have access to the same weapons. But in Cthulhu World Combat, each faction has its own loyal monsters unique to it.\nCthulhu World Combat is a multiplayer game, though it also supports singleplayer. Turns are short, lasting only a few minutes at the most, so you can take a short break to play a turn at any time during the day or night. You can have many games going on at once, as with other turn-based iOS games such as Words With Friends.\nBehind every great project, there is a talented team driven by a shared dream. Our dream started over 30 years ago, when Sandy got his start in the game industry in the early 1980s, where he first designed paper roleplaying games. His best-known work from that time is the cult game Call of Cthulhu, which has been translated into many languages and is still played world-wide. He also worked on many other roleplaying projects, such as Runequest and Elfquest, and was instrumental in the creation of dozens of supplements and game aids.\n \nIn 1988, he left paper games for the computer game world. He has worked for Microprose, id Software, and Ensemble Studios, where he was involved with Civilization, Doom, Quake, and the Age of Empire series, among others.\nEventually Sandy partnered with the techno-whiz Drew Fisher of Barking\nLizards Technologies, with the shared goal to unite his design lore with the\nconvenience of mobile gaming. With Barking Lizards' expertise, Cthulhu World Combat will not only be a terrific social game, but will be easy and fun to play with modern hand-held systems.\nWith the support of a core team of industry veterans, Sandy\u2019s passion for   both digital gaming and Lovecraft will be combined in their dream project \u2013 Cthulhu World Combat.\n\nThis team has a proven track record, and our members\u2019 games have sold tens of millions of copies worldwide, and has received dozens of awards from the game industry.\nBoard Games, Roleplaying Games, & Film:\nThe Whisperer in Darkness film \\ Petersen\u2019s Guide to Creatures of the Dreamlands \\ Petersen\u2019s Guide to Monsters \\ Arkham Horror \\ Ghostbusters roleplaying game \\ RuneQuest 3rd edition \\ Elfquest roleplaying game \\ Call of Cthulhu \\ Over 30 paper game supplements and products from 1981-1988\n\nVideo Games:\nAge of Empires 3 \\ Halo Wars \\ Quake \\ Age of Mythology \\ Rise of Rome \\ SiN \\ LUXOR \\ Doom \\ Tony Hawk 1 N64 \\ Doom 2 \\ X-Men  Legends 1 \\ Symbian \\ Civilization \\ Age of Empires 2 \\ Dr. Floyd\u2019s Desktop Toys \\ Star Trek Elite Force II \\ The Titans \\ Sid Meier\u2019s Pirates    The Conquerors \\ Sponge Bob PSP, PS2 \\ Spiderman N64 \\ Hexen \\ Heavy Metal F.A.K.K. 2 \\ Elder Scrolls Oblivion \\ J2ME, Brew \\ Duke Nukem 3D \\ Snakes 2 NGI Symbian \\ Lightspeed \\ X-Men Legends 2  Symbian \\ CounterStrike CZ / Xbox \\ C & C 10th Edition PC \\ SiN Episodes \\ Activision Anthology PS2, PC \\ Fallen Shadows \\ Darklands \\ The Bank iOS \\ Osiris Legends iOS \\ Command HQ \\ Super Collapse! 3 DS \\ Girlz Really Rock DS \\ Monster Truck Madness N64 \\ Fox Motocross J2ME, Brew \\ El Tigre DS \\ Blair Witch \\ Hyperspeed     \\ Sword of the Samurai \\ Midnight Mysteries \\ Shrek 2 Mobile J2ME \\ The War Chiefs \\ Spiderman 2 Japan-PSP \\ Bratz Diamonds DS, GBA \\ Zoey 101 DS, GBA \\ Marvel Ultimate Alliance GBA \\ Create DSiWare \\ Bratz Babies GBA \\ Muhammad Ali J2ME, Brew \\ Tony Hawk 2 N64 \\ Bratz 4 Real DS \\ Rock University PS2,Wii,PC \\ 25 to Life \\ Bob Esponja PSP \\ Bratz Diamonds DS\nPart of what makes this project and team so special is that Tom Sullivan has signed on to help!\n\nThose of you who remember the old Call of Cthulhu game and its supplements should be well aware of the terrific art of Tom Sullivan. He illustrated products from Shadows of Yog-Sothoth to Petersen\u2019s Field Guide to Monsters. He is THE definitive artist to illustrate the Mythos and its horrors. He has worked on many projects, including a majority of the effects created for the cult films The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, plus he did significant work on Army of Darkness. Those who purchased the Special Edition of the Evil Dead DVD received a copy of Tom\u2019s great Necronomicon tome, complete with illustrations.\n\nIn Cthulhu World Combat, Tom will be illustrating all-new visuals for the game. His illustrations will be design inspiration, and also be used as Kickstarter prizes. Also, Tom will be hand-crafting an all-new Necronomicon tome, which will house various Lovecraftian writings plus include a light strategy guide to the game, a behind-the-scenes look at the game\u2019s making, and unique art from the creative team. Who knows, there might even be a surprise or two from Great Cthulhu himself!\nThe Necronomicon tome will be included as a downloadable PDF for some of the reward funding tiers. If we reach our final stretch goal, it will be made available for fans to enjoy in print.\nAs you can see, a lot of talented people want to make this game! More than anything!! Part of our journey leading up to this moment came from Sandy\u2019s trips to game conventions every year, and his personal connections to Cthulhu fans from around the world (after all he is one of them.) One of the most common questions he gets asked is, \u201cWhen are you going to do something with Cthulhu again?\u201d Here are Sandy\u2019s own words about this:\n\n\u201cUp until now, I had to answer this question lamely, muttering something about \u2018Someday\u2019 or \u2018I guess Cthulhu isn\u2019t mainstream enough for my company to let me do it\u2019. But now is the time. I have partnered with a small group of like-minded, talented developers, and now I can do a Cthulhu product that I am really excited about. More than anything, I want to make this game, and so does the team. We have grandiose ideas for expansions and elaborations, but they can only happen after the first step \u2013 getting Cthulhu World Combat off the ground.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just the Mythos that has caught our love, but the strategy game accompanying it. So the game will be as strong as the topic. Along the development cycle (around 6 months), we will continue to keep you updated on the progress, with updates, game visuals as they come online and a running blog which will help keep you engaged in the process.\nOur long-term plan is given below. Please inspect the stretch goals. Not only do we want to bring this game to life, we are trying to ensure that it can be experienced with all worlds, factions and characters of the Cthulhu Mythos on every platform you like. Help us reach these Stretch Goals and you too can participate in the release of a horror not seen on this planet in eons.\nIf your love for Cthulhu and strategy games weren\u2019t enough incentive, we are throwing everything but Sandy's suspenders, your way. As a shameless THANK YOU in helping us make our dream game, you too will be rewarded with these amazing prizes.\nTons of goodies, and if you want to know more about each item, check out the list on the right of the page. More information to come in the next few weeks... who knows, we might add more items to sweeten the deal.\nSpecial Shirt Add-On\nWe are excited to announce a Cthulhu World Combat T-Shirt Add-On! There are multiple shirts to choose from, including an original \"Cthulhu-Tarian\" just in time for the election! You can choose one shirt, just add $20 to your donation! The full list of characters will include at least one from each faction!\nThere are tons of fans who want to see this game made, and we know we're the right team to accomplish the mission, but don't take our word for it...\nOver the last several years traditional game publishers have become increasingly \u201crisk-averse\u201d in funding new IP. As a result a lot of interesting and profitable concepts never see the light of day. Sadly, the traditional investing community is also far less likely to fund concepts of a frightening or horrific nature. When Sandy and his team try to present a Cthulhu-based product to potential investors, they are usually more puzzled than entranced. We have also tried to present the concept of the light strategy game, with more success. But one thing we have found is that investors nowadays are extremely unadventurous in areas where their minds dare not travel.\n\nKickstarter is an evolution in the way that new ideas go from paper to product that may someday obviate traditional seed funding and early stage investing. Not only does it allow new idea an improved chance for birth but it gives anyone the power to be part of something new with little risk. The Cthulhu Mythos is loved by horror fans around the world but is woefully under-represented in today\u2019s vast catalog of available video games. With the help of Kickstarter, we plan to address this egregious omission and take it several strides further.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the experience of the team we have assembled, all of the typical execution risks are not only understood but have already been addressed. In addition, technology, tools and a prototype have been developed so all money we receive from our honored investors on Kickstarter can go directly to the implementation of our dream.\n\nSo, regarding risks -- it\u2019s all about making a great game! Below is a list of issues we are currently anticipating. We have talked a bit about how we plan to address these.\n\n\n1) If every faction has its own unique line-up of units, how will the game be balanced? Won\u2019t some factions be stronger than others? One of Sandy\u2019s main design tasks throughout his career has been to balance units and factions for strategy games. He has spent many thousands of hours doing this, and is confident he can pull it off with Cthulhu World Combat as well. We want to create a great game and work with the player community (of which we are part) to seek out issues and eradicate them quickly and without mercy. \n\n2) If an opponent delays in his response, several hours or days could take place between turns. How will players remember what they were doing? In a simpler game like Chess or Words With Friends this isn\u2019t usually a problem, but in a strategy title there is a lot going on. When you fire up Cthulhu World Combat to react to an opponent\u2019s move, the game starts out by actually showing you that move in double-time. You can replay it, plus you can replay earlier turns if you need your memory refreshed. In fact, you can replay the entire game up to the present point if you wish, pausing it or speeding it up as necessary. Thus you will always be able to see exactly what has been happening and plan your strategy accordingly.\n\n3) One of the flaws of games such as Advance Wars and Civilization is the tedious end-game \u2013 at some point it is obvious that one side is going to win, and then the play is simply dragged out until finally the end comes. Sandy has addressed this issue with a feature known as the Ritual of Annihilation. When one player has significantly more controlled gates than his opponent, he can enact the Ritual. This ceases all his production, but sets up a timer. When the timer counts down a certain number of turns, then he automatically wins. His opponent can cancel the Ritual by recapturing enough gates, but of course you can try to block this. In this way, the end-game is an exciting race for whether you can finish your Ritual before your foe\u2019s counterattack succeeds, rather than a boring slog.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sandy Petersen\n32 created \u00b7 123 backed\nSandy Petersen got his start at Chaosium in the early 1980s, where he helped develop the original Arkham Horror board game.

My name is Avishai Weinberger. I'm 17, and I'm nearing the completion of my feature length movie, Surviving Evidence. So far, I've been shooting on practically no budget, other than whatever it took to pay to feed the actors. Towards the end of production, I am facing some difficulties, which is why I need your help.\nFirst, a little about the movie:\nThe premise: It's been weeks since New York City fell to a zombie-like epidemic. 7 people still survive in the city by living, quietly, in a high school. They videotape their lives in the hopes that someone, somewhere, might find them.\nThe movie is kind of a sequel to something I made last year, a 40 minute movie called Evidence. It was a bit more of a straightforward zombie movie, showing the original outbreak from the perspective of a teen with a camera. It didn't have a script, just a five page long outline, so all of the dialogue was improvised. I've learned a lot from that movie, which can be found at evidencethemovie.com.\nSurviving Evidence, my latest project, is wholly scripted with some room for improvisation. The plot is focused on the survivors. There are zombies, but they're not the point. They're just the catalysts.\nThat isn't to say that there aren't any zombies. In fact, these zombies are different. For one, they're not dead, just sick, a la 28 Days Later. However, what sets them apart is their motives. They're not driven by rage, or hunger, like past depictions. These 'zombies' are motivated by fear. The last thing they felt before turning was fear, and even after coherent thought is gone, the fear lingers. They're terrified and don't know why. When they see someone healthy, they desire help, but they can't ask for it, or even think about it. So they attack the healthy, tearing them to shreds, not realizing that they're causing more harm than good. Simply put, they're not responsible for their own actions. They're not villains, they're sick human beings.\nSo who is the antagonist? Well, there isn't one, not in the traditional sense. There are characters who only want the best for everyone but manage to mess things up anyway. I'd rather not give it away now, but it's a major focus of the film.\nNow back to production.\nI wrote the script over a year ago, cast the thing over the summer, and have been filming ever since. Because I'm filming in a school, I can only shoot on weekends, and only when the building is open. One unfortunate side effect is that it's much harder to arrange for everyone to be there at the same time. Things keep getting in the way. Not to mention, getting zombies. We've had one day for shooting zombies so far, and we got around 7 to show up. Only 2 were adults.\nOver an hour of the movie is in the can, but there's still further to go.\nThe reason I'm trying to raise money is so that I can afford to hire more extras, I can pay the actors a bit more as added incentive to make filming more of a priority, and so that I can afford better props and equipment. It would also help me with the final edit, and with festival registration. If enough is raised, I'll aim my funds at distribution.\nI've never worked with a large budget. I'm used to stretching the smallest budgets as far as humanly possible. Because of this, I'm not asking for much. However, if this project raises more than the goal, I will find uses for it, such as improving special effects and makeup.\nI'm not asking for your money for nothing. In exchange for donations, you can earn a name in the credits, a signed copy of the script, a copy of the screener, and other rewards.\nIf you can't donate or just don't want to, there are other ways you can help. You can post this page on your facebook and send it to friends. Also, if you live in the NYC area, you can be a zombie in the film.\nThat's my pitch. I hope it was effective, and thanks in advance for your generosity.\nPS- you might notice that this account is under the name Michael Weinberger. That's because, as a minor, I'm not legible to have a kickstarter page unless it's through the account of a parent.

After carefully studying the state of the film industry in Michigan during the winter of 2010, my creative team of Tobias Dawson (Production Designer) and Audrey Lucero (Costume Director) decided that the time was right to try and make a go of it.  I quickly asked for and received help from my long time friend and collaborator Jeff Morgan (Director, DP, Editor) and we set to making the proof of concept shoot a reality.  \nAs a story, SCOUGE explores ideas that range from resource depletion, governing models, inalienable rights, the pursuit of power, and the value of the social contract.  It's got some kicking undead too....    While we did have an inkling, the journey quickly became remarkable.  People were consistently amazed at the quality and quantity of design in the project, and became even more interested  when they found out what the project hoped to accomplish.  The goal of the SCOURGE proof of concept was always to catapult as many people as possible into the active film industry, and we've earned ourselves a chance at that goal, but we need some help.

Our amazing art department produced miracles for us, time and time again. And yet, for all of the dedication, time, talent and energy that these people put in for us, they were all volunteers!

We have received many emails from parents of young children saying that they hate to give their kids headphones and that the SoundJaw is the solution they have been waiting for. That's what inspired us to make this t-shirt. This shirt is sure to be a conversation starter and we hope you enjoy the design and see the humor.\nThis shirt will be made in the USA to ensure quality and custom shirts in (small) quantities are not cheap. If you would like this please just add $25 dollars to your pledge to cover the cost of the shirt and the additional shipping. I will send out a survey after funding to ask t-shirt sizes and I will also give you a couple color options (white is for sure but if I get enough orders we can do pink and black as well). Feel free to message me with any special requests. The artwork is done by a friend of mine, check out his site for more of his work.\n\nA Close Up Of The Design\nOn A T-Shirt\nUp until recently the SoundJaw was untested on the iPad (first gen). I had made a fatal error called \"assumption\", thinking that it wouldn't fit. Well... It does! It is not a perfect fit as the device was made for the iPad 2, a much thinner body, but it does the job. Check out the picture below. \nThe SoundJaw on the iPad 1\nThe SoundJaw is an accessory that works to redirect your iPad's sound, giving it a louder and richer tone. You won't believe the difference this can make. I'm sure you can hear the difference on the video but it is even greater when in person. The SoundJaw is VERY portable, making it easy to keep in your pocket. I have used it for anything from watching movies to listening to music far away. It makes the biggest difference when you are outside or a place with a lot of noise (plane, car, train, etc.) The testing done to make sure the sound was loud enough was only half of what I was concerned about. The iPad 2 is unmatched in its slim design and I didn't want to take that away. \nWorks perfectly with the Smart Cover\nThe SoundJaw is made to compliment the slim look without the added bulk you may expect. You can hold the iPad in landscape or portrait mode and the SoundJaw won't interfere with the placement of your hands. In my opinion the SoundJaw doesn't detract from the iPad's good looks, it adds to them. If you want your iPhone 4 to experience similar results it will fit it as well. I can't demonstrate this just yet however because the SoundJaw is made from a very rigid resin at the moment. Once it is made out of a more flexible plastic it will definitely go on, and if it doesn't I'll refund your money for sure.\nWe love the SoundJaw\nThe thin design makes sure it is not in the way\nI am going to be making this device out of plastic, which involves a lot of up front costs. The mold itself is a very expensive investment and so I need the Kickstarter community's help. I have already put money into this so I could keep the funding price low. $7,000 will be enough to get SoundJaw off the ground to guarantee this projects success. I have many future ideas that I'm sure you guys will love. Please continue to check back frequently as I will have updated rewards and video demos.\nTake it everywhere\nIf this project does well I will be shooting a video commercial involving a helicopter and the SoundJaw. I will also have a reward to accompany it if someone wants to take place in a video that is sure to go viral.\nThanks for looking and backing.\nTag: Sound Jaw", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "We just launched a quick 3 day project!", "update_content": "Hello Everyone!\nIt's been awhile since I last posted an update but I thought I'd share this most recent project with you as you have been so supportive through the years!\n\nWith only 3 days left in 2020, we wanted to say so long to this year in an Antsy Labs sort of way."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "We Just Launched Our Newest Project, A Game Based On Our Experience Of Making Fidget Cube", "update_content": "Hey everyone!\nOver the last year, we've been designing a board game that is loosely based on our experience inventing Fidget Cube and funding it on Kickstarter.\nWe call the game Fidget Factory, and we're excited to announce that we launched it on Kickstarter today!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Announcing Our Newest Project!", "update_content": "Hi Soundjaw Backers!\nCan you believe it's been over 7 years since Soundjaw launched!?\nI wanted to briefly notify you of our newest project, PIXL.\nIf you have the time, check it out!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Hello!

The mural will depict Vandercook Lake\u2019s local history and the lake\u2019s heritage.

The old Hague Park had the character and feel of a fair along the lake side--it was our Coney Island. About all that remains as evidence of the park's heyday is a concrete roller coaster support and the old postcards. The postcard images will be the basis of the mural design. They depict the ladies and gentlemen of the era relaxing, strolling, picnicking, boating, and swimming. Some cards feature a carousel, the Jack Rabbit roller coaster, a water toboggan slide, a steamboat, and more. The mural will bring this past back into the community identity of Vandercook Lake.\nGoals and Outcomes of the Project:\n1\nA public artwork created by local artists.\n2\nDocument the unique heritage of the Vandercook Lake area and display images from its history\u2014images of Hague Park. Inform the public about their past by depicting local life from earlier eras. Add to the community identity.\n3\nInvolve other community participants. The possibilities of involving others to help with the project will be explored and pursued. It is possible to involve art students from Vandercook Lake schools, involve a group who are creating a documentary film on Hague Park\u2019s history, or other participants.\n4\nThe mural\u2019s location will be a public area on the main street in town. It is a recently landscaped lawn with new picnic tables.

Yep\u2014director Joseph M. Monks, who lost his eyesight as a result of diabetic retinopathy, isn\u2019t visually impaired or legally blind, but rather, lights-out, 100% sightless. Despite the fact that there\u2019ve been substantial challenges along the way, and plenty of naysayers who refused to believe making this film was possible, The Bunker is no joke or publicity stunt. The movie has screened at film festivals, at comic & horror conventions, received critical praise from the likes of the Miami Herald, Fangoria Magazine, Rue Morgue, The Hacker\u2019s Source, and other genre trades and web sites, and has already received distribution offers. The film has even attracted the attention of international recording artists, including a Billboard chart-topping band who\u2019ll be providing a song for the film.\nMoney raised will be used for post-production expenses, including adding a professional film look; recording studio time for voiceovers and ADR (additional dialogue recording); sound re-recording; mixing of the score and matching it to the final edit, and producing high-quality screeners and media packages for distributors. With those few remaining elements completed, this movie, and the Making of... documentary, chronicling the production--which survived two hurricanes, the original composer\u2019s suicide, sabotage from within and other nightmares--will be ready for release.\nThe Bunker is a horror film/psychological thriller focusing on sexy newcomer Saskia Gonzalez, who plays Julia, the daughter of New York congressman Robert Jennings. A rebellious teenager, Julia runs away from home the night her father announces his bid for reelection. Unfortunately for the 16-year-old, before she can be located by her parents or the police, she is snatched off the streets of lower Manhattan by sadistic kidnapper Terry M. West (The Blood Shed, Flesh for the Beast), who has a hideous fate in store for her. As the grains of sand in Julia\u2019s hourglass begin to run out and West\u2019s intentions are revealed to her, it becomes a race against time. Will the police find the underground bunker where she\u2019s been imprisoned? Will the mobsters the concerned congressman has turned to in order to save his daughter\u2014and political career\u2014be able to get to Julia before the kidnapper\u2019s timetable for murder reaches its end? Or will Julia, faced with two desperate alternatives, find another means of escape, one far more chilling than anything her demented captor has in store...\n\u201cI expected it (The Bunker) to be enjoyable, but this was so much more. The script is solid. The production values are good. The direction and editing are excellent. A solid story told well. I was suitably impressed--nice job!\u201d --Carnell, FANGORIA Magazine features writer\n\u201cA well-crafted, well-executed story that will stay with you long after the final credits roll. The Bunker is as frightening as the headlines on CNN, because it\u2019s just as real, and twice as disturbing.\u201d --Franklin E. Wales, Editor, The Hacker\u2019s Source\n\u201cPretty soon, people won\u2019t even pay attention to the fact Joe can\u2019t see, because his film stands on its own. It\u2019s that good...you\u2019ll forget a blind guy directed it.\u201d --Mike Koneful, HorrorBiz\n\u201cFor a lot of people, this film has got to be inspiring. And, look at the money he saves by not having to use a monitor!\u201d --Ted A. Bohus, Producer, The Deadly Spawn We\u2019ll be updating progress on the project thru the film\u2019s official website, via Kickstarter updates, the Sight Unseen INSIDER video blog, Twitter and social media sites like FaceBook and MySpace. Plus, if we give those Diaspora boys a run for their money, who knows? Maybe your name\u2019ll appear in an upcoming project as well. (Be nice if we attracted an agent, too. Hint-hint.)\nYou don\u2019t get any guarantees in life, but we can make you this promise. You may have seen and/or contributed to unique projects before, but this film stands out because it\u2019s truly groundbreaking. This is something that\u2019s never been done before.
