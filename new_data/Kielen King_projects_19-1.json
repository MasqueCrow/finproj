[{"backer": "Kielen King", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is THE HATED?\nEqual parts spaghetti western and blaxploitation thriller, THE HATED is a new comic book written by David F. Walker, drawn by Sean Damien Hill, colored by Mx. Struble, lettered by Becca Carey, and published by Solid Comix.\nTHE HATED cover art by Sean Damien Hill with colors by Mx. Struble\nIt is 1872, and the war between the North and South is over. Neither side won. After years of bloody conflict, both sides entered into a truce, resulting in the formation of two nations, the Union States of America, where blacks are free, and the Confederate States of America, where blacks are still enslaved. Araminta Free is a former slave turned bounty hunter. She specializes in crossing the border into the Confederacy, and liberating slaves. She also tracks down Confederate war criminals, which has made her a woman with a price on her head in the southern nation. When a group of Confederate Raiders illegally ventures deep into the Union to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery, the stage is set for a deadly showdown between Araminta and the men who want her dead.\nImagine if director Sergio Corbucci (DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE) made a western starring Pam Grier as a badass, gun-slinging bounty hunter. Now imagine the story takes place in a world where the Civil War ended differently \u2013 instead of a victory for the North, there is a truce, and what had been one country is now two. This is THE HATED.\nThe first issue of THE HATED is 100% drawn and inked, and is currently being colored. Here are some samples of the amazing work by artist Sean Damien Hill and colorist Mx. Struble.\nWHAT ARE YOU FUNDING?\nThis campaign is funding the first issue of THE HATED, a mini-series written and published by David F. Walker, drawn by Sean Damien Hill, colored by Shaun Struble, and lettered by Becca Carey. This will be a full color, 40-page comic book plus cover.\n30 pages of story\n10  back-up pages\nStandard sized comic\nThe purpose of this campaign is to fund the production and printing of THE HATED #1, fulfill all backer rewards, and cover the cost of shipping and handling for all reward tiers. Because THE HATED is more pages than ONE FALL, the cost of printing and shipping is more, for that reason, we have set our goal higher this time. But all of the money is going towards the costs of producing and delivering all rewards, any remaining/extra funds will go toward the production of THE HATED #2.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe wanted the freedom to create a series on our own terms, and at a pace that works for our schedules. The first issue of THE HATED is drawn, inked, and partially colored and lettered. By the time this campaign is over, the first issue will be 100% complete and ready to go to print. The money raised from this campaign will go to fund printing and productions costs of the first issue of THE HATED, production of other rewards, and shipping. Any money raised over the target goal will be used as seed money for the second issue of THE HATED.\n\nTHE HATED #1 - We've got some great rewards for this campaign, starting the the comic itself. You will have a choice of a digital comic or a physical copy. There are multiple options for covers of the physical copy, including the main Cover, and the variant Cover B (image only, no text). \nTHE HATED #1 - David Mack Variant Cover - since a picture is worth 1,000 words, we'll just show it to you...\nDavid Mack variant cover\nTHE HATED #1 Black and White Limited Edition - Solid Comix is pleased to offer a limited edition, black and white version of THE HATED #1. This is the exact same comic as the color edition, only without the color. This edition will have a limited print run for Kickstarter. There will be no second printing. The black and white edition will only be available here on Kickstarter (and at conventions if any are left) -- no digital copies, not available online, and no retailer copies. Once these are gone, they are gone. \npages from the Black and White Limited Edition\n KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!! This amazing sticker (2\"x3\") featuring Araminta Free is included with all physical copies. Not available anywhere else, this is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED. \nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!\nBadAzz MoFo's Book of SPAGHETTI WESTERNS by David F. Walker - every order of THE HATED comes with this FREE digital of David F. Walker's book about spaghetti westerns, reprinted from the pages of his 'zine BadAzz MoFo. This digital book features reviews of more than 40 films and a historic overview of the Eurowestern genre -- 114 pages, including reviews of DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL, and many more. This is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED.\nADD-ONS\nThe Joelle Jones 8.5\u201dx11\u201d pin-up is now available as an add-on to all print copy reward tiers for $10 each (sorry, not available with digital only). This was supposed to be the $20k stretch goal...but since we likely won't hit that goal, and since this is such an amazing work or art, and because I appreciated all the support everyone has shown to this campaign, it is being made available. \nTo add the pin-up to your existing reward tier click the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (it should be on the right side of your screen). This will take to a page called \u201cChange Your Pledge.\u201d Change the \u201cPLEDGE AMOUNT\u201d to reflect the adding of the pin-up or any other add-ons. EXAMPLE: If you pledge $8 to get a print copy of Cover A and you want to add the Joelle Jones, you would add $10, making your new pledge amount $28.\nJoelle Jones 8.5\"x11\" pin-up\nMORE ADD-ONS\nANOTHER NEW TIER!!!\nWe\u2019ve just added a very special reward tier. Let\u2019s call it the \u201cI Love Indie Comics\u201d tier. This is a special bundle that includes The Hated #1 (Cover A) along with three indies titles that I really like \u2013 Harriett Tubman: Demon Slayer #1, Crescent City Monsters#1, and Is\u2019Nana the Were-Spider: The Ballads of Rawhead & John Henry.  All three are comic projects they I have backed on Kickstarter, and I want to share them with a select group of backers. You get physical copies of all four of these comics for $20, as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Stickers and a PDF of BadAzz MoFo\u2019s Book of Spaghetti Westerns. Limited to only 10!!!\n NEW TIERS ADDED!!! (UPDATE - All gone!!!)\nI\u2019m very happy to announce two new reward tiers. I have a limited number of BITTER ROOT #6 variant covers \u2013 both the \u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 tribute cover and the \u2018My Neighbor Totoro\u2019 tribute cover. Both are extremely rare, and going for upwards of $100 on eBay. I have eight copies of each cover, and once they are gone, they are gone. This reward tier includes ONE copy of BITTER ROOT #6 (either the \u2018Do the Right Thing\u2019 cover or the \u2018Totoro\u2019 cover), a printed copy of THE HATED #1 (Cover A), Kickstarter Exclusive Sticker, and Free PDF of BadAzz MoFo\u2019s Book of SPAGHETTI WESTERNS.\nSORRY...All of these rewards are gone.\n$20k Stretch Goal -- Joelle Jones 8.5\"x11\" pin-up, colored by Mx.

At the risk of getting too political, the damage wrought on the USPS by the Trump administration has been mind-boggling. I have been using the post office as my main source of business shipping for more than 25 years. In that time, I've had more problems in the last six months than in all those years combined. There have been more copies of The Hated that have simply disappeared than anything else I've ever shipped. In most cases, tracking shows that these packages were delivered, even though they weren't.

AND MORE!\n WE ARE MAKING AN ALBUM AND DOING A TOUR!!! Thanks to your help this is a reality, but there are still some cool things we could do if we make these STRETCH GOALS!\nPATCHES AND STICKERS!\nHello! We're The PDX Broadsides \u2014 Hollyanna, Jessica, and Christian \u2014 and we're a nerd-pop trio with tight harmonies and clever lyrics about fandom and feelings and things we love. We're from Portland, Oregon (aka PDX to locals) and we have been playing music together since 2011. Formed accidentally (and earning our name) by singing acapella sea shanties in public (oops), we soon branched out into our own original nerdtastic compositions.  Over time our songs have become more vulnerable and we're grateful that our audiences have responded so well to that openness - this is the most vulnerable album yet and we know you'll love this RELATABLE CONTENT.\nYou may have seen us performing with some other talented folks, like The Doubleclicks (we're signed to Doubleclicks Records), Marian Call, Misbehavin' Maidens, Molly Lewis, and Professor Shyguy, to name a few. Some of those stages include Dragon Con in Atlanta (where we're honored to return for a second year in a row in 2019 as a House Band!), Rose City Comic Con, Emerald City Comic Con, and comic book shops, science museums, and more across the US and Canada.      \nWe're also on the internet. We make videos, are enthusiastic Tweeters, and have been featured places like Geek In The City Radio and The Mary Sue.   \n\"The PDX Broadsides sing what we're all thinking\" - The Mary Sue\n\"...toe-tapping rhythms and charming harmonies...\" - GeekDad\n\"The band has always made music that resonates\" - Geek Hard\nTo date, we've released four studio albums (take a listen for free on Bandcamp!): \"Take Everything,\" \"Aim To Misbehave,\" \"Something's Rotten,\" and \"Trust Issues,\" and we're ready, with your help, to make #5: \"RELATABLE CONTENT.\"\nTo cut straight to the point: we're making 1) our fifth studio album + 2) our first East Coast tour.  \nWhen we started talking about making a new album, the songs that we chose naturally progressed the same ideas as on our last album: we're still facing the dragons, and sometimes we still don't win, but we're trying to be braver. We see the mistakes we make and we're finding ways to do better, in a world that continually finds ways to challenge us.\nOh, there's also buffalo and books and Steven Universe. We're still nerdy as heck, friends, and there's a lot of fun and upbeat stuff on here, too, we promise!\n\"Relatable Content\" has the songs that have resonated with our audiences and us over the past two years, and we're ready to have them in your ears and on the road.\nWe've made a lot of friends and fans over the years and we'd like to play with and for them more places. We've been asked repeatedly to come to the East Coast and we think we're ready as a band after our years of experience to finally do that. Did you know touring is expensive? It's hecking expensive, friends. We could use a boost.\nWe believe in Kickstarting to do something NEW and BIGGER, and with that firmly in our hearts, we\u2019re asking you to help us reach the next stage... figuratively AND literally.\nAlbum!!!\nLet's talk album. 13 full-length tracks, each one something we know you're gonna love. Oh, and this album is definitely family-friendly! \n \"The Alligators\" - the little lies that eat at us and keep us from being our best (featuring cello by Betsy Tinney!)\n \"Buffalo\" - a very silly song about consent and poor decisions\n \"Heartless\" - love will drive you insane, let the Queen of Hearts tell you, buddy (inspired by Marissa Meyer's novel \"Heartless\")\n \"Let The Wild Rumpus Start\" - let's go have fun and all be monsters together! (inspired by Maurice Sendak's \"Where The Wild Things Are\")\n \"Serotonin Dopamine\"- we miss those neurotransmitters when they're gone\n \"Rewind\" - ever wish you could just start a conversation over?\n \"Orpheus\" - when fight or flight fails, sometimes you freeze. #MeToo meets the Greeks. (with bass by Chris Waffle!)\n \"Lost At Sea\" - get ghosted by a friend? need to cut someone from your life? let them go. \n \"Together Breakfast\" - we really like brunch and friends. (inspired by Steven Universe, includes clarinet by Dr. Mary Crowell!)\n \"Winter is Coming\" - Arya Stark is not having it, y'all (inspired by George RR Martin's \"Game of Thrones\")\nIn addition, 3 of the songs from the album were inspired by YOU, the fans! Thanks to custom reward backers, we developed these songs that were so good that the rest of the world really needs to hear them.\n \"Jerkbrain\" - brains are jerks, but good friends are not\n \"House of the Wind\" - how does it feel to step on stage and perform? Equal parts scary and THE ABSOLUTE BEST (inspired by Patrick Rothfuss' \"The Kingkiller Chronicles\")\n \"Love Good\" - loyalty, honesty, and whimsy make Luna Lovegood a steadfast friend to have (inspired by J.K. Rowling's \"Harry Potter\" series)\nWe wrote all of these and every track will have guitar, piano, and our signature harmonies, plus some special add-ins. We're once again working with Kevin Hahn of Opal Studio to record, mix, and master (he also did \"Something's Rotten\" and \"Trust Issues\"!) so you know this is going to be magnificent.  \nTour!!!\nThis is our current path, starting in Raleigh! The sooner we fund, the sooner we can confirm stops!\nOur plan would be to tour the East Coast October 4-13 with stops in Raleigh, the Washington D.C. area, Philadelphia, Brooklyn, Newark, and Boston. We do have openings for a couple more shows which we could definitely fill in with house concerts (contact us if that's you and you want to back us for the house concert level!!!). The moment we fund, we can confirm our venues and possibly add additional shows.\nUPDATE: Current Shows (more info and tix soon!)\n10/4: House Concert; Raleigh, NC (with Juliana Finch)\n10/6: New Deal Cafe; Greenbelt, MD (with Misbehavin' Maidens!)\n10/9: The Way Station; Brooklyn, NY (with guests TBA!)\n10/12: The ONCE Lounge; Somerville, MA (with Sarah Donner!)\nPart of the joy of touring is getting to play with some of the friends we've made over the last few years. Our live shows are not just musical performances - somehow they turn into comedy routines as well, and even we don't know what's going to happen. That's part of what makes touring so much fun. We even stay friends the whole time!\nWe've crunched the numbers, and we know how much money it will take to not only record and produce an album, but also travel across the country and tour. It's more than we've got, but we know that there are friends and fans out there who really get what we do. They want to be a part of this crazy music thing that we do, and they want to hear new music. \nThat's where Kickstarter comes in. Our previous campaign for the \"Trust Issues\" album was overwhelmingly successful, and allowed us to bring the CD to life. In return, our backers got to be a part of that process and get their hands on some of our best work so far. They also were able to get new stickers, t-shirts, and even brand new songs just for them. Everyone got what they wanted, and Kickstarter made that process very easy. \nThis time around, there's even more on the table - we're taking more time on the recording of \"Relatable Content,\" and mounting our most ambitious tour yet. We know there's no way we're going to be successful unless we have your help to put it together.\nWe have some really cool rewards available, including a new 4-STICKER PACK, USB DISCOGRAPHY, and our first-ever ENAMEL PINS! \nTHE ALBUM:\nDigital downloads of the album will delivered to Kickstarter backers a day or more before the rest of the world gets it. Most likely, the album will reach you via a download code for Bandcamp. Physical CDs will come by post!\nWe're excited to announce that our album art is by Aud Koch! She is an amazing illustrator who's worked on comics for Dark Horse and Marvel. Her work on The Wicked + The Divine: 1923 inspired the direction for \"Relatable Content\"'s cover! It's got elements of Alice in Wonderland and some familiar beasties. We think you're going to love it AND you can get art prints of it (see below!)\nArt Prints:\nBrand new for this campaign, we're making beautiful 12\" x 12\" art prints of two of our album covers: the \"Trust Issues\" cover done by Benjamin Dewey (The Autumnlands, Beasts of Burden), and our new \"Relatable Content\" cover by Aud Koch (The Wicked + The Divine: 1923).\n[L]: Relatable Content cover by Aud Koch. [R]: Trust Issues cover by Benjamin Dewey. Both available as art prints for this campaign!\nStickers:\nOur four-sticker pack will bring you die-cut vinyl stickers for you to place on your car, your travel mug, your little brother... the possibilities are endless! Includes art from our own Hollyanna McCollom, German artist Jela Schmidt, and Portland artist Jesse Miller!\nStickers will be roughly 3\" square.\n\nEnamel Pins:\nWe finally made the leap and designed some enamel pins - they are so cool! Put them on your jacket, bag, lanyard, or decorative frame! Featuring Jela Schmidt's \"I Can't Even\" octopus and our ever-popular \"Smile!\" button. Pins will be approximately 1.5\" in diameter. Working out the area will be left as an exercise for the reader.\nActual pins may include glitter!\nUSB Discography:\nUSB sticks with all of our albums in digital format, plus some rare unreleased tracks! These have been a favorite with new fans who want to binge-listen. Also great for folks who don't want to stack up CDs!\nYour USB will arrive signed on the clever tag!\nArt Prints:\nBrand new for this campaign, we're making beautiful 12\" x 12\" art prints of two of our album covers: the \"Trust Issues\" cover done by Benjamin Dewey (The Autumnlands, Beasts of Burden), and our new \"Relatable Content\" cover by Aud Koch (The Wicked + The Divine: 1923).\nWhat if I want MOAR STUFF?\nYou want additional pins, previous albums or shirts, more USBs? No problem. After the campaign, we will be using Backerkit in order to let you add as many additional things you need for you and your discerning crew... but we have to reach that base goal first.\nUnique Rewards:\nIn addition to physical rewards, we have some SPECIAL opportunities:\nHOT SEAT: We'll reserve excellent seats for you and three of your friends at one of our shows! We'll dedicate a song to you, include you in an audience interaction bit, and more... or just wave hello and respectfully let you enjoy your seats. We get it, introverts, you can enjoy nerd music too. [Venue restrictions may apply. We'll contact you at close of campaign to make arrangements.]\nTOGETHER BREAKFAST: We'll take you and a friend out to brunch in Portland, OR where you can ask us all your burning questions and we'll be ridiculous Muppets together. Multiple spots are available, but we won't take more than 3 pairs out with us at a time for maximum Broadsides exposure. Multiple brunches for us! [Does not include transport or lodging, just brunch and hangout. We will arrange dates with backers at the close of campaign.]\nCUSTOM JINGLE/SONG: Ever want your own theme song? Writing a novel or need an intro song for a podcast? Really think we should write [SONG] about [THING]? Here's your shot. We send a survey at conclusion of campaign and work with you to write that song. Bonus: you might hear that song at our next show or on our next album!  [We retain all rights to the songs, song to be used for personal or Broadsides-approved non-personal uses.]\nHOUSE CONCERT: Let us play for you! We'll do an hourish of music for you and your pals. You provide the house and a space big enough for the three of us with piano and guitar, and we'll fill it with the nerdy songs you love. [Please contact us before choosing this option for arrangements! For locations more than 100 miles from Portland, there is an additional charge for travel and lodging which we'll work out with you!]\nHere's where your backer money will be used! You can see that TOURING is EXPENSIVE, and we appreciate every dollar that gets us closer to fulfilling these goals.\nThere's nothing quite like being a part of a community. We all share so much - we have bad days, we have good days, we're scared, we're happy... These experiences are what connect us, and with \"Relatable Content\" we are putting down in song some of the things we can all relate to. Your support means the world to us, and inspires us to create more for you. \nSpecial thanks to Laser Malena-Webber of Laser Campaigns for their help in wrangling this all together, to Benja Barker, Ryan Scott, Godiva Lee, and Nate Ayling for making our Kickstarter video, to Kevin Hahn of Opal Studio for recording us, and to Kara Helgren for taking wonderful pictures of us at The Nerd Out.\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH!\n-- Christian, Hollyanna, and Dr. Jessica", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter. Our previous one, for the album \"Trust Issues,\" produced a great CD on time. This time we are dedicating twice as much time to the studio so that we can really stretch out and create without as much pressure.\n\nThe big difference this time is that there is a tour attached, and tours come with their own unique challenges. What if things cost more than we expect? We've worked out a detailed budget that builds in a reasonable buffer for financial variance. The tour is not scheduled until late in the year and we're already in contact with several venues. We have been on tours before and we feel confident that we are well-prepared to fulfill all aims.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Friends and Relations", "descp": "Our Thanks!

In the same way those naturalists would explore new frontiers and carefully illustrate their findings, FIELD NOTES is a collection of my sketches, paintings and notes on the behavior of remarkable creatures in the wild. The animals are re-imaginings of characters you'll recognize from across the DC and Marvel universes, along with other favorites like the Ninja Turtles. The book is meant to be tongue-in-cheek, while still being a great showcase for the real-life animals these characters are based on. I hope to capture the wonder of exploration, even if it's just finding size-changing ants or leather-wearing house cats in your own backyard.  \nThis book collects my work on this project from 2015-2019, including over 100 oil, watercolor, and digital paintings along with pencil sketches. Though comics have an immense number of characters to reference, this book is as comprehensive as possible. Dozens of characters are spread out over 70+ full-color pages. So, from the flora and fauna of Gotham City, or the spider species of New York, to the grasslands of Wakanda, this book will be a visual guide for all the creatures you might encounter.\nFull-bleed oil and watercolor paintings allow you to see these creatures up close.\nColor studies and quick pencil sketches illustrate each sighting.\nScale charts describe entire families of creatures, and maps tell you where to find them.\nNow let's make it happen!\nFIELD NOTES will now be printed at 9\"x12\"!

You may also know that I wrote or produced the music on many of the hiphop hits of the 80s and 90s, that helped put New York on the rap map.\nNow Def Squad is back with a bang, starting with a new album featuring some of the top names of today like Pharrell Williams, Ghost Face, Redman, Styles P, Too Short and Big K.R.I.T. to name a few. \n New album\nThe new album is titled \u201cGo\u201d because we want to get maximum exposure from the word go! Besides the artists already mentioned we\u2019re lucky to also have my old collaborators Method Man and Keith Murray on board, along with AZ, Craig Mack, Mr Cheeks, Devin The Dude, Rockwilder, Rico Barrino, and Kid Capri. We're also excited to welcome newcomers Try Bishop, Katelyn and PWise. \nWe have 8 tracks in the can so far, and plan to add another 3 so there\u2019ll be 11 in total on the album. I\u2019m a fast worker so it will be ready by the spring, so watch this space\u2026\nAs a taster, one of the new tracks is called Southern Girl and features Pharrell and Big K.R.I.T. It was inspired by my Mom - who grew up in Alabama and Florida - and I like to think that everyone is a Southern girl at heart.\nNew Label\nThe album will be launched on my new independent label - Def Squad Records  - because the music business is very different from how it was back in the 80s and I want to give up-and-coming artists a platform to show what they can do. And at the same time we want to give you, the fans, what you want in the way of music, not what some ivory-towered record company executive thinks you want.\nA Brand New Concept\u2026 Def Squad Films\nTo complete the all-round Def Squad music & promo team we\u2019re hooking up with film-maker Shock B - long-time collaborator and the man behind our Shockumentary video above - to launch our very own music video production arm, so we can keep the whole process from idea to finished product in-house.\nWhy we\u2019re asking for your help\nI still have my studio in New York and all the original equipment which enabled me to produce beats like the popular 2001 track \u201cJust Like Music,\u201d sampling the late, great Marvin Gaye. Therefore many of the costs of producing a mainstream album are already covered. But I still need funds to finance the sampling - which doesn\u2019t come cheap - plus a sound engineer and all the costs involved in marketing the album to as wide an audience as possible, not just die-hard hiphop fans but to introduce great music to a new generation.\nMy proven track record\nFor the newcomers, here\u2019s a brief overview of our earlier work (14 albums under Erick Sermon, EPMD and Def Squad and music for over 30 movies and documentaries). Tracks like \u201cYou Got To Chill\u201d, \u201cStrictly Business\u201d and \u201cCrossover\u201d showcased quality music videos and were some of the genre\u2019s earliest commercial successes.\nA Bit of History\nI started out with Parish Smith as EPMD (which stands for Erick and Parish Making Dollars). Our first EPMD album, Strictly Business, laid the foundation for modern hiphop, sampling everything from Eric Clapton and Pink Floyd, to Zapp and Steve Miller.\nWhen label deals were shaky and corporate America was still being sold on the commercial viability of rap, Parish & I decided to pursue different paths and I embarked on a career producing music for countless R&B and rap acts. I was one of the early MCs to extend my brand beyond the booth.\nIn the two decades since, I established myself as a producer, with over 70 million album sales, thanks to working with some of the biggest names in the industry like Akon, Jay-Z, Kanye West, LL Cool J, Redman, Eminem, 50 Cent, Das EFX, Mary J Blige, D\u2019Angelo, Ja Rule, Diddy, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, KRS-One, Craig Mack, Heavy D, Das EFX and many more. For a more comprehensive list of my work see the bottom of the page.\nREWARDS\nWe have 20 incredible rewards that we're excited to share with you, ranging from $2 for a bonus track to $10,000 for a chance to record a beat and music video with me.

And we'll keep you informed every step of the way. As for benchmarks:\nIf we hit $5K, you'll get an exclusive comic screensaver. If we hit $7.5K, you'll get another digital comic story from Zimmerman / Lawrence. If we hit $10K, everyone who backed at $20 or above will get a physical comic along with their other rewards. And digital backers will get another cool screensaver! Now, back to your regularly scheduled campaign...\nMONSTER.  \nMy neighbor and pal, Kian, shot a monster movie with me in our garages and basements. It's called MADE YOU LOOK. And we'd like you to help us finish it.\nOne of these things is not like the other.\nTHE ROYAL WE. \nHere's our first set. That's me, writer and director, on screen left. Kian Doughty, star, with the flashlight. Tory Maurer, Director of Photography, with the coolest head tilt in town. And Chris Walas, who needs no introduction but I'll give him one anyway (Academy Award winner of THE FLY, GREMLINS creator), on monster duty.\nDon't go in there!\nIN THE CAN.\nWe shot on two separate occasions in two locations using two different 4K cameras over three days. Tory flew in twice to make this happen. Production's wrapped and the initial edit is finished. MADE YOU LOOK... is looking good! \nLook into my eyes.\nALL THE MONIES.\nAfter taxes and fees, 100% of the Kickstarter funds will go to two things and two things alone: post-production and creating rewards. NONE of the Kickstarter money goes to reimburse production costs or personnel. Executive Producer Douglas H. Snyder and partner Bricker-Down Productions (that's me!) are committed to finishing the film with incredible color correction, dialogue editing, sound design and composer partners without taking a dime. Furthermore, pal Kian will be there every step of the way, as we want this to be an incredible learning experience across all film stages for him.\nWe do have stellar stretch goal rewards in both the physical and digital realms, but any money above and beyond our goal will go to film festival submissions. We'd like the film to go across the globe, and we'll do our best to be there to support it. Especially with Kian and his family!\nSeeing triple.\nFUTURA.  \nChris told me he was investing in the future when he worked on MADE YOU LOOK. I couldn't have said it better. Let's make a cool little film together - we figure it'll be around 5 minutes - and we'll try our best to get it in a film festival near you. \nDeep background research.\nMADE YOU LOOK. \nProduction peeps. \nIntroducing Kian Doughty!\nBasement blues. From the ALEXA negative, no color correction.\nYour production team! Justin Zimmerman, Tory Maurer & Douglas H. Snyder.

Here's who they are, what they'll be doing and why it's important:\nJordan Eusebio will be doing the dialogue edit, sound design and final mix. https://vimeo.com/jordaneusebio \nThis is the opposite of what Jordan will be doing on MYL, so I promise he'll look significantly happier in future updates. At least, I hope so!\nKevin Shima is composing the final score. Part of the post budget is hiring lead instrumentalists to make the music as profound as possible. www.kevinshima.com\nJeez, no one's looking super happy in these pics, are they?\nZack Linkow will be doing a vfx pass on the basement portion of the film. For those keeping track at home, the monster sfx is 100% in-camera. We're old school. www.vimeo.com/zacklinkow\nThere we go. Thanks for the smile, Zack. This is actually on one of our previous projects together.\nREWARDS.\nThe digital bundle represents years of comic work and stories. Here's a sneak preview:\nJust a taste of the PDF package.\nThe exclusive lobby card will be printed on 130 pound paper with a speciality process that increases both contrast and reflection. Shiny and chrome!\nPrint signed by Justin and Kian. The original art by Russ Brown is available too!\nLet's not forget the Picture This tier, thanks to Kian's mom, Jillian @ www.22pagespdx.com\nTakes a good picture.\nAnd then we get to Producer, Curator and Logo levels, which come with an original Chris Walas creation.

County Maryland born MC, producer and educator, Substantial, first made his debut in 2000 while working with the late Japanese producer, Nujabes. Since then his soulful and introspective brand of Hip Hop music has received critical acclaim from HipHopDX.com and Ebony.com. His videos have appeared on MTV, VH1 and BET, he has performed around the world and collaborated with artists like Kool Herc, Oddisee and CunninLynguists. He has also worked with major brands such as Ford, Bentley, Amazon and UBER all while remaining a best kept secret.\nWHAT?\nTo This Union A Sun Was Born -2001, produced by late producers Nujabes & DJ Deckstream, is overdue for a repressing and Sacrifice - 2008 (which turns 10 years old in January 2018) has never seen a vinyl release. \nWHY NOW? WHY KICKSTARTER?\nThis past year, someone has literally asked if I had copies of my first album at every show I've done. Over the last few months, my sophomore LP has also seen a growing amount of requests for a vinyl pressing. Your request have been heard, now it's time to make it happen!\nIn order to make this happen it requires a lot of money. It's approximately $8,000 (before shipping) just to do 100 black vinyl copies of each release. This campaign will help better gauge how many copies I should press up and if I can afford to do splatter/color vinyl. Luckily, some of the greatest people in the world just so happen to believe in my music, so there's nothing to worry about. ;)\nARE THERE STRETCH GOALS? \nYes. Two. Details below.\n$12,500: If/When we raise this amount, I'll manufacture a new CD version of To This Union A Sun Was Born and cassette versions of both albums and include them in the rewards for those of you who pledge $100 or more. \n$15,000: If/When we raise this amount, I'll do splatter vinyl for To This Union A Sun Was Born and color vinyl for Sacrifice.

The game of the sixty second screenplay.\n  Great fun for both indoor people and theatrical types alike, Pitch Please takes any game night to the next level: Inside Your Own Mind. \nUnlike many games, this one incentivises you amusing each other. Much, if not all of the gameplay is conversation based. You may be pleasantly surprised by just how fun you and your crew can be.\nThis improvisational card game puts big budget blockbusters into your hands, with a fully illustrated deck of 53 movie cliches.\n Pitch, Please! Is the creation of cartoonist / comedian Carolyn Main.\nHow To Play:\nThe rules are deceptively simple- Each player chooses a studio name, and gets a hand of 5 movie cliche cards. The Producer chooses a genre. Two opposing Pitchers use 3 out of their 5 cards to make a screenplay in that genre. \nPitchers have one minute to plan, and then one minute to pitch their new movies to the Producer.\n  The Producer chooses the winning Pitch of that round. \nThat Pitcher now becomes the Producer of the next round. And so on, until they've played through the entire 53 card deck, or somebody has to go do whatever.\nKeep your winning pitch cards in a pile through the game. Who's ever stack is biggest, wins! ( Or, is it whoever had the most fun?)\nComplete Game Includes: One card deck and box, instructions. 53* movie cliche cards, and one genre card.\n*May include additional cards, depending on funding!\nPitch, Please! has been play tested to perfection, with a disparate sample: friends, family, gamers, artists, comedians, writers, normies and strangers alike.  \nBut don't take our word for it! Here's what real and big deal Pitch, Please! players have to say:\nWhat Are The Money Plans?\nFirst and foremost, we are raising funds to go into mass production.  We'll put in a bulk manufacturing order with local business, Print and Play Games. The bigger the total order, the better the price point we get on our end. So thanks in advance!\nAll additional monies raised will further production of more content in these directions-  Pitch, Please Podcasts, Live Shows, and internet animations. As well as payment for performers, musicians, technicians, and other future Pitch, Please! contributors.\nHere's the Rewards Breakdown:\nPLAY\n\nThe Bonus Stretch Goals:\nAt $2,000\nCarolyn will host 7 days of Pitch, Please Play! All around Portland,OR during the final week of this campaign. At various local businesses, to be decided. (Business Backers will be given preference, so go ahead and donate at least dollar, and shout out your establishment.)\nAt $5,000 \nUp to five new, bonus cards will be included in every deck! Hey! That's free bonus cards, for everybody! NICE.*\n*So long as somebody commissions these new cards on the reward tiers.\nAt $10,000  \nCarolyn commits to recording and releasing at least 10 Pitch Please Podcast Playthroughs, on Itunes and beyond, in conjunction with the River City Podcast Federation,  over the 2017- 2018 year. The podcast will featuring gameplay by comedians, cartoonists, writers, and more! (Probably about a Pg 13- NSFW)\nAt $20,000 \nOne new Collectors' Card produced, especially for this launch deck. The particulars of which to be determined by popular suggestions and votes of all backers! To be included in all card orders!\nThat card will not be available after this kickstarter printing for at least 5 years. And even then, in a different color palette. So this one's special.\n*Offer subject to artistic discretion, no sexist racist or homophobic material will be considered.\nAt $100, 000\nIf this game should reach the Mega Zone Carolyn officially commits to Pitch, Please! The Sequel! That's right, a whole other 52 card expansion pack, to Kickstart by 2021! \nAnd should that be successful, there's no shortage of expansion packs in the future. (Based on Sitcoms, Comics, Grindhouse, or almost anything...)\nAlso! For a whole year, whenever someone sees Carolyn Main and says the title to one of the Pitch, Please! cards, she will give them a deck! Free!* \n*Offer subject to one deck per day. Carolyn's purse is big, but it's allready pretty full of stuff.\nAt $500,000 \nCarolyn will travel across the united states and play Pitch, Please, live, with local talent. At least 5 shows by 2019. \nBy 2020 Carolyn will also finish a real screenplay based on ideas already inspired by Pitch, Please! She already has plenty of them.  All backers at the 100$ plus point this campaign go, in the credits! 4 Eva! WOWee!\nLook for that movie, in the far future, on the big, medium or small screen. Now that's what I call a ...\nPitch, Please!\nIt's the big screen in a lil' package. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk with all crowdsourced projects is of course the dreaded undeliverable: an idea or product that is simply too expensive or expansive to be created and completed at the volume needed to satisfy the interest.\n\nWith Pitch, Please, we've already taken that into account. Our modest funding goal is aimed right where we need it to be, to assure the project a viable and profitable state. \n\nWe've allready worked already with local Print and Play Games to produce demo decks, and are very pleased with both the quality and turnaround of the cards.\n\nTo maximise efficiency, all the illustrations have allready been finished. The only wait to the backers will be the manufacturing and shipment of the cards. \n\nUnless of course, this campaign gets new card commissions, in which case free additional cards go to all the backers! Yay! The new illustrations shouldn't take too long: about an illustration a week, and will be well worth the wait. \n\nTheres also the risk of being swamped by shipping, but we know of distributors able to help us literally deliver, should the project be fortunate enough to meet great success.\n\nThe worst risk of all, would be if the game was just not very good. But we've allready play tested with various groups of gamers, to great success.

Webster, Amandla Stenberg, Ashley A. Woods, Sheldon Mitchell, Michael Person, Olivia Duchess, Mervin Kaunda & Joyceline Furniss.\nWhile first introduced in The Untamed, Niobe's solo story begins years later with the character as a teenager. A child of prophecy is on the road to fulfilling her destiny... Niobe: She is Life.\nWith a world divided who do you turn to?  \nBetween two warring nations, in the heart of Western Ujoa, there is a haven to those who have lost their way. Some say you can rebuild your mind and spirit upon the mountains of Ugoma. For a Half-Elven (Sin-Galemren) girl with off-colored eyes, it is a chance to flee a dark past, and rest safely within the secret monatery of her ancestors. But you cannot run from destiny, or hide from the Devil.  \nSet within the original fantasy world of Asunda, Niobe: She is Life is a coming of age Beauty and the Beast love story threaded with murder and mystery that leads to all out war.\nShe is Life Preview Pages\nAnd the upcoming sequel... She is Death.\nThere is nothing more dangerous and beautiful than a wild woman.\nNiobe: She is Death is a tale of hard truths and revelations for a young woman who is tired of running. Niobe has lost her faith \u2013 in humanity and the world around her. In the sequel to Niobe: She is Life, we will witness Niobe\u2019s journey from heartbroken teenager to warrior woman, set to take on a world that would see her dead. Narrowly escaping a violent prison death, she learns that girls like her are being abducted. But the hunted becomes the hunter when she allies herself with a savage mentor who teaches her how to take vengeance on those who prey on the helpless \u2013 by being a bounty hunter herself. \nNiobe will hunt down and capture human traffickers, rescuing the victims for the families who seek her help. But each step takes her further down the path toward a destiny she did not ask for and a burden she does not want.\nShe is Death Covers and Preview Pages\nAnd that's only the beginning!\nSo many to choose from...\nReward packages and pledge levels are on the right, but here's a little more detail about the various items you can get.

In She is Life, one of the main plot points is a character accused of a crime based on the color of his skin, so we can't think of a better charity to work with than The Innocence Project.\nThe Innocence Project is a non-profit legal organization that is committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people through the use of DNA testing and to reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice. \nWe will donate 10% of our proceeds after the costs of printing and fulfillment with a minimum donation of $1,000 if the campaign is successful. Help us help others and get some great books in the process. And consider donating directly.

Accidentally formed as an a capella pirate shanty group, we soon branched out into our own original compositions. The Broadsides love things, and as a result, many of our songs are about the things we love. Turns out those things are basically nerdy. We have been fortunate enough to be able to operate on only the money we make as a band, thanks to our avid supporters, which is a pretty amazing concept!\nThe PDX Broadsides\nThe PDX Broadsides have played all around the West Coast at venues large and small. We\u2019ve done conventions including OryCon (as musical guest of honor), GeekGirlCon, Rose City Comic Con, and GameStorm, or you may have seen us play in shows with The Doubleclicks, Marian Call, or Chamber Band. \nAccording to Pandora, if you like the PDX Broadsides because of our \u201ccomedic sensibility, folk roots, acoustic sonority, and paired vocal harmony\u201d, you probably also like Jonathan Coulton, Ingrid Michaelson, Magnetic Zeroes, Karen Kilgariff, The Finches, Paul and Storm, and Barenaked Ladies. Who\u2019s going to argue with that?\nWHAT WE ARE MAKING\nTHE ALBUM: On our fourth album, the aptly titled TRUST ISSUES, we write about the things that scare us and make us worry, and how we face them with bravery and knowledge... and how sometimes we don\u2019t. \nWe\u2019re using this album to challenge ourselves musically, layering our tight trio harmonies in new and unique ways, as well as adding piano and other new exciting instrumentation. \nProfessional recording artists the PDX Broadsides\nOur songwriting continues to improve as we explore and expand our range of styles, adventuring into new territories: sweet Beatles-esque rock, eerily haunting ballads, and defiant nerd anthems. We are dealing more directly with the themes of self-confidence, social justice, and feminism, expressing these messages through the lens of our nerdy interests.\nWe plan for \"Trust Issues\" to have 13 all-ages songs: \nTiny Little Octopus \nNerd Love Song \nWe Want Rey \nRobot vs Boy \nOn The Case \nI Go Both Ways \nAcoustic Kitty \nI\u2019ll Eat You Last \nNoncompliant \nRocket Science \nThe Weather (A Night Vale Song) \nDelta You Delta Me \nDolores\nThere's happy stuff, sad stuff, funny stuff, and angry stuff. So much stuff! \nThis album will be recorded by Kevin Hahn at Opal Studio, same as our last album, Something Rotten! We are so excited to work with this talented local producer once again!\nSTRETCH GOALS! \n$5,000 - Commentary Track! - UNLOCKED! The PDX Broadsides record a digital \"commentary track\" for the album, which will be a free download for backers! Listen to us tell stories about the writing and recording of the tracks on \u201cTrust Issues\u201d!  \n$6,000: THE BOOK - UNLOCKED! : We will create and print a BOOK based on our song \"The Ultimate Riot!\" The book will be illustrated by our very own Hollyanna, and we'll add a copy to all backer rewards at level $75 and over!\n\n$7000 - Pizza Party! - UNLOCKED! We will play a concert in Portland at one of our favorite spots, and Christian finally gets to make his Ultimate Pizza (and the whole band has to eat it)!  This concert and party will be open to the public!\n$7500 - Missed Connections! - UNLOCKED! - We'll perform dramatic readings of Missed Connections from Portland's Craigslist! Strange and weird fun!\n$8000 - Upgrade CD to HAVE A SPINE! - UNLOCKED! - At this level, we get to put the CD in a full-on Digipak instead of a sleeve! It will have a spine and look much more fancy. We've wanted to do this for a while and would love the chance to make a \"super professional\"-looking package! All physical CD backers will get this LEVELED-UP CD!\n$9000 - 4-track DIRTY EP - UNLOCKED! - \"Trust Issues\" is kid-friendly... but there are more songs we want to share. At this level, we'll be able to record the \"Dirty EP!\" This EP will have three new original songs we kept off of \"Trust Issues,\" plus an alternate version of our song \"Rocket Science!\" \n$10,000 - \"HOLDING OUT FOR A HERO\" COVER SONG VIDEO! - UNLOCKED! We'll learn this Footloose soundtrack song and do a video for it, with much frivolity, probably!\n$11,000 - NEW KEYBOARD! - UNLOCKED! You'll hear Jessica play keyboard on TRUST ISSUES, and understand why she deserves a quality instrument. We've got our eye on the right one, and you'll be able to hear it on the road if we get to this goal!\n$12,000 - FIRST PDX BROADSIDES TOUR! - UNLOCKED!! You can help us do our very first tour, up and down the West Coast - Canada! California! Points on the map!\nWHY WE NEED YOU\nThis is our fourth album!

By constantly balancing the goal of flocking your own birds and blocking opponents' birds, a see-saw battle for avian supremacy ensues.\nFast and easy to learn and play \nFinely balanced mix of luck and strategy \nTerritorial disputes between birds vying for the same spot on the board are resolved via a novel \"Pecking Order\" \nUses a unique slide mechanic as resolve contested spots\nNon-player birds (crows and hawks) add unique chain reaction of board-reorganizing slides and scatters \nTruly an abstract \"gateway\" game that's great for kids' spatial and numerical skills (and even better for adults who are out of practice) \nBird pawns are cute, as well as fun to hold and play with! \nYou haven't heard bird puns and innuendo until you've heard THESE bird puns and innuendo!  \nGameplay is simple. Each player rolls two dice on their turn, indicating coordinates on the game board grid to place and move six birds on the board. Each turn players have the choice to place a bird at the rolled coordinate or play one of seven Action Cards as they work to achieve the winning formation of a four bird flock in the tree (either a square or straight line on the grid).\nOn Each Turn:\nThe current player rolls the dice. \nThe player may then choose to either place a bird into the tree (game board grid) OR play an Action Card from his/her active hand. Birds may only be placed in a spot in the tree that contains each number: for example a roll of 7 and 1 has two spots, \"17\" and \"71\". \nIf all of a player's birds are in the tree, they may choose which bird to relocate at the new coordinate. \nIf a double is rolled, a player can take the top action card (last used) from the discard pile and put it back in the active hand. \nIf a Hawk is rolled on the brown die, the player must place a Hawk pawn (brown bird) on any \"x\" on the board (the crossing branch lines between the coordinates) and the player's turn is over. Watch out! Hawks cause all neighboring birds to move off their perch! \nIf a Crow is rolled on the black die, the player may place a Crow pawn (black bird) on any spot on the board along the number line indicated by the other die. For example, a 2 allows 12, 22, 32, etcetera, and 21, 22, 23, etcetera. \nIf the spot you roll is occupied by another bird, and you do not have Pecking Order, you have to find a different spot. If you do have Pecking Order, your bird can displace the other bird. \nA displaced bird must \"slide\" along a branch to a new spot, possibly displacing another bird via Pecking Order. \nOnce all birds are moved via Pecking Order, the turn ends and play passes to the next player (clockwise).\nWhat is Pecking Order?\nOnly one bird can occupy any spot in the tree at a time. Each player has Pecking Order over the one (and only one) player to his/her immediate left. Once dice are rolled, a bird can land on an occupied spot if it has immediate hierarchy over the occupying bird via the Pecking Order. If the active bird has Pecking Order precedence and chooses an occupied spot, the displaced bird must relocate (slide) to an adjacent spot (that player\u2019s choosing) along any connecting branch line. If that spot is occupied, the process continues. If there are only 2 players, each player can displace the other. There is no \u201clow\u201d bird or \u201chigh\u201d bird as Pecking Order is circular.\nPlay-Through Video:\nPLAY\n\nReviews:\nBrand, spanking new review by Jonathan H. Liu of GeekDad!  Excellent guy, excellent take on the game.  Check it out asap:\nhttp://geekdad.com/2015/05/4-the-birds/\nTabletop game design guru Mike Selinker, founder of Lone Shark Games and known for games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Pirates of the Spanish Main, and Unspeakable Words as well as the epic book Maze of Games, makes a special appearance in the video. (Is that a squirrel pawn he's holding?! Hmmmm\u2026)\n\"I am a huge fan of family games that have replay value for the adult. Considering the possible level of strategy involved in the game, and the innuendos that could fly (fly \u2014 I made another bird pun), [4 the BIRDS!] has definite replay points in the adult category.\" - GeekMom's opinion of the game from a GameStorm play-test session.

As a child, my friends and I would collect and torture the various bugs that would wander through my back yard. We would squash them, collect them, burn them and so on.\nThe poor bugs never stood a chance. I really enjoyed destroying them as a child, but as I grew older I started to regret it. I think that's how most people feel. Or maybe not. But what if bugs really do have feelings? What if they could sense that we were about to kill them? Hmmm....\n(I'm the one on the coffin)\nI've always been a fan of scary movies. My dad took me to see Ghostbusters at the theater when I was 5. When Sigourney Weaver opened up the refrigerator I can remember begging my dad to leave. He spent a couple minutes in the back of the theater aisle convincing me to stay. And I'm glad I did. The enjoyment I found in that movie has stayed with me until this very day. \n(My love for horror movies came at an early age)\nAs a child, I always enjoyed drawing. My pencil and I became pretty inseparable. I imagined that one day I would work for Disney and spent every day recreating Disney characters.  In 1996 I graduated high school and enrolled in the illustration program at San Jose State University.\nIt was here that I became one of the \u201cShrunkenheadman\u201d and in 2001 I received the Society of Illustrator\u2019s Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge award. After graduating from college, part of me still wanted to work for Disney, but the other part of me wanted to create stories all my own.\nI came up with the idea for \"Don\u2019t Let the Dead Bugs Bite\" in 2004. I was playing around with the idea of a group of \u2018superhero\u2019 bugs and needed an adversary for them. The idea was originally for the superhero bugs to face off against a bad group of bugs that had died and come back from the dead. This quickly morphed into an origin story of how the bugs died and wanted revenge on the children that had squashed them. And with that, \"Don\u2019t Let the Dead Bugs Bite!\" was born.\nI recalled my childhood and my love of scary movies and decided I wanted to write a scary, but not too scary, book for children. Dr. Seuss was also a large influence of mine. I have always admired his writing style and wanted to emulate that style in my own writing.\nI have high hopes for \"Don't Let the Dead Bugs Bite!\"  I think this children's book is just the beginning. I have also written a full length screenplay and one day... one day I hope to sit back in and watch \"Don't Let the Dead Bugs Bite!\" on the big screen.\nI can't wait for everyone to read \"Don't Let the Dead Bugs Bite!\" I'm very happy with the way it turned out and I'm sure your family will enjoy it.\nAbout the Publisher:\nAll About Kids Publishing is an independent children\u2019s book publisher based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

(on social media web sites and applications) a word or phrase preceded by a hash and used to identify messages relating to a specific topic; (also) the hash symbol itself, when used in this way.\n\nOn August 25, 2007, a new word was born into our collective awareness. The \u201chashtag\u201d was invented to manage the growing torrents of social media information into conversations that would span the globe. Usage grew, social media exploded, and a new form of notoriety was created\u2014the social media superstar. Connected, adored, instantly validated, what\u2019s next for a celebrity when culture is nothing but clicks?\n\nABOUT THE FILM\nHashtag is a science fiction short \u2014 a sleek, smart, and sexy view of a world where social media dominates every moment of our lives. Hashtag follows \u201cX\u201d, the ultimate social media maven, a charismatic woman attracting the attention of tens of millions of online followers. \"X\" has attained everything she's ever wanted. She's #famous, she's #watched, and one unpopular move could mean the #end.\n\nHashtag is directed and co-written by Ben Alpi (Cowboy Creed, Silver Lining) who was inspired by a TED talk to write a story about our culture\u2019s obsession with speed. Ben approached veteran sci-fi writer, Kevin Rubio (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Ben 10, Green Lantern: The Animated Series, TROOPS), to co-write the script and the present incarnation of the script was born. Hashtag is an original, imaginative and thought-provoking tale in the wicked tradition of The Twilight Zone. Through the medium of classic science fiction storytelling, our writers weave a disturbing story of our all-too-possible future as a social-media society obsessed with virtual information and celebrity.\nStarring as \u201cX\u201d is Gigi Edgley. A superior and nuanced actress, Gigi is well known for her role as \u201cChiana\u201d in Syfy Channel\u2019s internationally acclaimed sci-fi series Farscape, and more recently as the host of Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop Challenge. She has also had a leading role in the Australian series, Rescue Special Ops and appeared in USA network TV miniseries, The Starter Wife. Well-versed in alternate realities, Gigi is skilled at creating amazing connections between our present selves and the \u201cother\u201d of speculative fiction.\nGigi Edgley will be 'X' in Hashtag\nA RETURN TO KICKSTARTER\nCowboy Creed, also written and directed by Ben Alpi, was successfully produced thanks to the support of generous Kickstarter Backers. Cowboy Creed (http://runicfilms.com/watch-cowboy-creed) did the film festival circuit and garnered two award nominations. Kickstarter Backers helped to create a completely independent, high-quality film, and now we need your help to bring an even more ambitious and timely film to the screen.\n\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP\nScience fiction is perhaps the priciest genre to put to screen because\u2014from sets to costumes and props\u2014everything has to be created to showcase a world that has yet to come. And that\u2019s in addition to the normal production insurance, stage and equipment rental, and crew costs. After the camera rolls, post-production services and detailed visual effects require additional funds to create a compelling and believable vision of the future.\n\nThe goal above is the minimum that meets our production needs.  Any additional funding above that level will help us make the film that much better!\n\nThat\u2019s why we want to bring you in as part of our team and help us to bring this beautiful and darkly textured film to light.  Please join us in this great endeavor and help us add to a long tradition of speculative fiction that explores the ever-evolving human condition.\n\nAlso, like our last Kickstarter, you\u2019ll get some really great rewards! Depending on your backer level, you can receive a copy of the finished film, the official poster, signed photos of the cast, an invitation to join us on the set of the filming and much more! Also, look for our Cowboy Creed Legacy Pack where you can score some great Western goodies.\nMEET THE TEAM\nWe have pulled together an amazing team of artists to make Hashtag a reality.  Producing the film will be Jyotika Virmani, Executive Producer of Cowboy Creed, along with Robert Alpi (Cowboy Creed) and Gigi Edgley (One Step Ahead, Nobody Knows). We will be working again with other Cowboy Creed alumni: Director of Photography, David Berry (Judas Kiss, Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II); Production Designer, Meg Savage (The Skeptic); Composer, Joe Terrana (Cuban Sandwich Crisis, The Gita, Magadog); Film Editor, Jeff Handy; Line Producer, Erik Goodrich (Beyond Scared Straight, Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II); and Sound Editor, Ralph Miller (Star Trek: Renegades, Judas Kiss). Joining this team is our visual effects supervisor, Deke Kincaid (The Chronicles of Riddick, The Water Horse, Pirates of the Caribbean series, National Treasure: Book of Secrets, Deja Vu).\n\nWe have the team. We have the knowhow. But in order to turn our concepts into reality, we need you to be a part of the team, too.\n\nKICKSTARTER FINANCE BASICS\nTo back the film, all you need is a credit card. Pledges are logged by Kickstarter and no money is charged unless we meet or exceed our goal. Kickstarter calls this all-or-nothing funding.  Once our Kickstarter is complete, each donor\u2019s credit card will be charged securely through Amazon Payments provided by Amazon.com\n\nUPDATES\nDon't forget to check out our Updates page to watch videos from Kevin Rubio (co-writer), Jeff Handy (editor), Meg Savage (production designer), and Joe Terrana (composer) on why they think this is a project worthy of your support!\n\nA BACKERS EXCLUSIVE REWARDS ADDITION!\nOur Backers have sent us a phenomenal number of messages of support! As a THANK YOU we will send ALL our Backers at the $30 and above level a set of Hashtag #MeetX Collectors Cards! You won\u2019t get these pieces of beautiful art anywhere else!\nHashtag #MeetX Collectors Cards\nSTRETCH GOALS DETAILS!\nBecause we have had such enthusiastic support from our Backers, we would like to introduce some Stretch Goals! First, we have many first time Kickstarter Backers so here\u2019s a quick definition:\n\nA stretch goal is a target for funding beyond the original Kickstarter goal. Meaning, our original goal is $40,000 but if we exceed that, this is what we\u2019ll do with any additional funds. As extra \u2018thank you\u2019s\u2019 we\u2019ll also be adding new rewards. Of course, the funds will be collected whether stretch goals are met or not, as long we meet our Kickstarter goal.\n\nSo, since we have achieved our original Kickstarter goal of $40,000, our stretch goals are:\nStretch Goal #1: NOW $44,000! (was $48,000)\nWhat you get: If we achieve this stretch goal, everyone who pledges at the $30 or more level will receive the digital soundtrack for Hashtag!\nWhat we\u2019ll do: Any funds we receive towards this stretch goal will help us to recover our fundraising expenses and will allow us to put those funds toward the film.\nAs we said, our Kickstarter goal is the bare minimum we need to produce this film. Out of the total funds you pledge, only 80% will go toward making the film. The reason for this is because 10% of the total goes towards Kickstarter and credit card transaction fees. We have budgeted another 10% for fulfilling rewards. So this leaves about 80% or $32,000 to put toward the actual making of the film - a film that will involve a cast and crew of about 35 people, equipment rental, set and costume design and creation, original music composition and recording, visual and other effects, as well as production insurance.\n\nStretch Goal #2: $60,000\nWhat you get: If we achieve this stretch goal, everyone who pledges at the $60 or more level will receive a very limited gold foil stamped Signature Collectors Card. This special edition card will feature a never-before-seen image of Gigi as X, emblazoned with Gigi's golden signature.\n\nWhat we\u2019ll do: Any funds we receive towards this stretch goal will be put toward key areas to improve the film. These include the rental of a larger/better equipped stage, the creation of a larger and more detailed set, and a more flexible shooting schedule. This will also allow us to hire more visual effects artists which means we finish the film faster and get it into your hands sooner!\n\n\nThank you kindly for your #Support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn addition to the expense of producing science fiction, there are additional risks and challenges when making a film, such as scheduling delays, equipment trouble, and other unforeseen costs.

We're the Doubleclicks. Thanks to this Kickstarter, we are going to make a lot of awesome things this year! Backers will be able to follow along on our progress on the CD, videos & more via updates! You can also check us out at http://thedoubleclicks.com and watch our videos on our YouTube channel! To be kept up to date on songs, the album, and our live shows around the country, subscribe to our e-mail list! \nThank you for unlocking all these stretch goals!\nFuture stretch goals:\nThere are more details about all of these goals below!\nHi, we\u2019re the Doubleclicks, and we write songs about things like dinosaurs, Dungeons & Dragons, love, books, and cats. We also have a cello, and we\u2019re sisters. You may know us from performing at conventions around the country, from many songs and collaborations (including the theme song for Cards Against Humanity), or from our big geek girl pride music video that came out last year, \"Nothing to Prove,\" full of amazing geek girls and some of our nerdy friends.\nWe want to make a new album this year called \u201cDimetrodon\u201d, featuring songs we've written over the past year, with studio-quality production and full-band arrangements. We also want to bring back our \u201cWeekly Song Wednesday\u201d music video project this summer. And to do these things, we need help!\nWe've got some rewards, many of which are exclusive to backers of this Kickstarter! We have t-shirts, dice, copies of the new CD, tote bags, custom songs (and mini meowing-themed-ringtone-songs), and even the opportunity to be immortalized in an art poster that is included with every CD! But even if you can only donate a little, you'll be contributing to our ability to make more and greater things, and we appreciate it!! \nThe more money we get, the more exciting things we can produce this year.  We have plenty of ideas on how to turn money in to FUN(ny). Funny? Yes. So take a look at the project, and please share it with your friends\u2014we can't do it without you! We are extremely thankful that you let us make music for you, and we want to do it forever. FOREVER. \n The Dimetrodon Album\nDimetrodon will be our 3rd full-length album and the second with a \"full band studio sound.\" We want to do this one bigger and better than any album we've done before. We'll be working with pros on the arrangement, mixing and production, including musician, comedian, producer and awesome human being Mike Phirman.\nMost of the songs on the Dimetrodon album will be our favorite compositions from 2013's Weekly Song Wednesday project, cleaned up, re-organized and arranged for a full-band sound. There will also be a couple brand-new songs on the album as well as some revivals from the Doubleclicks archives. \n\nWeekly Song Wednesday (unlocked!)\nThis is how WSW (Weekly Song Wednesday) works: we write a song, we film a video for that song, and we release these videos once a week on Wednesdays for some number of weeks. WSW is a songwriting exercise, a YouTube project, and a really, really fun way for us to make music and share it. Unfortunately, by itself WSW really doesn't break even, and without crowdfunding we just can't put the time and resources into the project to make songs and videos of the quality that we imagine in our brains. This year, we did Weekly Song Wednesday for 14 weeks, from September through December, and it was really fun. Dimetrodon was one of our favorite songs and videos from that project, check it out:\n \nIf we meet our initial Kickstarter goal, then, in addition to producing the album Dimetrodon, we will launch a new Weekly Song Wednesday project this spring/summer with new songs and videos that we can spend much, much more time on than we could last year. These videos could include good cameras, other people to hold the cameras (crazy, right?), props, costumes, and much more time spent on rehearsal, editing and doing lots of takes. Thanks to your generous backing, Weekly Song Wednesday will now be 10 weeks long instead of our original 5-week goal!\n-\n Monthly Song Monday (unlocked!)\nWe can't do Weekly Song Wednesday all year long: we need to tour, and sleep sometimes, and take breaks to recharge our songwriting muscles. However, we do want to keep releasing things, so at the $35,000 stretch goal, we will unlock a Monthly Song Monday project where we release a new song and video every month (on a monday). This will happen for 12 months, but we will pause this project during the months during which Weekly Song Wednesday is happening and re-start afterwards\u2014so this project will last for longer than a year.\n  Monthly Live-Streamed Internet Show (unlocked!)\nIn Portland, we produce a show called #NerdNightOut in which we fly in our favorite performers from around the country and do an awesome variety show. It happens every few months, but only locally. We'd love to put on a show with our friends and favorite performers everywhere in the world, but we can't. Or can we? If we unlock the $42,000 stretch goal, we will do a monthly live-streamed show (from March 2014 to December 2014). It will be part concert, part chat and part Q&A. We'll also invite our friends to be guests sometimes, so you can hear other people's songs and stories! It will be an Internet-wide Nerd Night \"In\"! (We're still working on that title). \n-\nMore awesome stretch goals UNLOCKED\nThe Doubleclicks coloring and activity book: UNLOCKED\nIf we reach this $55,000 stretch goal, we\u2019ll make a short Doubleclicks-themed coloring book with help from talented artists! It\u2019ll be a free PDF download for all backers who have selected a reward at level $12 and above, and will feature art by Molly Lewis (singer/songwriter/doodle genius), Ash Vickers (MegaCynics), John Kovalic (of Munchkin, Dork Tower & much more) and Lar DeSouza. There will also be activities included a Mad Lib by author John Scalzi! Here's a sample set of pages by the amazing Molly Lewis:\n\n\nAnimated music video: UNLOCKED!\nOur very first video was an animated one, created by the amazing Brad Jonas for our Dungeons & Dragons song. Since then we have wanted to create more, but we just haven't had the resources... until now? At $65,000 one of our videos for Monthly Song Monday videos will be ANIMATED, and it will likely be ADORABLE. Our animator is OnlyLeigh, animator, artist and creator of the excellent webseries FanGirls. Her showreel gives a good idea of how fantastic the video will be: \n\n\nKid's EP: UNLOCKED!\nAt $75,000, we will write and record a 5-song kids EP (for grown-ups, too) including songs about: science, history, and strong female characters, to be released in 2015. \n\nThere are many many people in the world more qualified to talk about gender issues than we are, but here\u2019s what I know: when I was a kid, in school and church and books, most to all of the heroes I saw were men. Media taught us that boys went off and had adventures and became doctors and scientists, and girls should find themselves a cool man who was a doctor or a scientist, and attract him by wearing uncomfortable dresses and losing weight. We want to make songs that tell a different story. Our goal with the songs on the new EP will be to teach you about things and people you don\u2019t usually learn about. People like Grace Hopper: a computer scientist who basically invented the compiler and, according to legend, discovered the first computer bug (it was an actual bug.) Grace & other awesome people will be featured on this EP, if it's funded. \nStretch Goal Freeeeeebiiiird!: UNLOCKED!\nWe can think of no better way to show our appreciation than to succumb to popular demand at the risk of our own sanity: we will cover Lynyrd Skynyrd's \"Freebird\" and make a video for you, and we will make it fun for ourselves and you. A download of our cover will be available in the 2014 song vault. \n\nCurrent Stretch Goal: $80,000 - UNLOCKED!\nThank you all for backing us like crazy!! Even now, your donations are going to help us level-up our music and videos all year. For a final bit of appreciation, we're gonna make you buttons! If we are mailing you anything: a CD, dice, or anything bigger, we will also send you a cool SHINY BUTTON with art by SOMEONE GREAT to show that you are an awesome Kickstarter backer.\nThe Dimetrodon CD physical package is very exciting for us: we are hiring amazing artist Kris Straub (who makes Broodhollow and Chainsawsuit), of whom we are huge fans, to make the album cover. Here's what his art style looks like:\n-\nThe cover art for the Dimetrodon album will be made by Kris Straub!\nThe physical CD will also include a pull-out mini-poster created by Lar DeSouza, artist of the webcomics Least I Could Do and Looking for Group. If you back at the \"Immortalization\" level, a caricature of you (based on one reference photo you provide) will appear in this poster with us!\n\nWe are creating three new Doubleclicks custom six-sided dice for this Kickstarter featuring images inspired by this album: a Dimetrodon, a cat, and an image of us, the Doubleclicks! These are designed by the amazing Brian Tatosky!\n\n\nThe 2014 Song Vault is a website where all the songs we write for weekly song wednesday and some other songwriting projects in 2014 will be available for download to backers who unlock it (at the Dimetrodon level and above). You may also find some demos, rarities, and other little ditties we think you'll find fun in this vault. \n\nT-Shirts and tote bags will feature a Doubleclicks design which is ONLY available through this Kickstarter! The art will be created by webcomic artist Abby Howard of Junior Scientist Power Hour and The Last Halloween! \nT-shirts will be available in adult sizes from S-3XL in a Gildan Unisex Ultra Cotton Tee (sizing) and S-2XL in a \"Ladies\" Bella Favorite Tee (sizing). Totes will be these jumbo eco-conscious numbers (take a look!). If you select the T-shirt and Tote level or add a T-shirt or tote onto another level for $35 additional, you will be able to choose any size of t-shirt, OR a tote instead, in a survey that we send out after this Kickstarter is over.\n\n  NEW: Dimetrodon Plush!\nIt's a little baby Dimetrodon plush!!!! This new, special, very exclusive, very cute plush was designed for this Kickstarter and will be individually made just for you by crafting genius Tally Heilke. The fleece Dimetrodon is approx. 17 inches long and soft and friendly. It may or may not eat sharks.\nDimetrodon and \u201cRawr, Velociraptor\u201d KNITTED HATS! A local here in Portland, Cathy of Frivolite Handcrafts, has created a knitting design for \u201ctoque\u201d-style hats with Dimetrodons and Velociraptors on them, and she will be making a set of them for this Kickstarter! You will be able to select size and style. \nDoubleclicks Dice Bags!\nThere are two different kinds of Doubleclicks dice bags! The first are made by Katrina Keller, made in your choice of Dimetrodon or Velociraptor, with or without \u201cThe Doubleclicks\u201d text. Yes, those are all adorable little pieces of fabric, painstakingly cut out and assembled.\nThe second kind of dice bags are gamer-tested, gamer-designed, gamer-approved flat-bottom bag from GeekyLyndsay of Dragon Chow Dice Bags. The one you order will have a Doubleclicks design, but the photos below show you what Dragon Chow bags look like.\n\nFor \"Kitty Ditty Ringtone\" and \"A Song For You\" awards: We are excited to write you a song, but we've got some rules. Subject matter can't be pornographic, illegal or offensive (to us.) We will have final subject-matter approval, but we will do our best to make sure you're happy with it, too. We retain rights to the songs and performances, but you can use them in whatever non-commercial context you'd like. If you have something very specific in mind, feel free to e-mail or tweet us before backing so we know for sure that we can give you what you're looking for.\n\nCircuit Bent Cat Keyboard: This reward is a custom-modified toy cat-shaped keyboard. It will be messed up just for you by our friend (musician, computer geek and electronics-tinkerer) using circuit bending. As a result, it will have a 1/4\" audio jack to be plugged in for recording and performance, and, when put into \"freak out\" mode, will make cool distortion-y noises to your command. You can read more in our Kickstarter Update about the keyboards. \n\nGame Night: If you back at this level, you'll get one spot at the gaming table with us for a 4-hour session of D&D! We'll do what works best for you: either a Google Hangout or an in-person game night in Portland. The game will be DM'd by our friend Justin Turner of gaming podcast GoingLast.net. \n\nHelpful Chart for \"who gets what\" in rewards:\nAdd-Ons\nDo you want some extra merch that's not included in a specific reward level? If you back at $25 or above, you can add on an item from the list below. Add on the appropriate amount to your pledge, and once the Kickstarter is over we'll get in touch to talk about what you want. \n- Kickstarter-exclusive t-shirt or tote bag: $35 / $45 int'l\n- Dimetrodon CD: $15 / $20 int'l\n- Set of 3 new custom Doubleclicks Dice: $10 / $13 int'l\nDigital Add-On:\n- Digital Doubleclicks Back Catalog $35\nincludes Lasers & Feelings (2013), Chainmail & Cello (2012), Beta Testing 1-2-3 (demo CD, 2010) and Christmas Ain't About Me EP (2012)\n- Plush Dimetrodons: if you want a Dimetrodon plush and have already selected another limited reward, which you *also* want to keep, here's the deal: if there are still plushes left after the Kickstarter is over, we will make them available as limited add-ons on a first fill-out-your-survey, first served basis. More information about that will be available when the Kickstarter ends.\nIf you want copies of our old CDs, old t-shirts or last year's dice set (with velociraptor, cello and guitar dice designs), you can buy those at our regular, non-Kickstarter merch store.\n\n\nHow the money is spent\n\nThanks are due\nThank you to to Paul (of Paul and Storm), Storm (of Paul and Storm) and Joseph Scrimshaw for the immense wonderful amount of advice that has made this Kickstarter rock.

Please take a second and watch it.\nThis is a mock-up of what our poster will look like. Everyone that backs us can get their photo on it. Even for just $1!\nThe Story\nHybrid Vigor is a feature film about life, death, violence, morality, immortality, love, and loss in the USSR during Soviet times and in present day Latvia. It opens on frozen Lake Baikal in Siberia during Soviet times. Most of the film takes place in present day Latvia. More details about the plot will be revealed in the coming months. \nProduction Status\nWe have already begun shooting. The photos you see on this page are from scenes we have shot. Hybrid Vigor is not being made like a normal film with a fixed shooting schedule and clear phases of production. We decided to use a more organic method of filmmaking. We may be editing scenes we recently shot while in pre-production for scenes we will soon shoot. Maybe we will shoot 2 days, edit 2 days, shoot 2 days and then take a break for a week or two so we can edit and prep the next scenes we will shoot. \nWe are organized and have a clear plan, but everything will be done in a very flexible way with a small dedicated crew and eager cast. This is how we are going to make this little film look as good as anything you will see in your local cinema and for less than the price of the catering budget on a \"normal\" film.\nHybrid Vigor is being made on location in Eastern Europe. One scene was shot in Estonia on a frozen lake on the Russian border. Most of the rest of the film is being made in and around Riga, Latvia.\nPrior to moving to Latvia I was living in Los Angeles and I didn't really like the direction my life was going. I had never left the US and wanted to get out and explore the world so I took a 10 day trip to Europe. One of the places I visited was Latvia. Immediately I decided I must make a film here one day. \nAfter I returned home from my trip, literally as I stood in front of my door with my suitcase, I stopped and said to myself, \"What am I doing here? I'm moving to Latvia.\" I immediately booked a flight and sold my car. A week later I was living in Latvia. I had absolutely no plan, but I had a very clear goal.\nLatvia is a small country with a population of just over 2 million people. It borders Russia to the East and was once part of the Soviet Union. Latvia broke free from Soviet rule on August 21st, 1991 and has been an independent nation state ever since.\nHybrid Vigor stars Velta Buka (top) in her feature film debut and co-stars Jevgenija Mirosnicenko (left) and Aleksandr Ivanov (right). All three actors are native to Latvia. No other parts have been officially cast yet.\nCurrent Cast\nVelta Buka\nJevgenija Mirosnicenko\nAleksandr Ivanov\nWe will have more casting news soon.\nMy Story\nMy name is Brandon. My first film was a low budget independent film I wrote when I was 18 years-old and directed when I was 20. The film co-starred Dee Wallace (The Howling, ET), Dennis Haskins (\"Mr. Belding\" in Saved by the Bell) and Joyce DeWitt (\"Janet\" in Three's Company). It was professionally done with a large crew of around 30 people and shot on 35mm film with Panavision cameras. Unfortunately the film negative and sound was stolen and the film has never been completed. I was able to recover the film negative, but was never able to get the sound. After nearly a decade of effort I had to accept that it was over.\nMoving On\nA few years ago I Executive Produced the critically acclaimed arthouse film Loren Cass. Variety called it, \"A starkly radical film debut of uncommon power and artistic principle.\" The New York Times said it was, \"Remarkable... One of the year's great discoveries.\" The film was solely the director's vision. I was just there to help support the talent I saw in him.\nIt's Time\nI learned a lot working on my first film and even more in the years since. I got my start as a writer/director in this business at a very young age, but lost more than 10 years due to my first film being stolen and unfinished. The last decade did not go to waste though. I made a plan for how I would make my next film and now I'm executing it. With your support we can make this film a reality.\nSummer in Latvia does not last long and we must shoot much of the film during this period. Our goal for this campaign is the absolute minimum we need to get the film \"in the can\". We certainly intend to raise more than our goal! We hope to raise enough money to fund the entire shoot and all of post production.\nWe are able to dramatically cut the cost of making the film because we own our own RED Scarlet-X camera, lenses, audio gear and some lighting. There really will not be much that needs to be rented. Also, in addition to producing and directing the film, I am shooting and editing and will be handling at least some of the visual effects work myself.\nWe plan to make a \"photomosiac\" movie poster using photos of all our backers. There will be a printable PDF of the finished poster available online for you to download. Once our project is funded we will send everyone that backed our film a request for a personal photo.
