When Kay and everyone at Oni saw the last version, we all shouted perfect (almost)! We sent the design back with one subtle but important change: Chamomile needs to be a lot grumpier. We need him to look like we accidentally woke him up from a really good nap and he is not happy about it at all. Once that change was made, we found our perfect Mountain Chamomile. \nThe Mountain Chamomile plushie and woven blanket shown are prototypes and the final versions may be slightly different. The final blanket will be 50\" x 60\". \nIf you're looking for add-ons, don't worry! We've got you covered.  If you back at any level (even the $1.00 pledge), you'll be able to add individual plushies to your pledge through Backerkit once the campaign ends, as well as the blanket, game, and books.\nPLAY\n\nOne of the greatest things about being in the comics and games industry is that throughout the year, we get the opportunity to interact directly with the fans at conventions all across the world. These events give us an outlet to create specialty items that we think fans will treasure, but that are prohibitive to make for retail. This year, we didn't have that opportunity, so many of the projects, like Mountain Chamomile, had to be postponed.\n\nWith Kickstarter, we have the ability to reach our fans directly and bring our creative projects to life. Literally every backer makes a difference and with enough backers, we can continue to connect with fans, share our process, and offer a variety of fun rewards.\nKay O'Neill is an Eisner and Harvey Award-winning illustrator and graphic novelist from New Zealand. They are the author of Princess Princess Ever After, Aquicorn Cove, The Tea Dragon Society, The Tea Dragon Festival, and Dewdrop, all from Oni Press. They mostly make gentle fantasy stories for younger readers, and are very interested in tea, creatures, things that grow, and the magic of everyday life.\nOni Press / Lion Forge Publishing Group is a premier comic book, graphic novel, and games publisher located in Portland, Oregon. Established in 1997, Oni Press\u2019s curated line includes a variety of award-winning original and licensed comic books and graphic novels, including: Adult Swim\u2019s Rick and Morty\u2122, Nickelodeon\u2019s Invader ZIM, Scott Pilgrim, Queen & Country, Courtney Crumrin, Wasteland, The Sixth Gun, Stumptown, Wet Moon, Letter 44, The Bunker, The Tea Dragon Society, The Coldest City, and Kaijumax.\nPlease note that shipping is not included in the prices. Shipping will be charged in the pledge manager based on where you live and on which rewards and add-ons you purchase. We've included a chart for estimated shipping costs with our reward levels and different shipping regions. Whenever possible, we'll bundle items together to save you shipping costs. \n\nPlease note that taxes are also not included in the prices. We are required to collect and pay taxes in specific states and countries. If ordering from California or Missouri, taxes will be added in the pledge manager. If ordering from Canada, VAT will be added to your overall purchase in the pledge manager.  \nWhat is Backerkit?\nBackerkit is a crowdfunding software tool that helps us make sure you get exactly what you want and are charged correctly.\n\nWhen will this happen?\nYou will get an email survey 2-3 weeks after the campaign is over providing a link to a Backerkit survey. In the survey, you\u2019ll add your shipping info and reward preferences and grab any add-ons to see the overall shipping and tax costs.\n\nHow much will I pay?\nThe total cost will be the value of all the items in your BackeKit cart, plus shipping and applicable taxes, minus what you were already charged in Kickstarter through your pledge.\n\nHow Much Do I Pledge Now?\nTake a gander at the banners on the right side of page and click on your preferred reward level. Looking for add-ons? No worries! As soon as you receive your email from Backerkit, you'll be able to add as many plushies, books, and blankets as your heart desires.\n Music: Bensound.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFor the Alpine plushie, we've been working closely with Kay O'Neill and the manufacturer to perfect the grumpiest face ever. \n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing. We're working with an established manufacturer, one we've been partnered with for three adorable plushies so far. We will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping, and if there are any delays, you'll be the first to know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nWe're using eco-friendly polyester and polyester fiber during manufacturing!", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wild Tea Dragon Spotter", "descp": "Support our campaign and follow our story!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["285 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 30 or more", "title": "Alpine Plushie Adopter", "descp": "The fluffiest and grumpiest tea dragon!\nShipping and taxes are not included in this price.

See the Licensing section for details!\nEngage the Nazi occupation of France in la petite guerre to throw off the yoke of the oppressors and free your homeland!\nMaquis is a solitaire worker-placement game with variable goals and a play time of approximately twenty minutes. The player places their resistance agents on spaces around town to achieve their goals - blowing up trains, publishing underground newspapers - but at the same time Milice collaborators and Wehrmacht soldiers patrol the area. Agents who can't make it back to the safe house at the end of the day are arrested, and never seen again.\nWith this new edition, we've added some new components to include some more difficult 3-star missions, some new spare rooms and resources, and made some tweaks to the rules & original components to improve clarity and gameplay.\nFor previous backers/customers who got the 1st edition, we have the option on this campaign to order the new components to add to your original game (Backer Level \"Maquis - New Content\"). They'll be fully compatible and will fit into the original box (with some maneuvering \ud83d\ude0a), or you can keep them in the nice tuck box they'll ship in.\nNOTE:  We only plan on printing what we need of the \"Maquis - New Content\" level so there is no guarantee that folks who don't back the Kickstarter will receive the new content separately. Don't miss out!\n\n\n\nTo begin, the player will set up the board, organize the game tokens and  randomly choose two mission cards that must be completed in the allotted number of turns.\n\nThe player will then shuffle the patrol deck and place it next to the side of the board. This deck represents where the Milice patrols will occur during each day.\n\nThe player will choose a location to send their first worker and assign one of their pawns there. They then draw a patrol card, and place a Milice pawn if able. This continues until all of the available worker pawns and Milice pawns are placed. If the Milice find your worker during patrol, they will be arrested!\nYour diligent workers are then free to perform their duties, working toward your two goals. Gather resources, recruit fellow patriots to the cause, and undermine the enemy plans to throw off the yoke of oppression and free your homeland!\n Downloads: \n(for 1st edition - 2nd edition files coming!)\nRulebook PDF\nPrint & Play\nTry it for free on Tabletop Simulator \nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through a pledge manager. \nThese shipping rates listed below are estimates and may change based on 2021 shipping rates & final production weights.

For backers in Australia & New Zealand, pledges will ship from within Australia (Aetherworks).\nFor our EU backers, all pledges will be fulfilled from the EU. We are closely monitoring what's happening with the trade deal with the UK and EU resulting from Brexit and we'll make sure that effective, customs friendly shipping will be available for everyone.\nFor backers in the rest of the world (including the US), pledges will be shipped from China either directly to you or through a local partner. This allows us to offer affordable shipping to everyone across the globe.\nAnd, for backers getting the English version, each additional copy you order doesn't increase the shipping cost! So if you order 1, 10, or 100 copies of the 2nd edition the shipping charge will be $6/$9/$15 depending on your location. :)\nNOTE:  These shipping estimates are for the English version only. We will work with our licensing partners to provide shipping estimates for those versions based on shipping locations. \nIt would be an honor to have Maquis on the shelves of retail stores!

In the PnP and first editions, the day track marks \"completed days\". This wasn't an issue for any of the original PnP missions, but some of the newer ones require you to complete objectives on or before certain days.

This project aims to fund the manufacturing of Zodiac Mermaid pins that I have designed. As of January 12, 2021 all 12 pins have been unlocked! My name is Jess of JellyJessBeans and you can find me on Instagram for more designs and art I make. I have experience making an enamel pin previously so I know what to expect from my manufacturer and have trust in their quality. if you would like to see my previous pin you can find it on my Etsy store.  You can also check out my design process and information about the Zodiacs on my TikTok. I have been drawing most of my life, and have decided I wanted to pursue my passion, so here I am! Thank you so much for taking a moment of your time to look at my campaign!\nThis project aims to fund the manufacturing of the below pins. The pins are all hard enamel, gold plated, at approx. 2 inches tall. They will have two pin posts and come with rubber clutches and will be sent with backer cards that are custom designed for each of the mermaids.\n In the line-up below you can see the pin artwork of each of the mermaids that will be sent to the manufacturers. Below them are each of the backer cards for each of the pins. The cards will be roughly 3 inches tall and will be white, with gold foil to give them that extra special touch! If you would like to see the illustrations of each of the mermaids, please head over to my Instagram to view them all!\n\nI am also offering freebies for certain pledge tiers!\nIf you order 6 or more pins, you will receive a 5x5 inch print of the illustration of each of the pins you want!\nThe initial funding target for the pins is $1300 which allows me to fund the manufacturing, shipping and fees on the first three of the zodiac sign pins! If this goal is exceeded we can start working towards unlocking the next nine pins! For those of you who are curious about how the costs get broken down or where the money goes here is a rough breakdown:\nPin Production: ~70%\nFulfilment and Shipping: ~20%\nKickstarter/Transaction Fees: 10%\n\nThank you for looking over my campaign! If you can't back the project right now, sharing this Kickstarter on social media is a great help! I'll be posting updates here and on Instagram!\nAll pins have been unlocked! Whether you pledge before or after they are unlocked doesn't matter, but you may miss out on the Early Bird specials if you wait too long! At the end of the campaign, regardless of when you pledged, you will be able to choose between any of the pins that we have unlocked. You will also be entitled to any additional freebies we have unlocked by the end of the campaign! This includes the Kickstarter exclusive 1.5 inch mermaid pin for free!\nI have even partnered with two Etsy shops to make custom designed pin boards for the project! They come in 13 inch and 18 inch variants which you can check out below the mermaids. The 13 inch board is being made by WhatsYourInnerGeek. This pin board is a thick, durable foam and has a wood backing. The 18 inch board is being made by UniqueCorkBoards. This pin board is made of cork like many boards you see in stores. I have linked their Etsy shops in their names if you want to go and check out their work!\nThese are custom designed, engraved pin boards, and are priced as such. The 13 inch board will cost $60 USD ($45 + $15 shipping & Handling), and the 18 inch board will cost $80 USD ($65 + $15 shipping & Handling).\nTo increase your pledge you can go to Manage Pledge > Update Pledge > Bonus Support > Confirm. I have also added 2 new reward tiers to get all 12 pins at a discounted rate that includes one of the pin boards!\nCapricorn, Pisces and Scorpio\nAquarius, Sagittarius and Virgo \nGemini, Libra and Cancer \nAries, Leo and Taurus\nKickstarter Exclusive FREE Mermaid Pin\n13 inch board on the left, 18 in board on the right\nSize comparison with my previous 1.5 in pin for size\nPledge Now, Pay Later\nOne way to think of Kickstarter is that it is a pre-order site! The benefit is that you can pledge now for the pins you want, and only pay at the end once we are fully funded; meaning if you need to back out before the campaign ends, you can! This means it\u2019s risk free for all involved! Once the campaign ends I will send out a survey allowing you to pick the pins you want.\nThe fees will not cover any import taxes or customs fees if you live outside the United States, so be aware of those if your country has them!\nJanuary 8: Kickstarter campaign starts and lasts 45 days.\nFebruary 22: Campaign ends, surveys are sent out.\nEarly-March: Funds received from Kickstarter and manufacturing can begin.\nEarly-April: Pins are finished! They are sent to me for grading (quality check) and packaging.\nLate-April: Your pins are sent to you! (Just in time for MerMay!)\nThese are all estimates and due to the pandemic situation delivery of the pins to myself, or to your home may be delayed. Be sure to check if you can receive packages from the US during the pandemic.\nIf you have questions, feel free to ask them! I will add any questions and their answers to the FAQ section as they are asked. If your question isn't answered there or you just need further clarification on something, feel free to contact me! You can get in touch with me through the Kickstarter messaging platform or via social media.\nEtsy\nInstagram\nTikTok: JellyJessBeans", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- If Kickstarter does not reach its goals, you won't be charged anything - your card will only be charged if we reach our goal and you don't cancel before the project end date.\n\n- Delay in pin production (due to errors or COVID-19)\n\n- Delay in shipping due to COVID-19 (USPS is experiencing delays, so please be mindful of this)\n\n- Small design changes (the overall look of the pin will stay the same but it may be necessary to make minor tweaks to metal line thickness or position of enamel to preserve the integrity of the pin)\n\n- Color differences due to Pantone matching and monitor colors\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "1 Mermaid Pin", "descp": "Special Kickstarter pricing! save $3.50 over retail price!

There's something about weird, interesting, emergent gameplay, shared incentives, and cubes stretching across a hex map that brings me joy.\nUnsure what a cube rails game is? That's okay. Some of the most popular titles are Chicago Express, Paris Connection, Irish Gauge, Ride the Rails, and more. These are 30-60 minute games of route-building, share-purchasing, & railroad-investing.\nWhile games in the genre can sound similar, cube rails titles have a long history of doing all sorts of weird stuff: 8 to 16-hour games of logistics in Union vs Central, the meta-think of Northern Pacific's player order, and the entirely wild random share ride of Erie Railroad.\nI wanted to do something different as well.\nCard Rails is a 3-5 player, 20-30 minute cube rails game played on a deck of cards. Instead of giving you a predesignated map, players together create the landscape of the game they are playing, blocking others and bettering their own positions, all while making the tough decision to keep a card for future financial gain or to garner an immediate reward.\n CARDS INSTEAD OF A BOARD? \nBased on player count, you will have a specific number of cards in hand. Each card is different and has lots of information on it. Cards are comprised of hexes, and there are different types of hexes:\nBasic green hexes\nPurple hexes that add value to the Railroad Company\nRed hexes that let you swap out cards in your hand\nBlue Lake hexes that block where you can go\nSpecial hexes with Railroad Symbols that majorly increase the value of a Railroad Company\nA Share of the Brown Company with a Red Swap Hex and an impassable Lake Hex in the middle\nA White share conveniently located in the middle of the card with a Purple +2 Value Hex just below it. But those two 1/2 Lake Hexes could be tricky to build around.\nON YOUR TURN: Take a Share or Build Track.\nTake a Share. This is how you get points. Without shares, you don't score anything!\nDiscard a card from your hand.\nTake an available share of a company. That's it.\nHowever, you can only have 3 shares in total.\nOh, and cards remaining in your hand at the end of the game also count as shares of companies, so discard wisely.\n\nBuild Track. This is how you increase the value of companies. Without high values, you won't score enough points to win!\nDiscard* a card from your hand.\nTake 1 or 2 cubes from any available Railroads and place them on the map, expanding their lines.\n*Are you building into a 1/2 hex (like the purple above)? Then play the card you were going to discard onto the map where you're building into. The hex on the card you play has to match, but nothing else does. Rotate the card to block your opponents.\nBuild into a Purple hex or a hex with that Railroad's matching symbol? That company's value increases at the end of the game.\nBuild into a Red Swap hex? Exchange a card from your hand for any discarded card.\nHOW TO WIN\nThe game continues until all players have a certain number of cards left in hand, dependent on player count. Then players:\nTotal up the value of each Railroad\nReveal the cards in their hands\nMultiply the Railroads' values with the number of shares they have (both as cubes taken earlier and the symbols of the cards in their hands).\nThe player with the highest total wins!\nRules Translations\nJapanese\nSpanish\nFrench\nPortuguese \nCard Rails is a 54-card cube rails game that comes with 60 8mm wooden cubes.

I am only making 100 copies of Card Rails. If you missed out, I'm so sorry. If this does well, it shows me there is a desire for these small box games. More than likely, I will open up preorders for a summer release, you know, when I'm not in the middle of being a public educator in America during a pandemic.\nDue to the volatile nature of the USPS right now, and because this is a short, small project, it's only shipping to the US.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

Thanks to the unexpected, stupendous support, PNP backers will receive W\u00fcrfel Pie, too! Thanks to a helpful friend, the rules for both games will also be available in French. \"Roll and write\" means that your game components and setup are minimal. \"PNP\" means that you will receive the PDF files for this game immediately after the campaign ends so you can start playing right away!\n The Picts, an ancient Scottish culture, were among several groups to have a hand in thwarting the Roman Empire\u2019s expansion, including the building of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. They were accomplished sailors, traders, and even pirates.\n\nStanding Stones is a blind bidding domino placement game by Benny Sperling. Yep, you read that correctly! Players will use one half of a domino to bid on an action card and the other half to complete a numbered action. The action cards will award resources, change how you use your domino, or allow you to do specific actions better. Players can even send a diplomat to visit another player\u2019s land and utilize one of their actions. Not only are you using diplomacy to do something you might be unable to do on your own, but you are also effectively blocking that action from their use that turn!\n The dominos are surprisingly tactical and wonderfully tactile. They really capture the theme for me when I stand them up on edge, looking every bit like the standing stones described in history and carved by the Picts. The stones represent your power and offer you more goods to feed into your resource converting engine.\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a demonstration video below:\n If you're like me, a major reason you love roll and write games is because they usually have solitaire modes of play. We have a special second sheet which drives an AI opponent designed to make your solo experience an engaging challenge. Princess Eithne will draft dominoes against you and send her emissary to try and slow you down every turn. \nBellow, Derik shows how to setup and play the solitaire version:\n  No problem!\nThe PDF files will include dominoes you can print with the rest of the game\nWe will have thematic domino cards available for purchase through The Game Crafter very soon\nSophia makes and sells incredible hand-cast resin dominoes. \n We met her on Twitter (@thesophia_509) and were absolutely floored by the gorgeous colors and textures she gets from her resin crafts. Her amazing dominoes made this Boston based artist an easy pick for our first community spotlight. Check out her store at PHIAART.\n Because support has gone so far and above expectations, we've rearranged our publication schedule to add Mr. Sperling's first (and my favorite) roll and write game to this project FOR FREE!\n\nW\u00fcrfel means \"dice\" in German. In this game, players are pushing their luck and trying to find the exact right combination of fillings in their pie and serving it up. Dice drafting finds the players hoping for just the right roll without their opponents snatching them away! Tricks and thoughtful play abound in this dice chucker. Is it easy as pie? Time will soon tell as you dig in for that first scrumptious piece!\nCheck out the rules, HERE, or watch a multiplayer demonstration below:\n Or, watch this one for the solitaire version:\n W\u00fcrfel Pie features art and graphic design by the incomparable Jason Washburn (Talon Strikes Studio). Be sure to put eyes on his latest releases as they are also looking and playing great!\n Benny and I have a passion for gaming and would love to publish these games in a format that is both fulfilling and inexpensive. As such, we realized that offering the files for players to Print and Play (PNP) at home was a perfect way to go! In fact, you don't even need a home printer. Since you'll have the PDFs, you can print at work, at a local print shop, or (like I often do) play straight on your iPad, Surface, or other tablet device.\n This unusual format (PNP) allows us:\n    To offer a low entry point into fun games produced on a regular, frequent basis with no extra shipping costs or delays.\n     The freedom to design wild, wacky, and wonderful ideas regardless of typical commercial viability.\n     The opportunity to connect creative creators and makers with a passionate community united by similar interests.\n Honest and responsive communication.\nDelivery immediately following the close of the campaign. \nA referral to at least one indie-maker in our community.\nMore projects just like this every month.\nAnd we\u2019d love to work with you designers out there!

We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 8 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that KTBG has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8-week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

Choose your side, grab your dice, and get ready to roll!\nKAPOW! uses buildable dice, allowing you to add and remove dice faces during the course of battle. This makes for a super-strategic dice-battling experience. With each roll, you decide how to attack, defend, and power up your character by choosing where to place your dice. \nThe battles get more explosive with each roll and as you gain more dice and dice faces. KAPOW! is simple to learn (roll and place), but has layers of strategy as you customize your dice pool and leverage the unique powers of the KAPOW! universe\u2019s heroes and villains!\nCheck out this gameplay video:\n And here is a video showing the Solo Play mode we've unlocked:\nKAPOW! Volume 1 & KAPOW! Volume 2 are each complete two-player games. \nJust pick the one with the characters you like best, or get both by selecting the TEAM-UP Tier to be able to play 2, 3, or 4 player games!\nPorcupine Mega-Hero Unlocked for the TEAM-UP Tier!\nThis is your chance to get Kickstarter Exclusives from previous White Wizard Games Kickstarters you may have missed!\nTo order an add-on, just increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. You will be able to specify exactly which add-ons you are getting using the pledge manager after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\nNote: If you ONLY want add-ons (like the Star Realms High Alert First Strike pack) but don't want any KAPOW!, back the \"Pledge Manager Tier\"\nThis Conversion Kit is for ONLY backers who currently own the first edition of KAPOW! It contains stickers to update your Player and Super Boards, plus the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero: Halfmoon and the Kickstarter Exclusive Mega-Villain: Sawmill Jackson. When purchased along with the KAPOW! Volume 2 Tier, your Stretch Goals will be upgraded to the TEAM UP Tier Stretch Goals.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Star Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Hero Realms game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Epic Card Game line.\nKickstarter Exclusive add-ons from the Sorcerer game line.\nAt the start of the game you will choose a hero or villain to play. Each comes with their own \"Super Board\" showing their unique powers, starting dice pool and health. \n\nEach round, players simultaneously roll their dice and secretly place them on their Player Board and/or their Super Board to attack, defend, or power up (gaining more dice and add faces to their buildable Action dice). \n All players then simultaneously remove their player screens revealing their boards.\nPlayer Board with dice.\nPlayers deal damage equal to their attack minus their target's defense. Reduce your opponent's health to zero to knock them out and win the game!\n\n\n\nEach set of KAPOW! comes with two high quality score dials!\nThis is the 2nd edition of KAPOW!. \nThe first edition of KAPOW! was designed and published by 2 Ton Porcupine in 2019. We met the game designers at the Boston Festival of Indie Games and were intrigued by this game. It felt super fast and thrilling with every play.\nWe fell in love with KAPOW!, and brought it into the White Wizard Games portfolio. We took the 1st edition to PAX Unplugged and PAX East,  where we ran tons of demos, and sold through the entire print run. \nThe White Wizard Games and 2 Ton Porcupine teams then combined forces to improve the game play, visuals and components of this already awesome game. In this Kickstarter you can get the new-and-improved second edition of  KAPOW! Volume 1 , and the ALL-NEW KAPOW! Volume 2. \nIf you already have the first edition of KAPOW! Volume 1, it is compatible with KAPOW! Volume 2. In the future, we will post a small second edition rules conversion supplement on our website.\nPLAY\n\n Shipping\nWe will be shipping to backers directly from fulfillment centers in The US, UK,  EU, Canada, Australia, and Asia.\nOur goal is to get product to our backers as soon as possible. When product arrives at one of our fulfillment centers, we will begin the process of shipping to backers in that region without waiting for product to arrive at other hubs. This means that backers in some regions may receive product before backers in others.\nIMPORTANT - For this Kickstarter you will be charged shipping separately after this Kickstarter concludes. This will be done via the pledge manager. What you are charged for shipping will be based on our actual cost to get your rewards to you from your region's fulfillment center plus taxes/fees we were charged to get your reward into your region.\nHere is an estimate of shipping cost by region. Keep in mind, this is just an estimate and cost will increase with add-ons.\nUSA (Contiguous 48): $12-$18\nAlaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico: $22-$54\nCanada: $17 - $27\nGermany $12 - $22\nRest of EU: $16 - $29\nUK:  $14 - $18\nNorway, Switzerland, Iceland: $35-$49\nChina, Macoa, Hong Kong: $18-$28\nRest of Asia $29-$59\nAustralia $20-$30\nNew Zealand  $25-$38\nRest of the World: $49-$89\nEU Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the EU. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUK Backers, please note: Your product will be shipped from within the UK. You will be charged VAT in the pledge manager.\nUSA Backers, please note: If you are in a state where White Wizard Games is required by law to collect sales tax(currently: Florida, Massachusetts, and New York), you will be charged sales tax in the pledge manger. \nUnfortunately, we don't ship to Afghanistan, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia, or Ukraine.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThese are exclusive items for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only. Kickstarter exclusives may eventually be remade with new art and/or language for general sale.\nThe Kickstarter Exclusive version will be forever identifiable by its original art and/or language.\nNothing is final until it is printed.\nAll art, materials, card text, and packaging pictured is subject to change. The final versions you receive may not exactly match what is pictured here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are veteran publishers with a lot of experience and great products under our belt, but we are also perfectionists. We will have the printer make samples, improve on those, make more samples, round and round as many times as it takes for things to be awesome. This means we may be late with delivery.\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this Kickstarter is December 2021, but please keep in mind this is just an estimate. We will work hard to ship your game on time, but our number one concern is that this product turns out great. If we have to delay delivery to improve the product, we will.\n\nAlso note COVID-19 has thrown off our production and delivery timelines a bit. Hopefully this won't be an issue when this Kickstarter is ready to ship, but it may slow things down a bit.\n\nWe are pretty active on the comments while the Kickstarter campaign is live, so we can get your feedback and input. Once the Kickstarter campaign ends we put our noses to the grindstone working on games, so we aren't on the comments nearly as much.\n\nOnce the Kickstarter campaign ends, you can expect an update about once a month letting you know our progress.

Eduardo Baraf is at the helm of Herbaceous Pocket to ensure it delivers Herbaceous' perfect balance of simple play, interesting moments, and wonderful art in a fantastic, tiny, package.   \n Keith Matejka (Thunderworks Games) - designer of Bullfrogs, Roll Player, and Skulk Hollow - created the additional rules for solo play, loved for its easy, rapid play.  \nHerbaceous is Zee Garcia's #1 relaxing game (and Mike Disilio's #4). The new, great way to experience Herbaceous with a cup of tea.  \n\n\nThe pocket edition of the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion includes Cinnamon, Star Anise, and Peppercorn and adds a little extra spice to Herbaceous' flavorful play. \nAll Kickstarter backers who pledge for Herbaceous Pocket Edition will also receive the Flavor Pack Mini-Expansion for Free. This expansion will be available for sale typically for $5 separately on BGG, at Conventions, the PFG Store, etc. It will not be packaged within the base game.     \nMy Mother Gives an Overview of How to Play the original Herbaceous - she has the prototype from our first KS.\nRodney Smith from Watch It Played teaches Herbaceous .

It is an absolutely delightful and very fast playing game that you can really do with just about anyone. This is the perfect game for high tea. \nBower's Game Corner: Herbaceous is a rock solid filler game - great family game, great game night game, great gateway game! \nHerbaceous: Pocket Edition is a Stretch Goal free campaign. We set out to make a perfect, pocket, edition of the classic game. Aside from size, card and component quality is in line with the original game.\n\n\n\nPFG worked with various partners to find a cost effective way to ship a single copy of Herbaceous: Pocket Edition internationally. Unfortunately, in a padded envelope, it is just a smidge too thick for international letter shipping. Therefore it is basically the same cost of shipping a small game (and there are a lot of additional shipping fees these days). \nHowever, since it is so small / light, it doesn't cost more to ship 2 or 3 copies in the same box. If you are outside of the US, I highly recommend buying the double or triple pack to split with a friend or give it as a gift. It is an easy, gateway game for almost anyone.\n> Herbaceous Pocket will be EU Friendly,UK Friendly, CA Friendly\nKeep up on Herbaceous\n                            - Follow Herbaceous on Facebook\nKeep up on Us\n                            - Pencil First Games, Follow Ed on Twitter\n                            - Dr. Finn's Games, Follow Steve on Twitter\n                            - BethSobel.com, Follow Beth on Twitter\n                            - Thunderworks Games, Follow Keith on Twitter\nBoard Game Aggregators\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGameGeek.com\n                            - Herbaceous on BoardGaming.com  \nIntro Video, Header & Lifestyle Photos: More Games Please, Follow Ross on Twitter ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n\"Herbaceous: Pocket Edition\" is Pencil First Games' fourteenth Kickstarter. \"Lift Off!

We are confident that you will get a game that you\u2019ll be proud to play AND proudly display on your game shelf.\n\nThe art and mechanics for In Too Deep are nearly complete. Once this campaign ends we will tie up loose ends and submit print files.\n\nIt is always possible that delays occur while a game is coming to fruition. This can happen for various reasons such as manufacturing issues, freight delays, and even importing the games to the various regions of the world, as we have recently experienced during this global pandemic. Although we have budgeted 11 months to bring this game to your doorstep, please know that these delays can change our timeline at various stages. Therefore our timeline is only an estimate. We are working to meet our goal to fulfill the game by the end of September 2021.\n\nWe will be using fulfillment partners from around the world so that we can ensure a fast and smooth operation. We have worked with all of these partners many times before, so we are optimistic that everything will go as planned.

Unfortunately the Endeavor: Age of Expansion campaign was delayed in some regions of the world due to Covid-19. We found ourselves just entering into our fulfillment phase when the world shut down. Although the fulfillment didn't go exactly as planned, we have been open and honest about the process, updating backers often.\n \u2022 Wide praise for production quality and gameplay development, as quality products is of the utmost importance to us. \n\u2022 Our designers and artists come to In Too Deep with many years of experience.\n\u2022 Customer service is key to creating a positive backer experience. We are here for you!\n\nOUR REFUND POLICY\n\nWe will refund your pledge within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, including all fees associated with the campaign. After that period, we will refund your pledge, no questions asked, minus all of the fees associated with the Kickstarter, payment processing, and our pledge manager. These fees cannot be recovered from Kickstarter/our pledge manager after two weeks of the campaign ending. This project is in CAD, therefore, refunds will be processed in CAD.\n\nWe want you to be happy! We promise to keep you in the loop every step of the way. If you have any questions, send us a direct message, email us at info@burntislandgames.com or simply comment on the campaign. We will get back to you as soon as we can.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nYour pledge must be confirmed within 6 weeks of our pledge manager email to you. If you do not confirm your pledge at this time, you agree that Burnt Island Games has fulfilled its obligation to you, and your pledge will become a donation. After the 8 week window, it might still be possible to get your game shipped, based on availability. It is so difficult for us to confirm shipping to different regions of the world when our numbers are in constant flux.\n\nIt is the backer's responsibility to provide us with the correct shipping address and to ensure it is deliverable by typical methods of shipping. Unfortunately we do not ship to PO Boxes. Backers who have provided an expired address, or incorrect addresses will be charged shipping a second time to get their game to them. There is always the possibility of a refund, although the Kickstarter and pledge manager fees are non-refundable.\n\nWe reserve the right to sell our games, for the purpose of keeping our company going, at any point through the production and fulfilment process.

The countryside is blossoming and you are in charge of it all. The last team of planners couldn\u2019t cut it, so the farmers turned to your team, the best of the best. If anyone can turn this little farm into a flourishing ranching community, it\u2019s you!\nAgropolis is a standalone Sprawlopolis game. What does that mean? Well it's more of what we built with Sprawlopolis, but instead of more cities, it's farms. It adds a few new twists (livestock and feed fees), and can be played on its own or combined with Sprawlopolis in a fun new way. \nAgropolis will be the 66th game to join our growing line of Wallet Games\nA quick note on Sprawlopolis\nWe've made over 60 Wallet Games by now and it's safe to say that there's something really special about Sprawlopolis. It has been nominated for the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game and Best Solo Game, was voted #31 in the 1-Player Guild's People Choice Top 200 Solo Games, and has received the Dice Tower's Seal of Excellence.\nIt's been a wild ride.\nIt's gone on to have multiple sold out printings, and is currently available in many languages from our publishing partners from all over the world. Once again, a very special game and we are really excited to expand on it. \nAnd now, a look at Agropolis\nIn Agropolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new farm from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. \nFirst, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game.\n\nIn this game, you will try to keep Pig Pens adjacent to your longest road, align your Orchards into specific polyomino shapes, and keep your Cornfields on the corners of the map.\nBut  not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they  also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the score that you need to reach in order to win.\n\nThe example above is just one of many, many combinations (816 to be  exact!). Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique  combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.\n\nA look at half of the scoring conditions in Agropolis\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing countryside, trying to score as many points as possible.\nPlayers will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.\nWatch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end.\nNew to Agropolis are the three types of livestock pens, each in two different configurations.\nAnd finally there's the Feed Fee: a fun (and optional) new way to raise the goal just a little bit, making for a tougher game.\nWhen all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.\nCan you meet the demands of the farmers, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate agricultural wonder? It\u2019s time to find out!\n\nDownload the preview PNP today at PNPArcade.com!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/collections/new-games/products/agropolis\nWe'll start with a little coverage of the original game, Sprawlopolis. It's been out for 2 years now and has slowly built up a stable of great reviews and video content. Here are a few of note:\nAnd now for Agropolis. \nhttps://whatsericplaying.com/2020/09/28/agropolis/\nhttps://www.dastardlydesignco.com/post/agropolis-dastardly-review-135\nhttp://www.purplephoenixgames.com/agropolis-preview/\n\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start.  So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Combopolis. \n\nUse this expansion to create the perfect mix of city and farm zones in a single game. It adds 6 cards with scoring conditions relying on both Sprawlopolis and Agropolis, along with a few really interesting new rules (you'll draw one card from each game, choose one to play, and then discard the other). It unlocks an exciting world of new combinations!\nFor a look at the Combo game in action, here's How Lou Sees It, starting at 13:44. Feel free to watch the whole video as well. :)\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\nWe usually handle add-ons exclusively through our website, buttonshygames.com, but since Kickstarter has implemented a new add-on system, we are trying it out. \nIf you want to add any of the following to your rewards here, you can do it right in your Kickstarter pledge.

(Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge level above.)\nOur 2020 $5 packages include an episode of Personal Space, a solo game that has multiplayer interactions. It's part roll and write, part campaign, part digital, part real life, part fantasy. There are stickers and everyone receives some unique cards and unique combinations of cards. It's been live for a few months now, and it's our most ambitious project yet and it will emerge throughout the year.\nIt also includes Trolling For Trouble by Mike Mullins. In your first month you'll get the 6 card starter kit and then each month after you'll receive a card to expand the game. Trolling For Trouble is a 3+ player bluffing and negotiation game where you play the monsters luring the heroes into battle.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something  extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of  the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the combo expansion here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Agropolis!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur two unfulfilled projects are moving along according to our updated schedule.

The goal in placing habitat tiles is to create contiguous corridors by matching rivers, prairies, wetlands, forests, and mountains. Once habitats are placed, players populate them with the wildlife species that each habitat supports. Each species has their own spatial requirements and connections to one another and their ecosystem! \nCascadia is a modular, dual-layer puzzle, with variable scoring conditions that is simple to learn, but challenging to master!\nCascadia comes with a variety of spatial wildlife goals allowing you to mix and match new challenges each and every time you play! There are hundreds of unique puzzles to explore! Create stunningly beautiful terrain maps as you build your own personal environment, while competing with others for the habitats and wildlife you desire!\nKickstarter backers of Cascadia receive a set of 5 Tarot-sized Promo Wildlife Scoring Cards FREE! With the addition of these cards, players will be able to mix and match even more goals. These promo cards are a special THANK YOU to all backers for being early supporters, and will not be included with future copies of the game!\nWant to learn about Cascadia in just 1 minute? Check out Board Games In A Minute's quick overview!\nCheck out this How-to-play video by AnnaMaria of Girl's Game Shelf!\nLearn all about Cascadia with Theo from Geeky Gaymer Guy in this game overview!\nSolo Mode\nCascadia can be played solo! The solo mode elegantly simulates a 2-player game experience by turning the tile and token drafting into a cascading market. Players must make difficult decisions about which tiles and tokens to take, as each turn brings changes to what is available. The solo mode is a quick and relaxing experience that is simple to learn, and does not require the upkeep of an AI player, while still offering interesting puzzly choices and challenging thresholds to overcome.\nGavin McGruddy of MyAutoma has uploaded a great browser-based demo of the Cascadia Solo Mode, so that you can try it out for yourself! This demo will let you play the recommended starting group of Wildlife Scoring Cards! Challenge your friends to see who can get the highest score! Try it out here!\nCascadia also has a Family Variant! If you are playing with children, those new to gaming, or you just want to make the puzzle a little simpler, you can play with the included Family Variant Wildlife Scoring Card. This streamlines the wildlife scoring so that each animal scores in a similar way, reducing the number of different scoring conditions to learn, while still offering challenging puzzly gameplay. In addition to the Family Variant, the Wildlife Scoring Card features a flip side with an Intermediate Variant. This mode increases the challenge of the spatial puzzle a bit, without adding more complex scoring conditions. \nWith this range of gameplay modes, Cascadia can be tuned to offer different game experiences to different players, depending on experience level.\nCascadia provides a fantastic mix of approachable game play with strategic depth. It is a natural follow-up to our wildly successful first publication, Calico! We wanted to provide fans of gorgeous puzzly games another easy-to-teach, yet challenging-to-master game. Our collaborative team has worked hard to make Cascadia an accessible and exciting game for a range of audiences.\nWhile it can be a fun gateway experience for new gamers, it provides more experienced players with variable goals, tension of managing habitats and wildlife simultaneously, and a great mix of long-term strategy and short-term tactics. This makes the challenge and reward of each puzzle extremely satisfying! We are very proud of the gameplay and quality of the product.\nWe know that gamers love sharing the hobby with their friends and family and Cascadia is the perfect game to do just that!\nThe members of our team have years of experience working on a number of successful projects, from Point Salad to Overlord! What we think these games all have in common is their attention to detail and focus on great gameplay and amazing product quality.\nLast year, 6,724 backers joined us on the journey that made Calico possible. Since then, the game has received various accolades - from being one of the most anticipated abstract games of 2020 on Boardgamegeek.com, to praise from countless reviewers.\nThe Dice Tower gave our first game, Calico, their prestigious Seal of Approval!\nSince this is only our second published game, Cascadia does not currently have access to broad distribution in order to be available in retail stores. This means Kickstarter is your first and best opportunity to bring Cascadia home! The Kickstarter Edition comes with free promo cards that will not be part of a standard retail edition, even if the game does make it into distribution.\nOur philosophy is that our backers are major contributors to our passion and our business. We do not take this lightly, and we know there is always risk in backing a crowdfunding campaign. Because of this, we want to make sure that our backers get the best possible experience and we show our appreciation for their early support. The pledge levels you are backing this product at are set to give you the greatest possible value, as well as subsidized shipping, as our way of saying thank you for your support. You are all special, and have a big hand in the success of the game - we can\u2019t do this without all of you, and we appreciate that! \nWe also look forward to chatting with you about the process and the game overall. We are focused on you and anything we can do to improve the backer experience!\nRetailers\nCertified brick-and-mortar retailers interested in backing can reach out through our website form (www.flatout.games/cascadia-retailer). Interested retailers will be invited to our pledge manager after the campaign has ended.

We believe that we are presenting you with a complete and refined game that is fantastic, right out of the box. However, there are plenty of component upgrades and little extras that simply will not be possible without a larger initial print run. \nAs we get funding, we\u2019ll be going on a trek together! As our numbers grow, we will be reinvesting extra money into upgrading the quality of the game components and finding fun bonuses along the trail!\nThe more funding we can achieve as a team, the better everyone\u2019s copy of the game will be, so please share this project so that we can get the game \u2018to the peak\u2019! \nWE DID IT!\nThanks to all of our amazing backers, we have reached the peak and the game has been fully upgraded with all of these fantastic extras!  \nCheck out Rahdo's Final Thoughts on Cascadia!\n Check out Jeremy's Final Thoughts of Cascadia on Man vs Meeple! \nCheck out Fiona and Amy's Review at The Game Shelf!\n Check out Eric's Review at What's Eric Playing!\nSee why Cascadia earn's Steph's Super Rainbow in her review!\nCheck out Tantrum House's Overview Video with Shantelle and Sara!\nCheck out Slickerdrip's First Impressions of Cascadia!\nWatch Theo's Overview of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Our Family Plays Games has to say about Cascadia!\n Check out The Cardboard Kid's Review of Cascadia!\n Check out Eric's Cascadia Review at The Cardboard Hoard!\nCheck out Marti and Sarah's Review of Cascadia at Open Seat Gaming!\n Check out Brian's review of Cascadia at Colorblind Games!\n Check out Jonathan Liu's Review at GeekDad!\nCheck out Plumpy Thimble's Review of Cascadia!\nCheck out what Ruel had to say about Cascadia on the Projects We Love Video! \nCheck out Andy's Review at Meeple Mountain!\nCheck out Jess's preview on Gameosity!\n Check out Ken's Review at Geek-Craft!\nCheck out BJ's interview with Molly and Shawn on Board Game Gumbo!\n\n\n We know that part of the challenge of backing a Kickstarter campaign is that there is a considerable cost attached to shipping games from our manufacturing partners directly to your door. We would like to help with some of that burden, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers.\nDuring our last campaign for Calico, we subsidized over $20,000 in backer shipping charges to help pitch in, and we're continuing with that trend here.\nShipping will be charged in our post-campaign pledge manager. Using the pledge manager, you will be able to confirm your rewards, confirm your address, and finalize your order. We have included shipping estimates for some common geographical areas in the chart below. Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances. The game will ship in 2021 and there is some uncertainty about how much global shipping will rise over the next year. We are dedicated to getting you the best possible value for shipping and are committed to shouldering a portion of the burden of shipping the game to you. We will provide customs friendly shipping to the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. \nBacking for additional copies of the game will offer lower per-unit shipping costs.\n\nFlatout Games is a board game design collaborative founded in 2017 by members Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. As a design collaborative, they have several designs under their belt, including the 2019 Dice Tower Family Game of the year, Point Salad (2019, AEG); Truffle Shuffle (2020, AEG); Public Market (coming 2020 from Talon Strikes Studios); and Dollars to Donuts and Abstract Academy (coming 2021 from Crafty Games).\nWhat's this 'CoLab' all about?\nIn early 2019 Flatout Games opened its doors to create The Flatout Games CoLab. The CoLab is an opportunity for the founding members of Flatout Games to team up with awesome established and emerging folks in the board game industry and make cool things together. In 2019, the CoLab brought you Calico, which had over 6,000 backers on Kickstarter, and our team is back together, with our new member, Randy Flynn on board!\nOur approach is to build the best possible experiences by involving everyone in the entire process. We strive to build passion in each of our collaborators through shared efforts and shared profits. This publication of Cascadia is a passion project of everyone involved, and we are all part of an interconnected team - we take risks and are rewarded together. We hope you will join us on our journey!\nLet's Meet the Cascadia Team!\nThe CoLab teamed up with Beth Sobel to bring you the artwork in Cascadia! You can check out her work here!\nDylan Mangini, our graphic designer makes amazing board game apparel as well. If you're looking for some sweet new threads, check out www.teebletop.com!\nFlatout Games is focused on creating innovative and elegant game experiences. We love puzzly games with simple rules, high replayability, and great tension! Players\u2019 options and decisions should be complex, rules should not be. We love products that are immaculately detailed, and designed with clarity and simplicity at the forefront.\nWe would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to people who have helped make Cascadia the amazing game that it is today!

We would love to bring it to life, and with your help, we can make that dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery project has its risks - there are plenty of circumstances within and outside of our control that could come up. Since this is our second crowdfunding campaign, we have the experience of a successful campaign under our belt. We have also done our homework and been actively engaged in reaching out to others who have been successful. We are Superbackers ourselves, proving our commitment to the amazing community on Kickstarter, and we have followed along on many other campaigns. In addition, the members of our CoLab have been involved with a number of successful campaigns in the past, so we feel we have positioned ourselves with the knowledge and experience required to make sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nWe have already done a considerable amount of the legwork involved in getting this game made and getting it into your hands. We have completed design and development, nearly completed artwork, and lined up manufacturing and logistics. We have a plan to get the game completed to the highest degree of quality and get it in your hands as soon as possible.\n\nWe are also committed to being open and transparent about our process and the challenges and triumphs associated with it.

We take great pride in the quality of our games, since we know that a well-made game is one that will stay on your shelf and provide many hours of enjoyment without becoming dated and ending up as waste.\nReusability and recyclability\nAt Flatout Games, we strive to use reusable and recyclable materials whenever possible. This production of Cascadia uses cardboard and wooden components that not only look and feel great, but are easier to recycle. We also try to avoid the use of plastics in packaging and shipping materials in order to reduce our impact.\nSustainable materials\nFor the production of Cascadia we chose to go with simple materials (cardboard and wood) because they are relatively easy to source and they can be produced with very little waste byproduct. Avoiding using plastics that consume fossil fuels and focusing on renewable resources like forestry products helps us to reduce our impact.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe shipping and fulfillment of this project will be carried out by multiple regional fulfillment centers around the world to reduce the overall energy expended to get games to backers.

Through careful planning and placement, the aim is to make the most money from selling your buildings.\nThe city is populated by increasing numbers of people (wooden meeples), each with their own preferences. These hipsters, tourists, shoppers, and parents increase the value of any buildings they occupy, and they move from street to street as they are scored. You'll need to locate your buildings carefully and attract the right crowd to earn more than your opponents!\nLay tiles and influence people!\nSome of the building tiles found in Streets.\n\nYou can download the draft rules here. The final rules will look much nicer!\nStreets is really easy to teach! If one person knows the rules, you can open the box and be playing in less than 5 minutes. Here's the basics:\n1. On your turn, place a building into the city.\nAdd meeples according to the colour and number of icons at the bottom of the tile you played. You'll also add an Ownership Token in your player colour.\n2. When a Street is Enclosed, all buildings in it are sold for money.\nCalculate how much each building is worth based on the Valuation in the top right corner, adding $1 for every meeple.\n3. Meeples move to new buildings.\nThe player who enclosed the street moves the meeples on it to new buildings of matching colours on unenclosed streets. Meeples who can't move stand up and get FOMO (fear of missing out), and they'll move immediately to matching buildings when new ones are built.\n4. Earn the most money to win!\nThere are lots of opportunities to create scoring combos, and to profit from other players' buildings. The number of meeples in play increases as the game goes on, raising the stakes and the tension! Though the game is suitable for new gamers, these dynamic mechanics create a lot of depth that seasoned gamers will enjoy.\n The Business expansion makes use of the icons on the top left of every building tile. Each building has one or more Home, Shop, Restaurant, Recreation, or Wild icon on it.  \nBusiness tokens and some of the tiles that generate them.\nWhenever a street is scored, every player with a building in that street gets to take a business token matching the icon on one of their buildings. At the end of the game there's a $10 bonus for the player with the most tokens of each type, and $10 for every set of all four tokens.  \nA simple addition to the game, but a big change to the way you'll play! Included in every copy of the game are seven Consultant cards (70x120mm tarot size) which give each player a really powerful and unique special ability. Deal one Consultant card out at random to each player during setup and you're good to go! \nSix of the seven Consultants that come with the game.\nBoth of the expansions are optional, and we recommend playing without either of them the first time you play, or if you're playing with a group that prefers simpler games. The expansions add extra crunch to the decisions you'll make as you play!\nRahdo's reaction to playing with the expansions.\nA game of Streets in progress.\nStreets can be played by one player versus an AI opponent called The Grifter, using a simple set of rules and no extra components. You can find more information on this in the draft rulebook.\nYou can watch a full solo mode playthrough video on our YouTube channel.\n\nMore building tiles - they're the same in standard and deluxe editions.\nWe've taken great care to ensure that Streets offers excellent value for money right out of the box, and we've come up with a number of cosmetic and usability upgrades to both editions of the game that we can include even at the minimum funding goal. Rather than throw everything at you at once, we'll reveal these additions as the campaign goes on. Since we've already budgeted for them, they won't be tied to the overall funding level, but we will make you work for them :D\nNew artwork will be revealed below...\nThe more copies of the game we order from the factory, the cheaper they become. We can use those savings to add some cool new content for backers at no extra charge. The more backers who join us, the more extras we can include for everyone.\nIn short, more backers means more free stuff for everyone! The free promo pack is our way of saying thankyou to backers for supporting this campaign. After the campaign it will only be available direct from Sinister Fish Games at an appropriate price plus shipping.*\n* The deluxe edition and promo pack will be available in limited numbers from retailers who back this campaign, but it will not go into general distribution, and there will be no restocks.\nThere are two versions of Streets; standard and deluxe. They both contain exactly the same gameplay content, but the deluxe edition has some upgraded components.\nScreen printed wooden ownership tokens (same in deluxe and standard editions).\n\nDeluxe wooden money tokens.\nDeluxe meeples.\nDeluxe business tokens.\nThe creators of these videos were paid to showcase the rules and components of Streets. These are not reviews of the game.\nIf we reach our funding goal, all pledge information will be passed over to our partners at BackerKit after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Their pledge management system allows backers to pay for shipping, to confirm or update their shipping address, upgrade or downgrade their pledge, and add extra items.\nIt is necessary for every backer to confirm their details in the pledge manager in order to receive their rewards. We'll give clear instructions on how to do this when the time comes. It's quite simple, you'll just need to keep an eye on our updates after the campaign ends.\n We are making the previous game from Sinister Fish and Haakon Gaarder - the Golden Geek Award nominated Villagers - available as part of this campaign. You can pledge for it (and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack) alongside the standard or deluxe copy of Streets by selecting the relevant pledge level here on Kickstarter. Villagers will also be available as an add-on item in the pledge manager.\nVillagers was a nominee in the Golden Geek Awards for Best Card Game of 2019\nBackers in the United Kingdom will receive their copy of Villagers and the Kickstarter Expansion Pack in October / November 2020 as we have stock in our UK warehouse (aka Dave & Carly's garage). Shipping is free for this.\nBackers outside the UK will have their copy of Villagers and Expansion shipped at the same time as Streets, with shipping charged separately in the pledge manager. See below for shipping cost estimates.\nWe are not reprinting the Villagers playmat or Coin Chest at this time.\nWe will charge backers for shipping after the campaign ends, closer to the time we actually ship. We'll do this via BackerKit, our pledge manager.\nInternational shipping prices are currently volatile because of the pandemic, and there are surcharges applying to many destinations. We want to minimise the chance of the final price we pay being significantly different to the price we quote now. By doing this we'll be able to give backers the best possible shipping price. On top of that, we will subsidise shipping by \u00a33 (about $4 / \u20ac3.50) for every backer, and UK shipping will be free. Wherever practical, we will pay local taxes and import costs. See the table below for more information.\nTo help us offer the best prices to our backers, we will send rewards from various shipping hubs around the world. Everything is subject to change, but our current plan is this:\n Sinister Fish Games (that's us!) will ship to the UK.\n Meeple Logistics will ship to all EU countries, plus Iceland and Switzerland.\n Pick & Pack Logistics will ship free of tax and customs to Canada\n Grimfield Games will ship free of tax and customs to Norway.\n Flat River Group, our retail distributor, will ship to the USA.\n VFI Asia will ship everywhere else.\nWe are investigating a better option for Canada - the deluxe version exceeds the import tax limit, which we'd overlooked previously. \nDue to pandemic related restrictions, we cannot currently offer shipping to India. We hope the situation there improves soon.\nWe will deliver the game as soon as is practical for each region. Not everyone will receive their pledges at the same time. We will delay the retail release until pledges have been shipped, but we can't guarantee that everyone will have received their pledge before the game appears in stores. \nIf your reward is lost or returned to us we will send a one-time replacement free of charge. If your reward is returned to us due to you submitting an incorrect shipping address, we will ask you to cover the cost of reshipping it. Lost rewards (that are not returned to us) with incorrect shipping information cannot be reshipped or refunded. Before your reward is shipped you will be able to check that your address information is correct and to update it if necessary.\nStreets is available to play online right now via Tabletop Simulator, which is available on Steam. You can play solo, or with up to 4 other players. Just follow these links and subscribe so you can download the necessary files.\n1-2 players\n3-5 players\nSetup instructions and a link to the rulebook are provided.\nStreets is available to back at retail level by physical stores only. Retailer information can be found here.\nWe recognise the urgency of the climate crisis, and we want to try and minimise our environmental impact. We are planning to use FSC certified wood products in Streets, and we aim to partner with an established tree planting organisation to overcompensate for the greenhouse gases generated by the manufacture and transport of Streets. We will share more details later in the project.\nThe price of the game includes a small allowance for the increased cost of FSC wood.\nAll tree planting expenses will be borne by Sinister Fish Games.\n If you'd like to keep up with Sinister Fish, we can be found at the following:\nFacebook\nInstagram\nTwitter\nYouTube\nTwitch\nDiscord\nAnd specifically for Streets:\nStreets Facebook Group\nStreets on BoardGameGeek\nStreets on SinisterFish.com\nSinister Fish Games is a small family business with one full-time employee, one part-time, and one toddler. We will do our best to answer support requests during office hours (GMT) on weekdays. We can't guarantee an immediate response, but we answer every message and we will get to you.

As long as we remember that there's a real person behind every username, and treat each other with respect, then it's all good.\nStreets has been a labour of love for the following humans:\nHaakon Hoel Gaarder is the game designer, artist and graphic designer behind Streets and Villagers. He has a background as an animator, specialising in character design and infographics, using animation to communicate complex subjects in a fun and simple way. Haakon lives in Oslo Norway, and loves exploring large cities. This love of urban life inspired him to make Streets.\nHaakon has recently started using Instagram, where he shares behind the scenes content and bits of trivia about his work.\nDave is the owner of Sinister Fish Games, publisher of Streets and Villagers. He has had various careers, more recently in print & signmaking, graphic & web design, and making leather armour & props for film & cosplay. He has been running Sinister Fish full time since 2017. He lives in Lincoln, England, with his partner, their son, and one and a half cats. \n Carly plays an important role in the day-to-day running of Sinister Fish, including customer support, event organisation, planning, and office management. A keen negotiator, she once talked her way free-of-charge out of a Vodafone contract with 18 months left on it. She lives in Lincoln, England, with her partner, their son, and one and a half cats.\nFollow our progress on KickTraq!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a good working relationship with our Chinese manufacturer, Whatz Games, who we've been working with for several years.\n \nAs with any Kickstarter project, the usual risks apply.

Players take the role of fantasy heroes: facing challenges, adventuring through the realm of Ulos, and making decisions that change the story \u2014 and the kingdom \u2014 forever.\nAfter a thousand years of peace, Dragul armies raided from the north, prompting you and every other loyal citizen of Nalos to sign up as soldiers of the King\u2019s Guard. The armies of Nalos fought long and hard against the North\u2019s monstrous generals and their minions, finally turning the tide of the Dragul Invasion.\nIn each of the game's 12 storybooks, you\u2019ll be asked to make choices, complete skill checks, and fight battles that will permanently alter the world of Ulos for that adventure and in future adventures. You\u2019ll find new allies, make enemies, and uncover secrets that will change the world around you.\nWhatever choices you make, someone will remember \u2014 and respond.\nChoose from one of 21 pregenerated characters, or import a favorite Roll Player character and take them on a heroic journey. Each character brings unique attributes, starting cards, class abilities, and backstories to your adventure.\nPregenerated Characters\nImporting Characters from Roll Player\nRoll Player Adventures does NOT require the Roll Player base game or any of its expansions to play, though it\u2019s possible to import characters generated in Roll Player using any number of its expansions. Do you have a favorite Obnoxious Saurian Fighter who grew up as a Street Urchin from your last game of Roll Player? Bring them along\nEach of the 17 races and 36 classes have unique portraits and class abilities in Adventures!\nConvert your attribute scores and use them to build dice pools during your adventure!\nEvery market card from Roll Player has a new dice-manipulating counterpart in Roll Player Adventures!\n Note: Roll Player products will be available individually in the pledge manager.\nRoll Player Adventures has 11 adventure books that form a continuous campaign, and 1 infinitely replayable sidequest that can be played at any time. In a session of Roll Player Adventures, you\u2019ll explore a new area of the world of Ulos, represented by a unique adventure map. As your party travels around the map, you\u2019ll read aloud from that adventure\u2019s storybook and choose how you\u2019ll approach each encounter.\nDuring your adventure, you'll encounter strange creatures, solve puzzles and mysteries, and discover new areas of the map to explore.\nRoll Player Adventures blends an immersive branching narrative with cooperative skill checks and combat encounters. These dice placement puzzles echo the satisfying, puzzle-solving features of other Thunderworks Games hits such as Roll Player and Cartographers: A Roll Player Tale. In each combat or skill check, players manage their resources to fill dice slots with dice of specific colors and numbers. With clever play and the players can attempt to overcome the obstacles on the path of adventure.\n\nSpend stamina from your character\u2019s attributes to add specific colors of dice to the dice pool: \nThen play cards from your hand to manipulate the dice and solve the puzzle:\nIf you lose a combat or fail a skill check, there\u2019s no replaying a scenario or rolling up new characters. You now need to deal with the consequences of your failure, and see how the world changes in response. Even death is a new adventure \u2014 with its own 10-encounter storyline.\nRoll Player Adventures has several systems dedicated to remembering the results of your actions. Together, they represent an incredible amount of responsiveness from the game world to player choices. Importantly, these systems also can interact with each other, giving nuance to relationships \u2014 you may choose to gain a temporary ally in an adventure, but be regarded by them differently because you\u2019ve offended their faction in the past.\nAt the end of each adventure, you\u2019ll spend your earned gold and experience points to advance your characters, improving your party for the next adventure. There are 100's of unique abilities to discover and many ways to specialize.\nWant to try Roll Player Adventures for yourself? You can play through a draft of Adventure 1: Battle at Blacklake on both Tabletopia (Free!) and Tabletop Simulator. \n Rahdo Runs Through - Runthrough\nThe Nefras's Judgement expansion is available as part of the Immortal Knight and World of Ulos pledge levels. In this expansion, Nefras, the Snake of Years, will judge each character in your party as they make personal choices that are woven through the storyline of your campaign. Uncover your backstory and choose your alignment in Roll Player Adventures: Nefras\u2019s Judgement.\nDuring a campaign including Nefras's Judgement, each character in your party plays through one unique backstory quest that spans across multiple adventure books.\nFor example, if a character in your party had a \u201cDetective\u201d Backstory, you might slowly uncover clues about a murder, scattered through the adventures in the main campaign, finally either solving the mystery or sending an innocent insectoid to Kulbak prison in the storyline's climax.\nWhen setting up the Nefras\u2019s Judgement expansion at the start of a Roll Player Adventures campaign, players can use the backstory provided with a pregenerated character, or they can import the backstory and alignment from a character built using Roll Player.\nAs with previous projects, we'll be shipping all pledge levels from reputable fulfillment partners around the world. This project is EU, UK, CA, and AU friendly. This means that rewards bound to those regions ship from within their respective regions so backers in those regions will not pay any VAT, customs, or duties on their games upon arrival at their address. Outside of these areas, we cannot guarantee friendly shipping.\n    ------ PLEASE NOTE: SHIPPING IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PLEDGE PRICE ------\nShipping will be charged in the pledge manager at the conclusion of this Kickstarter project based on pledge level and region.

Here's how you play!\nThe Thunderworks team has been working on this project for over three years. The scope is bigger and more ambitious than any project we've done in the past. It's a project born out of love for both narrative adventure games and the passion players have for the other games in the line. We are excited to bring such a big game to you from a small team.\nBut, printing a board game with a scope this large is expensive, and Thunderworks Games is a small company. Without the help of backers on Kickstarter, Roll Player Adventures simply will not exist.\nWe need your support to make this game a reality. The design is complete. The art is complete.

I've outlined some common areas of risk in boardgame projects and how I've done my best to address them.\n\n> Artwork: All the artwork for the game is complete, with the exception of any images added due to achieving stretch goals or any last minute tweaks before sending the final files off to the manufacturer.\n\n>Development: All twelve books of Roll Player Adventures are complete and have been extensively playtested. We are currently playtesting the full campaign with final art and most of its graphic design to make sure everything is just right before we send the game into final layout for manufacturing.\n\n> Component Quality: I've worked with and built a great relationship with one of the best game manufacturers around, Panda Game Manufacturing (www.pandagm.com). Their proven track record on games like Eclipse, Terra Mystica, Pandemic, Belfort, and Mice & Mystics, proves they make great games with a high standard to quality. They've printed all Thunderworks titles to date.\n\n> Delivery Timeline: Unexpected delays out of my control can always occur (i.e. component shortage, manufacturer issues, customs delays, etc...). For the production schedule of Roll Player Adventures, I've used conservative estimates to account for unknowns and bumps in the road.\n\n> Fulfillment: I have received multiple estimates and will be working with established fulfillment companies that have proven track records for delivering quickly and efficiently all over the world.\n\n> Eighth Project: Even though this is my eighth Kickstarter project, I have continued to spend endless hours researching Kickstarter as well as participating in many Kickstarters. I have done my best to foresee and minimize any obstacles or stumbling blocks.\n\nIn addition, in my life outside of this campaign, I have over a decade of project management experience on large-scale software projects. I will continue to leverage that experience and apply it to this project by anticipating issues and sidestepping hurdles that may arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Make your mark on the future of Ulos!\n- This and all other pledges will get you access to the pledge manager after the close of the campaign.\n- Shipping to be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

Evidence can be put towards individual success by investigating the three Chapters that make up the game's timeline, or towards a shared pool of Evidence dedicated to foiling the Final Plot itself and preventing the Syndicate from dominating New Dawn City for good. \nEvidence is filed into the Chapter for personal gain, or into the Final Plot to foil the Syndicate's plans as a group!\nEach turn, you'll hook into the mind of a criminal, then you'll gain Grip with every criminal you control. As your Grip increases with criminals, you'll gain access to their unique skills, and develop the stamina to extend your turn and accomplish more. \nA player hooks into the Smuggler, and gains enough Grip to activate its unique Skill!\nNext you'll put your hooked criminals into motion in the zones of New Dawn City. You can move criminals about, transport crucial items, activate the unique zone powers if the coast is clear, trigger powerful criminal skills if you have enough Grip, manipulate the unsuspecting local security forces, and engage in other activities designed to bring you ever closer to the heart of the Syndicate. \nThere are lots of possibilities... the game provides a deep toolkit for achieving your goals!\nYou'll need to put everything in place for the Syndicate's criminals to carry out their nefarious deeds. When everything has been arranged and a crime is committed, you'll earn Intel and Evidence, and unlock more serious crimes in that storyline. Your presence in the minds of the criminals lets you influence their approach... dangerous behaviour will earn you more Intel on the Syndicate's operations, but it also destroys Evidence and earns you more Dilemmas. \nSide Crimes are simpler but less rewarding. Story Crimes get more complex and more rewarding the further into a storyline the group pushes!\nDilemmas are tricky; they come with tempting rewards, but also dangerous Corruption. At the end of each Chapter you'll be forced to choose half of your dilemmas to keep as Permanent Corruption... the ones you keep could be richly rewarding, but the best rewards come with the most corruption! Losing control could drive you over to the Syndicate's side if you're not careful... and it's hard to know for sure if you are the most corrupt agent!  \nYou want big rewards but can you risk the corruption? That's the dilemma!\n At the end of the game, the least-corrupt player earns a bonus. The most-corrupt player has gone in too deep, and will suffer a massive penalty... if the plot was foiled! If enough of the needed Evidence has been filed, the plot is foiled and the In Too Deep player suffers the price of their corrupt ways. If the plot wasn't foiled however, that player reaps the benefits of their troubling tactics with no penalty at all. All players cash in their Dilemmas, and when the dust settles, the player with the most Intel wins the game! \nReady for more?

Hit the button below to be taken to the game's Workshop page. Please note that you will need to own a copy of Tabletop Simulator in order to download and play. \n_______________________________________________________________\nIn the world of Prisma Arena, every hero - like every player - is unique. We've worked hard to ensure that you'll be able to see yourself in the characters you can create, so before your first game of Prisma Arena, you will personalise your Hero\u2019s appearance. Using removable stickers, you'll have a variety of options open to you such as new faces, haristyles and much more. While all Heroes start out with the same ability, as you train in the Arena and rise through the ranks, you will unlock new uniforms and incredible Prisma Powers that you can mix and match to suit to your personal preference and playstyle. We can't wait to see who you bring to the table!\n_______________________________________________________________\nWe've worked with some of our favourite content creators to see what their thoughts are on Prisma Arena!  \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nAt Hub Games, we are determined to always offer the very best product from the start. We\u2019re also very aware that games are luxury items, so want to ensure the widest audience possible by offering our range at the best price possible. Everything you find inside the Prisma Arena box is the best that it can be, meaning that we\u2019ve got no need for Stretch Goals or Kickstarter Exclusives. You simply get a great game, manufactured to our exacting standards, earlier than anyone else, at a price that\u2019s lower than you\u2019d see in a store. This way everyone gets everything, and folks who miss out on the Kickstarter don\u2019t have to worry about getting less content in a game. We\u2019ve been working on Prisma Arena for over two years, so we want everyone to enjoy the full experience!\nSo, what do you get inside a copy of Prisma Arena? \n  _______________________________________________________________\nWe're keeping the Reward Levels as simple as possible for this campaign. If you want to pick up a copy of Prisma Arena, that's \u00a325 (approximately $30 USD / \u20ac28, or however much that converts to where you are in the world). If you want an additional copy, great! Each one costs the same amount - \u00a325. We'll then work out your shipping costs in the pledge manager when we're planning delivery. And if you're not all-in, no worries! Backing us at the \u00a31 level gives you access to all news and updates throughout the campaign, as well as the pledge manager later in the year.\nCertified Retailers will be able to pick up cases of Prisma Arena at a reduced rate. For more information on this, please see the Details for Retailers section below! \n_______________________________________________________________ \nWe are working alongside experienced shipping companies and have found pricing that we believe to be the most competitive around. Although you will not be charged for shipping during the Kickstarter for Prisma Arena, please be aware that the costs for shipping will be added the pledge manager after the campaign. The estimated costs are found below. If you require information on pricing for a specific location, please get in touch to ask!\n  ______________________________________________________________\nHub Games is determined to support Brick and Mortar stores by offering them the possibility of pledging for a retailer package. This includes a free demo copy of the game and an organised play kit for each case ordered, so you'll receive five copies for sale, one for demo, and a Launch Kit. The Launch Kit is a release celebration event, meant to not only provide a space for Kickstarter backers to enjoy their new game, but most importantly to introduce the game to new players who missed out on the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe kit will be available to both retailers who support the campaign and those who will purchase the game through traditional distribution networks.\nFor more information about the retail pledge, the launch kit and organised play events, please contact corina@wearehubgames.com \n_______________________________________________________________\n_______________________________________________________________", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPrisma Arena has been in development for over two years at the point of campaign launch, and has been tested by the widest variety of players available, from first-timers to experienced gamers.

Never have an itchy or irritated butthole again from improper cleaning with toilet paper.  \nYes there\u2019s other bidet attachements out there, but we spent hundreds of hours watering our butts to fine tune the angle, stream and pressure of the Narsehole for your tender areas.   \nIf Your Butt Could Talk -  \u201dImagine a life where im never irritated. You rarely see me, but you can feel me when I\u2019m upset.  Please start using water, it\u2019ll make me happy and when I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re happy.\u201d \n How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n\n Perfect for any occasion: You can activate the individual nozzles for the starfish or the clam, or both nozzle sprays at the same time for the dreaded diarrhea days. This will take care of your whole butt and restart you back in the game of life as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. Side note - thought about what you wanna get your grandparents for Christmas this year? (wink)\nWhat\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs. \nWhat is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :) \n How do I poop with the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done. \n What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\nDoes the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. That means if your power goes out you can still clean your butt! \nNEW - Two Handle Options!\n Spray Nirvana: The Narsehole has a spray stream with separate nozzles and pressure controls for both the starfish and the clam. Trust us, all sprays are not created equal, we spent hundreds of research hours watering our butts to fine tune the Narsehole\u2019s stream in order to take the best possible care of your tender areas! Wanna roll the dice and save five bucks on Amazon? You\u2019re risking getting either a small and pointy spray (ouchie!) or the super soaker that gets your entire bathing suit region wet (might as well just hop in the shower).\nPLAY\n\nNo More Wiping Yourself Raw!\nNo More Dingleberries!\nNo More Aggravating Your Hemorrhoids Before the DMB Concert!\n\nWould you use toilet paper if you pooped out your belly button?  No? then why is it good enough for your butt? \n Toilet paper is a 38 billion and 10 million tree a year industry in the U.S. Save money, the environment and your butt. \nDay of the Nareshole Shoot\nWe\u2019re four dudes that used water to clean our butts for the first time in our mid 30\u2019s. It was amazing, faster, more efficient and it left us feeling clean and fresh! We were shocked. \nOur goal -  Is to red pill everyone on water over toilet paper and to make sure their first experience is with a spray that\u2019s gentle but firm, if they need it to be.  \nBelow is our estimate for standard shipping charges, with $5 \u2013 $20 decuted (Nareshole\u2019s covering percentage of shipping to keep the cost down) Because this estimate is based on our expected volume for this campaign, it could be subject to change depending on the final result. These charges may also change if you add additional products during the survey process. We want to keep this process as simple and accurate as possible, while avoiding any false promise or unexpected charges.\nCustoms, Duty, and VAT charges: In some cases, international backers outside of the USA will be required to pay additional customs, duty, and/or VAT charges. We cannot control this additional charge, and it will be the backers responsibility to cover once they receive the selected reward. Any questions regarding this additional charge should be addressed directly with the backers customs office.\nQ&A\n1. How does Narsehole connect? It attaches in-between the seat and bowl and connects to the fresh water supply coming out of the wall via an included hose splitter.\n2. What types of toilets can Narsehole attach to? Almost any toilet. Everything is included in the box to connect to the common household toilet.\n3. How do I use the Narsehole? Poop, play on your phone for a while to make sure it\u2019s all out, turn the direction knob to the \u201cstarfish\u201d and the water pressure knob to desired spray, go back to playing on your phone while moving your butt around a little bit to be thorough, turn water off, pat dry with a few squares of toilet paper or hand towel, and you\u2019re done.\n4. Is it sanitary for multiple people to use the same Narsehole? Yes. Narsehole is designed to be clean and hygienic with a self-cleaning, auto-retracting nozzle and full-length nozzle guard. i.e. it\u2019s a million times more sanitary then using toilet paper.\n5. What\u2019s the \u201cClam\u201d for? If you happen to find yourself in ownership of a vagina on your frontside\u2026set the directional knob to the \u201cClam\u201d, turn the water on low:) Water is an effective way to remove bacteria and prevent UTIs.\n6. Does the Narsehole require electricity? Nope. It\u2019s powered entirely by your fresh water supply. This also makes it easier to install.\n7. What is the temperature of the water? It\u2019s cool/room temperature water. It\u2019s kinda like splashing your face with water in the morning...a nice little wake me up :)\n8. What\u2019s the difference between the Narsehole and the less expensive options on Amazon?  The cheaper ones have one nozzle (not worth your time) and 90% of dual nozzles are $70-$150.  We tested all the (direct from China) Amazon models and the truth is, you get what you pay for \u2014 if you\u2019re used to boxed wine, you\u2019ll still think it\u2019s good \u2014 but the Narsehole is for people who like that fine wine! We\u2019re not judging, but ask yourself, which person are you?\nDesign/Prototype - Our main focus on design was finding the perfect spray for both the starfish and clam.  Testing hundreds of different angles and hole patterns, we finally found the perfect spray and are excited to bring it to a butt near you coming this July:)!!\nInitial Design Scetch\nDesign Process & Progression of Nozzles\nPrototyping Nozzles for Perfect Spray", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe supplier has been established, vetted, and final samples have been tested and approved.

I picked the ones that resonated with me. I'm so glad the There is no planet B pin was offered, I've been watching it for a long while but never got to buy it. The Sashimi one is so small and cute!\"\n\"The bag is huge. Loved the pockets. I'm kind of hesitating using it for groceries ... it looks good this way, I really don't want to stain it.\"\n\"The lanyard feels nice. I hope I get the opportunity to use it.\"\n\"I just received my pins and bag and all I can say is WOW! The pins are just gorgeous! I'm so happy with them. I'll be proud to display them in my collection. The pin is stunning. And I am so, so happy I decided to get the tote bag !!! It's incredible! Nice, heavy canvas, zips and pockets and it's HUGE! It looks extremely well made and will last for years and years. Thank you so much for such beautiful items. I'll be backing any of your future Kickstarter campaigns, that's for sure!\"\n\"Such an amazing artist!Was able to pick them up cause I was local. They look even better in person. Can't wait to display them in my collection it's just perfect!\"\n\"The tote is such good quality can't wait to use it either!\" \n Timings \nPin & tote manufacturing at this rate will be complete by end of June for a Mid July arrival to me.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's always a risk in delays when manufacturing as there is a lot of hand work. Things that could go wrong include: too many seconds quality pins, slow shipment, manufacturer errors, etc. However, I've worked with my manufacturer for years of designs and they are very prompt and produce great pins! I don't see many things happening that would delay the production for too long and if there are any errors they have always promptly remedied with a fixed batch.\n\nThere may be minor differences in the actual pin vs what you see in my mockups due to hand enamel filled precision, color matching. These should just be small changes though and the pins will be close to what you see here as much as possible!\n\nPackages may get lost without the right address, so please double check your address to be sure that it's correct! If packages do not arrive over 2 weeks past estimation, I will ensure I correctly make a solution to get the product to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 20 or more", "title": "\u2661 ANY 1 PIN", "descp": "\u2764 choose (1) pin from the unlocked pin collection or Add-Ons.

It's Free, featuring over 20 spells, and the entire Day 1 from the final game! Available for Windows and Mac. \nA young girl named Vasilisa, destined to become a witch, decides to throw her fate away and marry her beloved - but that dream is shattered when her betrothed dies under mysterious circumstances. \nAching for her lost love, Vasilisa seeks out Black Book - a demonic artifact, said to be powerful enough to grant any wish to the one who uncovers all 7 of its seals.\nStep into the shoes of a devil-fighting sorceress, and travel the province of Cherdyn to unseal the Black Book - and solve the plights of people in need.\nThe game takes place in a setting unlike any other - a 19th century countryside, where Slavic myth neighbors reality.\nFantastical creatures, elemental spirits and demons exist alongside ordinary folk. Some of them are evil, some are not. Yet, only a select few are able to perceive, let alone communicate with the otherworldly beings. \nVodyanoy - a male water spirit\nBlack Book features a wide variety of mythological creatures: from some that you may recognize, like Chorts and Drowners - to other, more obscure ones.\nWe took extra effort to achieve authenticity in our portrayal of these creatures - using old texts of classical myths, illustrations from folk tale books, and every other source we could find as reference. \nLeft: Vasilisa the Beautiful, 1899 by Ivan Bilibin\nBlack Book is a unique opportunity to get acquainted with the world of Northern Slavic mythology, shaped by its history and tradition. The game was developed by the people who grew up with these folk tales, and consulted with historians and anthropologists to make sure the game\u2019s narrative accurately represents the beliefs of their ancestors.\nEvery Chapter's main goal is for Vasilisa to unlock a Seal of the Black Book - and to do so, she will have to challenge the mysteries of the otherworld.\nBattle demons and other mythological beings, help ordinary townsfolk with their troubles, and solve the mystery of the all-powerful Black Book! \nBattle otherworldly forces using a unique card-based combat system. Each turn, Vasilisa has to compose a spell by putting together multiple cards - each with their own special effect. \nSome cards work better together - so be sure to create a perfect combo for maximum damage!\nThroughout the game, you'll always be adding new cards to your arsenal. There are multiple ways to obtain new cards - from buying them at the shop and getting them as rewards for quest completion, to getting them as drops from enemy encounters.\nCollect different cards and build decks that fit specific situations! \nOn her journey, Vasilisa will meet some people (and not just people), who wish to aid her in her cause - each with their unique backstory and ability, that will definitely be helpful in battle. \nTo grow stronger, Vasilisa sometimes relies on the aid of Demons, whom she sends out to do her bidding. Recruit demons, and pick out ones with the right abilities to get the job done properly.      \nIn Black Book, we do our best to emphasize the dark atmosphere of mythological stories with the help of music and sound effects. In the game we combine electronic music and folk musical instruments. We studied authentic recordings of folk songs - some tunes were recorded hundreds of years ago, and will now be reborn in our game.\nMikhail Shvachko is the composer of the game, breathing life into the world of Black Book with his music. Previously, he did the music for our previous game, The Mooseman - which can be found here: https://soundcloud.com/mikhail-shvachko/sets/themoosemanost\nIf you want to get a taste of what to expect when it comes to the unique sound of Black Book, you can find some of his latest work here: \nAside from Mikhail's work, in Black Book you'll hear live choral music, performed by the student choir of the Perm Regional College of Arts and Culture.\nIn Black Book, you'll unlock new songs as you explore additional locations and do side quests. You will be able to listen to them in a special section in the game menu.\nThanks to reaching the first stretch goal we\u2019ll be doing an english voice over for Black Book \u2014 this was made possible through the support of each backer! \nHere\u2019s the list of voice-over actors we confirmed: \n Sarah Anne Williams as Vasilisa (Jinx \u201cLeague of Legends\u201d, Chihaya Mifune \u201cPersona 5\u201d)\n Kyle Hebert as Egor (Ryu \u201cStreet Fighter\u201d, Kamina \u201cGurren Lagann\u201d)\n Daman Mills as Nikolai (Frieza \u201cDragon Ball Super\u201d, Kai \u201cBeastars\u201d) \n Ben Diskin as Proshka (Mega Man \u201cMega Man 11\u201d, Aida \u201cBeastars\u201d)\nIf you feel like helping us grow the community around Black Book, we\u2019ll be happy to reveal some content as milestones are reached. Join us on Discord to enjoy content reveals!\nBlack Book supporters, who commit to a pledge in relevant tiers, will see themselves in the game - or help us design unique in-game content!\nThroughout the world of Black Book, multiple gravestones will be scattered. These are not your regular gravestones - these are a token of our eternal gratitude, in remembrance of those who pitched in to make our dream game a reality!\nEveryone's name from Adept pledge (or limited Backer Relief Plus) and forward will be immortalized in the game in those gravestones, so don't miss out on the exclusive chance to find yourself among the beautiful backdrops of Cherdyn!\nOne of the core features of the game that we're really proud of is the unique visual style of the Black Book. That includes every visual aspect: the locations, character and enemy models and animation, and last, but not least - the character portraits!\nIncluded in the Occultist pledge, you'll get the chance to see your own appearance, drawn in Black Book's artstyle, in the game itself! The development team will contact you and ask for a photo, which the artist will use to commission a portrait (which is also available on its own in the Herald pledge) - and then we'll pick out a place to include it in the world of the game!\nThe entire Black Book's combat system revolves around cards. Each card has a unique property - and if combined with others in the right way, can deal massive damage to the unholy creatures that roam the land. With the Hexer pledge, you'll get to design the look, name and in-game properties of a combat card that Vasilisa will use in her demonic encounters. Still, remember - setting and game balance restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over cards included in the final game. \nThroughout her journey, Vasilisa will find herself in many uncommon situations - from solving domestic disputes to confronting demonic creatures, who are known to terrorize human folk. Black Book will be filled with lots of unique in-game events - and with the Sorcerer pledge, we'll include your own scenario in the game as well!\nLater on in the development cycle we will contact you, and ask you to submit a short scenario - which we will then discuss and edit with you, and include it in the main game. But please keep in mind that setting restrictions do apply, and the development team does have the final creative control over the events included in the game.\nWant to leave a bigger impact on the events transpiring in Black Book? Then the Warlock pledge is the way to go!\nA side-quest consists of several in-game events, usually ranging from two to three - and tell a bigger, more developed story. As with the previous reward, we'll contact you later on, and after edits and approval from the development team, we will include an entire side-quest of your making in the final product! Be warned, setting restrictions still apply, and the development team still has the final say over in-game content of this calibre.    \nAfter finishing our latest project, The Mooseman, we\u2019ve wanted to return to the idea of making a game based on Slavic mythos - but this time, something much bigger in scale.\nWe\u2019ve been working on Black Book for quite some time. During that time, we\u2019ve accomplished a lot - from refining the game\u2019s visual style and character design, to writing the story and developing the proper combat system.. The result of our work so far can be seen in the demo - but there\u2019s still a lot left to be done until the game is ready for release.\nWith the extra budget acquired from Kickstarter backers, we aim to add many new features to the game: some of them planned, but scrapped due to time and money constraints, and others completely new.\nAside from gathering the funding required for development, crowdfunding would allow us to directly engage with the gamers all across the world - and, with their help and feedback, make The Black Book the best game it could be.\nWe're aware that the current gaming landscape is about to undergo major changes. With that in mind, we want to make sure that Black Book will be available on PC, as well as current and future consoles - so that all of our audience gets to enjoy the game, no matter what their main gaming destination is.\nWe intend on supporting all current generation platforms: PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch. \nOne of Black Book's core features is its rich, text-based narrative - and we believe that we owe it to the players to make sure this narrative is to you in full. We are already working with a professional editor, making sure that the English version of the game meets the high standards that our audience has. And currently, we expect the game to be available in the following languages upon release:\nMorteshka - The Developer\nOur projects are mythology and ethnic-based with the narrative and worlds supported by historical facts and folklore. Our first project, The Mooseman, was released in 2017 on Steam, and in 2018 on AppStore, Google Play, and modern consoles.\nThe name of the studio comes from wordplay of \"Mort\", which is French for \"dead\" and Komi for \"a man\", and \"Matryoshka\", the famous Russian doll.\nHypeTrain Digital - The Publisher\nBlack Book is being published by HypeTrain Digital, an indie game publisher for PC and consoles. They provide initial funding for developing the game and porting it to consoles and helping us with the Kickstarter campaign.\nHypeTrain Digital work side by side with independent teams to successfully ship their masterpieces to a worldwide audience. Their titles include: The Wild Eight, Stoneshard, DESOLATE, Police Stories, 12 is Better Than 6.\n-\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Mooseman was our first project as a team - and during its development, we learned a lot about what it takes to make a game from start to finish. While we are confident in our ability to deliver the game on time, Black Book is a project of a bigger scale, compared to Mooseman - and so, there is a chance that the release date would be changed further down the line. \n\nHowever, as we've said before \u2014 making Black Book as great as it can be is our priority number one. Throughout development, we will keep you informed about all updates and issues. \n\nWe thank you for your faith and support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Follower", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["78 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Reader", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["2,173 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Wanderer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["574 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Loyalist", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n\ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["514 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits (Backer)\n\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f Digital Artbook\n\ud83c\udfb5 Digital OST\n\ud83d\udce9 DLC Skin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2021"}], "stat": ["223 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 80 or more", "title": "Adept", "descp": "INCLUDES:\n\ud83d\udcacBacker Discord\n\ud83d\udceeE-mail Updates\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0fHD Wallpaper\n2\u00d7 \ud83d\udcbd Game Copy (PC or console of your choosing)\n\ud83d\udcdcYour Name in Credits -

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.
