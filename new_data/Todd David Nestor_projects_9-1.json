We know. But we had fun with it. Whatev's. \nHI!!! Wow, we've been completely blindsided by the amount of support we've received over the past week. Fully funded in 8 days, amazing!! This is a testament to the power of this community, so many people asked us how we would get a bunch of frugal people to help pitch in. We showed them! It's not that we won't spend money, it's that we won't part with money unless the purchase is a life necessity or the reciprocation brings us value, and lots of it! So, we see this successful kickstarter as a huge vote of confidence from y'all that you believe in this project, and we can't thank you enough. Phew!!! That certainly takes the stress down a few notches, so thanks for that! Plus, this means the film is officially going to be finished. Boom.\nNow that we have the opportunity to continue to raise money, you may be asking yourself.... \"where is the extra going?\". Well, we have some grand plans to share! All the icing on the cake will be put right back into the documentary. We plan to put together a 10-city screening tour across the country, we want to bring the party to you! The more we raise, the more fun the party. And perhaps we will be able to increase the amount of locations we can visit! But of course, travel, venue rentals, food, posters, etc.... these things cost money. Even when we pinch pennies and travel hack our way around, costs arise. And we can't do this alone, so the extra funding will allow us to continue to pay our people as we have since DAY 1.  \nSOOOO, we have extended a few of the backer levels, come up with some new ideas and added a new stretch goal! Let's see if we can get there! Thank you for all the continued support!\n-PWF Crew\nWe are making the first feature length film about FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early).\nIn the field\nPlaying with FIRE follows 35 year old Scott Rieckens, his wife Taylor, and their toddler Jovie as they embark on a year-long odyssey to understand the rules of this sub-culture and test their willingness to reject the standard narrative of adult life, which basically prescribes: \u201cGo to college, take out tons of student loans, buy a new car, take on a mortgage, buy another car and all kinds of other things, then work for 40+ years to pay for it all. If you\u2019re lucky you might be able to retire at 65 and have a few years left to hit the golf course.\u201d \nWhen Scott hears a prominent leader and \u201cearly retiree\u201d in the subculture--Mr. Money Mustache\u2014interviewed on the Tim Ferriss podcast, he enlists his wife to abandon everything they\u2019ve been taught about the role of money in adulthood and instead focus on pursuing financial independence. But doing so requires an about face since their current path has them spending every dime they make living in an expensive San Diego suburb, driving luxury cars, and eating at fancy restaurants. Although everything they are doing is sanctioned by their friends, traditional education, and broad society, Taylor agrees something is wrong when it becomes clear she\u2019ll need to sacrifice the precious hours of her daughter\u2019s childhood and work 40+ hours per week to continue paying for their lifestyle. She agrees to uproot their lives and spend a year traveling around the country to meet the subculture\u2019s mentors while living rent free to save as much as they can.\nTime is our most valuable resource. FIRE helps make the most of your time.\n The \u201cF.I.R.E.\u201d subculture (\u201cfinancially independent, retired early\u201d) is a stunning phenomena that has emerged in developed Western nations thanks to the Internet and simple, efficient ways to invest and grow money. Rooted in cultural traditions of simplicity and values-based appraisals of what makes life truly worth living, the FIRE sub-culture was born from the minds of engineers and computer programmers who favor life optimization and personal freedom over \u201cstuff.\u201d Today their followers number in the millions, gobbling up every detail of advice on popular blogs and podcasts. These men and women have proven--through a series of simple life hacks and time-tested investing strategies--that it\u2019s possible to buck the system and walk away from mandatory work decades before the standard narrative would suggest is possible. Once they reach \u201ctheir number\u201d (investments equaling 25x annual expenses), they are securely positioned to abandon mandatory work and pursue a life on their own terms. But getting to this place requires significant personal sacrifice,  a radical reappraisal of the role of money in our lives, and what truly brings happiness. Not everyone is cut out for the challenge.\nWe've spent the last year travelling the country, meeting the amazing characters who have illuminated the path to Financial Independence. From Vicki Robin to Mr. Money Mustache, we've done our best to find the most compelling and informative stories to help uncover the world of FIRE and try to make sense of the framework for a mainstream audience. The intention of this movie is to inspire people to take a look at their financial health and ask themselves if they can do better. It's to uncover this wild and wacky world of FIRE and present the soul of the community to the world. We want this to be a calling card for all those who are ALREADY practicing a FIRE lifestyle, but may feel alienated or unprepared to share their story with their friends, family or loved ones. Perhaps they've tried, but were met with the ugly truth. Our society's relationship with money is completely broken. So we went to the experts to learn how we can work to fix this. \nScott, Taylor and Jovie\nFinancial Literacy is more important than ever. It's time to share the FIRE framework with the world. \nThis project is as much for the FIRE community as it is for all those who still need to take control of their financial lives. We firmly believe there are too many people out there just like us, who had no idea how simple it was to get their financial world in order, and ultimately free ourselves from stress, shame and mandatory labor decades ahead of the prescribed schedule. But simple doesn't make it easy. We are hellbent on eliminating excuses through our own journey, sharing our tips, tricks and coping mechanisms and ultimately learning from the best, the existing FIRE community! The FIRE community has lived in fear of retribution for far too long. It's time to address the tough (but logical) questions and fears people have head on, and give our friends, family, neighbors, etc. the gift that we have all been so lucky to receive. The gift of financial freedom. And beyond the subsidization of this project, this is ultimately what you'll be supporting. This is an opportunity to pay it forward and give back, grab that life karma. Because FIRE is better when shared with others!\nThe Goods\nOh boy, do we have some goods. We've done our best to provide the most value for you, incentivising you to help us. After all, we know you aren't typically excited to part with your money. SO, while we don't fashion ourselves as retailers, we've given it our best shot! \nFrom coffee mugs, to bike bags, stickers to luggage tags, we've tried to make things you will USE. Function over all else. And in that spirit we also offer one on one time with your favorite FIRE experts, and a chance to be a part of our team!  \nThe Documentary\nThe Book\nSticker Pack\nCoffee Mugs\nLuggage Tags\nBike Bags\nPlaying Cards\nThe whole kit and kaboodle\nThe Plan\nWe are doing EVERYTHING humanly possible to bring a film, book, podcast to market while running quality control on the narrative and approach to encapsulating FIRE into a 90 minute film, 50,000 words and 10 episodes. This effort would be wasted without a healthy amount of press to share the story, an amazingly talented team and the support of the community it's meant to celebrate. \nPost Production\nWe are currently in rough cut stage, and will quickly be turning that into a beautiful director's cut, followed by a final cut. Once we've washed, dried, polished, buffed and waxed the beauty, we will send that off to experts who will color grade the footage and mix the sound so your eyes and ears stay super happy. At that point, we will need to send the product through a legal filter and ensure we get closed captioning and other various odds and ends to deliver the final product to you.\nWe are currently at 30 TB of footage, we are dangerously close to maxing them out. Thankfully we are wrapped with filming!\nThis is the crux of our current position. We need your help to hire the best and brightest. The more polished this film is, the more seriously it will be taken. The more respect it gains, the more it's talked about. The more buzz we generate, the more validation the community will have at large. The more validation, the more people will become interested in FIRE and the community. And this gets to the heart of our goal, to empower everyone to live a rich, happy and fulfilled life. This is about paying it forward! Imagine FIRE events popping up all over the country, making frugality and living within our means commonplace amongst our neighbors. Imagine watching the stress lift off the population, and a whole generation of people empowered to live their best life. This film has the potential to bring that story to the masses, and facilitate the nexus of that reality!\nThis is the last piece of the filmmaking and book writing process, but marks the beginning of a new chapter, marketing, selling, promoting... basically making sure everyone knows this thing exists in case they are interested! We can't let this endeavour be a sunk cost, we've devoted too much of our most precious resource, time. SO we are here... asking for your help.\nBuilding an Audience\nHere we are, we've finally completed the film. We are wrapping up the book. We're head down in post production, getting the stories tight, ensuring accuracy and inspiration are abundant. And while we've been incredibly connected to the community through events, emails, late night phone calls, international texts and Skype calls, we've been fairly quiet on the outbound side. That's been by design. We didn't want to string y'all along too long! We knew this project would take the better part of 2 years to complete, so we wanted to focus on the creating. But now, we will be sharing our experience. Our social media's will be getting a little love, and hopefully we can all enjoy the launch of this project together. As we are currently teaching our 3 year old... sharing is caring. So, sharing this Kickstarter campaign is the first thing you can do to help bring the superpowers of FIRE to those who need it most! \nScreening Tour\nWe are currently prepping a 10 city screening tour, and theatre release! We will be roaming the country, creating pop up FIRE parties. Hopefully you'll allocate a few bucks in early 2019 to join us! Just think, a red carpet event for the very topic that you consume daily! Perhaps a few of your personal finance hero's will show up. Perhaps we will have giveaways, Q&A sessions, accompanied by food and libations... Just maybe. \nTo sum it up, if you've read through to this point, you may be thinking.... \"that seems expensive\". Well, you would be right. This is going to cost money to complete. So for us, it's a sliding scale. The more money we raise, the more we can accomplish. If we raise the minimum, we will be able to execute the film. If we raise more, it will go right back into making this film the best and biggest we can make it! \nWho We Are\nSCOTT RIECKENS\nExecutive Producer | 2-Time Emmy\u00ae Nominated Filmmaker\nScott found FIRE through Mr. Money Mustache, and immediately connected to the philosophy, lifestyle and hope it offered him and his family. Scott has spent the last decade leading teams on creative concept, brand strategy and production. He is currently the founder of 99 Bravo Productions.\nHis work has generated millions of views, 2 Emmy nominations and countless other awards.

He is an award-winning film and television producer best known for his work showcasing unique individuals and cultures bent on self-actualization and excellence. Credits include the highly acclaimed Emmy\u00ae-winning unstructured docu-reality series, Life Below Zero (NatGeo), Top Gear USA (History) & Top Gear America (BBCA), Ice Road Truckers (History) Deadliest Catch (Discovery), The Wild Within (Travel Channel), Gourmet\u2019s Diary of a Foodie and Gourmet\u2019s Adventures with Ruth (both on PBS).

He holds a BA in English and French from the University of Colorado, Boulder.\nRAYMOND TSANG\nDirector of Photography | 3-time Emmy\u00ae Award Winning Filmmaker\nRay believes that every story he tells has an opportunity to inspire positive change in the world. He has collaborated with brands like Lyft, Apple, CBS, Facebook and T-Mobile; pushing the limits of what good people and good storytelling can accomplish together.\nFrom 30-second commercial spots to feature-length documentaries, he has been nominated for over a dozen Emmys and worked with some of the largest companies in the world in telling those stories.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks: The single biggest risk we currently face is lack of funding. We have the product nearly ready to ship. It's so close. It's going to cost close to $40,000 to finish editing, motion graphics, coloring, mixing, and prepping the film for release. We've been on or under budget on the entire film up to this point and decided early on to devote a considerable amount of resources to the production of the film. Without a great story, post-production didn't matter. We also chose to future proof the film and shoot 5K footage. This is not your average documentary. We had always planned to use crowdfunding to get us over the finish line in post-production. We've put ourselves at risk by assuming the existing FIRE community would be excited about this film and come to our aid to support us when we need it most. It remains to be seen whether we overshot our assumptions. Plus, we had originally planned to use the power of the community to help us share the film. If that doesn't take hold like we plan, we may need to spend additional funds to expand our reach. \n\nLastly, Taylor and Scott have risked their anonymity, and their reputations to be as transparent and open as they possibly could to hopefully help people relate to a FIRE lifestyle, show the realities and inspire people to learn more about personal finance and about themselves. But who knows, perhaps the internet trolls will fry us up in a frying pan, chew a bit and spit us out. It's scary as hell... So we are really hoping it was all worth it!\n\nChallenges: Like any creative project, the subjective tastes of so many can make it difficult to make safe assumptions, ultimately leading to undershooting budgets and overestimating success. We feel we have the experience to avoid the typical traps, but that same experience comes with a certain humbleness that we can't control everything. We have called in so many favors and hedged our bets on this project. We are running out of those favors, and getting into the type of work that does NOT come free. Also, we are new to the independent distribution model, and it's proving a challenge to learn exactly how to distribute a film in the currently disrupted and ever-changing landscape. We are doing everything we can to solicit help from the best sources, but you never know who is there to help and who is there to capitalize.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "5 Spot", "descp": "This means the world to us because we know every dollar can be traded for time.

His impetuous and unpredictable nature has made life for an aspiring magic user a challenge. As long as Merlin lives, you and your fellow wizards must hide in the shadows and follow his every whim. You know that there is only one way to end his megalomaniacal reign. You must kill him.\nBuy Ingredients\nUse your wits, magical ingredients, and the very elements of nature to assemble a mystical spell that can bring Merlin down. However, as you pursue your dreams of power, so too do the other magical beings of the realm. And the only thing more dangerous than a crafty old wizard is an ambitious young one. Actually, all wizards are terrifying, so be careful.\nLearn and Cast Spells\nBuy ingredients, learn spells, and cast spells to thwart your opponents. Be the first to defeat Merlin so that all may revere your glory!\nBe the first to defeat Merlin!\nKill Merlin! is a 2-4 player wizard-themed strategy game with unique mechanics and high player interaction. It is straightforward and easy to learn, but there are many layers of strategy. It's great for both gateway and hardcore gamers.\nA full game of Kill Merlin! takes about 15-30 minutes per player. So, a 2-player game might last 30-60 minutes, while a 4-player game might last up to 2 hours. Since the spell board is dealt randomly each game, the duration can vary.\n * The images above show the current state of the artwork, some of which may be upgraded during the design/manufacturing process.\nRead The Meeple Street's Review of Kill Merlin!\nMeeple Times:\n\"This is a take that game of the finest degree. It\u2019s simple, easy-to-teach, fast paced, and plenty fun for beginners and veterans alike ... Dave Schuman and his boys did a fantastic job crafting a game full of wacky and unpredictable surprises ... if you\u2019re a fan of take that games, a category made famous by games like Munchkins and King of Tokyo, but you want more meat on the bones, then you\u2019re really going to like Kill Merlin!.\" - Gary, Meeple Times\nRead the full Meeple Times review here: https://meepletimes.com/impressions/kill-merlin-first-impressions/\nThat's What Jenni Said:\n\"It feels a little less frustrating to have an opponent take all your money when you know they might be Merlin\u2019s next victim and lose it all themselves the next turn. It reinforces the theme that Merlin is the bigger enemy, and nothing should be taken personally as we step on each other trying to get to him first.\" - Jenni, That's What Jenni Said\nWe got a \"Oui! Oui!\" from Jenni :)\nRead Jenni's full review here: http://www.thatswhatjennisaid.com/2018/10/board-game-preview-kill-merlin-new.html\nUnfiltered Gamer:\n\"It's a party game, it's a family game, and it's crazy... even when you think you're losing this game, you might actually not be losing because Merlin might have a few tricks up his sleeve...\" - Michael, Unfiltered Gamer\nBoard Game Brawl:\n\"Kill Merlin!... is easy to set up, it's easy to teach, it's fast to teach... so there are layers of strategy there, but it's also so straightforward and easy to learn that I think that casual gamers could potentially enjoy it, players who want a little more meat on their games could enjoy it as well, and people who are in the middle.\" - Nick, Board Game Brawl\n Preview Video:\n Full Gameplay Video:\n        Here is a link to the draft RULES.\nHere is a link to the draft Wizard Turn Sequence Sheet.\nI've enabled commenting privileges in both of those docs, please feel free to comment directly in them with any feedback. The final rules are still being laid out and will be updated when available.\nShipping will be collected after the campaign via our Pledge Manager. We plan to work with Quartermaster Logistics for shipping logistics and fulfillment, and we offer customs friendly shipping to US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China backers.\nBased on the size and weight of our prototype, we *estimate the following shipping charges:\n~$10-12 in the USA\n~$16-20 in Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico\n~$16-18 in Canada\n~$10-12 in China and Hong Kong\n~$15-18 in EU/UK and Canada\n~$20 in Australia\nWorldwide prices can vary from ~$20-$80 depending on your location\n* These are only estimates. Your actual shipping cost may be higher or lower, depending on the weight of the final product with all stretch goals achieved as well as ever-changing shipping costs.\nWe are unfortunately unable to guarantee delivery to Russia, South Africa, Brazil, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. If you are in those countries and want to make a pledge, you might consider getting the game shipped to a friend or relative in a more shipping-friendly country.\nRisks and Challenges\nWith every project, there are risks. We have been working hard to mitigate those risks. We have spent the last year immersing ourselves in the independent board game scene, and have enrolled the help of industry veterans in order to better understand the publishing and manufacturing facets of board game production. The game assets and artwork are nearly complete, and we have manufacturing/shipping samples and quotes ready from multiple reputable factories. We have thoroughly researched pricing and costs, and we feel comfortable with our budget at various levels of funding.

For that reason we want to utilise Hydrogen batteries in our drones but to do this we need vital funds. Hydrogen battery powered drones can fly for up to 3 hours!\n       After three years of work, we are proud to be back on Kickstarter to present the Mine Kafon Drone: an unmanned airborne demining system that uses a three step process to map, detect and detonate land mines.\nThe Mine Kafon Drone is up to 20 times faster than currently available technologies. \nThe Mine Kafon Drone (MKD) offers an innovative solution to land mine removal, providing a reliable demining system that delivers accurate updates and information on mine clearing operations. \n    Presenting the Mine Kafon drone to Queen Maxima at the Singularity U expo in Eindhoven, the Netherlands.\nThe Mine Kafon Drone flies over dangerous areas to map, detect and detonate landmines from a safe distance. The drone works autonomously equipped with three separate interchangeable robotic extensions.\nThese three methodologies combined makes the MKD up to 20 times faster than traditional demining technologies. As well as being safer, it also up to 200 times cheaper.\n1. Mapping\nFirst the drone flies over the whole field with an aerial 3D mapping system to identify all the dangerous areas with GPS way points.\n 2. Detection\nEquipped with a robotic metal detecting arm the MKD hovers above the ground at approximately 4 cm to detect mines. Every detected mine is geotagged on the operator's system to construct a map of known mine locations.\ndetection\n3. Destroying\nFor the final phase of the process the MKD, attached with a robotic gripping arm, places a small detonator on every detected mine. The land mine is then detonated from a safe distance using a timer.\n3. detonation\n  PLAY\n\n    There are 100 million land mines worldwide. Every day, 10 innocent civilians are killed or maimed by these explosives.\nToday, land mines can still be found in more than 60 countries, constituting a significant risk to communities across the globe. In these countries, the victims are mostly civilians \u2013 children, women and the elderly \u2013 with tens of thousands of innocent people killed every year, and many more injured, serving as a horrific reminder of the past. \nUsing current technologies, clearing or even detecting all land mines across the entire world would take over 1100 years. The established processes are slow, dangerous and expensive, and completely unacceptable if we want to solve the problem in our lifetime.\n           MKD offers a number of crucial advantages over the products currently used by demining organisations. \n The MKD is completely casualty free and operates at a reduced cost to traditional methods. \n Its modular system can be enhanced through the addition of sensors and tools, allowing the MKD to perform a wide variety of tasks.\nThe ability to map the area covered by the demining operation creates a wealth of information to aid the decision-making processes for on-going operations. \nPlanning of demining procedures is made easier by the scanning process, allowing information to be gathered about at-risk areas before the demining begins. \nThe data from each operation is collected and analysed in a structured and systematic way.\nWhat if we could wipe out all the land mines and explosives in less than 10 years?\n    PLAY\n\n        PLAY\n\nDiscovery Channel, short documentary on Daily planet\n    Growing up on the edge of Kabul in a little town called Qasaba in Afghanistan, Massoud and Mahmud Hassani, the brothers behind the Mine Kafon Drone project, experienced the horrors of land mines from an early age. These experiences fuelled Massoud Hassani to develop a solution for a safe and smart solution to detect and clear land mines. \nFollowing Massoud\u2019s first successful Kickstarter campaign in 2013, backed by 4200 backers from all over the world, the Mine Kafon Foundation was founded. The Mine Kafon Foundation is an R&D organisation based in the Netherlands. In the past 3 years, Massoud and Mahmud have been raising awareness by giving lectures around the world and developing new approaches on how to fight land mines in different environments. In this way, they have crowdsourced many engineers and designers from all over the world and invited them to collaborate and volunteer on this humanitarian project. \n\"So far, we have already developed several working prototypes of the Mine Kafon Drone. We have performed tests with the Dutch Ministry of Defense on their territory and spoke with their experts on demining difficulties. The Mine Kafon Drone is now ready for its next step.\" \n      PLAY\n\n  First flight with the robotic metal detector and the Mine Kafon Drone.\n  robotic metal detector with integrated distance sensor and a gimbal.\n  Real time stream of the GPS detections on the base station.\n  Robotic gripper in action with the Mine Kafon Drone\n  It is now time for a pilot study showcasing the MKD\u2019s capabilities. This is crucial for the actual development and production of the Mine Kafon Drone because we need to prove to governments, the UN and NGOs that the MKD works as a reliable and unmanned demining system. This also allows us to test different weather conditions and environments. Following these tests, we will be able to finalize details for the batch production of Mine Kafon Drones.\nWith the Mine Kafon Drone we can save thousands of lives. Civilians will have access to agriculture, water resources, education, and the freedom to play outdoor sports. A billion people currently cannot move freely for fear of mines. Can you imagine that we could liberate these people in all affected countries with the Mine Kafon Drone?  \nWe need your backing to reach our goal in realizing the safety of people in need. By supporting the Mine Kafon Drone project, you will help the world get rid of land mines, save thousands of lives, rescue the affected natural landscapes and help build the economies for those in need. Join our Kickstarter campaign and spread the word.\nAll your pledges will go directly towards developing the Mine Kafon drones. Thanks for your support for bringing this project to life.

Detection\nIt can be difficult to detect land mines with traditional land mine detection technologies, as the quality of the metal degrades significantly after decades of lying dormant in the ground. Metal detection can also be hindered by differences in terrain and variations in the soil. Nevertheless, the MKD is able to detect even the weakest metal frequencies under ground in various terrains and can operate at full capacity in jungles, mountains, deserts or agricultural surfaces.\n\n2. Robotic arm\nThe robotic arm needed to hold the metal detector at the necessary distance from the ground and navigate it with the change of the surface must constantly function at full capacity without generating vibrations that can disorientate the drone.\n\n3. GPS positioning\nGPS has a typical accuracy of 4 m, which is not sufficient when it comes to the mapping of areas that could put people\u2019s lives in danger. In order to increase the accuracy of our GPS, the MKA uses triangulated GPS and external antennas on the field.\n\n4. Streaming detection data\nThe provision of a video and photo report is relatively simple.

Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!\nOur Story\nThe Mk.II - a 12,000-pound, 15-foot-tall combat robot that needs upgrades for hand-to-hand combat.\nWe are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!\nThe upgraded Mk.II concept - the most American robot ever made.\nRight now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.\nIn order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need to\nAdd heavy duty armor plating\nAdd some serious firepower \nUpgrade our hydraulics to handle the heavier armor and firepower \nIncrease our top speed \nUpgrade our power unit to keep up with our new hydraulic system and speed \nThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:\nTest a wide range of weapons and choose the best load-out\nKeep our balance during hand to hand combat and not fall over\nNot injure ourselves in the cockpit during combat\nFight with an incredibly sweet paint job. While not strictly required, this is a matter of national pride. \nAll told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. \nTeam USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!\nRobot Upgrades\n$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track Base\nMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!\n$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon Options\nRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).\n$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing Algorithm\nAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.\n$1,250,000: Life Safety Systems\nRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.\n$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint Job\nRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!\nWhat You Get  \n$5: Website Shout-out\nFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.\n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker\n For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out. All backers contributing to this level or more will also get access to the behind the scenes build process via the documentary we're filming!\n$12/15: Pilot the Mk.II In Robocraft\nFor $12 and above, you'll get to own and pilot the Mk.II in Robocraft, a new free-to-play game by Freejam Games that allows you to build your own combat robots from scratch and take them out onto the field of battle! The $12 level is a digital-only level, and comes with your name on our website but doesn't come with a sticker. The $15 level comes with both the Mk.II in Robocraft and a sticker from the $10 level. Any levels above $12 automatically receive the Robocraft unlock code.\n$25: Most Patriotic Poster Ever Created\nThe Mk.II concept art poster\nFor $25 you'll also get a 18\" x 24\" concept art poster celebrating the creation of the most American robot ever made.\n$50: One MegaBots Shirt\nJoin Team USA and show off your home team pride with a crew shirt!\nOur Evolution of Man shirt\nOur SUPER AMERICAN shirt\nFor $50, you'll get to pick from one of three shirts - a crew shirt that shows off your home team pride, an Evolution of Man shirt that celebrates the escalation of combat over the millennia, or our SUPER AMERICAN shirt that confirms that yes, Kogoro Kurata, building something huge and sticking guns on it is, in fact, Super American.\nYou'll choose which shirt and what sizes you want after the campaign's over, in a survey we send to our backers. If you want more than one shirt, feel free to add $35 to any level above $50, per additional shirt!\n$150: 3D Printed MK. II\nUltimate Swag Kit! Including 3D Printed MegaBot\nAt $150, you'll get the collector's edition swag kit - the shout-out, sticker, poster, and shirt, plus a team picture in front of the robot and a 3D printed MegaBot miniature! \n$500: Ultimate Swag Experience\nIf you want the ultimate swag experience, $500 will get you everything in the collector's edition kit, except it'll be boxed and signed by Grant Imahara, the co-founders of BattleBots, the owners of Howe & Howe Technologies, and the MegaBots team! The boxed kit will be a numbered collector's item, so get yours sooner rather than later!\n$250: Demo Day Experience\nCome see the robot and party with us!\nSwag is awesome - but seeing the robot in person is cooler. For $250, you can come to our demo day, see the robot show off its abilities in person, and throw down at a crazy San Francisco party with the founders of MegaBots.\n$750: VIP Demo Day\nYou, too, can hang out with the MegaBros 1-on-1!\n $750 gets you a VIP demo day experience where you ALSO get to sign the robot, take pictures of yourself inside it, and hang out with the robot and founders in a separate, exclusive event.\n$1000/$2,500/$5,000:  MegaBot Pilot/Weapons Testing\nSuit up and pilot the Mk.II!\nFinally, for the ultimate thrill seekers out there, you can suit up and pilot this beast of a robot. $1,000 gets you a ride in the robot as it drives through an obstacle course at top speed. If just riding in the robot isn't enough, $2,500 puts you in the gunner's seat on our shooting range - blow up mock-up KURATAS robots as we drive the robot through a combat simulation. And if that's not enough... $5,000 will put you in the gunner's seat in an exoskeleton that controls the arms and torso of the Mk.II. You get to use a car as a punching bag until the timer's up. On top of all of these experiences, you get the collector's edition swag and a VIP invitation to our demo day.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older by May of 2016 in order to suit up and pilot the robot, and rest assured that you'll have to sign a mile-long waiver that's full of 'YOU MIGHT DIE. NO, SERIOUSLY.'\n$10,000: Pit Crew Experience\nJoin the pit crew!\nLast, but certainly not least, up to 5 lucky people will get to join our pit crew for $10,000. Come along for the ride on the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime, behind-the-scenes experience as we take this fight to Japan.\nAdvisers\nGrant Imahara, formerly of Mythbusters and Industrial Light & Magic, has joined forces with us to help us design our robot, bring the giant robot duel to the people, and help make giant robot combat a sport in any way he can!\nPeter Diamandis, founder of the X-Prize, is helping us figure out how we can push the state of the art in robotics by using our competition to drive innovation!\nTrey Roski and Greg Munson, founders of BattleBots, have joined up with us to help us figure out the best weapons and strategies for melee combat against KURATAS, and to help us figure out how we can turn this duel into a sport!\nSponsors\nAutodesk has sponsored us from the beginning, supported the creation of the Mk.II, and will be continuing to support us with design software and access to high-end manufacturing equipment throughout this challenge.

It fits practically any bicycle frame and helps you use your bike more efficiently and comfortably, when and where you need it.\nRIDING\nSmart Wheel is a pedal assist which means it helps you ride your bike effortlessly. The motor turns on when you start pedaling and begins accelerating to your desired speed. It stops when you stop. It saves you time by getting you to your destination faster and gets you there without losing your breath or breaking a sweat. There\u2019s no need to worry about what to wear to that business meeting or 8 o\u2019clock date.\nSAFETY\nSmart Wheel takes care of itself. You can remotely lock the motor and track it in case it gets stolen. While riding, Smart Wheel keeps you safe because it spares your energy and allows you to keep your focus on the traffic.\nCOMPATIBILITY\nSmart Wheel is designed to fit practically any bicycle frame. It comes in different sizes and colors. You\u2019ll be able to specify the size and the color that suits your bike after the campaign.\nSIMPLE DESIGN\nSmart Wheel is designed in a way that makes installation as easy as possible. The motor and all the other components are packed inside a robust case. There are no wires or other gadgets to install. You simply remove your rear wheel, replace it with the Smart Wheel and you\u2019re all set!\nLIGHT, POWERFUL & SMART\nSmart Wheel\u2019s genius design packs a lot of power and keeps its weight as light as possible. It goes up to 20 mph (25 km/h) for a 30 miles (50 km) range and it weights only 9 lbs (4 kg). You can control the Smart Wheel with the FlyKly App which offers aditional features for safety, support and social connectivity.\nSmart Light holds your phone safely in place while riding. This cute little light is also a convenient phone charger that\u2019s always there to help you out!\nPHONE HOLDER\nA sticky pad on the Smart Light tightly holds your smartphone in place. Additional safety straps work as an extra measure for rockier terrains or faster bikers.\nPHONE CHARGER\nSmart Light connects to a dynamo generator. You simply connect your smartphone to the USB port and while you\u2019re enjoying the ride your phone quickly recharges.\nBICYCLE LIGHT\nAs the Smart Light name suggests, the dynamo also gives out just enough electricity to power a bright LED bulb which leads the way and never leaves you in the dark.\nEASY INSTALLATION\nSmart Light is easily installed with a simple theft-proof clip-on mechanism. A thin cable connects it to a dynamo on the front fork of a bicycle frame. To turn on the Smart Light you simply start pedaling.\nFlyKly App allows you to control and monitor the Smart Wheel. It also offers many other features like safety, support and social connectivity. It\u2019s available for free for iOS and Android devices with Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity and for the Pebble Watch.\nRIDING\nIt's simple. Just set the top speed on the app, start pedaling and Smart Wheel will do the rest. While cruising you can monitor your current speed, the distance, the time of travelling and the battery level. Smart Wheel studies your cycling habits and suggests the most time efficient, the safest or the most attractive routes.\nLOCKING & TRACKING\nYou can lock the Smart Wheel with a simple touch of a button on your app. In case your bike gets stolen it can quickly be located and tracked via GPS.\nSUPPORT\nFlyKly App constantly monitors the Smart Wheel components and functionality. In case anything happens to go wrong we\u2019re already a step ahead at suggesting a solution. This way we can offer you the quickest and most efficient support.\nSOCIAL CONNECTIVITY\nThe data collected by the app can easily be shared and compared with the cycling habits of your friends. You can also share it with your city officials who\u2019ll be able to use it to design better cycling infrastructure. This way you can stay in touch with your cycling community and help creating more livable cities.\nPEBBLE WATCH\nFor all the Pebble Watch users we designed a special version of the FlyKly App. With Pebble Watch you can set the top speed, lock the Smart Wheel, receive notifications and always have most of the cycling information at arms length.\n*WORLDWIDE SHIPPING INCLUDED \nABOUT THE MOTOR\nSmart Wheel\u2019s revolutionary motor is incredibly thin, light and efficient. With its 9 lbs (4 kg) it generates 250 W of power which is enough to push you up to 20 mph (25 km/h). This makes the whole wheel easy to ride and even carry up the stairs. \nElectronics\nMagnets in Motor Housing\nMotor Housing and Sensor Magnets\nABOUT THE BATTERY\nSmart Wheel\u2019s 36V Lithium battery lasts for a range of up to 30 miles (50 km) when fully charged. It can be charged in 2-3 hours by connecting it to a charger and plugging it into the nearest wall socket. The battery also charges when you\u2019re going above the desired speed, riding downhill or pedaling with the motor off. The life expectancy of the battery is around 1000 charging cycles.\nBattery prototype\nCOMPATIBILITY\nSmart Wheel comes in different sizes (20\", 26\u201d or 28\u201d wheel rim) and in 9 different colors (white, black, grey, blue, red, green, yellow, pink, Glow in the dark).

Pebble Watch.\nSOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)\nSmart Wheel is as open as possible. It generates a lot of data that can be interpreted and applied in many different ways. We want to enable the people to develop software and hardware solutions that will work with the Smart Wheel. We're trying to create an ecosystem of connected devices - that's why we\u2019re making our SDK available for you.\nFlyKly Smart Wheel already assembled and fitted to a wheel rim of your choice along with a bicycle tube and a tire\nFlyKly Smart Light with an adhesive surface for holding your smartphone and dynamo generator included\nan electric charger for charging the Smart Wheel\nIn 2011 Niko Klansek introduced the first line of the FlyKly electric bicycles to the USA market. After the first experience with the electric bicycles he realized the many possibilities of how to innovate on the e-bike field. The time was ideal to finally actualize the idea he had for years on how to upgrade the ordinary bicycle with a motor and turn it into a pedal assist. Niko sketched the rough concept and started working with a team of engineers, designers, software developers and bicycle culture researchers and created the first working prototype in early 2013.\nFlyKly is a team of coworking friends who are also strong supporters and promoters of utilitarian bicycle culture. Many of these young creatives were already a part of four successful Slovenian Kickstarter campaigns: LL Stol, ONDU Pinhole, Musguard and Lumu.\nThe FlyKly vision is to reshape the cities bottom-up to improve citizens' quality of life by providing a more people-, city- and environmentally-friendly solution to the problem of transportation. We try to empower people with tools that will start to reshape the cities with mass use in a way that again people, not cars, come first.\nTEAM\nfounder and CEO: Niko Klansek\nproduct design: Matej Colja\nmotor: Janez, Peter and Samo Frantar\nplastic housing: Darko and Peter Osterversnik\nsoftware: Klemen Nagode, Marko Jurincic, Rok Cresnik\ngraphic design: Romina Kavcic\nbicycle culture research: Eva Percic, Andraz Tarman, Tonja Klansek\nvideo: Andraz Jeric, Bor Pungercic, Luka Tisler, Simon Pensk\nmusic: Boomhauer & Donkeyhorse\nphoto: Peter Marinskek, Lucijan Kranjc, Vladimir Mickovic\nlegal: Maja Bogataj Jancic, Stephane Levy\nsupport: Jerca Jeric, Elvis Halilovic, Jurij Lozic, Miha Artnak, Tilen Sepic, Marko Pirc, Stas Stankovic, Nejc Matjaz, Nicholas Barfell, Caterine Molina\nSPECIAL THANKS\nGama System PerceptionAnalytics\nProjective Space\nMSC Bikes\nLinus Bikes\nPublic Bikes\nMission Bicycles\nPebble Watch", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe need to raise the funds to establish production in New York City, buy some tools and equipment and place bulk orders for the materials.\nShipping options have already been checked out and most of the arrangements have been confirmed.
