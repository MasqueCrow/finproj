I have been tattooing professionally for twelve years. During that time, I have successfully opened, owned, and operated multiple tattoo shops that are still currently up and running. I found climbing ten years ago and though my first love is bouldering, I also enjoy a killer sport climb or multi-pitch route.\n For years, I have dreamt of finding a way to meaningfully combine my two passions: tattooing and climbing - and I finally figured it out! I initially created a tattoo special that donates 10% of quarterly profits to a rotating non-profit that directly works to preserve and maintain our beloved wild outdoor areas. As this small personal project began to take hold, I was still left plotting about how else to expand on the concept. And what better way to raise money for the outdoors then to bring sick tattoos to the hikers, climbers, bikers, and general nature-lovers done inside Tattoo Basecamp.\n\nInterior Layout\n\n  An Airstream Basecamp trailer turned mobile tattoo shop? It\u2019s as simple and bitchin\u2019 as it sounds. After endless instances of friends wanting to get tattooed out at a climbing festival or classic crag, the time has come to make the experience a reality. It is an important factor to be able to offer a clean, proper shop atmosphere regardless of terrain, location or weather. I plan on creating a registered, up-to-code, genuine tattoo shop on wheels that brings high-quality tattoos to the outdoor community around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREWARDS\nWOMENS TANK TOP\nMENS T SHIRT\nSPECIAL EDITION BANDANA\nArtwork prints\nWHY AIRSTREAM BASECAMP?\nWhile planing the mobile tattoo station I\u2019ve gone through different options to create it. From a toy hauler to a camper trailer, but none of those were a good fit for this project as the Airstream Base Camp trailer. It\u2019s was love at first sight. Since the Interior is exactly what I needed to pass health department codes. Most camper trailers are wood interior and porous surfaces as well as the furniture fabric, and the health department requires for all tattoo shops to have non-porous walls, cabinets, countertops, and furniture including pillows.   Plus it has other things like power outlets, hand washing sink, potable water, wastewater tanks, and lighting. Leaving me with only very few things to adapt to be able to be up to code. \n\nWHAT\u2019S THE PLAN?\nOnce funds are received, the plan is as follows:\n1. Purchase the Airstream Basecamp trailer.\n2. Begin build-out and conversion to a legitimate tattoo station.\n3. Submit the plans to the health department.\n4. Finish inspection and finalize permits to operate.\n5. Rewards are printed and packaged.\n  *Climbing trips projected for spring 2020.\n6. Rewards are shipped to our stellar supporters.\n7. Plan a route and hit the road!\nWHY DO I CARE?\nAs so much of my inspiration for both my artwork and tattoos comes from natural spaces and climbing locations, I feel responsible to give something back to the places and community that has given so much to me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSETBACKS\n\nHealth department permits: There\u2019s multiple steps to be able to get the trailer fully certified and these take time.\nMy plan would be to have everything ready for full inspection within two months of the trailer being funded so there\u2019s no delays and I can start traveling. I have completed this process before on a brick and mortar location and have successfully passed all the inspections with no setbacks. I\u2019m confident this would be successful on the first go.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Angel Lopez\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nAngel Lopez is a Tijuana, Baja California native and San Diego, California local.

It's Dave from Thread&Leather, back with my new business partner Lily (who also happens to be my sister) five years after successfully launching the Wrap Wallet right here on Kickstarter. We're excited to bring you two amazing new products: the Thread&Leather Clutch and the Half-Wrap Wallet.\nThread&Leather Clutch - Simple, but not basic\nWe've spent the last year creating the ultimate take-anywhere clutch, designed to hold all your essentials in one spot. Durable for everyday use, yet stylish enough for date night.\nThe Clutch also works great for keeping all your travel documents and currency organized, so you don't lose anything important while rushing through security to catch your flight.\nThe Clutch is 7.75\" wide by 4.5\" tall, perfectly sized to hold everything you need and bring with you everywhere.\nThread&Leather Half-Wrap - Maximum minimalism\nWe at Thread&Leather are extremely proud of the Wrap Wallet. Over 12,000 customers agree that it is the best wallet in the world. It is as small as possible while remaining fully-functional. It is so good that it was recently awarded U.S. Utility Patent #10,080,407.\nHowever, we keep getting requests for an even smaller wallet for minimalists, people who don't carry cash, and people who want something ultra sleek for going out at night. So we took the best parts of the Wrap Wallet, the credit card pocket on the inside and the slide pocket on the outside, and combined them into the Half-Wrap.\nThere's enough room to hold 6 cards between the two pockets, with a few bills folded up inside, just in case. It also makes an amazing business card wallet, holding 10 business cards in the main pocket, with your hotel key easily accessible in the slide pocket.\nMaterials & Construction\nLike the Wrap Wallet, the Clutch and Half-Wrap are made in the USA, laser-cut from premium, locally-produced goat leather. We hand-sew every wallet with the finest French waxed-linen thread using the saddle stitch, which is stronger than any machine sewing method. We pride ourselves on the details & quality. See for yourself!!\nAfter testing dozens of closure options, we found the perfect magnetic clasp for the Clutch. It is simple, secure, feels great to open and close, and the stitching detail looks amazing!!\nEvery product we make is bespoke, sewn to customer specifications. You have your choice of seven colors of leather and five colors of thread, for 35 total color combinations.\nLeather Colors\nThread Colors\nColor Combinations\nHere are a few of our favorite color combinations. You'll be able to select your personal color combination after project funding closes. Creativity is encouraged!!\nHalf-Wraps in British Tan & Green, Rich Mahogany & Ecru, All-Natural & Red, and Jet Black on Black\nClutches in Jet Black on Black, British Tan & Green, and Ferrari Red on Red", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter project has its risks. We learned this the hard way after our first project exploded in popularity, and a few loose ends were lost along the way. But that was five years ago, and since then we've built a streamlined system where wallets are laser-cut, hand-sewn, and shipped around the world every business day. All of our production happens in-house, and we'll be using the excess capacity our business has after the holiday rush is over to begin producing and shipping the Clutch and Half-Wrap right after the project ends.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Half-Wrap Wallet", "descp": "The best wallet in the world, pared down to the bare essentials.

We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   \nIt's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. \nThis material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  \nUsing a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.\nHave a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  \nThe tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  \nAt Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  \nThe earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.\nIn 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  \nWhen we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.\n   Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.\nAdd it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  \nNeed less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  \nNever lose your pen again.   \n      They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  \n     We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.\nIn order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  \n   SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nMEDIA KIT HERE\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Single Pack", "descp": "Single Pack = 3 NanoPens.

This is a film about 5 of the best climbers in the world doing what they do best: crushing. Pretty Strong will follow 5 female climbers* around the world as they explore new climbing areas, find projects, and push the boundaries of our sport.\nThis film is for every climber stuck on the couch recovering from an injury. This film is for that little girl who just started climbing, to show her that the climbing world is a place for her. This film is for the climber looking for that last nudge of inspiration to get off their ass and go to the gym. If you\u2019re a climber, this film is for you.\n*There are dozens of climbers we are considering for this project, but the final selection will depend on climbing objectives, funding, athlete schedules, and our production schedule. As we get more of these things confirmed, we will update you on who we are planning to include. Comment below on who you would like to see featured!\n**Shoutout to good friend, designer, motion graphics artist, and creative genius Bryan Nanista for our badass Never Not Collective end card. Check out more of his work at http://www.bryanjnanista.com/ or on Instagram @bnanista.\nWhat was the first major climbing film you ever saw? What about the most recent one? Chances are if you\u2019ve turned on a climbing film in the last 18 years, you\u2019ve seen male climbers dominating the screen. With more women climbers than ever, the numbers weren't adding up, so we did some research. \nNina Williams on the Southwest Arete (5.9). Photo: Colette McInerney\nOut of 91 main segments in high production climbing films, there have been 8 segments that feature a female climber as the main character (and the same woman was the subject in three of those). Out of the 91 segments, 11 showed a woman climbing\u2026but her part was a supplement to the main story about one or more male climbers. Out of the six narrative-style feature films we looked at, none have had a female climber as the lead character.\nEmily Harrington on 'Tom Et Je Ris' (8b+/5.14a), Verdon Gorge, France. Photo: Colette McInerney\n...And we want to see more women making media.\nNot only are the climbing films being made today mostly featuring men on screen, but they are predominantly being created by men. We're hoping to foster a community and network of female media makers through Never Not (with this project and future ones). We want to build relationships with established female camera operators, editors, composers, animators, etc., and create opportunities for women who are new to outdoor media. \nBelow is a breakdown of the Pretty Strong budget. We are planning on getting half of our funding from Kickstarter and the other half from brand partners. \n        We are videographers, writers, photographers, and most importantly, climbers. With climbing films for inspiration, all four of us longed for movies that put female climbers front and center. As we developed individually as creatives and eventually founded this all-women's production team, we realized: We should make the film we've always wanted to see.\nStarted by four unapologetic women of the outdoors, Never Not Collective seeks to tell the stories of everyday people doing great things, brave things, things that are challenging, engaging, and gratifying\u2014regardless of \u201csuccess.\u201d Action is exciting, but we believe that people, with all their complexity, faults, and flaws, are at the heart of every compelling story. Our deep commitment to collaboration stems from diverse backgrounds in writing, photography, video, multimedia, and analytics. This fusion of unique perspectives helps Never Not create refreshing content that connects with a wide variety of viewers. \nCOLETTE MCINERNEY After a decade of traveling the world as a professional climber, Colette started recording her adventures through photography and film in 2010. She found her passion at the intersection of photo, film, travel, and climbing, and since then she\u2019s worked with companies like Red Bull, National Geographic, Prana, and New Balance to capture the story behind the biggest accomplishments. From summiting 14,000-foot peaks to scaling massive limestone walls, she can\u2014and will\u2014go anywhere to get the shot.\nJULIE ELLISON As Climbing magazine\u2019s first female Editor in Chief, Julie has spent a quarter of her life writing, shooting, and editing stories about climbing and the outdoors. With a genuine documentary style, her stories use adventure as a way to experience the world and help the people in it. She\u2019s written about the refugee crisis on the island of Kalymnos, a climbing camp for cancer survivors, and seeing death firsthand in Mexico. In 2017, the OR Daily named her one of the 26 Most Talented People in the Outdoor Industry.\nSHELMA JUN Shelma is a sucker for a good story. Whether it\u2019s documenting cyclists of color in NYC or building a temporary community art park in the Lower East Side, she focuses on bringing people together and sharing their stories. She is the founder of Flash Foxy, a multi-media platform that celebrates women in climbing, and the creator of the Women\u2019s Climbing Festival, a weekend of climbing, panels, and clinics. In 2017, she was named one of 40 women who\u2019ve made the biggest impact in the outdoor world by Outside Magazine.\nLESLIE HITTMEIER Working as an editor at Skiing Magazine, a managing editor at Teton Gravity Research, and a freelance photographer, Leslie became a fixture in skiing media before joining Never Not Collective as the group\u2019s token young gun. She\u2019s traveled to Chile, Japan, France, Jamaica, and all over the American West to document badass skiers, climbers, and adventurers in their natural habitats. As an obsessed skier and climber herself, Leslie plays and trains in her home mountain range of the Tetons.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are trying to make a feature-length film about climbing.

Currently available at the $99* EARLYISH BIRD perk ($139.95 retail price), $198* for two, or $285* for all three. *Does not include shipping.\n        Made in Bolivia with llama fiber, the Libre Sweater is our answer to the garment that doesn\u2019t exist any more\u2014a beautiful, rugged knit engineered to be put through the wringer, day after day. It keeps you comfortable, invites you to push yourself, and maintains that classic, heritage-inspired look, wherever you happen to roam. \n            We started with a tailored, unisex silhouette for the Libre, and then added raglan sleeves for enhanced mobility. In other words, no restriction while reaching for a climbing hold, zero bunching while stretched out over the handlebars, and no pull while lifting the coffee mug. For the front panel and arms, we\u2019ve employed a buttery-soft, midweight llama knit for year-round wear. We engineered an innovative, breathable knit mesh for the back panel, helping to regulate body temperature by releasing excess heat and moisture vapor. Say goodbye to sweaty back syndrome. Additionally, we beefed up the ribbing on the neck, cuffs, and hem to eliminate the dreadful stretching and sagging that plagues most woolen tops. We then rounded out the design by adding double-reinforced seams throughout to ensure it stands up the loads of use and abuse we encourage you to dish out. \nThe Libre pays homage to the early wool-wearing boundary pushers\u2014vikings, sailors, climbers, alpinists, skiers, writers, and other trailblazers who did things their way. After all, the wool sweater is one of the original technical midlayers, and we recognize it as a symbol of freedom that invites, and challenges, us to push ourselves to do things our way. \n  The story starts with the llama\u2014that noble, dependable pack animal that\u2019s been providing a way of life for people in the Bolivian Andes for thousands of years. Llamas are adapted to this high plains region, where 50-degree temperature swings can occur daily, and their hollow hair serves as the perfect form of natural insulation. It\u2019s proven to effectively trap warm air, insulate when wet, create a natural wind block, in addition to being naturally hypoallergenic, elastic, strong, and soft to the touch. This made it the perfect choice for the foundation of our Libre project.\n    Additionally, llama fiber is sourced with minimal effects on the environment, and the sale of llama fiber acts as a source of income for thousands of families in the Andes. We\u2019re working closely with these farmers and manufacturers to develop a supply chain that focuses on the animals\u2019 well-being, improves people\u2019s lives, and minimizes our impact on the environment. Members of our team regularly visit suppliers to ensure that we\u2019re creating a lasting, positive impact on communities in the region by responsibly sourcing the fiber that goes into our products.\n               We\u2019ve partnered with a team in Bolivia for our fiber, which is one of the few companies in the world that\u2019s developed an innovative dehairing process to separate coarse llama hair from fine hair. It\u2019s based on the same principles used for dehairing cashmere, yielding the finest fibers possible for its \u201cCashmere of the Andes.\u201d This fiber is then knitted to our specs to create the highly insulating, comfortable, and durable Libre sweater.\nTransparency and camaraderie stand at the center of this company, with a group of employees that has grown into a family within a superb working environment and excellent working conditions. \nThe group we've partnered with proudly holds social and environmental sustainability as the company\u2019s core values. Its strong commitment to social responsibility is evident throughout the company\u2019s practices and production processes: \nIt is WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production) certified. \nAll workers receive health and retirement benefits, paid vacation, and double pay for overtime. \nIt provides food subsidies to factory workers. \nErgonomic chairs for all of its workers. \nClose to 80% of its workforce are women; many of whom are the sole providers of their households. \nPreservation of Bolivia\u2019s strong heritage of knitting by providing job opportunities through this trade. \nThe use fiber dyes with low environmental impact. \nA water treatment plant has been mounted by its sister company and yarn provider to treat the production\u2019s water residues. \nLow-carbon emissions through the use of natural gas as our main source for heating. \nThe use of biodegradable plastic bags for shipping. \n      All our products are Guaranteed For Good. Your product is guaranteed to last 61 years, the average lifespan of a person living in the developing world. \nIf your product does not meet your expectations in any way, we\u2019ll work with you to resolve the issue, whether that means returning the item for repair, replacing or exchanging it, or refunding your purchase.\n  Davis Smith is a member of the UN Foundation\u2019s Global Entrepreneurs Council.

All the trips we have done in the past relied on us as volunteers to come up with large amounts of funds, typically asking our family and friends, to finance the project. Also, our impact on these trips was limited to building a single house for one family. Project Latitude is our solution to the following problems:\n1. How could we make volunteering trips more affordable?\n2. How could we have a more lasting presence in these communities?\nThe concept is simple: Our products are tied to a community for as long as they are sold. The community will inspire the product design, make the products and they will be the sole recipients of the funds raised from the sales.\nEach project will have a fundraising goal. We are architects, so every project will respond to the communities\u2019 construction needs. Since this particular project is a build, let's say it's a certain amount of bricks needed to be raised. Every product we sell will count towards this fundraising goal.\nEach product is tied to the community for its lifetime. So when we start a new project, it will be with an entirely new line of products \u2013 based on the culture of this new community.\nBecause of everyone\u2019s support on Project Latitude\u2019s Kickstarter, we were able to donate 1200 liters of water to the Ecuador Earthquake relief efforts. The water was donated earlier this week in Canoa, Ecuador and came at a critical time for the community.\nOur first product is the result of a trip to Ecuador, where we were inspired by the Andean culture and lifestyle. We fell in love with the rich colors and textures of the local fabric, which inspired us to design a backpack to help raise our funds.\nThe Chaski Backpack is an all-purpose roll-top backpack designed for people like us, one that could be used in the city AND on adventurous weekend getaways. \nEach Chaski is individually handmade in Ecuador.  Chaski means messenger in Quichua - the local Andean language.\nRoll-Top Style Backpack\nLocal Material Shoulder Strap Detailing\nExterior Pockets for Everyday Essentials\nAll Detailing is made from 100% Recycled Car Tires\nPadded Interior Laptop Compartment\nVertical Front Pocket Accessible While Backpack is on Shoulder\nRubber Bottom with Unique Pattern from Recycled Car Tires\nAustriAlpin Quick-Release Buckle\nHandwoven Interior Lining and Accent Strap\nMultiple Strap Colors Available\nAll products are stamped with the latitude coordinate where the product is from. The Chaski has 00 for Ecuador.\nAnyone can track the impact the sales are making as well as track the overall progress of the project on our website. Each product will also come with a tag about the members of the community.\nOur hope is to create a brand that will ultimately impact communities across Latin America by rethinking the way volunteer projects are funded.\nWhile many other companies offer to donate a portion of their proceeds to a good cause, Project Latitude actually takes the funds - or bricks in this case - and builds the project!\nWith the help of volunteers, Project 00 will build an entrepreneur workshop in the community of La Isla outside Quito, Ecuador. This will provide the community with much needed space for production, which in turn will empower the workers and the community as a whole.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are architects/designers - we have full confidence in the process of designing the products as well as organizing the physical build. Bag production is new to us, but we've been working with the manufacturers for close to a year. We've adjusted the backpack's design many times to arrive at our final product. Despite best intentions, manufacturing complications and delays can occur when dealing with overseas logistics.

Fill tikr with treats, then set the length of playtime by turning the built-in timer dial. There are NO electronics to break, and NO batteries to charge or even replace. Yup, you read that right!\nFill with Treats!\nSet the timer from 5-45 minutes\nPlaytime!\nPlaytime can be as short as 5 minutes, or as long as 45. You decide! \nTikr rewards your dog's play and curiosity with gradual access to the treats inside. \nTreats can only fall out when the timer-controlled holes in the toy align, so your dog remains captivated throughout play.\nThe treat holes are different sizes, so larger treats are saved until the very end. First the small, then the medium, and finally the large treat!\nOh, and did we mention... no batteries or charging required!\nTikr is made of incredibly tough rubber that is safe on teeth and won\u2019t make that loud rattling sound that hard plastic toys do.\nHelp us reach 1,001 backers and free tikr treats unlock for all backers! Tikr treats are the perfect size for tikr, healthy, and all-natural. Help spread the word!\nThe idea for tikr came from playing with our dogs Misha and Aure. Our dogs love to play. But unfortunately, nothing on the market was keeping their attention for more than a few minutes at best. They needed a stimulating, long-lasting dog toy that would spark their natural curiosity. And we wanted a safe, healthy and affordable solution... \nSo, we came up with tikr!\nOur concept was to use a timer to MAXIMIZE the time that treats were captured by the toy. This would ultimately ensure that playtime would last. I took the idea to d:e Creative to transform it from concept to reality...\nSome of my early sketches\nTogether we developed tikr to be the ULTIMATE solution: a super fun interactive dog toy that rewards your pup's attention with treats, and can keep them engaged for an amazingly long period of time - over and over again!\nEarly CAD screenshots\nAll dogs rejoice... it's a hit!\nTikr's patent pending secret is the built-in timer combined with varying hole sizes. As the timer unwinds, the hole in the treat chamber slowly aligns with the increasingly bigger holes in the outer shell. When the inner hole aligns with the outer holes, the treats are awarded through play. Larger treats remain inside tikr (until the time is right) because they can't fit through the smaller holes. \nIt's really that simple!\nX-Ray view shows the treat chamber rotating - in super quick time!\nWe're designing special tikr treats that will be the ideal size. But, you can totally use any treats or kibble your dog likes! Keep the play experience exciting by varying the timer settings, or amount of treats used.\nTikr is made from a food safe rubber-like blend that's flexible, extremely durable, and easy on your dog's teeth. It uses no electronics or batteries.\ntikr size compared with a standard tennis ball\nTikr has been our labor of love for the last two-and-a-half years. The design has been perfected and dogs absolutely love playing with tikr!  Production is nearly ready, and we've come to you, the Kickstarter community, to help us make tikr a reality for dog lovers everywhere. \nTooling has been very costly, and we want to make a sizable order with the factory in order to keep the costs low for everyone.  So please, for treats sake, back tikr today! \nThank you for your support!\n- The Christensen Family (Misha, Amanda, Maddox, Whit & Aure)\n                                                                         We're super excited!\nLaunch Kickstarter Campaign\nSuccessfully funded! High-Fives all around!\nExpect the unexpected\nConquer the unexpected\nBegin treat production\nPlace initial order with our factory\nPrepare tikr for factory shipment\nHead for the open seas\nBegin shipping tikr to backers!\nAll dogs unite...

We believe that there needs to be a fashionable and functional alternative for climbing footwear. This is where our journey began, and has now surpassed what we thought was even possible. In the end, we created an authentic shoe line full of classic, distinctive qualities. Let\u2019s Take Hold together.      \n     Early in the process, we committed to blending fashion and function. The colors, style, and nostalgia of retro footwear drove our simple obsession. Pulling inspiration from vintage running shoes, retro soccer shoes, and bowling shoes, we slowly began turning these inspirational concepts into high performance climbing shoes. \n     We pioneered along-side an innovative designer from France and began to tackle the mountains ahead. Every part of each shoe has been meticulously designed. The external features of the shoes distinctively resemble the classic footwear that originally inspired us.  \n     Our development process resulted in over 150 samples. Although a daunting and lengthy process, only extended by our fierce and stubborn determination to develop originality and a timeless aesthetic, not a single detail was overlooked.\n     Between our ingenuity and final world-class samples, 1,095 days have passed. That is three years of defying the odds and building our vision. 36 months of creating a product that is stylish, unprecedented, and innovative.\n     We want to build these shoes together, and offer you a deep discount as an early pioneer. We are not owned by a parent company or conglomerate.  We don't have big investors, and are completely independent. Yet, you have helped make us identifiable in the world of climbing, for which we are incredibly grateful. We are excited to bring you a future of innovative grips, clothing, and footwear. Thank you and enjoy.\n      In our pursuit for a rubber that exceeded the standard, we discovered one formulated for the United States Navy Seals. The rubber was built for a purpose. This outsole rubber provided security for the Navy Seals, assuring that their feet would not slip during rugged approaches.\n     We signed a licensing agreement, and began to incorporate the innovative rubber into our shoes. This tenacious rand and outsole rubber is called \u201cDark Matter\", and is a member of the \"UnParallel Rubber\" family. Its signature is denoted with a simple line placed on the bottom of each shoe.\n     Our functional colored outsole rubber is the first of it\u2019s kind, ever. Several models are the only climbing shoes, ever created, devoid of the monotonous black outsole. The creation of both a sticky and colored outsole rubber provides a perfect combination of fashion, function, and performance.\n     Inspired by a retro running shoe, the Runner embodies simple aspects of classic footwear while retaining the functionality of a high-performance climbing shoe. A medium stiffness, highly downturned toe provides precision in technical or steep overhung climbing. The fish-hook, thin midsole helps edging power for gym and outdoor climbing.\n     The padded tongue, breathable mesh upper, and thin lining offers comfort and reliability. Crafted with synthetic materials to create a long lasting fit (minimal stretch) and three point velcro closure system, the Runner is a supreme climbing shoe blending fashion and function.\nLearn More\n     Inspired by a retro running shoe, the Runner embodies simple aspects of classic footwear while retaining the functionality of a high-performance climbing shoe.

Crafted with synthetic materials to create a long lasting fit (minimal stretch) and three point velcro closure system, the Runner is a supreme climbing shoe blending fashion and function. The LV (Low Volume) version is for a narrower, thinner foot.\nLearn More\n     Inspired by everyday classic footwear, the Street is a faultless blend of fashion and function. The softest and most downturned aggressive shoe in the line was designed with synthetic materials for minimal stretch. An ultra thin midsole proves a softer, more sensitive feel, creating an extremely lightweight, aggressive climbing shoe.\n     The Street is fully sealed in a formidable matte black finish and equipped with a thin, padded tongue. The toe box has been masterfully crafted to allow for a higher level of comfort and works conjunctively with the perfect amount of tension in the heel. The larger matte black buckles give the tightening system power and sensitivity to mold the soft shoe to your foot.\nLearn More\n     Designed to resemble a retro 70\u2019s bowling shoe, the Bowler mimics similar characteristics in style. Adorned in vintage details, the Bowler is an original climbing shoe intended for beginners with a less aggressive, classic shape. Produced with a supremely thick midsole for durability, ultra thick rand, and leather upper for extreme comfort, the Bowler is something cool for beginner climbers.        \nLearn More\n     Modeled after a 1970\u2019s retro soccer shoe, the Kick is a uniquely crafted climbing shoe. A perfect companion for intermediate climbers, the shape is slightly arched and perfectly tensioned in the heel. Developed with comfort and function in mind, the medium stiffness midsole helps enable the shoe retain its clean shape.\n     The Kick is dyed leather with custom colors, soaking them in rich tones creates an unprecedented original shoe. Perfect for bouldering, gym training, and outdoor climbing, the Kick blurs the lines between comfort and performance. The Kick boasts a simple, single strap, velcro closure system for quick on and off capabilities.\nLearn More\n     Modeled after a 1970\u2019s retro soccer shoe, the Kick is a uniquely crafted climbing shoe.

If you are a guy, start with your street shoe size. Then, we suggest ordering a half size down for a comfortable fit and a full size down for a performance fit.\n     If you are a lady ordering a Regular Volume shoe, take a size and a half off your street shoe to get the regular volume equivalent. Then downsize a half or full size depending on fit preference.\nLow Volume (LV): Low Volume shoes are for anyone with a thinner, narrower foot. Because this is normally a characteristic of ladies, the sizing of Low Volume shoes are based on ladies\u2019 sizes.\n     If you are a lady, start with your street shoe size. Then, we suggest ordering a half size down for a comfortable fit and a full size down for a performance fit.\n     If you are a guy ordering a Low Volume shoe, add a size and a half to your street shoe to get the low volume equivalent. Then, downsize a half or full size depending on fit preference.\nWhere does your rubber come from? \"Dark Matter\" rubber, a member of the \"UnParallel Rubber\" family, was developed for the United States Navy Seals. A sticky, colored outsole rubber for their approach shoes was needed. We use this same rubber for our climbing shoes. The first of its kind.\nHow many shoes are you able to produce? We are in this for the long haul and are committed to filling every pre order and orders for years to come.\nWhat sizes do you offer? Regular Volume: 4-13 (includes half sizes) Low Volume: 4-11 (includes half sizes).\nWhat if my shoes don\u2019t fit? Simply call us to receive a return authorization number. Send the shoes back, and we will ship you a replacement in the correct size.\nDo you ship internationally? Yes. If you are outside of the USA, please select the international support option.\nWhere will you be selling your shoes after Kickstarter? Early retailers listed above will be the first with product, please support them.\nWhen is the estimated delivery date? We plan to ship all pre orders between June 1st and July 1st of this year from our warehouse in Saint Louis, MO.\nWhy do you need my support of this project? Initial orders for \"Dark Matter\" rubber and upper materials are extensive; we need your help to hit production minimums. Most importantly, we want to offer you an exclusive wholesale price to pick up the shoes as an early believer and supporter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have carefully thought through each phase of this process, however, we also acknowledge that every project comes with its own risks, challenges, and unknowns.

Just wondering if I can have them switched out? I wore them for about five minutes walking around and it really was to much to bear at that point before needing to take them off for a rest. In the meantime, am I allowed to actually use them even if it is for only 5 minute stints at a time I really want to, but am afraid they will void my return/warranty if I do so?", "time": "almost 5 years ago"}, {"username": "rothar ly", "content": "Can I get a size swap for my shoes ty", "time": "almost 5 years ago"}, {"username": "hhj", "content": "am wearing Miura VS Womens Sz 36..anyone in a similar size and managed to get a good fit with the Street? which size did u get?", "time": "almost 5 years ago"}, {"username": "Andrew Herrera", "content": "Has anyone else not received their shoes yet?

So, we need to hit this goal! You can help by continuing to spread the word and sharing on Facebook/Twitter! \nWHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT TEPLO:\nIntroducing the world\u2019s first smart bottle for tea lovers.\nTeplo is a revolutionary smart bottle that allows tea drinkers to brew the perfect cup of tea by tracking and controlling brewing temperature and time, via a mobile app. Instead of letting your tea get cold, a rechargeable battery hidden in the base of the bottle keeps the beverage at the preferred temperature. Plus users can personalize, find and order premium teas from all over the world on Teplo\u2019s app.\nTHE PROBLEM:\nTea is the most popular drink in the world yet many tea drinkers don\u2019t realize that getting the perfect cup of tea is actually quite complex and difficult; tea is extremely sensitive to temperature and brewing time. Compared to the way most typically brew tea: by simply throwing a tea bag in hot water and start drinking, we are ignoring taste, flavor, color and even the correct drinking temperature of the tea. \nThe Teplo team spent the past year carefully engineering both the bottle and the technology that powers it and are excited to unveil our product and bring it to tea lovers around the world. Introducing the world\u2019s smartest bottle for tea drinkers - simple and elegant!\nTHE SOLUTION:\nTeplo combines technology with its unique design to allow for the most perfect tea drinking experience, unlike anything else.\nThe glass bottle allows tea enthusiasts to appreciate the color of the tea, as well as to maintain the perfect temperature for a long period of time.\nHOW IT WORKS:\nCRAFT YOUR PERSONALIZED TEA BLEND:\nTHE SPECS:\nTeplo\u2019s innovative design consists of a glass bottle with a thermo sensor, heater, Bluetooth communication module and two batteries. An internal battery is used to communicate with smart devices, and has an all-day battery life. An external battery maintains the drinking temperature for as long as four hours.\nTHE APP:\nTeplo will provide a mobile application for iOS and Android, available from the App store.\nTHE R&D:\nWe develop our technology in our in house R&D lab. We also leverage our capability by partnering with manufacturers across the world.\nTHE PRESS:\nTHE TEAM:\nKazunori Kawanobe (CEO, co-founder)\nAbhinav Sureka (COO, co-founder)\nMayuresh Soni (CTO, co-founder)\nMarissa Goldstein, CMO\nBill Phelps, Ideastorm Inc., Design Partner\nTetsuo Hitomi(tet.hitomi@gmail.com), Logo Design Partner\nMai Usami(sammy.mu@gmail.com), Logo Design Assistant\nLemonLight Media, Video Production\nAdam Goldstein, Timroon, Manufacturing Partner\nOUR STORY:\nWe are three friends who came to the US to get our MBA\u2019s at Babson College. Coming from Japan and India, tea is really important to our culture. With a growing tea market in the US of $2.4B, we thought that there must be a better way to use technology to create a better tea drinking experience. So, after discussing together, we decided to create Teplo, a simple yet elegant solution that combines modern technology with traditional tea drinking.\nWe\u2019ve spent the past year designing and building both our hardware product as well as the technology that powers it. We\u2019ve gone through countless prototypes and have tested it out on our classmates, who come from all over the world.\nNow we are ready to launch Teplo and get it into the hands of tea enthusiasts all over the world and we need your help. With the money we raise from this campaign, we will be able to purchase tooling and thus kickstart the manufacturing process. We have the prototypes, have identified our suppliers and just need the capital to manufacture.\nTIMELINE:\nPHOTO GALLERY:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing any product to market can present challenges and unfortunately delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances.

You can also easily label and or design the caps so that users know which side to open because there is little difference on the two caps in Teplo, one being a little thicker/taller. Having both ends accessible is brilliant for cleaning as tea stains. And for replacing parts e.g. the warmer cap is broken or battery worn out etc. On second thought, why not give backers an option and pay a little more with the magnetic infusion cap? Or as a stretch goal bonus? Afterall, this additional feature is only confined to the cap and can easily be opted out. There can be so many combo as well. Like not having the warmer element at the bottom and just plain bottom cap, making it more affordable or perhaps simpler when you are consuming one or two types of tea most often or when not travelling. How often would one need a warmer and an app feature built in at the bottom? Even eliminating accidental \"throwing in\" the whole Teplo into the dish washer by accident for argument sake?

Have you considered a tea brewer/strainer that you put tea leaves/tea bag that can be magnetically attached to top of magnetic screw top? Whilst brewing, the container is flipped upside down for brewing. Then, when the time is optimum, turn it right side up and tea bag/leaves are above the liquid level - stopping the brewing process whilst the lower half maintains the temperature etc? This allows, for e.g., to just simply put the tea in strainer, pour hot water, flip it upside down, then go out and about with your life. After a few mins or optimum brewing time to your liking, flip Teplo right side up to stop brewing and the heating element helps maintains temperature. When cleaning or whenever, unscrew top, discard used tea and reinstate the tea strainer easily without much care -- all with the simple magnetic attachment. I see your video and it uses another tea strainer on a chain, meaning for some tea, you cannot leave it steeping and have to continually be aware when the app reminds you to remove tea leaves etc. Imagine it as simple as flipping it upside down? No hassles in taking tea strainer out, then when do you put it? If you're driving whilst tea is brewing, then simply lift Teplo from drink holder, flip it upside down and carry on.

My name's Jesse.  Some of you may know me from some inspirational videos around the world I made a few years ago, but many of you also know me as a climber you've likely seen at the crags.  This Kickstarter campaign isn't about myself though - it was a community effort that helped me put together a great guidebook in a short amount of time, and hopefully, it will remain a community effort.\nI've been very open about the project, and with the help of several people in the climbing community - and local hard climbers Greg Williamson, Leslie Timms, and Mark Smith - I've been able to put together a guidebook for the best crags in Southern Ontario.\nLeslie Timms killing it!\nA Brief History\nHere's a familiar story.  For most of us, the current climbing guidebook looks like this - a mish mash of old guidebooks, PDF printouts, and maybe a document a friend or two put together:\nOld guidebooks\nI heard about another guidebook being released about 8 years ago, so I waited and waited... and waited.  Same with everyone else.  Eventually, many lost hope, but I did build the app anticipating a possible release.  After arriving at The Swamp for the seventh year, people were still asking which routes were which - it was all kept a secret.\nAfter Greg Williamson released his amazing Lion's Head PDF recently, most of us assumed that a guidebook was never going to happen. And it was really unfortunate because I was meeting climbers around the world who wanted to climb in Ontario, but couldn't find the right information.\nThe information was all there - the key was to simply put it all together and show climbers we were timely.  So I volunteered over the past half year or so and pretty much gave up much of last summer's climbing season taking photographs and putting together a comprehensive climbing app and guidebook for the most popular climbing areas in southern Ontario - The Swamp, Devil's Glen, Metcalfe, Mount Nemo, Old Baldy, Lion's Head, White Bluff, and TV Tower.  It's been an exhausting effort, but I'll admit it's been fun at times too - who can complain about hanging out at Lion's Head in the fall? \nFirst, I'd like to thank a HUGE group of old and new school climbers who climbed all the routes and helped me fill in so many details.  Everyone was really helpful and open with assisting me with the project - I can't stress enough how much of a group effort it was.  \nNext, I'd like to thank these climbers for their contributions on the hard routes that I may never be able to climb: Greg Williamson, Mark Smith, and Leslie Timms.  I'd also like to thank Joe Stubbs for providing his Mount Nemo photos.  This is all super important because the book was a community effort.  My roles was to piece the information together.\nOld Baldy, Mount Nemo, Lion's Head\nSo here's my current progress.  The app, done in partnership with Rakkup, is 95% complete and pretty much ready to release.  It's really useful, and good for Apple or Android, but I'll tell you about it further down.  Right now, I'd like your support on Kickstarter so I can publish the print guide version.  If you want to see the below previews come to life, all you have to do is pre-order a copy and get your friends to also!   \nPrint Guide Features\nThe print guide will be photo intensive, having pictures of most routes.  The photos have been meticulously touched up, so you won't see dark walls against bright skies.\nBefore and after touchups\nI've also made the guide very friendly to those new to climbing, and have included specific approach photos, GPS coordinates, and directions.  At Lion's Head, I have photos of most of the rappel areas.  Every route includes consensus grades, quality ratings, and fun descriptions.\nFinally, I put some of my graphic design and photography skills to the test, and whipped up some fun area drawings and climbing photos.  As the book focuses on the best southern Ontario crags, and especially sport climbs, I'll do my best to keep the guidebook lean and mean.\nThe Swamp preview\nWhy I'm On Kickstarter\nThe Canadian dollar is really weak right now, so publishing costs have gone up, and I definitely could use support from the Ontario climbing community, both financially and spiritually - I want everyone to be on board helping and treat this as a community project.\nI didn't set the Kickstarter amount too high, but that's kind of a threshold amount, with a bit coming out of my own pocket.  I'd really like this project to come to life and not go into any debt!\nRakkup Sample\nApp\nThe app was built in partnership with Rakkup, a digital publisher of rock climbing guidebooks.  It's available on Apple and Android, and has these pretty cool features:\nThe app doesn't use data.  Everything, including photos and maps, is stored offline once you purchase a digital guidebook\nMultiple route photos, which is useful if you're the type who has trouble identifying routes (don't worry, it's common)\nGPS.  Never get lost finding a crag again! (or a rappel area at Lion's Head)\n1 year of updates.  Get the latest scoop on what's new on the walls all the way to 2017.  Updated instantly once we find out or send something.\nThe Swamp, Devil's Glen, Metcalfe\nMost of all, the speed at which we were able to complete this task shows that my contributors and I are very knowledgeable of all the climbing areas, with local experts mantaining each crag.  More importantly, we can be trusted to be transparent, open (NO SECRETS), and keep you posted and up to date on the Ontario climbing scene.  Another goal is also to have  community contributed updates so we don't have to wait another 20 years for a guidebook!\nSo that's my story. Many thanks to the climbing community, but we're not over the top yet, so please make a pledge and pre-order a copy!\nExtra Rewards For Backers Who Really Want To Help!\nHere are some extra rewards on offer if you're a SUPER backer!\nCrimp mugs made with holds provided by Ontoro Climbing:\nDry Pointe climbing shoe inserts stuffed into the crimp mugs - keep the funk out!

Click here for a sample of my work.\nContributor Bio's:\nLeslie Timms (in her own words)\nI was so immediately taken by rock climbing that I quit my dream job as a canoe expedition guide and was road trip bound with my college sweetheart. After years of living out of the back of a Subaru Outback and climbing rocks across North America, we both eventually got the itch to have a place to call home. Raised in Kingston, Ontario, I've always had a bond with the great lakes and the Niagara Escarpment. On a short climbing trip to the Bruce Peninsula, I fell in love with Lion's Head, the crags of the Beaver Valley, and the small towns scattered along the shores of Georgian Bay. Chasing a dream, my husband and I rather spontaneously picked Thornbury, Ontario to settle in. The location is perfect and the local community was so welcoming that it immediately felt like home. I guided caving, rock climbing and paddling with Free Spirit Tours for years and fell in love with guiding rock climbing. I went on to get certified as a guide and mentor with Professional Climbing Guides Institute and I started up a climbing guiding service called On the Rocks Climbing Guides. I now live out my dreams of guiding awesome people across North America and teaching a variety of custom technical climbing courses at crags close to home. I've loved getting to know the local crags, the people and empowering climbers to get out there and explore too. When I'm not guiding full time, I love developing new routes in Southern Ontario and pushing myself on the trad, sport and mixed styles that the local stone offers. In search of an endless summer, my husband and I hit the road each winter with our 13ft Trillium trailer, to climb, roam and explore until winter passes back home. I think I spend more time dangling from a cliff then I do on the ground and I really like it that way.\nGreg Williamson\nTHE Lion's Head local. Greg Williamson is Bruce Peninsula born and raised, and currently lives with his wife and 3 daughters in Lion's Head, Ontario. He has been one of the leading route developers in the area for years and is a familiar face out at the cliff on any day of the week. You can be sure that Greg is the first and last one on the cliff each year, running solo laps on the classics, eyeing out new hard routes, or belaying his mutant climbing daughters. Greg truly knows the limestone of Lions Head better than anyone and compiled a free regularly updated guide book to the area, in his spare time from being a full time architect.\nMark Smith\nMark Smith has been climbing in southern Ontario for over 17 years. His excitement, energy and positive attitude towards the sport of climbing are undeniable and contagious. He is always looking for ways to contribute and grow the climbing community and now offers climbing clinics, private lessons and more. If you\u2019re interested in improving your climbing while keeping it fun or just looking to have a great time climbing, send him an email and he\u2019ll gladly find a way to make it happen.\nAlso, special thanks to Neel and Will!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk is fairly low for the app. It will take about 2 weeks to finalize.\n\nThe book is also low risk - if I get enough funding, I will publish it. However, it will require a little more time - but it'll be worth it. The climbing data and route lines are in a database, which after writing some simple programming scripts, converts very nicely into book format, but I estimate I'll need another month to go through the drafts, put in all the graphics from the advertisers, and have mistakes checked out. I will keep everyone posted along the way - after all, that's the fun part of being a backer!\n\nFrom there, it will take a minimum of 2 months for the book to be queued and published.\n\nThe app isn't being sold as a standalone yet, because the earnings has to be split with Rakkup, and thus won't fully contribute to the print guide campaign. If you just want the app, arrange with me directly. \n\nThis winter's been warm, so if you think you'll get an early start, please support me by purchasing the book + app reward. The app has been discounted if you buy both.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Mount Nemo Turtle Wall Topo Free On Sloper Climbing App", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Niagara Glen Guidebook Printing!", "update_content": "Hi Everyone,\nI thought you might be interested in watching this vlog as I got my printed proof for the Niagara Glen guidebook!\nCheers,\nJesse"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "New Niagara Glen Bouldering Guidebook Kickstarter", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Affordable Climbing Belay Glasses For Sale!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Ethiopia Climbing - Gear Request!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comments": [{"username": "Scott O'Brien", "content": "Hey Jesse.

I simply want to say THANK YOU so much for visiting this Kickstarter and supporting this new adventure for Carabiner Coffee Co! Here's the story of what this campaign is all about.\nClick the photo to read the story of Carabiner Coffee Co.\nI started Carabiner Coffee with the mission of sharing an incredible cup of coffee along with the inspiration to do what you love. For over two years now I've have taken Ol Blue to countless places across the country meeting friendly faces in the outdoor community, sharing stories and most importantly sharing inspiration and encouragement over a great cup of coffee. The love and support that has come from those who have walked up to the door of the van has been overwhelming and never ceases to put a huge smile on my face. I can't imagine doing anything else with my life other than this and that's why I couldn't be more stoked for this next chapter. After two years of constant moving and settling in different areas around the west, it's time to find Carabiner Coffee a home and start spreading the love in a whole new way. \nThis Kickstarter campaign is to raise enough funds to open the first ever Carabiner Coffee storefront and coffee shop in Boulder, CO. Not only will this new location be the hub for Carabiner Coffee, it will also be supporting young grassroots companies that are striving to make their mark in the outdoor industry. The new space will be aptly named the Carabiner Collective! \nTake a tour of Ol Blue\nThe Plan is to keep it just as simple as it is in the van. We will offer small batch drip coffee, pourover and aero-press as the three main brew methods and not a latte in sight. Carabiner Coffee has always been focused on keeping things simple, honest and genuine and that is what I want the experience of visiting the Carabiner Collective to be. Our roast master has been roasting for over 30 years and our beans are responsibly and sustainably sourced strictly from small farms around the world. To me, that is what a great cup of coffee is made of and always will be. \nThe Funding from this Kickstarter will go towards many things to get this new venture off the ground. Here are the main objectives that will be accomplished when we reach our goal of $12,000!\n+ Finding, renting and furnishing this new space with local, upcycled, recycled, hand crafted and community sourced materials. (it's going to be really really really good looking)\n+ Expanding production and supply capabilities of Carabiner Coffee to reach and encourage more people to pursue their dreams. (This means having a desk for the first time ever in Carabiner history) \n+ Collaborating with both local and national grass-roots companies who strive to promote a life of passion, adventure and connection to nature.\n+ Providing a place for climbers, bikers, hikers, skiiers, riders, runners and simply just genuinely awesome people (and by genuinely awesome people, I mean all of you) to cultivate and share ideas, laugh and smile because life is beautiful thing and we're all in it together so we should all probably hang out.\nWhat else will the Carabiner Collective offer?\nAnother goal besides serving you a great cup coffee will be to create a launching pad for small outdoor companies from across the country to showcase their products and put them in front of the outdoor community! There are many local Colorado companies that will be represented as well as others from coast to coast that are fueled by the mission to improve the way we play outside. I can't wait to give these companies a place to show the world the amazing things they are creating and the love that the outdoor community has for them.\nAlong with supporting small business, the Carabiner Collective will be a space to hold events, outdoor initiatives and simply a place to share the love of being outside! There won't be a day that goes by in this place that we aren't stoked to be there.\nDoes this mean Ol Blue and Carabiner Coffee are going to stop bringing you great coffee and good vibes across the country?\nNO WAY! The Carabiner Collective will only improve the capabilities of coffee tours and give Ol Blue a place to rest her wheels whenever we aren't on the road. Meeting you all out in the wild places is what this company was built on and that will never go away.\nPLEASE if you have any questions about this new venture or even new ideas of what you would like to see it become, I'd love to talk with you about it!\nYou can stay posted here regarding new information and developments as well as on the Carabiner Coffee website www.carabinercoffee.com \nYou can also follow Carabiner Coffee on Instagram and Twitter\nThank you from the bottom to the top of my heart for supporting this campaign and the truly awesome outdoor community that it is meant to inspire.\nAll Love,\nErik Gordon - Founder of Carabiner Coffee Company", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacle in establishing the Carabiner Collective will be finding the perfect location for the space. We will be looking for a centrally located space with easy access bike routes, trails and foot traffic. The faster you can bike, run, ride or slide here there better. Since we will be keeping it simple in the coffee arena, we will not have to go through as many hurdles of health codes and licensing which are always the worst enemy of every new shop. Over the past few years of starting and running Carabiner Coffee out of Ol Blue I've learned how to keep the mission simple and the experience amazing.

But most brands we found that actually created a decent watch had an exorbitant price tag. Even on Kickstarter.\nAfter completing the most backed watch project ever on Kickstarter with 4435 backers, we are introducing a passion project in the Havok Racer Chronograph watch using your feedback and suggestions.\nThe inspiration for the Havok Racer came from vintage timepieces worn by race car drivers in the 1960's. Prior to that, drivers wore stopwatches strapped to their wrist to track lap times. \nWe wanted to create a classic racing chronograph watch that captures the scent of exhaust and the sound of roaring engines. The Havok Racer embodies the soul and adrenaline rush of conquering impossible speeds.\nWith timeless design, quality components and detailed craftsmanship, we have created the perfect racing timepiece whether you're in the stands or the driver's seat.\nSeveral problems needed to be addressed as we designed a watch we could not find: \nAFFORDABILITY: Under $200 on Kickstarter. Working direct to consumer, we pass the savings to you with radical transparency for a quality watch. \nPRACTICALITY: We wanted a precision handmade watch useful enough for everyday wear. Functional & sensible in all situations. \nDESIGN: Beautifully crafted for timelessness in a vintage design. No funky shapes or colors, just a classic timepiece.\nDiamond Black Racer\nRose Gold Racer\nOur goal? Simply, to create a watch that was practical, beautiful, and affordable.\nWe decided to design, create, and share a watch that solved all the problems we faced. We wanted to do so, direct to consumer, without any retail markups. At $139, we beat out all competition while over-delivering on the components offered by anyone else- sapphire crystal, solid 316L steel case, debossed steel bezel, japanese movt, and more.\nSapphire Crystal\nOur designers and engineers have worked tirelessly to perfect this chronograph watch. Created with premium materials in a symphony of design, a masterpiece was born.\nWe are generally minimalist in our goods. But in the Havok Racer, we wanted to revive an era where quality was a standard and excellence was strived for.\nEvery single minute detail of this timepiece was considered, from the semibold font on the tachymetric scale bezel to the legible red tips on the secondary seconds recorder. It is truly an expression of purpose and precision.\nImperceptibly calibrated.\nAn additional 3 sub-dials offer tracking for seconds, minutes, and hours for ultimate precision.\n An object of design.\nThe Racer features a tachymetric bezel that allows for speed/distance readings on the go.\nAn expression of purpose.\nFor convenient daily use, a 31-date function is integrated into the watch at the 6 o\u2019clock position. The highly demanded sapphire crystal, from last project, comes standard with all watches now.\nIn designing, we wanted to keep the watch functional and easy to read. A 3-hand analog face with lume offers easy visibility at all times.\nTo increase durability while maintaining a solid construction, we decided on a 316L steel case. The case was to be sandblasted first, to have all the edges softened, but also brushed, to offer a distinct, durable surface. It is 42 mm for a full-sized chronograph watch.\n316L Steel will be used for the cases for a strong, weighty construction. The bezel and backplate are also steel and fitted perfectly. \nBLUE RACER STRETCH GOAL\nROSE GOLD STRETCH GOAL\n4 Styles Available\nWe have 4 different models in this line of Havok Racer Chronograph:\nSapphire Blue: An iridescent blue color-way for a brighter look. Similar to the British Racing Green, but with a contrasting sapphire blue.\nBritish Racing Green: The rebirth of an iconic color-way in the racing world. A classic green face with a natural leather band for a vintage look. \nDiamond Black: The minimal black on black watch for a more subtle touch in your daily wear. Perfect for any gentleman\u2019s wardrobe. \nRose Gold: An elaborate coupling of rose gold and black for an upscale luxury look. For a little more flare in your every day wear. \nThe Racer Collection\nWall Of Cases\nWe now has an established relationship with our manufacturing partners from the last collection and moving forward will be smooth sailing. We chose to work with this reputable watch manufacturing group known for decades of rigorous quality control. \nWe've thoroughly toured their facility multiple times and they are completely aligned with our goals. We visited their facility in the Summer of 2014 in detailed tours and again in January 2015. We will be in constant communication throughout the entire process.\nWith multiple stages in the manufacture and quality check process, we are confident in their ability to deliver a quality product. We were impressed with their sophisticated manufacture process including different rooms for assembly, air pressure checkpoints, water pressure stations, 48-hour time-keeping accuracy test, and (of course) a drop test. Their facilities meet all necessary regulation and code for operation.\nThough they host the manufacturing of many large retail brands, the general managers made sure all of our requirements were met and accommodated. Their experienced staff and attention to detail was what made our decision to choose them so easy. We, at Elliot Havok, are extremely confident they will meet our needs.\nMOVEMENT\nWe wanted to use some of the best input materials on the market for this watch. Inside of the Havok watches are Miyota JS-15 Movements. Miyota has been building reputable, reliable movements for brands like Citizen for decades. Their movements are very accurate and built to last for many years.\nThe Miyota JS-15 fits our needs perfectly and ensured a quality timepiece. Furthermore, their movements are made with mercury-free batteries and in RoHS compliant facilities.\nA common misconception is that automatics are absolute superiors in timekeeping capability. A quartz will keep time just as well, if not better. Battery changing only takes about 5 minutes of your time every several years. But having to re-adjust your automatic watch almost every time you set it down can be tedious. Of course, it's just a matter of price and preference.\nSPECIFICATIONS: \nCase Diameter: 42 mm Case \nThickness: 11 mm \nFace Diameter: 37 mm \nBand Material: Genuine Italian Leather Band \nBand Max/Min Length: 21.5 cm/17 cm \nBand Width: 22 mm \nTotal Weight: 69.5 g \nCase Material: 316L \nSteel Back Plating: Stainless Steel \nClasp: Standard Buckle Clasp \nClasp Material: Stainless Steel \nDial Window Material: Sapphire Crystal Glass \nDisplay: Chronograph Analog \nMovement: Japanese Miyota (Citizen) JS-15 Quartz \nDate Function: Yes \nSeconds Function: Yes \nWater Resistant: 5 ATM / 50 Meters\nBattery: Sony SR621SW\nLast year, we launched the most backed watch on Kickstarter. We were only able to do so by offering the best product for the best price. Basically \u201cthe best bang for your buck\u201d. We will never overcharge and dump ridiculous retail markups onto our supporters. We adamantly dislike when high designer markups are just passed onto the consumer. \nJust because it was designed does not mean it deserves a premium or exorbitant price tag. We wanted to make a watch without having the audacity to charge $200-$300 for a quality watch. In reality, design is meant to be shared with all to benefit. Especially in this Kickstarter community where everyone contributes with ideas and feedback, aren't we all designers? In reality, you Kickstarters help create these products. \nFurthermore, we will offer the Havok watch at wholesale pricing with radical transparency, inspired by Everlane. Not only should the watch be priced so that nobody breaks their bank, but what goes into the watch should be disclosed.\nYou should know exactly what components are put in the watch and the costs of those components. \nHAVOK TIMEPIECES ARE BACKED WITH A WARRANTY \nWe believe in our watches. And you should too. If anything were to happen to your watch within the first 2 years, we hope that you will send it back to us for repair or replacement. We highly recommend you take the watch to a specialist when replacing parts as it requires special tooling. We will cover all internal parts should they ever fail you. \nAfter the Kickstarter campaign concludes, we will send out surveys gathering backer information to begin production. Meanwhile, we want to continue R&D for the watch. We will rigorously source, test, and research the materials and production of the watch. While the watches are being manufactured and packaged, we will be preparing for large scale shipment to our backers.\nThis is where Kickstarter comes in. We need your support to launch this line of watches. We are raising funding specifically for R&D, manufacturing, packaging, and logistics for the Havok Racer collection. Your support for the production of these affordable watches will also make them available to all in the future. And of course, you will be the first to own a Havok Racer Chrono. Thank you for taking the time to check out the project.\nABOUT US\nElliot Havok consists of a diverse team of creative product designers with cross-functional skills within the fields of design, development, and manufacturing. Our team encompasses over 20 years of combined experience in bringing innovative products to life. Steven will be spearheading the design and development of the Havok Racer collection, while Bryan and Joseph supervise logistics and backer relations. With the support of the rest of our experienced team including industrial and graphic designers, we are ready to build you a product that you can proudly support. \nHi-Res Gallery : Here \nFor further information, media, and a gallery, refer to: www.elliothavok.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf this project gets funded, we will have to make sure everything goes according to plan to meet the promised deadlines. Projects often have trouble when facing the production process and deadlines for shipment. The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product or packaging does not meet our requirements after production. We would have to have another production run if this is the case. However, we have extensive experience and close relations in manufacturing and production. We will be producing these high-cost watches in small batches to control quality. In addition, we will not be outsourcing the post-production work to another company. Our team is prepared to ensure that post-funding will run like clockwork when the time comes. (pun-intended) Although we do not see any direct risks and challenges, there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during the process of production.

We're proud to claim the title for World's Most Comfortable Tee:\nThey're built using our signature Modal fabric blend, a sustainable beech-wood derived rayon made of microfibers. It's twice as soft and breathable as cotton, making it the perfect fabric for body-hugging apparel.\nWhether for a night out, as an undershirt, working out or lounging, their versatility shines thanks to the blissful 92% Modal and 8% Elastane blend.\nWith a 190gsm fabric weight, they're light, robust, and higher quality than any other shirt in your closet or department store. They're also half of price!\nColors and Styles\nWe're introducing the Bliss Modal Shirts in Tee form in three colors: Monaco Blue, Jet Black, and Bright White in both Crew and V-Neck variations in sizes S, M, L, XL, & 2XL. Model wears Medium.\nNormal fit on the snug side. Choose between a soft snug fit under your regular size, or a looser fit with a larger size. Model wears Medium.\nHow do I get them?\nIt's easy. You have 2 options: \nOption 1 - Underwear + Tees: Add $20 to your underwear pledge for each shirt that you want (no extra shipping).\nOption 2 - Tees Only: Choose any of the new pledge level with tees.\nThese bad boys go from $34 to $60 at department stores, but you'll have the chance to get them for a special introductory price of $20 on Kickstarter. You can add as many as you want! There are no extra shipping charges involved when combined with your pledge for underwear. You can choose your color, size, and style when we send out your Backerkit order form. This will have your credit automatically reflected and you'll have the chance to pick your variations then. If your size doesn't fit as expected, we'll honor all size exchange requests, no questions asked, free of charge. We're already manufacturing them, which means they'll ship alongside your underwear in the same package this March.\nIntroducing the ultimate interpretation of the word comfort: the Bliss collection by The Comfortable Boxers Co.\nOur new collection improves upon our previous boxer briefs through tons of new features and under-the-hood improvements, including an even softer modal fabric, a tagless design, a modal covered waistband, and a brand new fly.\nThe best part? With the Bliss collection, you'll be looking your best.\nWe've combined the finest in business technology, design styles, textiles, and machinery to bring you the best underwear experience of your life.\nSince modal fabric adapts to your body type, there will never be any tightness or discomfort. Carefully designed with the masculine body in mind, our underwear are custom made just for you.\nWe've prepared two comfortable styles for our Bliss collection. Our boxer briefs run longer down the leg whereas the trunks run short. Choose your own underwear style or get some of each for the best of both worlds.\nWe also have brand new colors available for the Bliss collection! We've improved our standard Gray and Monaco Blue, and we've added Bright White, Malibu Blue, and Royal Purple options.\nAll colors are now unlocked! You'll have the chance to select your color after the campaign ends. You can also mix and match between boxer briefs, trunks, and all available colors!\n\"Underwear\" and \"innovation\" are two words rarely used in the same sentence, but we can honestly say that we're proud to be leaders of true underwear innovation. Here are a few of the improvements we've made to our underwear:\nWe've re-invented the pouch by removing the maze that is the vertical fly. Instead, we've turned it on its side. Two overlapping flaps that make it easy to use in any scenario.\nAt last, you can have both easy access and a sleek appearance.\nThe waistband features a silky-smooth modal fabric wrap, absolutely no tags, and no distracting design elements or branding.\nWaistband elasticity is precisely fabricated and measured for a soft feel and snugness to keep your boxers in place. We then wrap the waistband in modal fabric for the ultimate underwear experience.\nThis contemporary look not only pleases the eye, but also drastically improves comfort by covering the waistband in the same amazing modal fabric that covers the entire underwear.\nAnd since the waistband is tagless, you won't suffer from that itch that accompanies the ill-placed tag on the back of the waistband. Instead, we've printed the information on the rear inner side of the underwear.\nOur underwear is made with 92% modal fabric, an eco-friendly microfiber that enfolds the body in a light embrace. Modal is smooth, soft, and breathable, and its luscious texture feels similar to silk. It\u2019s cool to the touch, super absorbent, and resistant to shrinkage and fading. In short, it\u2019s the perfect microfiber fabric for body-hugging underwear.\nWe wanted to create the softest pair of underwear in existence. When it comes to underwear, we know that softness is the most important factor, and we\u2019ve found modal to be the softest fabric available. The more modal fabric that\u2019s present, the softer the underwear. So we've improved the fabric by adding 20% more modal than our previous ridiculously comfortable underwear, making softness the key characteristic.\nMeasurements show that modal is twice as soft as cotton. It's also 50% more water absorbent, doesn't shrink, and doesn't fade.\nThe softness of modal was measured according to the Kawabata Evaluation Systems for Fabrics in Japan.\nWe blend 92% modal with 8% elastane for a snug fit that you\u2019ll love. These underwear are designed to contour to your body without any pressure points. They provide both a lush feel and a perfect fit, making them the most comfortable pair of underwear ever.\nThis unique blend gives our underwear amazing contour properties that allows it to mold seamlessly to your body type. Unlike other underwear, our boxer briefs adapt to your physique for maximum comfort.\nQuality underwear requires quality engineering, so we partnered with the finest craftsmen and fabric engineering experts with years of experience refining high-grade materials.\nWe've paid particularly close attention to the stitching and fabric durability. We've also implemented a new, more robust stitching method that maintains softness. And our new, more durable fabric allows for greater longevity.\nWe worked closely with the manufacturing facility every step of the way to carry out our vision and transform it into a reality.\nWhen we claim the world's most comfortable underwear title, we better pay close attention to every detail. Stitching is an aspect often overlooked by underwear makers. The underlying problem with traditional stitching is that it falls apart. The logical solution to this is to make a more robust knit. However, this requires more surface area with the use of a wider stitching pattern and stiffer threads. Today's premium underwear companies stop right there. This brings about a new problem: the itch. We weren't satisfied with this, so we worked through multiple prototypes until we reached the level of comfort you'd expect from us. After careful testing, we implemented an idea borrowed from techniques used in premium winter clothing that use 'fluffy' thread instead of traditional hard thread, woven to minimize space between each strand. This is the result:\nNot only is the difference visible, but the feeling is completely new and isn't seen in undergarments. It's a complex method that requires careful crafting, and you'll have the chance to feel this with our new Bliss Collection.\nIn our search for great underwear, we found two categories: Cheaply priced and cheaply made, or premium quality with premium pricing. We didn't like either, so created a third category: quality underwear at an affordable price.\nTo do so, we cut out all the middlemen and storefronts, excess spending that companies typically suffer from. We go straight to the source and obtain the world\u2019s finest fabrics. We partner with the same suppliers and factories used by big-name underwear companies. Then we turn around and sell them directly to you at far less than the retail price.\nWe also cut down on excessive marketing and celebrity endorsements. The result: We\u2019re able to offer our underwear to you at less than 50% the price of competing luxury brands!\nKickstarter has provided us with a wonderful platform to connect with backers like yourself. Since we\u2019re manufacturing the product and delivering it directly to you, we can cut out all excess costs and give you the best product and price possible.\nModal\u2019s botanic origin in beechwood trees makes it particularly eco-friendly and sustainable. We only work with ethically responsible suppliers who meet our extensive requirements. Throughout the process, we minimize waste and recover all chemicals used.\nThis exceptionally ecological fiber is produced using new symbiotic production technology. Using this method, the pulp (raw material) is produced at the same site as the modal fiber itself. This minimizes the energy and resources used during the production process.\nWhether you\u2019re out for a run or a game of basketball, our boxer briefs move with you. They absorb water and fit snugly to ensure you\u2019re comfortable even in the roughest conditions.\nThey also pack light and provide constant comfort for long flights, hikes, and any outdoor activity you can think of. Since our boxer briefs leave no mark on your legs while you wear pants, they\u2019re ideal for wearing to work as well, which means 9 to 5 just got a lot better! You can also take relaxation to the next level by lounging around the house in our silky smooth underwear for a vacation in your living room.\nEvery fabric we source undergoes rigorous testing by SGS lab testing for fabric weight, color fastness, and shrinkage to ensure quality and durability. Our latest production runs resulted in excellent results.\nEveryone has a variety of options to choose from. We're basing our rewards levels on the amount of underwear you'd like to stock up on. This pricing is one-time only but extends to backers on a permanent basis. The more you pledge, the better the deal! However, by pledging now you'll have first dibs on the first manufacturing run. \nSelect your pledge level to the right by picking the amount of underwear you'd like to stock up on. After that, select your country and enter the information required by Kickstarter. We'll update you during the campaign with new products and colors as well as information on how to add the items to your pledge.\nAfter the campaign is funded, we'll immediately send over an order form where you'll have the chance to pick your style, color, and size in any combination you want. You'll have over 50 options to choose from! You'll also input your preliminary shipping information so we can coordinate our fulfillment center distribution. We'll then build the underwear and update you on the progress! When they're ready, we'll give you a chance to update your shipping information once again and ship out your underwear.\nOur boxer briefs are designed to fit closely but not tightly. If you are between sizes, the larger size will fit better if you prefer a normal fit. If you prefer a tighter fit or have skinnier legs, choose a size lower. To measure, run a tape measure around your waist. Place one finger between your waist and the tape measure for a comfortable fit. You can also use the first number on your jean size as reference. Use this sizing chart as reference:\nYou'll be able to pick your size, color, and style after the campaign ends.\nWe promise you'll love them. If your underwear doesn\u2019t fit you the way we\u2019ve described, or if it develops any defects, we\u2019ll exchange them for another size of your choice - on us. Return shipping for exchanges is covered in the U.S. International shipments will carry special considerations depending on each situation. Defective items do not require return shipping. Whichever the case, we'll take care of you!\nWASHING INSTRUCTIONS: Natural fibers like modal are known for their ultra soft textures, but washing on too harsh a cycle can cause lint pills to develop long term. If you're worried about long term longevity, separate lights from darks, and wash separately. You can machine wash in warm water, preferably on the delicates cycle, and don\u2019t use bleach or fabric softener (they can't get any softer, believe us). Tumble dry on the lowest heat setting and remove as soon as they\u2019re dry. During our lab tests with SGS, an independent testing service, we got virtually no shrinkage in their most rigorous hot washing test. However, we don't recommend this long-term.\nFor this second Kickstarter, we've taken more time developing the second collection and are now focusing on quality control and consistency throughout the manufacturing run. This will take some time as our Shanghai quality control office implements the new inspection methods. What you'll get is an amazing and consistently durable product.\nSHIPPING: When it comes to shipping your orders, we're changing things up a bit. All international shipments will be fast and trackable.\nNEW SHANGHAI OFFICE: Our new quality control office in Shanghai takes care of supervising every manufacturing batch, discarding any possible defective items. \nNEW PLATFORM: Your contribution will also fund the maintenance of our revamped e-commerce platform, which will go live at ComfortableBoxers.com when the campaign is funded. The completely automated order and fulfillment process will help maintain excellent pricing after the campaign with quick and speedy delivery. Any orders from our backers after our stock comes in will ship the same-day!\nSUPPORT & HELP: if you have any questions, concerns, ideas, or just want to say hi, don't hesitate to reach out to us at hello@comfortableboxers.com or head over to comfortableboxers.com and chat with us. Whichever way you choose, we answer very quickly!\nHELP US SPREAD THE WORD: You can share the campaign directly via the SHARE THIS PROJECT button below the video. \nFOLLOW US: Don't forget to follow us on Instagram, Twitter, like us on Facebook, and read our Blog.\nPRESS-KIT: Head over to our Press-Kit for images and information to use for press.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo! We shipped over 10,000 items to 2,500 backers in 2 days. We then shipped another 5,000 through our e-commerce platform. We have shipping, handling, exchanges, and returns handled beautifully. Our specialized fulfillment center in New Jersey is fully operational and makes sure everything runs smoothly. We've discarded shipping providers that proved to be too slow and upgraded our shipments to a fully trackable service. \n\nWe've lived through many full production runs of high-quality garments and worked with all of our vendors previously. We know the pitfalls, and we know the snags to watch out for. But most importantly, we know more about how to control for quality. High-volume production could pose any number of challenges, but we've partnered with a professionally established manufacturing facility and expanded our quality control through our new Shanghai office. Our staff takes care of supervising every manufacturing batch, discarding any possible defective items.We're putting in more hours dedicated to supervising manufacturing!\n\nWe've gone through numerous textile and product prototypes that have gone through extensive testing, including wash and color fastness, fabric weight testing, comfort trials with objective lab measurements, and in-depth lab testing by SGS. We partnered with the right people, completed all sampling, and sourced the best fabrics, so we're confident to ship underwear that will exceed all your expectations. We believe in transparency and blazing fast communication, so our backers will be the first to know about any unplanned hurdles or delays, although, at this point in the project, they are highly unlikely.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Hey backers, T-shirts are back and better than ever!", "update_content": "Thank you for joining us in bringing sustainably built luxury apparel to the world!

Airport line-ups, lost luggage, baggage fees are things we all look to avoid.  Most of the standard trolley carry-ons are not small enough to bypass the bag check, forcing many to wait in lines and forfeit their bags over to the mercy of Airlines.  The trolley carry-ons that are small enough to bypass bag check force us to fold our clothes into tiny compact squares leaving expensive business suits, shirts, and dresses ridden with wrinkles.  \nThe Design Solution\nA carry-on that takes on the look of a classic weekender bag, but fully unzips into a full-on garment bag that allows you to hang your clothes and keep them wrinkle free.  Fill the middle with shoes, tablet, toiletries etc., zip up and go.\nWhen zipped up, the curved shaped of the carry-on ensures there are never hard creases in clothing. \nSpecifically measured to meet the carry-on measurement requirements of ALL airlines and comfortably fit under your airline chair for when the overhead storage becomes too full.\n Choose from 2 colors to suit your style:\nAmber Brown with Antique Brass Hardware; or\nOnyx Black with Chrome Hardware\n Great for a couple day business trip or a week long vacation down south\nPLAY\n\nMade using a water-resistant leatherette and stitched together with top quality craftsmanship, this carry-on will hold strong and protect your clothes through all your world travels.\nWe combine together style and utility for the ultimate carry-on bag.

The watches or \u201cchapters\u201d in this collection will not only tell time, but also signify a very important part of American history.\nEach chapter will help us write a new story for American Watchmakers told through a collection of timepieces that represent its history. By backing this campaign and the chapters thereafter you\u2019ll help us bring the craftsmanship and culture of watchmaking back to the States where it belongs. Every story must come to an end and ours will do so with a watch that is fully designed, produced and assembled here in the States.\nTo best tell a story you need to start at the beginning. Meet the \u201cNative Watch\u201d - the inaugural timepiece in the Americana Project. Created to illustrate the colorful and culturally rich Native American people, the watch was inspired by the scenery of our beautiful desert and tribal art of all kinds.\nThe carefully constructed face of the Native Watch was crafted using thinly sliced pieces of the natural gems of the Southwest. The last year was spent working with different natural stones that best represented the culture to give the watch a truly unique look. The case diameter measures at 43mm and the strap width measures at 22mm.\nTo really take care of our backers, we designed a \"Part II\" in the collection to give off a more classic and timeless feel. We stayed true to the beautiful deserts of the Southwest and went for a more vintage mindset when creating the color pallette. By backing at $295 or above you will get both watches in our first chapter and the interchangeable American leather strap.\nThis is the first step in our master plan of bringing watchmaking back the States. Reaching this goal will allow us to start gathering the plans needed to open a \u201cclean-room\u201d workshop for commercial watch assembly and testing that would employ up to 10 people. At this funding amount we\u2019d be able to train the new employees on all the tools needed for assembly and testing as well as the art of assembly. We would also be able to purchase the necessary equipment to test the watches including water resistance, to open and close case backs and a watch shock tester (to test durability). This facility would give the more than 70 US watch companies a well priced domestic option for assembling and testing their watches. \nOnce we have an assembly facility we would be able to implement the making of the case and other smaller components such as hands, markers, buckles, etc. at $225,000 in funding. The money would go towards purchasing milling machinery for true customization, metal plates for the backing of dials and more. At this level we\u2019d only be able to purchase the machine and would need to earn more to actually staff it. Our other option would be partnering with a CNC router company in the States to keep costs low and production more efficient.\nNow that we\u2019d have a team and all the necessary equipment to create the foundation of the watches, we would then look at making sure all straps used are American. Regardless of materials, we want to partner with artisan shops around the country to find the best American leather, and other straps made in America. We want to keep things sustainable as well as humane so that any watches produced are truly unique and of the highest quality, reaching and even exceeding the quality of the Swiss companies.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\n1. Competition from low wage / low price countries.\n\n2. The lack of machinery and tools for watch making, assembling, and testing in the United States. Most of these machines are only available in Switzerland and / or other parts of the world.\n\n3. The lack of already skilled workers in this industry. There are several good US based designers and some good fabricators, but not really in the world of watches.\n\nRewards:\n1. The most important and significant reward of such a grand endeavor would be to bring the lost art of Watchmaking back to the United States where it belongs. This first chapter is only the beginning of this ambitious journey and by the end of it we hope to not only provide jobs for skilled American workers, but to also build a sustainable industry for future generations.\n\n2. Providing a cost effective alternative to other watch companies and brands to provide assembly, testing, and even watch designs and components for their models.\n\n3.

We've made the perfect climbing brush that respects climbers with its thoughtful design, ease of use, and durability.\nUnique neck design is tougher than your latest project and won't bend or snap.\nWith over 14,000 bristles in our Premium Boar's Hair brush and over 6,500 in our Classic Nylon version, our brush works better and lasts longer. One Year Guaranteed!\nErgonomic handle that fits perfectly in a climber's hands.\nSecret Compartment in the handle designed to hold our custom climbOn Bar and also connects to future accessories like our fully articulating stick-brush adapter.\n100% Recyclable brush and packaging, because you care about the environment and so do we.\nThe Sublime Climbing Brush allows you to effortlessly clean holds on your climbing routes or boulder problems, removing friction-killers like dirt and excess chalk, and increasing your ability to hold on. This is even more important for newer climbers whose hands aren't that strong yet and rely more on a hold's natural friction. Quickly cleaning your holds with The Sublime Climbing Brush increases the surface's coefficient of friction, and your ability to hang on and climb the route.\nBrushing is a breeze. Each use is quick and light - no more having to use a tiny brush on a giant sloper or push down violently for brushing power. This is achieved by our special ridge reinforced neck design, the unique shape of the brush head, and over 14,000 bristles.\nDesigned for Climbing. The Sublime Climbing Brush was designed from the ground-up for climbing. Our clever brush-head design allows you to quickly clean the biggest slopers while still being able to clean small features like mono-pockets. Its unique handle fits your hand perfectly so you can clean any hold easily at any angle whether you're on a rope or working boulder problems.\nObsessive attention to quality and durability. We believe in making quality products, and Sublime Climbing Brushes are built to last. We've gone through nine prototypes with feedback from hundreds of fellow climbers to make our brush the best. They feel lightweight, strong, durable, and look gorgeous. We could have easily made them cheaper with a repurposed handle made from bargain materials and fewer bristles, so people would need to replace them more often. This is known in the manufacturing industry as 'planned obsolescence' and is unfortunately pretty standard. But this is something we made for ourselves, as well as our friends in the climbing community and we appreciate quality craftsmanship. Our obsession with making the best and longest lasting brush is probably why it took us about a year and why our bristles are guaranteed to last at least one year.\nLooks Gorgeous. The Sublime Climbing brush has a beautiful minimal designed that's a perfect blend of form with function. Our brush's sleek organic lines are complimented with a gorgeous matte finish available in blue, violet, orange, and light grey colors.\nMore than just a brush. The Sublime Climbing Brush is designed to improve your climbing experience by conveniently carrying your 'need to have' skin-care products, like our custom made climbOn Bar. Our brush's handle can also be adapted to upcoming products like our fully articulating stick brush adapter for your highball boulder problems- no more stick and duct tape!\n100% Recyclable. When, or if, you manage to go through your Sublime Climbing Brush, rest assured that it will be recycled and reincarnated into an amazing new product. You care about the environment, and so do we, that's why we made our brushes and packaging to be 100% recyclable.\n                        The Sublime Climbing Brush in Classic Nylon\nWhen you need a brush that will work, all the time. Our Classic Nylon brush is designed to last for years. With over 6,500 bristles that last 4 x longer than Boar's Hair, you can rely on this brush to effectively clean your routes and boulder problems for years to come.  \nThe Sublime Climbing Brush in Premium Boar's Hair\nOur Premium Boar's Hair Brush is as good as it gets. This brush will clean every climbing hold amazingly. With over 14,000 individual bristles, its built for high performance and removing anything that could detract from your ability to climb your route, allowing you to climb your absolute best.  \nThe Climb Harder E-Book\nImagine talking with Tom as well as other top climbers and coaches and asking them for their best tips on how to climb harder and address problems like 'climber's elbow'.

Please note that you may be responsible for local duties, fees and taxes.\nOur Story\nThe history of climbing has lots of climbers who have enjoyed pushing themselves on the rock, but maybe not so many who have enjoyed trying to run a business as well. I suppose it\u2019s the hugely time consuming nature of climbing that ends up being a limiting factor and also that many people did not start climbing as a way of making money. I think the cool thing in our industry is that most of the companies are still run (and often owned) by real climbers - the people that truly understand why someone wants to hand over their hard earned cash for a sport which we can mostly practice for free.\nBy a chance encounter I met a very psyched American climber in 2014. His name was Ransom Allison and he was so incredibly motivated to try and develop some climbing product ideas that I was immediately hooked. I knew from my background in coaching that if someone has that much enthusiasm, they\u2019re going to go a long way! Ransom actually left a lucrative career-path in aviation technology to pursue his dreams in climbing. With the combination of Ransom\u2019s design and technology experience and my long term industry involvement we formed a small start up project called Sublime Climbing. We started Sublime Climbing to develop great climbing products; products we all want and need, but no one makes. Over the last year, we\u2019ve sat down, skyped, talked, emailed and bashed around various ideas. Whilst we have around eight or nine different products that we are continuing to develop, we honed in on the simple idea of a \u201cbrush that doesn't break or wear down, and works perfectly\u201d as our initial project we wanted to create.\nI must admit, the first few prototypes were far from perfect. Oh my, they broke, or the bristles were too long, or the wrong material, the finishes were awful, and the necks snapped like most brushes out there now. But they got better, much better. After sending many designs across the Atlantic and testing in the hands of hundreds of our climbing friends and by super-star climbers around the world, they became great. It took nine prototypes and about a year of design work.\nTHANK YOU! Seriously, Thank you.\nOur brush is something that everyone out there can see as a reflection of our passion to do things incredibly well and in line with the morals of the climbing community. Together with the climbing community, we've finally made the Sublime Climbing Brush the best brush out there.\nSo far we have self funded the design, development and sampling for The Sublime Climbing Brush. Our final prototype has been well tested (a lot!) and our manufacturers are ready to go. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, packaging and shipping. \nRansom and I really appreciate all the feedback and encouragement so far and are looking forward to you joining us with support to make our project happen.

Don't worry, Sole-Socks are still available on our website. Click the button below to see our entire offering.\n     Sole- socks is a simple solution to a common annoyance / problem. In today's ever evolving fashion and style trends, more and more people are going sockless. It's become a very popular look  for both men and woman. In addition, there are others who just don't like socks, whether it be for convenient or laziness, they don't want to wear socks. There are a couple big problems that everyone who is trying to pull off the sockless look has to deal with. The first is, if you choose to wear socks, you have to find super small thin socks that don't go above the shoe line. These socks are typically tight, uncomfortable and slip off the heel throughout the day. The other option is to fold down larger socks and deal with bunching and unevenness on your foot. The last option is just to choose not to wear socks. This seems like the most logical right? But then you run into the issue of having sweaty, smelly feet  trapped in your shoes and no matter how many times you try to air them out, or even wash them, the smell won't go away. I can't tell you how many pairs of shoes I have had to throw away from rancid, funky smells from not wearing socks.  \n Sole- Sock are specifically designed with those problems in mind. We started with a plush terry cloth top, which absorbs the moisture, odor, and all the other funky things that come from your feet throughout the day. This 100% cotton Terry cloth has been specially designed to be thick with long loops in order to be breatheable enough to let air through to the foot while the fibers are designed in a way to absorb and wick away moisture in your shoe. The terry cloth is attached with a durable cotton outer layer of fabric and attached with a Bosnian embroidered stitch around the entire outer edge of the sole. The zig zag looking stitch insures durability and quality during the length of the product's life. Sole-Socks were designed to take the wear and tear that occurs each day on your feet. The final component of the design is the base, this is designed in such a way to allow the sole to grip the inside of your shoe and prevent slipping. These same fiber that grip and stabilize the Sole-Sock, are designed in such a way to allow air to flow from underneath your foot. This allows your foot to breathe, cools it down and reduces sweat and odor. Additionally, the base layer is perforated to allow the foot to breathe from the bottom. This bottom layer also acts as a padding and support. Sole-Socks are designed in a way to offer a little more cushion and comfort on the bottom of your foot. At the same time we designed it in a way to make sure it wasn't too bulky to cause the shoe too become tight and uncomfortable. These were designed to be treated like a pair of socks. The newest addition to the sole sock original is the Polyester toe cap. Its design with a very minimal seem to insure comfort and not cause an annoying irritation across the top of your foot. We use a durable polyester toe cap to help offer protection and comfort while allowing airflow and maximum breath-ability.  \nBoth styles of Sole Socks work for many different shoes depending on what you prefer and what your needs are. Depending on the type of shoe and your preference both sole-sock original and sole-sock 2.0 has you covered.\nInfo\n Step One: Find out what shoe size you wear. The easiest way to do this would be going to your closet and looking at your shoes. Once you know this, order that size of Sole-sock or sole-sock 2.0.  Step Two: Once you receive your sole-sock in the mail simply place the left and right foot beds into your chosen pair of shoes. (Should I remove the existing sole? it all depends on your preference. Most people lay the Sole-sock on top of the existing sole due to the fact these are designed as sock and not sole replacements.) Step Three: Put on your shoes and go about your day. Step Four: At the end of the day simply remove your custom pair of Sole-Socks and throw them in the washing machine if need or use them again the next day.  It's as simple as these 4 steps, treat them like you would a normal pair of socks. \nAs you know going sockless is not as easy as it should be. Having to deal with super small baby socks, socks with holes, rolling down socks to get the look but dealing with bunching. You could always go no socks at all but the aftermath is unbearable.  \nFACTS:\n- The average person owns 22 pairs of socks\n- There are 250,000 sweat glands on your feet\n- The most sweat glands on the human body are found on the bottom of your foot.\n-80% of the sweat on your feet come from the bottom\n- 1 cup of sweat is produced from your feet each day.\n- Socks don't show anymore   \n- Extra padding for soles of your shoes\n- Blocks odor - Breathable - Absorbs moisture\n- Prevents athletes feet symptoms\n- Comfortable\n- Very convenient\n- Machine washable\n- Customization to your size and fit  \n- Able to use in almost any type shoe\n- Take up less space in suitcases / dresser drawer space\n- No more socks with holes\nTo make this as successful as possible in both feedback and sales, we need your help.

It's been an amazing 45 days and we're looking forward to getting production started.\nTo order some SilverAir Socks & Shirts, head on over to yathletics.com\nWhy you'll love the SilverAir Sock:\nOur Story\nY Athletics was born on Kickstarter with the help and support of thousands of backers from over 70 countries. Our mission is to design and manufacture the highest quality products in each activewear category, using the best materials and technologies on the market. Simply put, we create products that are engineered for performance and insanely comfortable\u2014you\u2019ll never want to take them off.\nWe leverage cutting edge technologies like seamless knitting, which eliminates the need for stitches and ensures minimal irritation. Our fabrics are sourced from unique locations around the world, wherever innovation is occurring most rapidly. This includes yarns knitted with pure silver, which prevents odor from accumulating on your gear.\nA year ago, we launched our first product - the SilverAir Shirt - and our fans helped us raise more than $250,000 to kickstart our dream. We\u2019re frequently asked what\u2019s next and now have an answer: \nAfter many months and hundreds of hours in development, we got the formula right and our next product is ready. We are proud to introduce the SilverAir Sock - It's beautiful. It's comfortable. It's odorless. It just works.\n\nDevelopment\nThis is a brand new fabric. We sourced the finest merino wool from Australia, known for its natural performance and odor-resistant qualities. But wool by itself is not soft enough, so we added acrylic for superior comfort, nylon for durability, and spandex for stretch recoverability. Finally, we blended pure silver on the areas that accumulate the most sweat, which takes the odor-fighting capability of this sock to a whole new level, unlike anything you\u2019ve experienced.\nAfter fabrication comes construction and we iterated until it was just right. We used seamless knitting to create a sock without any stitches and added vent panels that allow airflow to keep your feet cool and comfortable. The sock is beautiful inside and out. After you've worn it a few times, you won\u2019t be able to go back to anything else.\nTesting\nWe've been testing our socks rigorously over the last 9 months. A backer from our first campaign cycled 800 miles for two weeks wearing the same pair of SilverAir socks. A decathlon athlete wore them through his entire race and the socks stayed fresh. And, of course, we wear them every day ourselves. Every test led to improvement until we got them just right. \nProduction\nThis is where you come in. We're still a young brand that's self-funded, and to bring these socks to market, we need to manufacture them at a moderate scale. Help us fund our first production batch of the SilverAir Sock and be the first to receive a pair... your support would mean the world to us.\n\nHow It Works\nWhere It's Made\nWe're proud to work with the best manufacturers in the industry. Here's where our socks and our shirts are made:\n\nSOCKS:\nSHIRTS:\nColors & Styles\nSOCKS:\nThanks to you, we will now be offering our socks in six colors. Check them out: \nThe Jet Black and Electric Blue are exact colors. The other 4 colors were unlocked as stretch goals and the colors shown are mock-ups. We'll show the actual socks in a future update.\n\nSHIRTS:\nFor this campaign, our shirts will be available in the short sleeve crew and V neck styles in six colors - Carbon Black, Jet Grey, Surf Blue, Alpine White, Alloro Green and Marino Blue.\nMeasurement Guide\nSOCKS: Our socks are unisex and will come in two sizes*:\n*Due to a small number of our backers having a shoe size of 14 and above, we are going to be producing an XL size for shoe sizes 14-16. This size will only be available in our most popular color - Jet Black.\n\nSHIRTS: Our shirt sizes are men-only for the time being. The shirts are fitted. We recommend sizing up if you prefer a loose fit.\n*Carbon Black color may not available in the XXL size\n**Please check our web-store for the latest measurements\nShipping / Delivery Schedule\nKickstarter backers will be receiving their shirts and their socks together. We estimate the following timeline:\nMAY 2015 - Campaign closes. Backers' selections finalized.\nJUNE 2015 - Raw materials are sourced and shipped to our factory.\nJULY 2015 - Production period.\nAUGUST 2015 - Finished products are shipped to our distribution center and on to your doorstep.\nWhere We Are\nSOCKS - We've been working with our sock manufacturer for almost a year now. We've made and tested dozens of prototypes and feel confident in bringing them to you. The socks you see in pictures are production-ready and we'll start manufacturing them as soon as we are able to raise the funds for production.\n\nSHIRTS - We have delivered thousands of shirts to the backers from our first Kickstarter campaign and continue to deliver shirts to customers every day. The production of our next batch of shirts will start soon and we want you to be the first to get your hands on them, at a deal exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nHelp Us Spread The Word\nWe need your help to get the word out, so please help us by telling your friends and family about us. We also give away prototypes to our fans on facebook and twitter from time to time so keep an eye out...\nInternational Backers\nCarrier - We ship to most international countries via FedEx, to ensure the package is delivered to you safely in the shortest amount of time. If you would like to opt-in for another shipping method, please email us at hello@yathletics.com\nDuties & Taxes - Please be aware that all international shipments are subject to duties and taxes by your government and you are responsible for paying that. All Kickstarter rewards will be declared 'gift', however, most countries will still assess a value and in certain cases FedEx will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter project and we have done our best to make realistic projections of the amount of raw materials we need, the time we need to receive them, and the time we need to manufacture the socks. However, manufacturing at the standards of Y Athletics has its own complications. Every single detail is scrutinized and we don't settle for anything less than perfection. The risk with that is that it if unavoidable production issues come up, the delivery of your rewards will be delayed.\n\nWith that said, we will make two promises:\n\n1. We will deliver the highest quality product to each and every single backer. We take extreme pride in making some of the best products in the world and will never compromise on quality.\n\n2. We will keep the lines of communication open at all times. If we have hurdles, you'll be the first to know about them.

Please read the update here for more details. Check out the info graphic below for the updated rewards!\nCoup: Mobile Edition is coming to Physical form!\nPhysical deluxe edition (Coup + Coup: Reformation) will be available as an add-on item! Please read the details here!\nBox art not final.\nHelp bring the hit game Coup to iPhone and iPads everywhere!\nThanks for checking out our Kickstarter! \nWe are Banana & Co, a super small games development studio based in San Francisco, CA made up of three mobile game veterans who recently decided to quit our day jobs and make games that we love playing.\nWe're really excited to be working with Rikki Tahta and La Mame games to develop a mobile version of the hit card game Coup.\nCoup (and its expansion Coup Reformation) by Rikki Tahta was a successfully funded Kickstarter project published by Indie Board & Cards.  \nYou can check the previous Kickstarters out here and here. \nFor those new to Coup, below is a video overview from Tom Vasel:\nThere are also plenty of written reviews out there.  Here are some of our favorites.\nThe Mobile Edition\nThe idea behind the game is to take Coup but be able to play it anywhere, anytime, with anyone.  We've focused on making the game feel like you're playing live (trash talking, reading your opponents, bluffing), but also that you're playing with a much wider network of players. Similar to games like Words With Friends, you don't need to be in the app to play a game - you can take your turns at your convenience.\nAs huge fans of Coup, we want to deliver a mobile experience that is intuitive, smooth, and (most importantly) fun!\nFEATURES:\nBluff, steal, and manipulate your opponents on the go.\nAll new art and 5 gorgeous new cards.\nPlay up to 4 player games, worldwide.\nInvite your friends or play ranked matches with random opponents.\nIncrease your rank by earning achievements and badges...and winning.\nAll new art and cards\nIn setting out to create a new card deck, we wanted to deliver a unique set of characters. We decided to contact some of our artist friends who we knew could nail the style we were going for. We love what they came up with, and we hope you do too. \nNew art!\nHere's a look at how some of the characters were developed, from sketches to paint.\nThe Duke, for once not taking tax.\nThe Ambassador, from pencil to celebrity, to global diplomat.\nWe know many folks would prefer the cards from the tabletop version of Coup, so we've got you covered there too.  We're working with Indie Board and Games to include the their cards as well.  You can choose which deck to play with at any time.\nOriginal Coup card art included\nIn addition, Duke Tier backers will also receive the alternative card set from Indie Board & Cards as well as free alternate decks we release in the future.\nAlternate IB&C set free for Duke Tier\nPlay multiplayer games worldwide\nThe mobile version of Coup can be played with your friends and players anywhere in the world. \nPlay with your friends\nYou can create private games with your friends anytime, each match supports up to 4 players.  You can add friends to your friend list by inviting them directly, importing from your contacts, using Facebook, Game Center, or by adding favorite players you've met in any of the ranked matches.\nRanked Matches\nThink you've got what it takes to take on the best Coup players?  We've created multiple ranked rooms to match you with opponents all over the world.  Wager a small amount of your reputation in rooms with newbies, or risk more and play against the best.\nReputation\nAs you win ranked matches you earn Reputation.  Higher ranked rooms, where presumably you will face better opponents, will require a higher wager of Reputation to enter.  Of course the upside of this is that you can win much more Reputation as well. \nFriendly matches with your friend list do not require any Reputation to participate in.\nChoose carefullly...\nSPIES expansion\nThis SPIES expansion is a one time purchase to unlock for the general public, but is included for all KS backers (Ambassador Tier and above).\nSPIES won't reveal confidential information within a game - that would be unfair. It will show you historical stats (most claimed card, bluff %, favorite ways to kill) that gives you a \"read\" into your opponents play style, similar to as if they were part of your live play group.\nWith the SPIES expansion, players will get 1 Spy to use per match. It\u2019s up to you to decide how and when to use this limited resource. Do you want to use it to hide your stats right away (and consequently be unable to see anyone else\u2019s), or save it for later in the game?\nWe\u2019ve been playing around with this for a bit and it adds a nice layer of strategy to the game that we think is really fun.\nAchievements and Badges\nComplete over 50 achievements to increase your rank and unlock new badges to display on your player profile.  Kickstarter backers can receive a one of a kind badge to use as part of a reward.  More achievements and badges will be added for future updates.\nRanks/Achievements and revealing opponents stats.\nStretch Rewards\n7K - Coup: City State Cards - UNLOCKED! Unlocks the original Coup: City State cards from La Mame Games added as an optional card deck for all KS backers.  You will be able to switch decks anytime.\nThe OG Coup cards\n35k Animated Cards - UNLOCKED (see update here):\nGorgeous fully animated versions of all of our new cards.  Take a look at a sample we made below: \nOk maybe we overdid it with the lightning a bit..\n100k - Android - We will hire a team to help port this game to Android devices.  If we hit this stretch reward, the Android version would come out after the iOS launch. Note that even if we don't hit this stretch reward, Android is still something we want to do.  Check out the comments section for more details.\nOur Story\nThis all started when 2 (out of the 3 people that make up Banana & Co.) started playing Coup... a lot.  In the corner of bars and sometimes on the ground.  \nOur office in SF, come by and say hi.\nAfter some discussion about how the game could be made into a mobile multiplayer experience, we contacted Rikki Tahta, the designer of Coup.  We've been collaborating with him ever since on designing and developing the game so it works great on the go.\nThere were of course tons of design and technical issues to solve.  These include how the turns would work, how challenges would work, and in general making sure the flow of the game feels good when your not sitting across from your opponents.\nSince we got our prototype up and running some of us have retired our paper copies and have been playing exclusively on our phones.\nWhat will we use the funds for?\nWe will primarily use the funds for two things.  \nOne, to set up the backend infrastructure we need to handle tons of people playing multiplayer games.  We have proof of concept and prototypes working, but we need the funds to deploy this on a large scale.  Also as part of the backend system, we want to create a robust system for player stat tracking.  This will be used in conjunction with SPIES to gain insight into players play style.\nTwo, to pay for the art we need to finish the game and make sure everything is nice and polished for the release.  We really want to animate these cards too, we think that that subtle movement of the card animations will bring the game to life.\nWe have the technical ability and experience to do most of the work ourselves to create the game. The above two items, however, are external costs that we need help with.\nAbout Banana & Co.\n  We are a super small games development studio based in San Francisco, CA made up of three mobile game veterans.  We've all been making mobile games since 2003 at companies like Glu Mobile and Booyah!.  \nTogether, we've shipped over 50 mobile games.  In early 2013, we decided to quit our day jobs and start Banana & Co. \nVideo games have been a huge part of our lives, and we truly love making games. Over the past few years we\u2019ve been getting more and more interested in board and card games, so bringing Coup to mobile is an exciting new venture for us. \nWe hope the success of Coup Mobile will lead to more awesome opportunities in the future!\nBanana & Co. circa mid 80's", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest risk is delivering the game on time for you by May 2015. \n\nThis means a lot of QA/Beta testing, multiplayer online stability and reliability.\n\nTo mitigate this, our team has already completed the design and a large chunk of the development for the game. We need your help to push this game past the finish line with the level of quality that it deserves.\n\nOur team has shipped dozens of mobile products in the past on incredibly tight deadlines and budgets, both original titles and big licensed products.\n\nWe're 100% committed to shipping and delivering our game to you no matter what.

Select a reward from the column to the right or click one of the rewards on the image above.\n  Handground is the result of thousands of coffee enthusiasts around the world contributing their time and ideas. From home brewers to national barista champions, people from all corners of the world have leant lifetimes of experience with coffee. \nThe power of this experience shines through in the design of the Handground coffee grinder. It took hundreds of iterations and incremental improvements to get to the final design and there is no other way it could have been done without the help of these people. Here are just a few pictures of the people behind Team Handground.\nBy backing this project you will join Team Handground and have the opportunity to participate in decisions going forward as we move into production. \nThe idea to make a better coffee grinder started from something we called the \"Crowdsourced Coffee Experiment\". We were attempting to apply a Japanese principle called Kaizen to our coffee routine. It wasn\u2019t long before we learned how important a good grinder is to making better coffee so we purchased an entry level manual grinder. \nThe new burr grinder was a noticeable improvement over the blade grinder, however we couldn't help but notice areas for improvement. Since Kaizen means continuous improvement we started to look for better options. Yet after searching the market and seeing the same ancient designs being repeated over and over we finally thought, we can do better.\nOriginally we wanted to name the company Kaizen Coffee but decided to do a survey with our top 4 name choices. The surveys came back and we learned a ton of things that we didn't know that we didn't know. For example, Kaizen is impossible to spell and associated with German culture (which isn\u2019t a bad thing) but it is a Japanese term that was being perceived as something other than what we intended.  \nHandground, on the other hand, was easy to spell, simple to remember, and had tons of positive connotations. The choice was obvious, but only after consulting the coffee community. We decided to apply the same crowdsourcing principles everywhere we could for the rest of product development. That's when we held a design competition. Hundreds of designs came in and Team Handground helped narrow down the pool to 6 finalists. After the final round of voting, Joaquin Herlein had won with a design that was the beginning of everything you see now.  \nJoaquin has continued working with Team Handground to improve on the initial design. Every time a major design decision or tradeoff arrises, members of Team Handground give their opinions and ideas through surveys and open ended responses. This effort has led to a 50% reduction in the number of screws used and an overall height that brings the grinder into alignment with the golden ratio. \nWe started our Instagram on day one as a way for us to document our journey but it has turned into so much more. I don't think we want to try to count how many hours we've spent on IG, but the community we found is great. \nWe decided to take the show on the road during the Kickstarter campaign and tour up the west coast to visit some of the biggest coffee cities in the USA. If you live in any of these cities, come say hi and see the Handground prototype in person.\nMaterial Specifications\nBlack Handground Grinder\nThe black version of the Handground grinder will be made out of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, otherwise known as ABS plastic. ABS is considered superior for its hardness, gloss, toughness, and electrical insulation properties. ABS's light weight and ability to be injection molded and extruded make it useful in manufacturing products for everything from musical instruments, to golf clubs heads, to automotive components including bumpers, protective headgear, luggage and protective carrying cases, to coffee grinders :) The list is endless for the applications of ABS plastic.\nIt is a very strong and durable plastic that will withstand the abuse of even the most careless coffee brewers.\nNickel AND Copper Handground Grinder\nThe nickel and copper versions of the Handground grinder will be made out of ABS plastic and then electroplated with either nickel or copper metal.\nElectroplating enables us to coat plastic with metal to achieve a real metal surface to increase the strength of the plastic substantially without adding a ton of weight to the product. This is a common practice used in home appliances like the sink faucets and handles and in the auto industry. These products look and feel metal because they are coated in actual metal, but if you were to break one in half (which is very hard) you would see that the inside is actually made of a hard plastic. We have currently chosen this method to achieve the nickel and copper finished versions of the grinder.\nAs discussed in the Risks and challenges, if this process does not live up to our standards and survive our thorough strength and durability tests, we will explore other methods to achieve the results we are looking for, including possibly die-casting the parts out of full metal.\nConical Burrs\nThe burrs are 38mm conical burr mills made from densely sintered Alumina ceramic which has high strength and hardness, temperature stability, and high wear resistance and corrosion resistance. We are continuing to experiment with material composition, the treatment process for the ceramic, and mechanical design aspects such as the angle and sharpness of the teeth. We will keep everyone updated on our progress with the burrs.\nStainless steel components\nThe main vertical axle and all screws and washers that will be in contact with the beans will be made from 300 grade stainless steel that you typically see in pans and other cookery tools.\nStainless steel is non-porous, it resists bacteria and germs more effectively than wood or plastic surfaces. It also is one of the most hygienic surfaces available, so any foods that come into contact with the surface or material do not attract dirt or germs. Stainless steel also does not react with coffee or other drink/food products.\nGrind Levels\n\nThe finest micron level for the grinder is currently set at 100 microns, increasing at 125 micron intervals. We are testing this range and even considering reducing the micron intervals for the first few steps at the finer range so that you can really hone in on your favorite espresso fine grind.\n\nDesign: Joaquin Herlein\nVideo Production, Editing & Sound: Alexis Morrell\nSourcing: Don Craig & BriteHub\nPrototyping: Shapeways & Quickparts\nVideo Contributions: Slayer Espresso & Cold Bruer\nBrewing Device Icons: Eric Ellis", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile manufacturing a product has become increasingly easier in today's well-connected world, there are always unforeseen challenges in bringing a brand new product into production. To best prepare for these challenges, we've been consulting with both successful Kickstarter inventors and coffee industry experts.\n\nWe've partnered with a sourcing company that has 25 years experience working with factories around the world. They employ professionals both locally in the US and internationally in Asia. Because of their experience working with top-quality factories in Asia, we are confident that we will be able to manufacture a high quality product from this region. We have already completed a round of factory tours and have selected the manufacturers that are most capable of building this product.\n\nThe next step of development is the consultation of a professional engineering firm to help conduct stress & longevity analysis. We will be integrating their feedback into our final design for manufacturing and then proceed with the factory that we choose to build the tooling for plastic injection molding. We will be actively involved with the tooling and validation, and plan to travel to the factories in order to inspect and test the initial production pieces before shipment.\n\nAs of right now, we see the greatest possible challenges in the areas below:\n\nCoffee Wood Knob: It has been our goal to source the wood for the knob from actual coffee trees from a coffee farm in Central/South America. Coffee wood is rarely, if ever, used to make physical products but our research shows that it has a very high tensile strength. Right now, we have found a large farm in Costa Rica that is going through a major renovation of their farming plot and will have thousands of old coffee shrubs available for our use. The problem that remains is finding a professional wood-shop that is located within a reasonable distance of the farm and capable of mass producing the wood knobs fast enough to then be shipped to our factory for assembly before we ship worldwide, in addition to conducting further tests on strength and durability. This is an ambitious goal that received high interest from Team Handground when we presented the idea months ago. It was clear that everyone loves the idea but that we can do without it, if it raises the cost of production too high.\n\nThe wood knob you see now on the prototype is called wengy wood. This is currently our first choice for wood because it is much easier to source than coffee wood. It\u2019s only downside is that it is fairly expensive, although absolutely beautiful. If we are unable to source a large quantity of coffee wood or wengy wood at a reasonable price, then we may have to consider a different type of wood that will achieve a similar look and feel.\n\nElectroplating is a process that uses electric current to reduce dissolved metals so that they form a coherent metal coating on another surface. In other words, science enables us to coat almost any material (including plastic) with metal to achieve a real metal surface that looks and feels like metal because it is metal, to increase the strength of the plastic substantially without adding a ton of weight to the product. This is a common practice used in home appliances like the sink faucets and handles and in the auto industry. These products look and feel metal because they are coated in actual metal, but if you were to break one in half (which is very hard) you would see that the inside is actually made of a hard plastic. We have currently chosen this method to achieve the nickel and copper finished versions of the grinder.\n\nThe prototype shown in this Kickstarter has a brushed nickel-like finish. Very thin black lines give the appearance that the product has been brushed. Brushed electroplating achieves this look by physically brushing the plastic parts with a plating solution. Brush electroplating has several advantages over \u201ctank plating\u201d, including portability, ability to plate items that for some reason cannot be tank plated, low or no masking requirements, and comparatively low plating solution volume requirements. Disadvantage compared to tank plating includes greater operator involvement, which can substantially increase the cost of production. We will be able to calculate the cost of production better once we know the initial demand for the grinder through Kickstarter. If the cost for brushed electroplating is too high, or if backers as a part of Team Handground decide they like a different finish better, we can choose from one of many other metal finishes for the grinder, such as a smooth matte finish, to a shiny reflective finish, that don\u2019t require brushed electroplating.\n\nWith that said, high quality and strength are our major goals, and even though electroplating is strong on paper, if it does not live up to our standards and survive our thorough strength and durability tests, we will explore other methods to achieve the results we are looking for, including possibly die-casting the parts out of full metal.\n\n\nGear material choice: We are currently using brass miter gears to transfer power from the side-mounted handle to the vertical shaft that drives the ceramic burr grinding mechanism. Our initial goal was to use two different sized gears to achieve a higher spin ratio (2:1) so that one turn of the arm corresponded to 2 turns of the burr grinder. This greatly increases the difficulty in turning the handle and we have decided not to use two different sized gears. We are now using brass miter gears that are high in strength. These gears are strong enough but we are continuing to experiment with gears made of other materials, including, but not limited to, stainless steel and delrin, a self-lubricating high strength plastic.\n\nThat is all! We will keep you informed with regular updates as our product gets closer to production, and we'll be doing everything possible to stay on schedule and deliver you a high quality and beautiful product. As we\u2019ve done since day one, we will keep everyone involved and be 100% transparent throughout the process.

Is it a condiment, a hot sauce, a dipping sauce, or a cooking sauce? The truth is, sriracha sauce is all of the above and MORE!\nFor the sriracha purists, our traditional sriracha sauce is exactly what you  expect it to be, a little spicy and a little sweet with a hint of garlic. For those that are bolder, we have also developed a few very distinct sriracha sauces. See the chart below for a quick description of our sriracha.\nLAST YEAR I launched my first sriracha Kickstarter <---(click here to see it) to raise enough money to help me get my family sriracha recipe from my kitchen table to local farmer's markets. I was so excited to have raised 896% more funds than I had originally hoped for. I was able to use the extra money to do all of the things promised in that Kickstarter, including refining my recipes and investing in the equipment I needed to get into farmer's markets. Since then we have continued to grow and have done many great things, including redesign our labels, rent a commercial kitchen for the production and storage of our sriracha, and even started development of a new sriracha sauce.\nTODAY we need your help to bring our newest sriracha sauce to the world. Our Ghost Pepper Sriracha is the hottest and most flavorful yet. We use smoked bhut jolokia peppers (along with a lot of love) in our new recipe. Like all of our sriracha sauces, we age our peppers until they are ready to become sriracha sauce.\n Rewards are all listed on the right side of this page.Please take your time to browse them and select the one that fits you best. In addition to our delicious sriracha sauces, we have included some swag for you to choose from as well. Of course we have stretch goals that we want to achieve as well, and the rewards for those can be found further down.\nOur Goals and Stretch Goals are ambitious, but we are confident that with your help, we will be able to achieve them. Our original goal and our stretch goals are all outlined below for you. Of course, every time we reach a stretch goal a unique reward will be sent FREE to every backer.

ZenEgg project will continue its story on our webpage :)\nFor all of you who still haven't decided on your holiday gifts, we have designed a special ZenEgg gift-card that you can give to your loved ones or friends in their stockings or under a christmas tree. This year Santa is coming in March :) You can download it H E R E. Peaceful and relaxing holidays to you all!\nREMINDER: Fitting into your home and office, ZenEgg is designed to sit comfortably on your desk, table or shelf. It reminds you to pause what you are doing and take a few minutes to reflect. \n\nSTRESS RELIEVER: Stress balls were created to relax the tensions in your hands and mind. ZenEgg works in much the same way, except it has been created out of warm, touchy materials.\n\nMASSAGE OBJECT: Made from solid wood, the rounded shape of the egg allows you to apply pressure directly and easily to relieve body tension.\n\nTOY: Nudge it, spin it, roll it.. No matter how you interact with it, the experience is always fun. Its playful character makes the ZenEgg a perfect gift no matter what age.\nERGONOMICS: My goal was to find the ideal shape to fit in my palm. The familiar and simplistic shape of an egg was the perfect answer. ZenEgg is designed to feel comfortable in your hands. With a weighted base, it always restores its balance.\n\nNATURAL FEEL: ZenEgg is made out of carefully selected Walnut, Pear and Maple woods. Working with these materials gives each ZenEgg a unique pattern and an inherent natural aroma. The warmth of the solid wood, gives the egg the natural feel that your body responds to.\n\nLOCALLY PRODUCED: ZenEggs are hand-crafted, following an age-old tradition of local woodcraft. Even though the shape itself is quite simple, the process behind it takes true craftsmanship to make it. Every ZenEgg is treated with organic oils to increase its durability. They are made with a high level of precision, tested and checked to ensure top level quality.\nZenEgg was created with an emphasis on tangible sensations. We are tactile creatures; it\u2019s common for us to have something in our hands. I started to realise that every object that we hold is associated with some activity that we automatically start to do. It\u2019s for this reason that I wanted to develop an object for taking time out.\nHidden from view, there is a meaning imbued in every egg. The Ouroboros, an icon that symbolises self-reflexivity, is burnt in on the inner surface of every wooden fitting.\nNote: Wood is live material so textures, lines and colours may differ from one ZenEgg to another. Also, in time colour of the wood will darken. All of our ZenEggs are treated with natural oils to ensure the most natural feel and aroma. The Olive ZenEgg is oiled with a mixture of olive oil an lavender.\nDARK WALNUT\nAverage Dried Weight: 38 lbs/ft3 (610 kg/m3) (of walnut wood)\nAppearance: Heartwood can range from a lighter pale brown to a dark chocolate brown with darker brown streaks. Colour can sometimes have a grey, purple, or reddish cast.\nGrain/Texture: Grain is usually straight, but can be irregular. Has a medium texture and moderate natural luster.\nMAGNIFICiENT PEAR\nAverage Dried Weight: 43 lbs/ft3 (690 kg/m3) (of pear wood)\nAppearance: Heartwood is light reddish brown. Sapwood is slightly paler but is not usually distinct from heartwood.\nGrain/Texture: Grain is usually straight, with a very fine uniform texture.\nLIGHT MAPLE\nAverage Dried Weight: 44 lbs/ft3 (705 kg/m3) (of maple wood)\nAppearance: Colour ranges from nearly white, to an off-white cream colour.\nGrain/Texture: Grain is generally straight, but may be wavy. Has a fine, even texture.\nSOOTHING OLIVE\nAverage dried Weight: 62 lbs/ft3 (990 kg/m3) (of olive wood)\nAppearance: Heartwood is a cream or yellowish brown, with darker brown or black contrasting streaks. Color tends to deepen with age. Olive is sometimes figured with curly or wavy grain, burl, or wild grain.\nGrain/Texture: Grain may be straight, interlocked, or wild. Fine uniform texture with moderate natural luster.\nCOLORFUL PLUM\nAverage Dried Weight:50 lbs/ft3 (795 kg/m3) (of plum wood)\nColor/Appearance: Plum heartwood can exhibit a cornucopia of colors, typically a yellowish brown, with streaks of pink, orange, red, purple, olive, or grey mixed in. Because of the small size of plum trees, swirled or irregular grain, as well as knots and other defects are common.\nGrain/Texture: Has a fine texture with close grain and a slight natural luster.\nDEEP WENGE\nAverage Dried Weight:54 lbs/ft3 (870 kg/m3) (of wenge wood)\nColor/Appearance: Heartwood is a very dark brown with black streaks. Upon application of a wood finish (particularly an oil-finish) the wood can become nearly black.\nGrain/Texture: Grain is straight, with a very coarse texture. Low natural luster and large pores in no specific arrangement. Brown mineral deposits are occasionally present, growth rings are distinct.\nAll the ZenEggs are available as a single reward or as an add-on. A lot of you were asking about a bundle of two the ZenEggs, so we made it possible by adding the Add-on feature. You can also order a bundle of three.\nHow does it work? Add-ons can only be added to an existing reward (ZenEgg, Duo or Nest). To add an additional ZenEgg, select your chosen reward and write in the price sum of the previous selected ZenEgg plus the new one (you do this manually). Example: Walnut ZenEgg (18$) + Wenge ZenEgg add-on (30$) = total (48$). The add-on feature is available for all ZenEggs in our rewards system (Walnut, Maple or Pear add-on = 16$, Olive = 25$, Plum = 22$). For any additional questions just write us a message.\nAlthough I designed the product and sourced the producers, the tooling and material costs are simply too much for me to afford on my own. The campaign goal is set at just enough to cover the costs of tools, labour, shipping and materials. After this costs are covered, I\u2019ll be able to produce more ZenEggs in a more sustainable way.\nThroughout this design process I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to get help from some lovely people. They saw the message I was trying to make and they supported me. \nJan Kikelj / Project management & Communication strategy\nMiha Artnak / Visual identity\nLucijan Kranjc, Alen Bubanja / Photography\nEthan Grant / Customer relationship\nNejc Matja\u017e / Production advisory\nMiha Mo\u017eina, Andra\u017e Jeri\u010d, Ju\u0161 Premrov / Video & Sound\nBla\u017e Beuermann, Srdjan Prodanovi\u0107/ Web development\nEva Per\u010di\u010d, Luka Pi\u0161kori\u010d, Peter Ru\u017ei\u010d, Janez Uplaznik / Business advisory \nSimon Pen\u0161ek / Studio sound recording\nAnja Humljan, Iris \u010ceh, Ana Osredkar, Naja Kikelj / Help with content\nCreative Centre Poligon / Creative environment\nMaker Lab / Photo studio\nPoti-Poti / 3D printing\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the design process finished and our producers chosen, we\u2019re thankfully in a pretty safe position.

Zebrano wood brings equal quality and aesthetic values as Olive wood and is at this point more suitable solution. Why? We cannot get the right thickness of the olive wood piles, if we do, the piles crack in 90% of cases which results in huge wood waste and we can only send you zen barbecue briquettes :) "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Thanks Ze(n)brano wood! ;)", "update_content": "Dear ZenEggers!\nI am happy to announce that plum ZenEgg is finally in production and ready to be shipped.

We've designed and built these pants from the ground up, based on 3 priorities:\n   \u25cf JEANS, MEET SWEATS. Yes, you can have it all. Imagine the flexibility and comfort of sweatpants and the look and reliability of denim. That's us. Our Jogger Denim stretches, breathes, and is made in Canada under the highest standards.\n\u25cf DAILY COMFORT.\nMost jeans make you struggle, pull, and twist to put them on. And then they squeeze and cut your midsection all day! No, thanks. Jogger Denim adjusts to your shape with a high-grade elastic waistband and drawstring-- a revolutionary improvement for jeans. It's like you aren't wearing pants. \n\u25cf UNPARALLELED STYLE.\nJogger Denim has a sleek silhouette that suits all occasions. It's sharp and bold for business, and fun and flexible for play. Plus its clean, cuffed finish makes other pants look baggy, and a little outdated.\n \u25cf NO MORE RESTRICTIONS\nOften times denim will be very restrictive especially around the groin area. Jogger Denim is modeled after sweatpants and has a relaxed fit around the groin much like sweatpants.\n\n\u25cf CYCLING\nSince Jogger denim is cuffed, it naturally reduces the amount of times you'll get your pantleg caught in the chain!\n In today's world, jeans are a daily necessity. But every morning, we wake up, and a part of us doesn't want to settle for the same restrictive, confining pants that people have worn for decades. \nWhat about sweatpants, you ask? Well, sweats are comfy but send the wrong message in public. What about jeans? They look better, but their lack of flexibility and fit don't compliment today's active lifestyle. \n\nIn today's world, we need the comfort and personalized fit of sweatpants. \n\nIn today's world, we also need the look and reliability of jeans. \n\nIt's time for something new. Together, right here and now, let's create Jogger Denim. \nIt is our vision that, as the first to own Jogger Denim, you get...\n\n\u25cf More comfortable days and nights. No need to struggle into these pants. No painful buttons or zippers. Jogger Denim adjust immediately with a high-grade elastic waistband and hardy drawstring capped with our signature rose-gold hardware.\n\u25cf Access to your full potential. Most denim restricts your ability to move, stopping you from living life at 100%. Most denim simply doesn't stretch. Ours does. Running, biking, commuting, exercising, playing sports, getting to important places, dancing or just enjoying life-- Jogger Denim will take you there.\n\u25cf Unparalleled looks. Much like you, Jogger Denim is sharp and professional when it needs to be. But it has a kind, flexible side as well. You can wear these pants from the boardroom to a party, and get compliments in both places.\nJogger Denim features...\n\n\u25cf Technologically advanced denim. Denim has come a long way in the past few years, allowing Jogger Denim to stretch, provide comfort, and take a hit-- all while retaining its shape.\n \u25cf Quality craftsmanship. Jogger Denim is made in Canada, and your pair will be individually appraised for over 50 points of quality. We use 10 stitches per inch to ensure the seams will weather any storm.\n\u25cf A fit that's all your own. Yes, the denim stretches. But the pants also adjust to your shape with a high-grade elastic waistband (which beats zippers and belts 100x over, we promise), and a drawstring. \n\u25cf Signature details that elevate your style. The denim itself is minimal, so that you can wear Jogger Denim from the boardroom to the party. However, each pair comes with carefully-selected rivets and drawstrings to accent your look.\n \u25cf Far below-retail pricing. Kickstarter is family to us. Because you're helping us create Jogger Denim with your ideas, enthusiasm, and ledges (and because we're cutting out the retail middleman by selling\nonline) Jogger Denim comes to you far below retail pricing! \n\u25cf Our guarantee. If you try them on, and are not totally satisfied with the fit and function, send them back (we'll pay the return) and we'll issue a refund for store credit. \nCHOOSING YOUR SIZE\nJogger denim is versatile because it has an adjustable waistband that can change sizes. This is great for the daily things you're exposed to in life. It can be made tighter if you're exercising or being active and looser if you're just relaxing around the house or treating yourself to a nice meal. You can forget about sorting through many different pairs of pants for your daily needs. And even better, say goodbye to restrictive buttons.\n\n The fit is inspired by sweatpants.

And it\u2019s almost impossible to actually increase your phone\u2019s battery power if you\u2019re using it as a GPS even while your phone is plugged in into your car's USB port; that's because your phone is using more power than the power your USB port can supply to your phone.   \nWHY DOES A PC/USB PORT CHARGE SO SLOW?\nA regular USB cable is made to communicate (transfer data) and to act as a power supply between your USB port and your device.\nWhen you connect your device (i.e. phone, table, etc.) to your USB port(on your laptop or in your car), USB port automatically prepares to communicate with your device and provide limited electric energy:  to sync AND charge.  Simply put, attempting to transfer data and charge at the same time is the main reason why charging is so slow.\nTHE SOLUTION \nTurning the switch ON to DouBBleTime mode results in faster charging time for your device when plugged into your computer or USB port in your car.\n DouBBleTime with Samsung Galaxy\nDouBBleTime with iPhone\nFast Charging AND Secure\nAn added bonus of DouBBleTime Charging Cable-it protects your personal and private data stored on your devices by blocking data connection.

DouBBLeTime mode achieves this by blocking off the data communication between your phone and USB ports, allowing only power charging to take place (at DouBBle the charging pace compared to a regular usb cable).\nHOW IT WORKS\nA simple yet ingenious special chip inside the switch talks to your computer saying, \u2018I\u2019m not a phone; I\u2019m not going to sync, so give me maximum charging energy.\u2019 This message allows the cable to bypass the capped out maximum power a USB can output and connect straight to the mainboard. The special chip also provides over current protection (OCP) and short circuit protection, which guarantees the safety of both your computer and device while charging. \nTESTING DouBBleTime CHARGING CABLE\nTEST PROTOCOL:\nWe used several power sources in our tests; used the USB charging cable from the original phone packaging for each phone or tablet and the USB ports of several different laptops (both PC and Mac). In addition, various vehicles with USB port were used for car charging tests.\nTEST RESULTS:\nCOMPATIBILITY  \nPROGRESS \n TIMELINE\nIn order to bring more than just a concept and idea to Kickstarter campaign, we have completed the following milestones:\nDesign Complete\nPCB Tooling Complete\nEnvironmental and Field testing Complete\nSupply agreement Complete with MFI licensed USB cable manufacturer\nWe need your help to complete the following:\nPlastic mechanical tooling for the switch.  We need funding to pay for tooling (mold)\nPackaging design\nWebsite design\nWorking capital to pay for raw materials\n Why Kickstarter?\nWhen we first shared the DouBBleTime Charging Cable idea to friends and co-workers in Silicon Valley, everyone said \u201cYou should check out Kickstarter!\u201d And we asked, \u201cWhat is that? How can Kickstarter help us complete this project?\u201d\nAfter researching Kickstarter, we fell in love with the idea of crowd-funding and even contributed to a couple of cool campaigns. We also reached out to other project creators whose campaigns were successfully funded and loved the sense of community and help we received along the way!\nThis is our first campaign and we\u2019re super excited to have our ideas become a reality through the Kickstarter community. \nDouBBleTime Team\nMinsoo Seo - Founder with extensive Project Management experience\nEmily Seo - Founder, Marketing and Advertising experience\nRichard Cho - Mechanical Engineer with 18 years of product development experience\nYoung Ran Jung - Electrical Engineer with 14 years of computer architecture and USB experience\nDong Hun Lee - Electrical Engineer with 15 years of power design work\nDan Xiong - Industrial Designer with 8 years of smart device accessories design experience \nFeng Haoyu - Multidisciplinary Creator.

These working samples have been tested extensively to prove charging times and safety. We have already set up agreements with key suppliers (certified MFi connector factory) and contracted manufacturer. And we have expertly-designed printed circuit boards in hand. These are just a few steps we\u2019ve taken to make sure the product is delivered correctly and on time!\n\nOur biggest concern and challenge will come from manufacturing of our product. From the quality of the mold we will be making to final assembly, we have a very high standard and expectation.

Pre-order at ZipSeam.com - use code Kickstarter for $5 off!\nA poorly fitted shirt or dress makes you look sloppy, lethargic, and unprofessional. The ZipSeam is a patent pending breakthrough invention that allows the user to quickly and inexpensively tailor their own shirts in the comfort of their own homes; turning any off-the-rack item into a sexy, sleek, fashion piece. \nIn an attempt to purchase collared shirts for my workplace, the only options offered were shirts of different neck sizes. The resulting shirt fit well around my neck, but my torso looked like I was wearing a one-man tent. Actually tucking in the shirt turned me into a hot air balloon, but leaving it un-tucked gave me an irresistible urge to do twirls in my button-up dress. I\u2019d always noticed a similar ballooning effect on my other collared shirts, albeit to a lesser extent.\nI wanted my shirts to fit something like this:\n\"Slim fit\"\nAll of the department stores have mannequins outfitted in sleek dress shirts, but what matters is this, which isn't immediately apparent\u2026\nFalse advertising anyone?\nA quick glance at the back of the mannequins revealed many folds of cloth, hidden from the shopper, beguiling them as to the true fit of the \u201coff the rack\u201d shirts.\nBait and switch haha!\n\u2026and so I explored options for bettering the fit of my shirts.\nTraditional tailoring is often expensive/cost ineffective, time consuming, and commonly permanent. If you were to take needle and thread to cloth, tailoring one shirt would take the average person well upwards of an hour to possibly result in a questionable result. A whole wardrobe? The thought of tailoring my entire closet is horrifyingly daunting. \nA sewing machine is faster than sewing manually, decreasing the time commitment necessary, but the initial cost at minimum is $50 for a passable machine, not to mention the steep learning curve.\nVisiting a professional tailor entails the drive there, the drive home, and then another drive there and back to pick up the finished product. Hopefully the result is satisfactory; otherwise you\u2019ll unfortunately have to plan for another trip for whenever the touch-ups are done. And at the end of the whole ordeal, expect to pony up $15-25, per shirt! \nHaving a shirt custom made will cost you even more, running anywhere from $50 to upwards of $100 per shirt. Those costs didn\u2019t fare well with my budget bruised with student loans, so I had to try something new.\nThe ZipSeam combines material and structural design to create the strongest seam without compromising flexibility and comfort. The patent pending design allows the ZipSeam to be lightweight, removable, AND reusable; users can tailor a shirt in minutes (demonstrated very clearly in the video). The ZipSeam turns clearance rack items into sleek shirts with excellent custom fits.\nComfort- Who would want to wear a piece of plastic inside their shirts? All my friends asked me that, until they tried the shirt with the ZipSeam in it. Thanks to the ridges, the ZipSeam is as flexible as your cell phone charging cord and can easily bend and flex with your body. Though it is a different feel from fabric, it is very much comfortable (I myself wore a shirt with the ZipSeam for 3 straight days). \nBefore and After\nBefore and After\nSam, who is 6'7\"\n            Ignore my enormous head and you can see the difference\nBefore and After\nI can smile!\nZipSeam bends with your body\nCloseup of the seam\nCAD design of a prototype\nOld prototypes\nPrototype\n3D printed model did not turn out too well\nDifferent materials tested. Top to bottom: HDPE LLDPE PP\nCurrent Design\nPrototype of current design\nAs you can see, the prototypes all have unsightly burrs; but final products will be injection molded, which would eliminate the burrs whilst keeping the required dimensions and structural integrity consistent (most certainly better than my own unsteady hands with a knife).\nTo mass produce the ZipSeam, we would need to purchase tooling for production. The tooling will be quite costly, so I am looking for help from Kickstarter.\nThe ZipSeam will be manufactured in the USA.\nApril - \nKickstarter is launched and funds raised\nJune - \nManufacturing of the ZipSeam after tooling and die are made\nTooling: 2-3 Weeks\nProduction Lead Time: 2-3 Weeks\nJuly to August - \nShipment of orders", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a manufacturer lined up and ready for the volume.

In today's ever evolving fashion and style trends, more and more people are going sock less. It's become a very popular look / style for both men and woman. You also have a huge amount of people who just don't want to wear socks, whether it be for convenient or laziness, they don't want to wear socks.  There are a couple big issues and annoyances that everyone who is trying to pull off the sock less look has to deal with. If you choose to wear socks, you have to find super small thin socks that don't go above the shoe line. These socks are typically tight, uncomfortable and slip off the heel throughout the day. The other option is to fold down larger socks and deal with bunching and unevenness on your foot. The last option is just to choose not to wear socks. This seems like the most logical right? But then you run into the issue of having sweaty, smelly feet which almost always gets trapped in your shoes and no matter how many times you try to air them out, or even wash them, the smell won't go away. I can't tell you how many pairs of shoes I have had to throw away from rancid, funky smells from not wearing socks. \nTHE SOLUTION \nSole-Socks are specialty insoles that have been created to replace socks. You can machine wash them when they smell and get dirty. Sole socks solve the many problems that we face when trying to pull off the no sock look. This is a deodorization, hygroscopicity and breathable, shock- absorption insole that offers added comfort to your shoe. These also offer air circulation inside the shoe. The end result is that your feet are cool, dry and comfortable.\nABOUT THE DESIGN\nSole- Sock are specially designed with a plush terry cloth top, which absorbs the moisture, odor, and all the other funky things that come from your feet throughout the day. This 100% cotton Terry cloth has been specially designed to be thick with long loops in order to be breathable enough to let heat and air through to the foot but its fibers are designed in a way to absorb anything that shouldn't be in your shoe, such as sweat and odor. The terry cloth is attached with a durable cotton outer layer of fabric and attached with a Bosnian embroidered stitch around the entire outer edge of the sole. The  zig zag looking stitch insures durability and quality during the length of the product life. Sole-Socks were designed to take the wear and tear that occurs each day on your feet. The final component of the design is the base, this is designed in such a way to allow the sole to grip the inside of your shoe and prevent slipping. These same fiber that grip and stabilize the Sole-Sock, are designed in such a way to allows air to flow from underneath your foot. This allows your foot to breath, cools it down and cuts down on sweat and odor.  Additionally, the base layer is perforated to allow the foot to breathe from the bottom. This bottom layer also acts as a padding and support. \nSole-Socks are designed in a way to offer a little more cushion and comfort on the bottom of your foot. At the same time we designed it in a way to make sure it wasn't to bulky to cause the shoe too become tight and uncomfortable. These were designed to be treated like a pair of socks. \nthe design and why it works so well\nWhat about the sweat from the top of my feet?  More than 90% of odor causing perspiration is released at the sole of the feet. \nMaterials: 70%cotton, 5% Polyester 25% silicone\nbottom of the sole-sock: Groove to help air flow and grip, air hole for breathablity.\nbase of the sole sock\nA detailed photo of the top absorbent material and why it works so well.\nPLAY\n\njust for kids\nBenefits of sole socks:\nOur goal is to keep your feet, COOL, DRY, ODOR FREE AND COMFORTABLE. We know Sole-Socks offer all of these things.\n   - Socks don't show anymore\n- Extra padding for soles of your shoes \n- Blocks odor\n- Breathable \n- Absorbs moister \n- Prevents athletes feet symptoms \n- Comfortable\n- Very convenient  \n- Machine washable\n- Customization to your size and fit\n-  Able to use in almost any type shoe\n- Take up less space in suitcases / dresser drawer space\n- No more socks with holes \nHOW SOLE-SOCKS WORK\nStep One: Find out what shoe size you wear. The easiest way to do this would be going to your closet and looking at your shoes. Once you know this, order that size of Sole-sock\nStep Two: Once you receive your sole-sock in the mail simply place the left and right foot beds into your chosen pair of shoes. (Should I remove the existing sole? it all depends on your preference. Most people lay the Sole-sock on top of the existing sole due to the fact these are designed as sock and not sole replacements.)\nStep Three: Put on your shoes and go about your day.\nStep Four: At the end of the day simply remove your custom pair of Sole-Socks and throw them in the washing machine\nIt's as simple as these 4 steps, treat them like you would a normal pair of socks.\nSole- Socks time lines and future plans.\nAs you can see sole socks are fully developed, tested and ready for mass production. When our project is funded, all backers will receive there order in less than 60 days. As soon as the project is backed our first full production run will be placed. Production time is about 30 days. Once product is made, we will then sort, package and proceed to ship each individual order to each kickstarter backer. \nOnce we have shipped and fulfilled all the backers orders, our plan is to start selling Sole-Socks directly on our website for $10 a pair. We want to reward early backers who support us here on kickstarter with a low price for all the support and belief in our product. Act fast and check out the rewards on the side. We will also target key retailers who we think that would be a good fit / partner. \nWe also plan on upgrading our packaging in order to educate the consumer more easily on the benefits of Sole-Socks\nPLEASE SHARE THE PROJECT ON FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM , YOUR SUPPORT MEANS A LOT.\nEXTRA INFO\nSIZING: You may be asking how do I know what size Sole-Socks works best for me? We work on a US shoe size system, in both Men's and Woman's. We recommend you purchase the size of sole-sock that you would for shoes size. Sole-Socks are offered in whole sizes only, if you are a half size no worries we got you covered. Sole-Socks are designed to fit full and half size shoe sizes. As a rule of thumb, for those individuals who wear a half size we recommend going down to the nearest whole size. For example if you are a size 9.5 you would order a size 9 Sole-Sock. See chart below for to reference what size will work best for you.\nKids sizes: If we hit our stretch goal of 15,000 we will offer kid sizes sole-socks. We will offer size 8-13 small children and sizes 1-5 big kid sizes as well.\n  If your more familiar with other sizing metric feel free to refer to the shoe chart below.\nAdult sizing chart for reference\nKids sizing chart: toddlers, little and big kids\nDo they really work? I'm sure some people doubt that these could replace their socks and have so many added benefits. To be honest we were a bit skeptical at first as well. Yes, it is a simple design but the product testing and design behind Sole-socks speaks for its self. When analyzing the materials and the functions each one of these materials play into the product, we know our product works and our proud to stand behind it. The only way to truly know for yourself, is to try it out. \nHow often do I need to wash my soles-socks? This really depends on you. Each person who uses the product differs widely. Some people's feet sweat a lot more than others. Some people are washing there pair each day, and others are washing there pair of Sole-socks every few weeks. \nCare instructions: How do I wash my sole-socks? It's really simple Sole-Socks are washing machine friendly, just throw them in the washer and let me air dry. They are designed to air dry very quickly and be ready to use with little wait time.\n Why do my feet stink without socks? - Stinky feet are caused by overgrowth of bacteria. Interestingly, a skilled diagnostician can identify the type of bacteria from the smell. Sole-Socks help prevent this bacteria from taking place in your shoes it acts like buffer and stops smell at its source.\nABOUT US\nMy brother and I have been in Business together since we could remember. I guess you could even go back to our first neighborhood lemonade stand, to most recently working the past 3 years together with a startup based in Boise Idaho. Each of our skill-sets and knowledge has really helped to complement one another in work and family relationships. We get a lot of inspiration from each other and our surroundings. We are extremely passionate about Sole-Socks, the fact that this product solves a problem us and our friends have dealt with makes this project so much more special. We really think that this product is going to change the sock industry. With Tanners expertise in manufacturing and product development and Taylor's experience in marketing and advertising we know that we can bring this product to market.\nTanner and Taylor doing some product testing\nBrainstorming & design ideas\nFor more information check out our Website http://sole-socks.com\nLike us on facebook and share our product with your friends.\nanother detailed photo of the terry cloth top material", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter months of fine tuning, we have our final product done and ready to go. All product testing is done and the product is proven. Our biggest issue moving forward is going to be estimating inventory amounts in each size of soles for men and woman. Forecasting amounts for production will be somewhat of a challenge due to the fact there is no historical data on a product like ours. But we know with a $4,500 investment this will cover all of our backers and enough to take to market in a select few stores we choose to partner with.\n\nAdditionally, we face the challenge of proving to consumers that this product actually works. It's so simple and logical there could be people who doubt the soles actually work as good as a pair of socks at stopping sweat and odor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Reaching out", "update_content": "It has come to our attention that there are a few backers have still not received their Sole-Socks reward.

Pledge for an Orbitkey and give out an Orbitkey Christmas card to tell that special someone what nice gift they will be receiving in March 2014.\nYou can download the instruction and print your own Orbitkey Christmas card from this link >> here. The card will have a web link which they can visit and choose their preferred band style from (webpage will be launched before Christmas)! \nStylish. Make an impression with the Orbitkey. Not only is it practical, Orbitkey embodies elegance. Our objective is to create key accessories that you can be proud to carry.\nOrganised. Orbitkey transforms your cluster of keys to a neatly organized stack. You can arrange keys in your order of preference, which will help you locate the right key quickly and effortlessly.\nQuiet. Orbitkey is truly silent. It just won\u2019t rattle! Perfect for keeping in your pocket when jogging and perfect for sneaking up on people!\nNo more key scratches. Keys don\u2019t always get along with your smartphones and other precious items; Orbitkey protects your belongings from key scratches.\nPersonalised. With an interchange-able band design and wide selection of materials and colors to choose from. You can have several bands to suit your style and occasion.\nFlexible. Orbitkey caters for both minimalist and traditionalists. Whether you have 3 keys or 9 keys, the Orbitkey will stay compact and organized! Your keys will fit comfortably into any pocket or bag!\nSpecial Locking Mechanism. Our custom designed locking mechanism solves the issues that normal screws have. It is specially created to stop your keys from coming undone over time and it also allows you to adjust how tight your stack of keys are. It has also been designed to complement the overall sophistication of the product.\nOptional Attachment. In case you're wondering, Every Orbitkey comes with an additional attachment ring to carry bulkier and odd shaped items such as your car keys or bike lock keys!

You can use most standard keys with Orbitkey. If you happen to have keys with smaller hole diameter than 5mm, please let us know. We have a few tricks to make that work too!\nPLAY\n\nOur goal is to provide you with more band and accessories options. When we reach certain number of backers, we will be releasing more bands/ accessories for you to choose from. Please help us spread the word to make it happen! More stretch goals coming so stay tuned!\nAlthough we are all-too-familiar with the \u201ckey ring\u201d and grew up using it, it was far from perfect; it was noisy, it was unorganized, it damaged anything that came near it and it was unappealing! Everything the Orbitkey is not! We started trialling with different materials and designs. The initial design involved the use of Chicago screws, but we quickly found these to be unreliable (and unappealing) as they would come loose over time. We then set out to create something of our own \u2014 a tool that could withstand the test of time! Our newest model has a built in mechanism that prevents the device from coming undone accidentally. It can also be adjusted to fit a different number of keys. We tested many different materials for the band and finally settled on TPU rubber and leather. We wanted a material that is flexible yet strong enough to perform the movement of the Orbitkey, but, more importantly we needed something that would prevent keys from scratching our belongings.\n Why we need you\nFor the past 12 months we\u2019ve been testing and refining the Orbitkey. All the manufacturers are lined up and ready to begin production. Your support will help fund the first production run and get the Orbitkey from our warehouse into your pocket! The funding will assist with the cost of tooling, manufacturing and distribution. We will also be using the funding to expand the range of bands available for you to choose from. In order to bring Orbitkey to life, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for an Orbitkey, but also sharing this project with your friends. Something as simple as tweeting about our page or sharing our Facebook page will go a long way to the success of Orbitkey.

It's treated to be specifically windproof, water and soil-resistant, and offers excellent anti-microbial properties.\n4) WHOLESALE PRICE: We're selling these gloves exclusively to you on Kickstarter, cutting out the the middlemen and traditional retail markups, to offer the gloves at the revolutionary price of $65.\n5) OUR GUARANTEE: You'll instantly see and feel the difference when you put on the Touchpoint glove. We're so confident that we guarantee it with free returns for store credit (see full details below).\nHow It Works\nOur gloves mimic conductive properties of the human skin; this makes it touchscreen compatible. The surface of the glove alone is enough to work on a touchscreen. Therefore, we've been able to line it with extra soft fleece to keep you warmer. The gloves have been designed to provide seamless control of touchscreens, stylishly.\nWhat You get\n1) Complete control of touchscreen devices.\n2) Warm hands protected from the elements.\n3) A beautifully designed glove that stands on it's own for aesthetic.\n4) A timeless investment piece that ages, grows with your hand, and becomes more valuable over time.\n5) No more taking off and on gloves to interact with your phone.\n6) No scratches or smudges on your phone from your fingers.\nArrival Before Christmas Holidays!\nAnd by far, one of the best holiday gifts for 2014. It's something that everyone needs and can make use of. The gloves will retail for over $120 and since they are new to the market, they make the perfect gift for that person who has everything. We will have them sent out by December 15th, way before Christmas arrives!\n\n\nOur Story\nLeather gloves have been keeping hands warm for centuries and are known for their durable exterior, insulation, and timeless look. But in light of recent technological advances, most gloves are no longer practical. These days, we need touchscreen technology when we're really doing anything with our phones. We need our gloves to keep us warm and perform even better for us!\nWe believe in creating accessories that exist in the space where fashion meets function. So, AEON Attire has created the Touchpoint Glove, premium leather gloves with nanotechnology that allows you to stay connected seamlessly and stylishly. Complete control at your fingertips.\nI teamed up with leathersmiths and designers who had been working in the leather goods industry for over the past 8 years. The result was a new glove line that we developed to be one of the most comfortable, exceptionally designed, and amazingly functional leather gloves to date. Not only that, but by selling on Kickstarter, we're able to offer our gloves directly to customers at a revolutionary price of only $65. (Includes shipping in Canada)\nOur Fits & Styles\n\nThe Tri-Line:\nThe Rider:\nRider sizes: 7\", 8\", 9\"\nThe Quilt:\nQuilt sizes: 6\u00bd\", 7\", 7\u00bd\", 8\"\nIf you are not sure about your glove size, measure the hand you normally write with at its widest point in inches (excluding the thumb), then round down to the nearest half or whole number - this will be your glove size.\nGlove sizes come in half and whole numbers, between 7\u00bd and 11 for men and 6 and 8\u00bd for women. For example if your hand measures 8\u00bd inches around its widest point (excluding the thumb), your glove size is 8\u00bd (Note: one inch = 25.4mm).\nWhere gloves are sized S,M,L,and XL, the following guide will apply (measurements refer to your glove size, as calculated above)\nFor Men:- Small 7- 7\u00bd Medium 8\u00bd - 9 Large 9\u00bd\nFor Women:- Small 6 - 6\u00bd Medium 7 - 7\u00bd Large 8 - 8\u00bd\nIf you are between sizes, choose the smaller size. Gloves should be snug at first but will stretch.\nPremium Craftsmanship & Detailing\nWe take pride in the exceptional quality of our gloves. We believe that the details matter and take great care in combining the best materials and craftsmanship in our products. Here are some of the highlights:\nCare Instructions\nDo not put them in a washing machine or tumble dryer. Do not wring, do not bleach, do not iron and do not dry clean. These gloves should not be machine washed. Gently hand wipe if needed.\nHelp Get Production Started\nWe're raising $2,500 to get production started for the Touchpoint premium leather glove line. This includes the costs to meet production minimums, top quality leather, improving a few stylistic and functional aspects to the prototypes. Both gloves will have 2 adjustable buttons for the wrist instead of just 1. We also realized that the gloves needed to be more fitted in the fingertips to increase control when we tested prototypes. We've already developed most of the project through with our own money and time but we need your help to improve and bring the collection to life. This is the final push! Please support us at whatever level you're comfortable with. In return, you can get a pair of our amazing gloves. And by selling directly to you online, we can offer you our wholesale price of $65 CAD(W/shipping in Canada) down from over $110.\nOur Guarantee\nSimply try the gloves on and we guarantee that you'll instantly feel the difference or the return is on us. This means that if you don't like the gloves for any reason, just email us and we will send you a pre-paid shipping label to send the gloves back to us. The gloves will need to be unworn and in their original packaging, and returned within 14 days. Upon receipt of the gloves, we will issue you full store credit to use on our website. Note that free returns only apply to domestic orders - international shipping costs more, so we aren't able to provide a pre-paid shipping label for international returns.\nJoin Us and Help Spread The Word\nWe're excited to get the AEON Touchpoint premium leather glove line launched on Kickstarter. After you support us, we would love it if you could help us spread the word and share our video with friends. You can find us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (@AEONAttire). If you have any questions or just want to say hi, you can email us anytime at info@aeonattire.com.\nThank you so much for your support!\n\n-Patrick\n\nMusic by Sweet Wave Audio www.sweetwaveaudio.co.uk", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTiming is the biggest risk for us. We're expecting to get them all shipped out before December 11th. The good news is that we went through the major challenge of getting glove production started already. We have successfully funded a project on Indiegogo and raised over 11k. As a result, our supply chain and manufacturing procedures have been streamlined and we're ready to go. We're looking to reduce the risk of delay this time through a few additional changes as well:\n\n1) First, we are staggering our delivery dates into batches according to when our customers place their orders.\n\n2) We're also going to start getting production started immediately once we hit our goal of $2,500, rather than waiting until the campaign ends.\n\n3) We simplified our product offering (3-4 sizes only) This significantly helps us simplify the manufacturing, and also lets us offer these leather gloves at such a low price.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Our Second Project", "update_content": "Hi all,\n\nTogether, we made winter phone use easier for so many people.

HERE'S WHY...\n1 - PERFECT FIT:  In this ever-changing world, you need a belt that adapts with you, every 1/4 inch of the way. Trakline belts conform to your exact waist size, every time you put it on.\n\n2 - ADJUSTABILITY:  It's true, Trakline belts are 8X's more adjustable than traditional belts. That's because they offer over 40 sizing positions to choose from. Traditional belts have only 5.\n3 - NO HOLES:  That's right.  No more worn-out, stretched-out, augmented, poor-fitting belt holes to deal with. Instead a modern, hidden trak system that lasts longer and conforms to your precise waist size. \n4 - QUALITY:  We only make products that we want to wear >> and we like quality stuff. The buckles are solid stainless steel and the belts are full-grain leather.\n\nfeatured on:  Dude I Want That, Gear Hungry, ShoppersBase & Crowdfund Mafia\n                                visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nSO HOW'S IT WORK ?\nWhen a Trakline belt is pulled snug around your waist, the buckle locks firmly at your exact waist size - every time you put it on. To remove or adjust, pull the small tab under the buckle.  It's that simple.  Not only do Trakline belts fit much better than traditional belts, but they're easier to take on and off.  Watch the video and see for yourself - because seeing is believing... \nOUR STORY\nTwo years ago my wife bought me an expensive, designer belt for my birthday. She wanted to upgrade my wardrobe. Unfortunately for me, the belt holes didn't line up with my waist size that day.  So I did what a lot of guys have done, I added a couple holes.  But in the process >> I ruined the belt.  Needless to say, my wife was not happy.\n                           Visit us online at www.TRAKLINE.com\nINSPIRATION\nI learned 2 simple lessons that day.  First, never puncture any gift from your wife and second >>  belt holes don't work all that well.  Not much of a surprise, considering they were introduced during the \"Dark Ages\" and haven't changed much since.  \nConsider that as you work, walk, eat, sleep, play - your waist size naturally fluctuates with you.  Unfortunately, traditional belts only offer you 1 inch spaced holes. Who's waist fluctuates 1 inch at a time?  Not mine.  So I made it my mission to find a better fitting belt with style.  But when I scoured the marketplace for a product that could adapt to my ever-changing waist size AND look good doing it... I came up empty. That's when I got inspired to create a whole new kind of belt.\n                                  visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nEvery man knows that belt holes aren't fun to deal with.  They stretch-out, wear-out and rarely seem to fit just right.  Don't you think you deserve a belt that not only looks great, but offers a perfect fit every time you put it on ?   ...I think so too.\n\nCREATING A NEW KIND OF BELT\nAfter a year and a half of researching, designing, redesigning, prototyping and testing >> we came up with the TRAKLINE BELT.\n                                visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nFirst - we employed a simple, more effective trak system.  This 10-inch trak is sewn into the back of the belt and completely hidden from sight.  Next, we designed a unique (patent pending) buckle to interface with the belt and give you over 40 sizing positions all in 1/4 inch increments.  That 8X's more adjustable than your traditional belt.  When a Trakline belt is pulled snug around your waist, the buckle locks firmly at your exact waist size.  The result = a simple, stylish belt that offers the perfect fit, every time. (see photos)\nWHAT ABOUT QUALITY ?\nWe designed the Trakline belt to last by using the best available materials. The buckle is constructed of solid stainless steel and the belt is full-grain leather with double stitching.\nHOW DO YOU KNOW I'LL LOVE IT ?\nWhen we completed the final samples, we handed them out to a few friends and associates to test for us.  We asked them to wear the belts for few months in the \"real-world\" and give us their feedback.  The only problem was, when we went to get the belts back, no one wanted to give them up.  All the guys loved their new belts.  They said it was the best fitting belt they ever had and they didn't want to go back to their old belts.  So we feel like we can say with confidence >> this is the best belt you'll ever own and you're going to love it.\nWE NEED YOUR SUPPORT\nWe're ready to launch Trakline and take it to stores, but we need your support to do it. Specifically, we need the funds to pay for the first production run and get the belts into the marketplace.\n                                visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nREWARDS\nIn return for your support, we want you to be one of the first to own a Trakline Belt !  Check out the Rewards column for the styles and backer pricing.  In addition, We're offering FREE SHIPPING to all U.S. orders and $15 for International destinations outside the U.S.\nGIFT FOR GUYS\nTrakline Belts make a great gift that guys can wear and appreciate everyday... not like that tie you're thinking about buying him.\nBELT DETAILS\nAt the moment, we have 4 buckle styles (Icon, Intrepid, Evolve & Eureka) and 2 belt colors (black or brown) to choose from (see photos).  Belts are 1 3/8 inches (35mm) wide and should fit thru most jean or dress pant loops. Currently our belts fit waist sizes UP TO 44 inches (118 cm).  We will have larger sizes and women\u2019s styles in the near future on our website - http://www.Trakline.com\nOn the back of each belt we've printed waist sizes to show you precisely where to trim your Trakline belt (with scissors) . The trimmed end then snaps securely into the buckle.  It's easy.  It's best to try the belt on before trimming.  The purpose for trimming, is to get your belt length within your \"waist range\", then the 10 inch trak system can create your perfect fit every day.\nTHE TEAM\nKarl Kozak: Sales & Marketing\nMauro Bove: Manufacturing & Quality Control\nSteve Olson: Product & Web Design\nThe three of us have been good friends and business associates for over 10 years. We often share new ideas and look to each other for advice.  So when I approached Mauro and Steve with my idea to create a new kind of men's belt, both thought it was a great idea who's time had come and jumped at the chance to get involved.   Not just because of our friendship, but because they mutually agreed that traditional belts were not only outdated, but that there had to be a better method. And I wanted them on board because of their skill sets and expertise. I thought they were perfect for this project.  For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing and quality control.  As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of high-quality retail products for some of Americas biggest retailers.  Steve on the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in creating our product designs, drawings and the website.  My background has been in business management and sales.  Over the past 20 years, I've successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies.  Together, the three of us make a great team.\n                              visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nPRODUCTION PLAN\nOnce we complete the Kickstarter campaign we will immediately commence production on our first order of Trakline belts. Based on the factories estimate, the manufacturing process should take between 30-40 days to complete.  To save money, we're making the belts at a responsible factory in Southern China that we've employed before with great success.  One of our partners (Mauro) will personally be on hand to oversee and ensure that the best quality standards are met. Once the production is completed, we will ship the belts to our office in San Diego, California, and then repackage individual orders to ship out to backers within about 1-2 weeks.  It's that simple.\n                              visit us at  www.TRAKLINE.com\nTHANK YOU !\nThanks in advance for your support and for taking the time to learn about our new product, we really appreciate it !\n\nTrakline's unique buckles are Patent Pending.  Trakline is a trademark of The Standard.\nWhat some folks are saying about us:\n\"Trakline banished the meager five, 1\"-spaced holes of traditional belts from their full-grain leather strips, and replaced them with a secure Trak system boasting 40 sizing positions at 1/4\" increments. The result: a perfect fit at my precise waist size, whether it's Liquid Diet Monday or Chicken & Waffles Saturday.\" - Dude I Want That.com !\n\n\"What we love about Trakline belts is that each belt fits to your exact waist size, every time you put it on.

SHINY SHINY\n\u201cBetter battery life, widgets, dedicated call answer/end button, dedicated camera shutter button and a notification LED \u2026 I\u2019ll soon be able to mark one of those features off my list if the myLED Kickstarter project gets fully funded\u201d THE GADGETEER\n\u201cmyLED looks like a fantastic little device to remove the frustration of checking for notifications every minute or so when we\u2019re expecting something\u201d. N3RDABL3\nWhat Is myLED?\nmyLED is an external notification light for iPhones and iPads that flashes to alert you of notifications such as missed calls, emails and social network updates. It allows you to keep informed of activity on your phone without having to switch on the screen.\nmyLED is packed with a ton of functionality and fits seamlessly into iOS devices. It sits inside the headphone jack to ensure full visibility from every direction, and when there is an interaction such as an email or missed call, myLED starts flashing to let you know.\nmyLED in real life size\nmyLED in operation\nmyLED is an incredibly simple solution to an issue many of the 400 million iPhone and iPad users have: notifications. There is no convenient way to get alerts for activities such as missed calls, emails and social network updates on iOS - if you\u2019ve used a BlackBerry or Android and have seen them flash to alert you, you'll understand the difference. Phone notifications are a small detail however it can cause much aggravation to check the phone for new activity every few minutes. \nWe have come to face the challenge of creating myLED from a personal need. We used to have Blackberrys and got accustomed to the extremely handy notification light. When we migrated to the iPhone and the iPad we felt the devices had a major deficiency in the lack of external notification i.e. to check for missed activities you must switch the screen on. This can be particularly inconvenient, for example when the device is on silent mode such as in the office, at meetings, lectures or when you are in noisy environments. \nFrom this need we decided to find a better way to get notifications from our iPhones and iPads; so we created myLED.\nHow Does myLED Work?\nmyLED is a elegantly designed accessory with a micro-LED connected to the audio jack. You insert it into an iPhone or iPad, switch on the myLED app, and set what you\u2019d like it to notify you of - missed calls, and Twitter updates for example. Now those incoming notifications  will trigger myLED to flash, and it will continue flashing until you see what you\u2019ve missed - alternatively you can program myLED to flash for a given time only.\nHow to use myLED\nSince myLED allows you to customize different blinking patterns for the various notifications, it is easy to see what kind of activity has happened at first sight. \nFurthermore, myLED comes with a headphones clip so that when not in use it can be safely stowed.\nmyLED headphone clip\nmyLED is a super-useful complement to any iOS device, so small and intuitive that it will feel as a natural part of your iPhone or iPad.\nWhat Kind Of Alerts Can I Get On myLED?\n   Missed Calls\n   FaceTime\n   Emails \n   Skype\n   Facebook\n   Twitter\nWhere We Are At\nWe have been designing and developing myLED for a couple of months applying lean methods to the entire process. We set out with a goal of creating an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) and to complete a proof of concept.\n  CAD model of the jack's head\nWe successfully built a number of prototypes, iterated through a few designs and developed a basic working iOS app that enables myLED to run on the iPhone and iPad. \nmyLED prototype\nThe next stage is to launch the project here on Kickstarter in order to gauge interest in the product. While we are generating funds we can complete the development of the myLED jack and start to produce packaging concepts and detailed plans for the app architecture. As soon as funding is available to use, manufacture can commence.\nProject Timeline\nWhy We Need You\u2026\nWe are raising money to revolutionize the way notifications work on iOS.\nOur team is in advanced discussion with a manufacturer and in order to produce myLED on an industrial level we need to address the following:\nTooling, manufacturing and assembly: the production of the bespoke 3.5mm jack requires special tooling, and this costs several thousand dollars alone. The soldering process for connecting the micro-LEDs to the jack needs high precision and it is also highly expensive.\nInjection molding: to manufacture the white casing we need to create a custom-made mold for plastic injection.\nApp development: we need to continue developing our software in order to reach full functionality, and for this we\u2019ve found highly skilled and experienced developers who are working for us.\nFinally, we have to package and ship myLED to you.\n\n  FAQs\nDoes myLED flash in different colors? Currently myLED produces a red flash. We choose to create myLED with a single color in-order to minimize the size of the device, which otherwise would require significantly more electronic components. This design also ensures minimal power consumption that may otherwise significantly affect battery life on an iOS device.\nDoes myLED alert for text messages? At this point we are facing challenges making text messages work with myLED so we expect the initial app to ship only with notifications for Calls, Emails, FB, Twitter and Skype.\nCan I use earphones while myLED is in use? No, myLED is inserted into the headphones input and so headphones can\u2019t be used together with myLED - that said, the whole point of myLED is to alert you to phone activity when you\u2019re away from it. Also, a plastic clip to hold myLED to your headphones set when not in use will be shipped as part of your myLED package.\nDo I need to install software on my iOS device for myLED to work? Yes, you install a free app that interfaces and controls the settings for myLED. The app will be free for download to all our backers.\nDoes the app need to be \"on\" for myLED to work? Yes, myLED app needs to run in the background and we are currently working on further minimizing battery consumption. Our tests on iPad 3 showed 80hrs of battery life with myLED app running in the background and wi-fi data connection switched on.\nIs myLED compatible with all iOS devices? Currently myLED has been successfully tested with iPhone 3, 3S, 4, 4S, 5 iPad 2, The New iPad. \nI want to order more than one myLED \u2013 how can I do it? Due to the new Kickstarter rules for manufacturing projects we have not been able to insert more rewards for multiple quantities (for example a x2, x3, x10 packs etc). However you can pledge a sum equal to the price of the reward desired  x the number of myLEDs you want. We intend to do a survey at the end of the funding to collect addresses and make sure everyone receive what they pledged for.\nAlso, please contact us directly if you are interested in a large quantity purchase (x10 myLEDs or more) to secure the best deal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy pledging you get to be involved in an innovative project and we endeavour to reward you for that, but you also agree to share the residual development risks and challenges with us. \n\niOS development\nOne risk is app approval by Apple for the AppStore. \nGaining access to notifications on the phone log is blocked for most apps and we are having to work hard to find solutions that don\u2019t use this method.\nWhile we will work tirelessly to create an app that is acceptable to Apple and feel that we can do so, we cannot make guarantees since this process is outside of our control. \nThe final development of the app will continue as soon as the funds are available to us, and we will be submitting our app for approval at the first opportunity. However, given the nature of our delivery programme, we will be likely to hear back from Apple once the product and packaging production is well underway and these activities will absorb almost the entirety of the money raised on kickstarter. For this reason, if we come up against an insurmountable problem with the app approval, we will be unable to offer refunds.\nUnexpected software development obstacles could be a risk too, although we have carried out a large number of experiments with our developer to ensure the feasibility of all the features and details that are still to be implemented in the final app.\n\nmyLED working with text messages\nWe have run into a challenge getting the app working with the text message client. We are exploring alternative solutions and will inform our pledgers on progress throughout software development.\n\nManufacturing process\nShipping time can be delayed subject to manufacturing delays.

I\u2019ve come up with an innovative and stylish way of carrying your keys without the use of the cumbersome, and let\u2019s be honest, not very attractive carabiner. \nAll my prototyping is done manually on a machine made for the war effort in the 1940\u2019s. In order to get this product to you at the lowest possible price, I need your help to do a production run.\n\nForm & Function\nI believe good design should be attractive and well-crafted without sacrificing function. By using strong materials and clean lines, my aim is to create a useful piece that can be enjoyed and used daily. If you\u2019re going to use something everyday it should be good. \nThe slots are designed to hold securely to a belt loop, but still able to detach easily. I have never had one come off without intentionally detaching it. \n\nMaterials and Process\nCut and machined from a solid block of stainless steel. Not die cast. This  method produces a stronger, better quality, more consistent product than casting steel into various shapes.\n\nFinish\nEach piece is hand finished to ensure quality. It will never rust, corrode, or wear out. When you hand it down to your grandchildren, it will look like it did when you first bought it. \nAs with anything that is attached to a keys, normal wear and scratches will happen. Because the KeySquare is fabricated from stainless steel, it allows any scratches to be quickly buffed out with any household scotch pad or small grit sandpaper. \n\nDesign Features\n Looks good with casual or dress \n No moving parts to wear out \n You\u2019ll always have a bottle opener at the ready \n Small enough to fit comfortably inside a pocket \n Made from durable stainless steel \n Holds securely on a belt loop with enough reach to pocket your keys\n Made in USA\n Weight: 1 ounce\n\nShow your support and get some of these rad coasters \nSpecial Edition Kickstarter Coasters made from solid aluminum", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a background in manufacturing, metal fabrication and experience running production jobs. Having done the actual work of manufacturing, I know the kinds of problems that arise in the shop and how to deal with them quickly and efficiently. \n\nThe biggest challenge for the KeySquares is the finishing process. Each one is sanded and buffed by hand. Although this method is time consuming, it ensures the highest quality. To compensate for the time this process takes, the delivery date is February. \n\nI've designed the manufacturing process to work with local small businesses. Every aspect of the project with be manufactured locally in Richmond, Va without the use of off-shore sourcing or sacrificing quality. Go USA.\n\nThe success of this project depends heavily on getting the word out. Every blog or social networking post counts, so please share. Thanks for your support.\n\n\nCheers,\nAdam\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "All New Machine Era Project Live Now!", "update_content": "We're excited to announce our latest and greatest project: The Field Pen"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Introducing the all new Ti5 Slim Wallet", "update_content": "We're super excited to share our latest project: Ti5 Slim Wallet\nIt's been a few years since the original Machine Era Wallet release.

When you have our money, we are shareholders. We have some right to know what you are doing with it, I believe. I backed this project because it seemed like a labor of love. Making beautiful pieces on an antique machine was a passion for Adam i supposed and I was really excited to back that. It probably could have been about anything he was making and I for one would have chipped in. A bottle opener/ keychain, sure, sounds cool. What I now feel was that Kickstarter was just another sales channel for him, some exposure, a storefront to sell more stuff. If he's selling and delivering them from the website as he's still fulfilling our pledges, that we just bought crap from a store too, we didn't fund a cool project. That is my primary complaint- and I don't know if it's true or not, Adam refuses to address it. Had he said anything- \"no guys, that's not the case\" or \"sorry guys, I goofed on that one\", no big deal. But people are sitting here with no product in hand, bad updates coming sporadically, certain comments here addressed but not others, emails unreturned and the perception that web orders are going out the door before those of us who theoretically made this project possible has left a bad taste in at least this backer.

We compare the Boombot REX to the Jawbone Jambox and the Kickstarter funded Outdoor Technologies Turtle Shell.\n________________________________________________________\nBoombotix at CES '13! Stop by booth 3506 in the iLounge pavilion and check out the Boombot REX speaker firsthand. Sake and Sumo on Tues and Wed at 4PM!\nREX is the next evolution of smart speakers in the ultraportable Boombot collection. A salute to the king of dinosaurs, the REX mimics the thump of the T-Rex\u2019s footsteps as it ruled the land. With revolutionary acoustic and industrial design, a noise-canceling microphone and a built-in clip, the REX allows you to stay connected to your friends and your music, while keeping your phone safely in your pocket. The REX connects to iPods, smartphones, tablets, and laptops using wireless Bluetooth technology. Stream music, change tracks, and answer, end, or deny phone calls on the fly. The REX is built to withstand the demands of an active lifestyle so you can bring music to where you enjoy it most.\nUltraportable engineering that fits in your palm\nThe product originated from carving a clay block to find the ideal shape for the ultraportable speaker. The REX was crafted to fit in the palm of your hand, be clipped onto your backpack, belt, or handlebars and be toted on adventures with ease. The housing is a ruggedized high-impact ABS shell with the circuit board secured to the internal frame in four locations. The unit is certified IP53 water-resistant; don\u2019t hesitate to bring it cycling in rain or on your next snow outing. The REX is powered by a rechargeable medical-grade lithium-ion battery that will keep the tunes booming for 6 hours. The industrial design of the REX encourages you to pick it up, clip it on, and add a soundtrack to your life in motion.\nModern design with unparalleled utility\nAs a companion device to your mobile phone, we sculpted the edges of the REX to compliment your handset as a day-to-day accessory. We chose to build something distinguished that can be discreetly integrated into your outerwear, or showcased as a beacon of modern design. In addition, the REX features fully interchangeable grills and belt clips and will come in limited edition colorways designed by renown artists. Whatever your flavor, we've got you covered.\nUncompromising acoustic performance\nThe sound on the REX is unmatched by any speaker of its size. With dual 36-millimeter full-range drivers and a MASSIVE Bass Woofer, the REX is the smallest 2.1 sound-system in the world. The full dynamic range of the REX is stabilized across all frequencies in the audible spectrum allowing the speaker to reach over 90 dB@2ft. The REX has optimized volumetric calculations that are matched to the driver characteristics ensuring that every square inch helps deliver the richest audio experience possible.  \nHands-free capabilities that empower and protect\nThe REX incorporates a noise cancelling microphone that allows you to answer, deny, or end a phone call with the press of a button. Leave your phone protected in your pocket and change tracks and volume using our custom designed firmware. Do it all with just three buttons. \nDaisy chain with SoundHub technology\nThe Boombot REX features Audio IN and Audio OUT ports for ultimate system scalability. Simply plug in any peripheral speaker system to the Audio Out port on the Boombot REX and the stereo signal will be replicated throughout the entire system. To daisy chain the Boombot REX, simply plug the Audio Out into the Audio In port on the next Boombot REX speaker, and repeat infinitely. The best part of it all? Control any impromptu sound system wirelessly with Bluetooth!\nSiri Integration\nThe REX is the first ultraportable speaker with Siri integration.  Queue a request to Siri with the push of a button and Siri will answer back to you through the speaker. \nWhat we need to bring the REX series to life\nWe've invested in the research, design, and development of the product. We've even invested in the tooling to build this incredible piece, but we need your help to get the first pilot run of the REX to market.  We are looking to Kickstarter to raise at least $27k to fund our first low-volume production run.\nWe are grateful for your support. We're proud to offer our backers with:\n$5 donations Get swagged out with an anodized aluminum dog tag and a die-cut 4-color sticker. The Boombotix name and logo are on one side and \"I'M A BACKER\" is on the other.\n$30 donations will land you a limited-to-100-pieces Kickstarter exclusive Boombotix T-Shirt. Our Boombotix Team T-shirts have never been available to the general public, and never will. Your choice of size (S, M, L, XL).\n$75 donations Backers will receive one of the first pilot run Arctic White REX speakers. You will be in direct contact with our engineering team to provide feedback as we further develop the REX. The quantity will be limited to 300 units, so act quick if you fashion yourself as an early bird. Expect to start hacking on yours in January. Suggested retail of $99.\n$80 donations will receive one of the first production-run pieces of the REX series, in either Electric Blue, Savage Green, or Pitch Black.  You will be amongst the first adopters and the coolest of your friends.\n$100 donations will receive one of the first production-run pieces of the REX series (choice of Pitch Black, Electric Blue or Savage Green) AND a Custom GrillKit (replacement front grill, rear clip, and port covers) in their choice of PURPLE or ORANGE. This backer should be the type willing to take the Boombot REX to the limits of style and customization. Additional die cut decal included. \n$300 donations For this level of support, backers will be treated to a tour of the San Francisco headquarters and dinner at a local establishment in the SF Mission (your choice of Mission Chinese, WeBeSushi, Foreign Cinema, or Beretta). Look forward to a vibrant discussion on product design, entrepreneurship, design thinking and much, much more. In addition, backers at this level will receive and be able to customize the Boombot REX of any color (White, Black, Blue, Green) with any Grill/Clip combination (White, Black, Blue, Green, Purple, Orange). Count on good times and a bike ride through the district.\n$3000 donations will get to work directly with the Boombotix design team in creating a one-of-a-kind limited edition speaker.  You will have full creative direction over colors, patterns, textures, and just about anything you can dream up. \n$5000 donations are for those that really want to get their fingers into the product development experience.  Backers will enjoy an all expense paid trip to our headquarters in San Francisco where they will work hand-in-hand with our engineering and design team to craft their own one-off personalized speaker.  You will also be taking a fresh REX out for an evening of partying with the Boombotix crew and a staged photo-shoot where YOU get to be the creative director.  You\u2019re the BOSS!\nStretch Goal 1 @ $100k\nTHANK YOU Kickstarter for allowing us to continue following our dreams.  Now that you have sweetened the deal for us, we want to give a little something extra back to you.  We made these mini-cube shaped travel chargers that you can use to charge anything via USB including your new Boombot REX or your mobile device.  Each charger features a soft-touch coating and folding plugs so you can stay juiced up wherever you go.  \nThe Story\nBoombotix was founded by Lief Storer and Chris McKleroy - two college friends who met on the ski slopes of Lake Tahoe, with a passion for music, gadgets, and the active outdoor lifestyle. Lief, an optical engineer with a background in fiber optic lighting systems, created the first Boombot ultraportable speaker in 2009. Developed as an alternative to headphones, the Boombot was conceived by combining a Japanese vinyl toy, off-the-shelf speaker internals, and a walkie-talkie clip. Originally developed for a bike ride to work, both founders quickly realized that this product integrated perfectly into their life off the saddle as well. Chris, with a background in marketing and product design, began to sculpt the first Boombot REX prototype in 2011. With support from friends, advisors, and the growing team at Boombotix, the Boombot REX project began to take shape and evolve into the product you see today. \nEngineers + Audiophiles\nOur team has been building ultraportable speakers for years now and we have experienced the pleasure and pain of hardware.  Lief Storer heads the electromechanical design leveraging years of experience developing high-power intelligent fiberoptic lighting systems.  Chris McKleroy was instrumental in the original concept and design of the REX, and continues to be involved with the manufacturing and product management process.  Ben Radler flexes 16GB of RAM lodged in his cerebral cortex to undertake the task of iOS and Ruby development.  Ben is building technology that will expand the potential of the REX with a mobile app that allows audio mesh networking. \nOur crew now consists of seven people crammed into a studio-loft-garage in San Francisco's Mission District.  There is never a silent moment in the office, especially when you have round-the-clock R&D on a speaker system loud enough to fill up the whole room.  At least it sounds amazing because we wouldn't have it any other way. \nEveryone on our team has at least an 18-inch vert. Fact.\nHARDWARE\nPOWER OUTPUT: 3W x 2\nDRIVERS: 36mm x 2\nIMPEDANCE: 4 Ohm\nLOUDNESS: 87dB@2ft\nRUNTIME: 4-8hrs depending on conditions\nBATTERY CAPACITY: 1000mAh\nMICROPHONE FIELD: 60 degrees\nWEATHER RATING: IP53\nWIRELESS RANGE: 25-40ft\nDROP TESTING: Up to 2.5m\nINDICATOR: Tri-color LED\nFIRMWARE / SOFTWARE\nFully customized sound profile\n3-button interface for all commands\nSiri integration\nBluetooth v3.0 +HS\nBattery indicator displays on most mobile devices\nOption to set as favorite device\nFor in in depth acoustic analysis of the Boombot REX, please refer to our Portable Speaker Showdown.  We compare the Boombot REX to the Jawbone Jambox and the Kickstarter funded Outdoor Technologies Turtle Shell. \nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\nFrequency response curves in the audible spectrum show that the Boombot REX has very comparable response accross most frequencies to the Jawbone Jambox. The larger passive radiator of the Jambox offers more bass. With significantly less size and weight.\nSIZE REFERENCE\nWe have spent the last 15 months fine tuning the industrial design and the electromechanical engineering of the Boombot REX in our SF-based live-work-garage-studio loft.  We have been creating speakers for over two years with our trusted contract manufacturer in Shenzhen; we have gained many production efficiencies and learned about a number of production faults to look out for after shipping thousands of Boombot speakers. After six rounds of prototypes, The Boombot REX unit has been tooled and we are currently testing our T1 (first unit off the tool).\nPending the success of our Kickstarter campaign, we will begin production on the first round of units on December 31. We have sourced the materials for the first 3,000 units to be ready for this first production. These units have a 30 day lead time (production time).  We will take an additional 10 days to do a final inspection and QC of all outgoing units.  It will take another 24 days to ship across the Pacific Ocean leaving from Hong Kong and arriving in Oakland, CA. Units will be shipped via USPS ground from the Bay Area once landed.  We use a fulfillment center in Vacaville, CA which has the capacity to ship hundreds of boxes with a 48 hour turnaround. Between production time (30 days), final inspection and QC (10 days), and shipping from Hong Kong to Oakland, CA (30 days), the Boombot REX should be shipping out of our fulfillment center in early March.\nPending success the success of our campaign, beginning January 22nd, we will be able to produce 5,000 units per month with our current factory in order to meet demand. Units will have a 30 day lead time (production time), 10 day quality control/inspection,  and a 24 day shipping transit time. Units will be shipped to backers in order of project funding date. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware is hard. But we love it. As we mentioned, we've swallowed one of the most daunting tasks in product development (tooling), but there are certainly some potential bumps in the road that we're prepared for. \n\nOne of our biggest struggles on this project was power management. We aimed for such a compact form factor that there is limited space for anything. Hitting our target runtime has continued to be a struggle, but we are working on engineering a more efficient amp design. Some of our more recent tests seem much more promising, but there is still a lot of work to be done to deploy this design into production. \n\nThe REX pushes the upper threshold of what the speakers are capable of. There have been a number of improvements with integrated signal filters to alleviate issues with clipping and distortion. Digital music these days is chalked full of a wide variety of quality standards. This has resulted in a daunting variable that makes it difficult to deliver consistent sound quality from inconsistent signal levels. It is something our team would like to continue investing our time in improving, but for now, we'd encourage you to avoid crappy recordings whenever possible. After all, YOU are an audiophile too right? \n\nWe've worked with our ODM in China for several years now, which alleviates a number of risks associated with outsourcing. That's one less problem to worry about. This doesn't mean that we can relax, but we know that our challenge with them is to get them to produce exactly what we spec. Any first run product is more at-risk of falling off of spec, so we have to pay particularly close attention to getting it right the first time around, managing our risk, and ramping up production gradually.

However, with the release of the new lightning jack for the iPhone 5 we found ourselves back at square one... having to remember our charger every time we left home.  Within days of having the iPhone 5 we had no choice but make a new friend - Nomad:  An Apple certified cable that has no home.  \nWhile the aesthetics of the Nomad was important to us, the most critical aspect of our cable design was to make it Apple certified.  We had purchased too many knockoff cables in the past that stop working after a month. Creating a quality cable that would last was a top priority.\n\"This Keychain Lightning Connector Is Perfect for Emergency Charges\" - Mashable\n\"This is going to be a breakthrough product\" - Apple Magazine\n\"This idea is simple but brilliant\" - Tecnabob\n\"The Nomad is a must have!\" - CRNCHY\nThe Nomad is a 3\" Lightning to USB cable that caps securely to your key ring\nThe Nomad loves to nestle between your iPhone and laptop!\nThe Nomad charging from a USB port in a vehicle\nDimensions of the Nomad cable\nDesigning the Nomad in 3D CAD\nPrototyping the Nomad\nThe Nomad is flexible enough to charge from almost any USB port!\nPledge $30 to receive a Nomad plus a custom aluminum bottle opener!\nPotential Packaging Concepts\nUp until now\nWe have established relationships with three different Chinese manufacturers who we see as potential partners in producing the Nomad. One of these manufacturers, a reputable producer of iPhone accessories, provided us with the prototypes that are pictured and filmed throughout our project page.\nOnce funding begins\nWe will closely review quotes from these three overseas manufacturers and finalize our assessment of who will be the best partner in producing the Nomad. We do not want to accept any quotes prior to achieving our goal in the event that we exceed our goal. This would allow us to offer more colors and options!\nOnce successfully funded\nWe will have chosen a manufacturer and will be able to immediately move forward with the tooling of molds - followed by a full production run. The entire production run will either be overseen directly by us or one of our overseas associates we have worked with in the past. From there, each Nomad will be tested, packaged, and sent directly to Chicago where we will box and ship them out to you within days!\nWith a successfully funded project, we will get our first run of Nomads manufactured, packaged, and shipped to your key ring by February 2013.

You can wake up in San Francisco, spend the afternoon in New York, and be back in the West Coast right on time for drinks. Whether you walk or ride around your hometown, drive to another city, or fly to another continent- your trusty bag is always with you. \nUnfortunately bags haven't changed much over time, so they're a little outdated. We designed Phorce to be the ultimate bag for the mobile age. Phorce can hold lots of stuff in its minimalist design. It can power all your devices, even MacBooks! It can communicate with your smartphone. It can transform from a messenger bag into a backpack, or briefcase. And so much more...\nPower your entire life. On the go.  \nSay goodbye to dead batteries.\nCharge all your devices. \nPhorce can charge up to 3 usb-devices simultaneously. Charge smartphones, tablets, iPods, GoPro and other cameras, smart watches, portable speakers, noise-canceling headphones, and thousands of other devices.\nPower your MacBook. \nOn top of charging all your other gear, Phorce for Mac can also power a MacBook for up to 7 extra hours*. So leave that bulky wall charger at home, and enjoy the freedom to work (or play) from anywhere.\nSerious mobile power.  \nThanks to its integrated lightweight battery pack, Phorce is powerful enough to charge an iPhone 5 over 8 times, a Galaxy S3 about 6 times, or an iPad Mini 2.5 times. Phorce has more power than you\u2019ll need, so it\u2019s always there when you need it.\nStretch goals\n1) Free international travel adapter kit. \nIf we reach $250K we will include an international travel adapter kit ($30 value) as a free bonus! The wall charger will include free additional plugs so you can charge your Phorce bag in any country.\n2) More power.\nIf we reach $750K we'll increase battery capacity by 10% - without adding weight - by using battery cells with a very high energy density. You'll have enough power to keep your phone charged for almost 2 weeks without having to plug it into the wall.\nCommunicate with your bag.\nInformation at your fingertips.\nBluetooth & app.\nPhorce connects and communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth. The Phorce app (iOS & Android) shows you exactly how much power your bag has left and what you can do with it. Intuitive graphics display the exact number of times Phorce can still charge your devices, like your phone. You can also ask Phorce to send you notifications, for example a reminder to charge Phorce when its battery's running low.\nLoss prevention.\nDid you forget your bag?\nForever yours.\nLosing your bag means losing a lot of valuable possessions: your laptop, tablet, keys, money, your personal files & documents, and -of course- your bag. Whether you forget your bag when rushing out the door in the morning, leaving a restaurant or coffee shop, getting off a plane, metro, or train, or out of a taxi - you\u2019ll receive a notification on your phone as soon as Phorce is outside of your range, so you can quickly run back and rescue it from the evil clutches of your arch nemesis.\nTransform.\n3 bags. As easy as 1-2-3.\nMessenger. Backpack. Briefcase.\nWhat we bring, where we go, how we get there, and what we do once we get there varies from day to day. Phorce can adjust itself to your needs, thanks to its unique construction and strap system. Phorce can transform from a messenger bag, to a backpack, or briefcase in a matter of seconds, so you can carry it however you want to. Transforming Phorce requires no additional components, and can be done on the go, in a matter of seconds.\nFull 360-degree expansion.\nNeed to bring a lot of stuff? Phorce has a 360-degree expansion zipper you can quickly create over 240 cubic inches (4000 cm3) of extra space. Why choose between a compact bag and one that holds a lot of stuff, when you can have both?\nTravel superstar.\nA frequent flyer\u2019s best friend.\nEnjoy the journey.\nPhorce makes traveling more enjoyable. An especially-designed opening on its back allows you to slide Phorce over the telescopic handles of your trolley, so you can enjoy hands- and shouldersfree travel. Phorce also has a direct-access laptop pocket to quickly remove and insert your MacBook or laptop, making security checks less of a hassle. Keep your phone charged for over a week without bringing a wall charger or travel adapter. With mobile power for all your devices, multiple carrying modes, and expandability, Phorce is a traveler\u2019s best friend.\nAdvanced materials.\nClean. Organized. Safe. Dry.\nOrganized.\nWith its cable management system and dedicated pockets for all your devices, Phorce keeps your gear organized. Its A4-sized front pocket and spacious main compartment are perfect for bringing along paper, pens, magazines, books, water bottles, and lots of other stuff.\nComfortable. \nMagnetic black suede handles, rich padding for your shoulders & back, and anti-slip shoulder straps make Phorce very comfortable to carry - even for long periods of time.\nProtect your gear.\nPhorce is constructed out of a durable, water-resistant, custom-coated fabric, and features waterproof zippers to keep your gear dry. Impact-resistant padding protects your devices against shocks and bumps.\nNo more fingerprints.\nPhorce\u2019s laptop compartment, tablet, and smartphone pockets are lined with a special fabric that automatically cleans your devices. It\u2019s also very smooth, making it easy to insert or remove your devices. That means hassle-free device access, and fingerprint-free displays.\nLight and compact.\nComfortable & Dynamic.\nEngineered for comfort.\nDespite all its features and technology, Phorce's weight is comparable to other premium bags at just 3.7 lbs (1.7 kg). This means Phorce is light enough to comfortably carry around all day.\nDesigned for movement.\nPhorce\u2019s minimalist design allows it to be very compact while offering maximal internal storage space. Its compact form factor makes it easy to move around in crowds and tight spaces. This makes it ideal for airports, metros, shops, and crowded sidewalks.\nTech Specs.\nPhorce for USB. Phorce for Mac.\nPhorce for USB or Phorce for Mac?\nPhorce comes in 2 versions: Phorce for USB and Phorce for Mac. Both bags have the complete Phorce feature set, wireless technology, and the same powerful lightweight battery. However, while Phorce for USB can charge phones, tablets, cameras, and thousands of other USB-devices on the go, Phorce for Mac can also power MacBooks.\nPhorce for USB is great for tablet users and Windows laptop users, or for MacBook users who don't need extra power for their MacBooks. It keeps all your other devices charged and fits most Windows laptops up to 14-inches, such as the 14-inch HP Envy, and all MacBooks up to the 15-inch MacBook Pro. Phorce for Mac is great for MacBook users who -besides keeping all their other gear charged- would like to be able to use their MacBooks for hours longer without plugging into the wall.\nColors.\nPhorce comes in 4 colors: black, red, dark green, and 'voter's choice' which you'll get to vote on as a backer. You'll have 4 great colors to choose from.\nAbout us.\nHello world.\nWe\u2019re experienced at getting new products to market, and we're thankful to have a great team of mentors and advisors that we continue to learn from. Together we have all the bases covered, from product development, to design for manufacturing, production, supply chain management, quality control, and logistics.\nMarijn Berk.\nMarijn has a background in consumer electronics, nanotechnology, and portable power. His previous company made solar chargers that enabled off-grid consumers in the developing world to charge their mobile phones, resulting in iF and Reddot design awards. Marijn was also awarded a Global Scholarship by the Kauffman Foundation, enabling him to take classes at Harvard, Stanford, and MIT, and check out Silicon Valley. In 2011 Marijn was named Dutch young entrepreneur of the year by Sprout magazine. Marijn is a speaker at various events (TEDx, Entrepreneur\u2019s Organization, etc.) and a Startup Chile alumni. He is passionate about portable & clean energy, and making mobile devices truly mobile. Marijn loves to travel- he once visited 6 developing countries in a single 2 week trip, bringing nothing but a phone, wallet, and passport. Yes, and pants too.\nJames Jeffrey.\nJames has designed and shipped bags for over 10 years for major bag brands like Knomo and Crumpler. This even placed him in Vietnam for 3 years as head of design- working closely with factories to have his team\u2019s designs made and shipped. James is a brand new father, and a running enthusiast, having just completed a 50K run for charity. Once on a Phorce company trip, James managed to break 5 bathroom wall tiles with his head. In one blow. He went KO, walked it off, and got right back to work. Nothing can stop these guys from getting this awesome product in your hands - not even a minor concussion.\nTeam Phorce.\nFinally, we have a great team of partners and mentors that have set up factories all over the world, and have developed, manufactured, and shipped bags, performance sports shoes, portable batteries, apparel, and nanotech solar panels. \nProduction planning.\nGetting Phorce built: a detailed outline.\nHere's a detailed outline of our actual production planning. \nDecember 2012: Select partners.\n- Final selection of manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers: We're working with a great bag maker, Mr. Ahn Duc and his team at MK IMAX. James and him used to work together for an Australian bag brand and have known each other for years. We're also talking to many other manufacturers, suppliers, and logistics providers. This decision depends on the number of bags we end up making. We are talking to people that focus on low/mid volume orders of high-quality products, to ensure that every Phorce bag is made with the utmost care and attention.\n- The world ends.\nJanuary 2013: Design For Manufacturing (DFM).\n- Take the final steps to get the Phorce bag and integrated electronics ready for production. \n- Finalize smartphone app.\nFebruary 2013: Final testing & Moulds.\n- Extensive pre-production testing of electronics & app to ensure perfection.\n- Order materials & components.\n- Make injection moulds. These are used to make a strong protective housing for Phorce's electronics.\nMarch & April 2013: Make & Ship.\n- Start production run (the production run takes around 60 days)\n- Product certifications (CE, RoHS, etc.). We want Phorce to be tough, durable, and environmentally friendly.\n- Final assembly and quality control.\n- Ship.\nMay 2013: Delivery.\n- Phorce is delivered to customers.  \n- Smartphone app available in Android & iOS app store.\n- Time for you to download the app and unbox your Phorce bag! \nMay 2013 - Eternity: You're awesome!\nWe really appreciate your support, and we'll always be grateful for enabling us to bring Phorce into the world. We hope you'll enjoy your new Phorce bag, wherever life may take you next.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGetting a product made and shipped is fun & exciting, and we can't wait to share this experience with you.

The TGT 2.0 adds a pocket made of fine Italian leather.\nNothing should be bigger or more complicated than it has to be, which is why I first designed the TGT wallet in 2008. It fits smartly anywhere, and does not add unnecessary bulk to your jeans or your bag. \nREASONS TO SUPPORT: \nUsing a TGT makes your pants fit better. \nA TGT is easy to find in your bag or purse.\nIt's small in your pocket, and it's only as big as you need it to be.\nYou can throw your phone in it to consolidate your pocket.\nCards are easy in, easy out.  \nTo respect the silhouette of the butt. \nChristmas shopping. Done.\nEasy mailing.  Easy gifting.\nYou can jump in at $16!\nIt's hard to make your wallet stand out, but a TGT stands out.\nIt's so versatile, use your imagination to decide how you'll use it!\nThey come in cute individual TGT packages perfect for gifting.  \nLook at how invisibly it fits into a back pocket.\nSmart phone, meet smart wallet. \nThe RPJ 1.0, featured below.\nThe RPJ 2.0.\nLimited Edition Stone 2.0\nStone 2.0 with black leather.\nLimited Edition Stone 2.0\nLimited Edition RPJ 2.0\nTHE PLAN\nThe funds raised through this project will be used to produce the TGT wallet line, which includes ten different wallet styles, and uses seven different elastic patterns.  It will help with the costs associated with a large scale production run, including ordering the necessary supplies.\nI am working with two different factories through a process of sampling and manufacturing in order to get the exact elastic I need, and am continuing my work with leather tanneries, die cut packaging providers, and label makers to order the supplies.\nI have honed the process of making these wallets for several years: sewing them, designing the logo, and creating packaging and labels, so the process of making a TGT wallet has been streamlined. \nTo prepare for a large order, I have enlisted the help of a sewing house in New York City that has agreed to help prepare TGT wallets in time for the holidays.  They have been helping fashion designers deliver heavily demanded products for years, so I'm happy to have them on my team.  \nMAKING THE TGT\nSewing is serious.\nAfter making countless wallets by hand in my living room, this production run will finally allow me to get TGT on the shelves of your favorite boutiques and stores. I am so grateful for the opportunity to share this with the Kickstarter community! \nA huge thank you to Waylon Thornton for the use of his song \"Favorite Secrets\"!\nThis graph below is provided by CanHeKickIt. \n\nhttp://canhekick.it/projects/jacksutter/tgt-tight-a-new-kind-of-wallet", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges of the TGT Kickstarter will be getting the word out, and convincing Kickstarters to participate. There are so many amazing projects out there, it is going to be hard to get the attention I need to make this Kickstarter successful. To reach as many people as possible, I am asking friends, families, and various blogs to help me spread the word.\n\nOnce the funding is in place, my challenge will be producing a very large quantity of wallets, and making sure all the partners I'm working with maintain my quality standards. Depending on outside help is difficult, but I have been dealing with the companies I'm working with for months and establishing a solid communication base that has given me a lot of confidence in them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "FOR YOU, TGT's BFF", "update_content": "I hope everyone is having a great holiday season!\nWe have been working around the clock to deliver these wallets to your mailboxes before the 25th.

Yet the idea still remains relatively unknown to the average person.\nTo us, this is kind of a shame, sort of like being unaware of the existence of books or music. Lucid Dreaming can be one of the most profound things you can experience in this life - but explaining it to someone who has never done it can be a bit difficult. It is so visceral and hard to put into words that it can rarely be related in a meaningful way to a non-lucid dreamer. Conversely, when a lucid dreamer meets another lucid dreamer comin' through the rye, general excitement and lots of note-comparing ensues. It almost feels like a secret club. We want you to be in that club, too. \nGreat, but why would I want to do it?\nThis is an easy one. You saw in our video some of the more creative applications of Lucid Dreaming. Sure, you can perform any feat from the sublime to the superhuman. But the potential benefits of lucid dreaming are truly limitless. Flying through the galaxy riding a giant kitten might not be your thing, but what about having a roundtable discussion with your ego and id? Maybe you can finally get over your fear of public speaking in the safety of your own dreams. What about trying to write a short story, or compose a melody? Paul McCartney and Mary Shelley, among others, might have a lot to say about harnessing the creative power of dreams. Build skyscrapers in your mind, attack unsolved mathematical problems, or just try and figure out what happened at the end of Lost. Lucid dreaming is a path, a journey - what lies at the end of the path, magnificent or mundane, is your call.\nOk, but why Remee?\nThere's a lot more to Lucid Dreaming than simply acknowledging that it's real and crossing your fingers. It's tough! Your body has a been dreaming one way for your entire life, so teaching it to dream a new way requires some effort. Dozens of websites have cropped up where lucid dreamers, novice and expert alike, flock to swap stories and tips. Some of these techniques include Reality Checks - a quick \"lucid test\" that requires forming simple habits during waking life that you then perform during dreams. Other methods, like WILD (Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming) involve taking a very active role in the process of falling asleep, which can lead to entering directly into a dream from wakefulness. Remee aims to make all of this a lot easier by providing recognizable external input into your dreams. You may find that you don't have to remember to ask \"am I dreaming?\" and count your fingers - with its customizable light patterns, Remee is doing the reminding for you. You may find yourself sitting at an outdoor bistro with Ellen Page and suddenly a soft pattern of red lights appears in your field of vision. Back and forth. Back and forth. \"That looks familiar.\" you think. Wait. Remee! That's Remee! I'm dreaming! This is a dream! \nBoom. Congratulations. You're lucid. With luck, and a little help from Remee, you can stay that way!\nHere's some great info for people new to the concept:\nWNYC's Radiolab - We've been listening to Radiolab for ages, so we thought it was great when they recently released a short about someone using lucid dreaming to overcome a recurring nightmare.  The podcast has a great overview of lucid dreaming and is as usual well produced and entertaining.\n/r/LucidDreaming - Reddit's active, knowledgeable, helpful Lucid Dreaming community. 25,000 dreamers strong and growing!\nLucidipedia - A veritable treasure trove of information about the practice of lucid dreaming. Tips, tricks, & techniques.\nExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming by Stephen LaBerge - from the father of all modern advancements in lucid dreaming research, and the creator of several useful lucid techniques, comes this, the Lucid Dreamer's bible.\nSo how does it work?\nSleep stages are divided into two main categories: non-REM sleep and REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, where dreams typically occur.  Over the course of the night a sleeper will cycle through the five stages of sleep a number of times with the REM stages lasting longer and longer towards morning. \nIn default mode, Remee targets these long chunks of REM sleep towards the end of the sleep period. Before bed, turn Remee on, fine tune the brightness of the lights (if needed) and then go to sleep.  Remee will wait for an initial long delay, usually 4-5 hours, until you're in the heart of the heavy REM stages, before initializing light patterns.  After the initial long delay Remee will display light patterns for 15-20 seconds with a second shorter delay, default at 15 minutes, between each signal.  During non-REM sleep the lights are unlikely to effect you, but if you're in REM sleep the lights will bleed into your dreams, presenting a perfect chance to become lucid.\nWhy six lights and why red?\nWe spent a lot of time making sure that Remee's lights were configured in such a way that it would work well for all face shapes and head sizes. Six lights creates a much larger effective signal area so that even if the mask shifts during sleep you'll still most likely have at least a few lights over your eyes.  Even cooler, by having six lights we make it possible to create much more unique signals that can strobe, sweep and blink in ways that are not only recognizable, but that stimulate your visual field in a more tangible way.  In addition,  red light penetrates skin much more readily than other wavelengths.  Remember when you were a kid and you put a flashlight in your mouth to make your cheeks glow red? That happens because red light is able to pass through your skin, and in the case of Remee, your eyelids, much more easily.  On a side note, red LEDs also use much less power than other colors so we were able to keep you from strapping a 9v battery to your head.\nCustomizable, you say?\nYou bet. You'll be able to edit the standard full night sleep long delay and short delay, as well as setting both the short and long delay for nap mode.  Nap mode lets you trigger signals after a delay as short as 15 minutes - perfect for a quick lucid siesta. This is also great for the Wake-Back-to-Bed technique, which veteran oneironauts can attest is one of the best methods for lucid dreaming. In addition to setting Remee's timing, you'll be able to select from a variety of unique signal patterns and also modify the brightness to suit your paper thin or ogre thick eyelids.\nI own a soldering iron, give me specs!\nCongratulations, you're probably into tinkering and hacking just like we are, and most likely you want to know the skinny on Remee's guts. Remee is built around an atmega168 running on the internal oscillator.  Which means its fully compatible with the Arduino IDE.  If you're inclined, you'll be able to load whatever code you like on Remee and we'll be sure to create a tutorial to show you how. We are working on a simple way to hook an ISP to the board with no soldering or messy wires too. The light sensor bit-banging is pretty cool and we can't wait to share that with the world with a forthcoming tutorial, including part numbers and settings so you can use it in your own projects.  We will update as things move along.\nRewards\n$5 Reward: Remee wooden coin, laser cut by us in Brooklyn.\n$15 Reward: Remee dream journal printed on 100% recycled paper.

EWOLD is such an amazing book which will radically inform anyone interested on dreams, not just on lucid dreaming, but on dream research in general. Since Laberge's time at Standford there have been some interesting developments in dream research, in trying to understand non-rem dreams, the relationship between cortical activation and dreaming as opposed to just rem as an indicator, and things of this nature, but there really hasn't been a tremendous amount of lucid dream research such as that which was done by Laberge. The EWOLD book still represents the largest collection of information on the subject to date. As I understand it, the book you mention was boiled down for people who just want the techniques.

The point is that your brain never experiences a phenomena such as sudden faint red dots blinking through your line of vision seemingly out of thin air. Its almost sci-fi robot overlord esque no?

Other funding money will go towards new packaging. And all the extra money will go towards research and development of Estylo 2.0.\nFeatures:\n* Great for drawing, sketching, writing, playing games, reading ebooks or navigating the web.\n* Magnetically attaches to the iPad 2.\n* Ergonomic design that adapts to the natural grip of the hand.\n* The front tip works between 5 to 70 degrees.\n* Dual tip stylus. The back tip is perfect for more detailed work.\n* No extra pressure is needed for the tips to function.\nEstylo 1.1 works on: all generations of iPad, iPhone and iPod touch.

The Estylo itself came with the old packaging, the packaging was squished and deformed, probably form the trip. The package was posted June 5th so that makes it 23 days for it to get here. The Estylo look and feels very organic. The broader tip has some sort of rubberized coating on it, if look from the side it seems to be a 2 layer set up. I'm guessing the \"revised\" version is just the old version with a thicker coating of the capacitive rubber. The only problem I have with mine is that the topmost layer seems very brittle and it arrived with a hairline crack, witch seems to be getting bigger. The body itself is pretty comfortable to grip, one of its 4 sides is rounded so it work be uncomfortable when holding it. The thinner side of the Estylo is little harder to get it to work how you want it, and it makes a very loud \"clicking\" sound when drawing/writing. The Estylo has I'm, guessing here, 3 magnets inside the body. But in mine one seems to be upside down, so that end of the Estylo repels the smart cover, thus leaving the Estylo stuck at a 35% angle. Overall I'd give it a 77 out of 100.

It really does work perfectly for me....no skipping whatsoever, unless I am lying down or in an odd position, which is often the case for other stylus's as well. There is an obvious \"sweet spot\" but once found, its an awesome stylus. Still working on doing a better video. I think it must have to do with the way people are comfortable writing. I know I sell hand made fountain pens, and some people just can not write with them due to the angle they hold them at and then think the pen is crap and doesn't work. I see no other explanation, unless they are not all made equally, which seems odd to me. The apps I use are Artrage, SketchTime, Procreate and now Paper53, and Penultimate for note taking and the Estlyo works perfectly in every one, for drawing and note taking. And I don't draw or write slowly, I sketch and write, just as I would with a pencil or pen., I feel bad for those who are unhappy with it, but I am very happy with mine and would love a few more only because the temptation is there for me to put it in my mouth, and eventually i think it is going to get pretty rough looking. I feel like the 25 I paid to back it might be a bit high compared to the Adonit Jot for example, that has a lot more to it, but the I feel the price of the eight dollar backing was extremely reasonable. as for how it is finished, flat paint on the surface with a gloss on the ends, that works for me too. i have to laugh at some of the comments though and wonder if people read what it is they are buying. Someone said, \"it is noisy , could you make it so it doesn't click\" its a wooden stylus and your iPad is glass, wood/glass, how is this not going to make a noise? if you want it not to make a noise, buy a rubber stylus. jeez, or, \"its too light\", well pick up a pencil......I understand that some people are frustrated and agree that the shipping time was crazy, and also some have not yet received, but I feel the product is exactly what Plai said it would be.

YAY!!! right after i changed my color to black they emailed me immediately and I got it a few days later!!! thank you!!!", "time": "about 9 years ago"}, {"username": "Garza Dave", "content": "Got my Estylo Monday in the mail. I have tested it from then on (since I use it to take notes on my iPad with Noteshelf for all my classes). I'm very expirenced with using styluses to write notes on my iPad; I currently own both the oStylus and the new oStylus Dot which has not been released to the general public. I bought the Estylo because it resembles the shape of a pencil, it's wood, and it's magnetically attachable (which is very convenient and I have not see any other stylus use this idea). To being with I would like to make it clear that the Estylo DOES WORK. For me there was no learning curve. I have fount that the issue with the Estylo is that the hump and curvyness of both ends is what makes it unresponsive at times. As to be able to get the iPad to recognize a stylus it must be touching the screen a certain amount, but the Estylo's hump and curvyness make it so that at some angles it becomes unresponsive. What I mean by angels is not the angle you choose to use it at but the slight tilt to the side, one naturally may do when writing in a quick manner. As the will mean that the Estylo is not centered and will not be recognized. This is very annoying specially if you need to write notes quickly as I do, as a university student. This makes the Estylo more for drawing than note taking. And I believe it shouldn't be this way specially since its supposed to be like a pencil which can be used for both. I have also found little difference in precision between both ends. For most this will not be the case because you can see where your writing with the narrow end; however, the contact surface area is roughly the same. I have tried note taking with both ends however the narrow end has a much more fixed angle than the wider end. The angle at the narrow end is not optimal for note taking for me at least so I don't happen to use it much. The wide end on the other hand is a bit too wide and like I said before a bit too curved. I know Plai did this so that there was a grater spectrum of angles the Estylo could be used at. However, this was at the cost of ensured surface contact area making it so that you have to be centered at all times while using the Estylo. Now as for quality, I find that it's pretty low, Plai should have put a clear coat over the pain as some of it has scrapped off not on the ends used to write but on the sides. The magnets tho do hold it well, I leave it attached to my iPad in my backpack. The weight is okay. Over all I think it's pretty good for the first try. Obviously though I don't plan on using it as my everyday note taking stylus, for that I use my oStylus Dot which I modified by adding four magnets to so that I can attach it to the side of my iPad. So overal the Estylo is not exactly what I expected specially due to the vast amount of time it took to get it. And also that the Estylo is not the ideal stylus for either note takers or artist, it's more just of a play thing at the moment unfortunately.

People loved it so much they instantly demanded that I produce them. As I was already engaged in developing the full color version of the deck I put off the notion until after all the artwork had been completed.\n\nNow that the original concept is being printed, I can go ahead and approach doing these black and white versions. I recently ran a poll to figure out which deck people liked of the two variations: (white with more grid like structure, or black with more depth). To my surprise, I got an overwhelming response to make both! So here they are :)\nWhat will you do with extra funds?\nAny extra funds received will be used to buy uncut sheets of the deck to give to pledges and to create merchandise to commemorate the launch of the deck. Also if enough money is raised, it will be used for professional photography, national advertisements and a video trailer.\nHow will you notify us of your progress?\nThere will be regular updates with design changes, new designs for face cards, custom artwork displays, and time-lapsed videos cataloging the creation. They will be posted in the updates section, as well as a bi-weekly progress email.\nLEGAL: BICYCLE, BICYCLE and Design, BICYCLE Logo and associated marks, logos, designs and finishes are trademarks of The United States Playing Card Company.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Latest project update from Lance T.

He quickly attains fame and climbs the ladder of Casinos to become the city's leading act. He combines his unique style of magic with the sword work he learned from a wandering desert warrior on his travels to the city.

The wallet part is actually a little tough to open, but I think that it will loosen up a little over time and I'd rather it was a little tight rather than pop open at the wrong time.
