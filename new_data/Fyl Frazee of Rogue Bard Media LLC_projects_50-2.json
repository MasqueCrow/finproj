Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons: Stories players dive deeper into the lore of Aughmoore. \nThe Stories expansion introduces a new Story Mode that has Heroes completing Side Quests and adventuring deeper into the dungeon, descending Multiple Floors and eventually fighting multiple Dungeons Bosses at once!\nIn addition, Stories offers a slew of new Heroes, Loot, Dungeon Rooms, Dungeon Bosses, Minions, and Goblins! \nThe Stories expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Dungeons.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

It is time to take him to the NEXT LEVEL with his very own FEATURE HORROR/COMEDY \"ONYX THE FORTUITOUS AND THE TALISMAN OF SOULS.\" \nOnyx is the brainchild of writer and performer Andrew Bowser. Through an ongoing series of viral videos spanning nearly 9 years, Onyx has permeated every corner of pop culture. The character has amassed over 300 million views online and his content has been shared by numerous celebrities and referenced in multiple hit songs. \nAs a director, Bowser has helmed numerous independent films that have had premieres at SXSW, Seattle International, and Chattanooga Film Festival. He has worked with Legendary Pictures, Warner Bros. Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Funny or Die, Chrysler, and Marvel. He has also directed horror mainstays like Barbara Crampton, Bruce Campbell, and Adrienne Barbeau. \nThis film is the culmination of Bowser's abilities as a director and Onyx's potential as a resonating comedic character. \nTHE TALISMAN OF SOULS is a horror/comedy in the vein of 80's favorites like GREMLINS and FRIGHT NIGHT. It's a throwback to an era when horror movies were equal parts absurdity and humanity. \nPoster art by Lukas Ketner\nThe story follows fledgling Satanist Marcus J. Trillbury (Onyx) as he attends a once-in-a-lifetime ritual at his idol BARTOK THE GREAT'S dark mansion. Once there, Marcus meets a group of other worshippers. As the group is led by Bartok and his assistant Farrah in a series of rituals meant to \"better them,\" it becomes clear that their intentions are more nefarious. As his new friends are losing the battle to keep their souls, a question of great destiny looms over Onyx's head: is he doomed to be a nobody or is he the only one who can defeat Bartok and save his friends from damnation?\nInspiration for \"Talisman of Souls\"\nTHE VISION BEHIND THE FILM \n ---NEW \"FILM ONLY\" REWARDS! ---\nFULL REWARDS BREAKDOWN!\nCAMPAIGN PRODUCTION CREDITS : \nMAIN TITLE DESIGN BY JUSTIN CROWELL\nMAIN TITLE THEME BY ROB AMJARV\nMAIN TITLE SOUND DESIGN BY MIKE JAMES GALLAGHER\nTITLE HEADER ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHEY EPSEJO\nThrough his many years creating content in this industry, Bowser has amassed an amazingly talented team to surround him and Onyx on this project.\nDAN ADLERSTEIN/DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY\nDan is an LA based DP who works on a wide variety of projects in television, commercials, narrative, documentary, and digital content.\nHe has worked extensively in TV, shooting for HBO, CBS, Netflix, Amazon, HULU, AppleTV, and more.  His commercial work includes campaigns for Old Spice, Kahlua, Zappos, Fox Sports, as well as many other brands. His narrative work has been featured in festivals worldwide, including Sundance and Cannes.\nDan is an alumn of Wesleyan University where he majored in Film Studies, focusing mostly on film history and theory.  He went on to earn an MFA in Cinematography at the AFI Conservatory.\nDan is a member of IATSE Local 600 and on the Industry Experience Roster as a Director of Photography. He recently shot the Netflix show \"Aunty Donna's Big Ole' House of Fun\" and Bowser's short \"Little Willy.\"\nSTUDIO ADI/SPECIAL EFFECTS\nSTUDIO ADI is a group Academy Award winning creators of special characters and character effects. Calling upon a diverse range of talents and techniques, they create prosthetic make-ups, animatronic puppets, actor duplicates, and replica animals. With over twenty-five years of professional experience, they bring \"real\" character effects to the set to interact with actors, lighting, and practical atmosphere. Studio ADI prides themselves on working with the industry's leading CGI companies to find the right balance of digital and practical effects.  They continue to provide filmmakers with realistic and economical character effects that best serve the story and the production. Their credits include films such as IT, Godzilla VS. Kong, The Predator, and The Nun.\nMATT MAHAFFEY/COMPOSER\nMatt Mahaffey is a self-described quirky musician. After having niche success with a rock band, he found out - much like Mothersbaugh and Elfman - that his ideas fit better over the course of 11-75 minutes of picture than it did in a 3-minute pop song. The Shrek universe was his first job in film/tv and it was the gift that kept on giving.  He started a composer collective with his wife, creating scores for dozens of television shows over the last decade, including \"Rise of the Ninja Turtles.\"\nHe's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including doing 3 years on the road with Beck and writing and performing on his Grammy-award winning album Morning Phase. He also received Gold Sales Awards for Keith Urban\u2019s Fuse and Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Lasers, among others, and Platinum Sales Awards for Vitamin C and HelloGoodbye. Matt also scored \"Little Willy\" and Bowser grew up idolizing his work in the band Self.\nMIKE JAMES GALLAGHER/SOUND DESIGNER\nMike James Gallagher is a sound designer and re-recording mixer currently living and working in Los Angeles. As a sound designer he has worked for clients like Netflix, Hulu, Marvel, Lagavulin, Pro Sound Effects, Crypt TV, and Nerdist, among others. His work has also been featured in numerous festivals including Sundance and Edinburgh International. In 2018 he created the popular sound-oriented YouTube channel INDEPTH Sound Design (https://www.youtube.com/indepthsounddesign).\nMike met Bowser at Comic Con 10 years ago and they've been collaborating ever since on projects including Monster Machine, Worm, and Little Willy. He also enjoys writing about sound for picture, most recently writing the episode \"Storytelling with Cinematic Sound Design\" for the popular YouTube channel Film Riot. Some of his latest sound design work is featured in the Netflix series, Song Exploder, which was adapted from the acclaimed podcast of the same name.\nBOWSER'S DIRECTING REEL\nLITTLE WILLY (SHORT FILM)\nTHRILL ME!

So, we are coming directly to you, the passionate Steven Universe fans out there!\nBacking Steven Universe: Beach-a-Palooza Card Battling Game on Kickstarter is the ONLY way to get it . . . the game is a KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE.

But it\u2019s not going to be easy: Party Crashers\u2014Corrupted and Homeworld Gems\u2014want to ruin your amazing performance. It\u2019s Beach City\u2019s event of the year and you\u2019re on center stage. Play your cards right and your band might be the big winner!\nWe expect the game to start shipping at the end of 2020 or in early 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., no customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU/UK, Australia, and New Zealand.\nShipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two games (\u201cDouble Up\u201d Tier) costs the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\nDue to COVID-19, all schedules need to be considered somewhat tentative this year, as there have been and will continue to be unexpected delays worldwide. However, we do have a planned timeline for getting you your games, barring disruptions: \n August: go to print\n Mid-/late-October: ships leave port with games\n Thanksgiving weekend: ships arrive at destination ports for distribution\n December 2020-early 2021: fulfillment\nCheck out the Steven Universe: Beach-a-Palooza Giveaway!

The Mission is complete.... all the goals and then some!  We love you chummers.... thanks for an amazing campaign! \nIn Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops, players lead a team of shadowrunners gunning for the big score! \nAlong the way they\u2019ll have the chance to hire more seasoned runners, outfit their team with cutting-edge technology\u2014from the latest weapons to cyberware enhancements\u2014and take on increasingly dangerous contracts on the mean streets of the Seattle Metroplex.\nEach payout increases your chances for a more lethal combination of gear, training, and skill. All leading to that final score as you take on one of the world\u2019s megacorporations. But you\u2019ve got to hit it before another team steals your ticket to the big time\u2014hold off too long to grab that ring, and you\u2019ll lose it all!\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops is a competitive board game for 2-4 players that combines worker-placement with push-your-luck dice-rolling mayhem.\nThis game is chromed up and ready to rock! It has everything you need to run the Seattle streets, from a sleek board to custom dice to art work that brings you into one of the greatest settings in gaming history!\n\nThe year is 2080, and the world has only gotten meaner. Magic came back into the world nearly seventy years earlier, bringing orks, elves, trolls, dwarfs, dragons, and all kinds of spells and magical critters. Dragons and megacorporations alike gather their hoards, uncaring of who they stomp on to amass their treasure. Government power has faded as the corps wrap international economies around their bejeweled fingers. Most people survive by selling their souls to the megacorps, slaving away for their entire lives to stay safe and fed.  \n\nSome people, though, aren\u2019t willing to sell out. They don\u2019t fit into the mold the corporations have prepared for them. They live in the cracks and margins of society\u2014in the shadows. To survive, they do the things others won\u2019t, performing the grey ops the megacorps need in order to keep up with the competition.  \n\nYou are one of them. You are a shadowrunner. You may make your way by slinging spells, swinging swords, firing bullets, or hacking the Matrix. You have to be a step faster and a hair smarter than everyone else if you want to keep working, and you need to keep your wits about you if you want to stay alive. There are plenty of obstacles out there: corp security officers, ultra-violent gangers, vicious critters, and people who carry two hundred bullets and an equal number of grudges. To stay alive, you trust yourself, you trust your team, and you remember a few simple pieces of advice:  Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever cut a deal with a dragon.\n If you want to see the components in more detail, check further down the page and also watch our micro videos! \nCheck this out! \nWe've got some wiz options for you. When you're a more seasoned runner you know that working together is sometimes the best strategy!  Exclusive to Kickstarter is the Co-operative Conversion Kit! \nThis bad boy comes with its own board mods, new decks of cards, and a whole new subset of rules and missions for you and your omaes to work together instead of against each other to win the big score! \nWhat do you get with your cooperative expansion?\n\n1 Megacorp Bi-fold Sideboard 508mm x 152mm \nCooperative Rulebook \n20+ Playing Cards + Final Missions\n60+ Tokens\nWhat does Exclusive mean? \nThis expansion makes Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops go from a competitive game to a fully cooperative game. That's right, it's like TWO games in ONE!   This is an exclusive product only, which means it will only be available here on Kickstarter, through the pledge manager and through Catalyst or Lynnvander directly and/or at a variety of conventions while supplies last.  This is a limited print product. \nWe've got a cooperative video for you down below after the play-through video and micro-videos! Enjoy. \n What do you get with your 5-6 player expansion?  \n52+ Cards including 10 New Missions. \n2 Player Boards\n8 New Player Standees with Bases. \nRules Insert\nNew Tokens and Additional Nuyen\nBoth expansions will come with their own boxes and inserts. \n\nMORE to come...\n METAL DICE  \nAircraft aluminum dice are Superior in quality and will outlast any run no matter how crazy. These dice will be anodized in color to match the standard dice you'd get in the board game. We've broken these dice down to a few categories and we'll explain them here and on the main page for you.\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\n You can choose from;  \nA set of 6 of any ONE kind of die. i.e. 6 X Street Samurai is considered one add-on. \nAn RPG set is 6 of EACH kind of die. Street Samurai, Decker, Face, Mage and Rigger.  These are perfect for the role-playing books and other product that can use these dice. Of course you could use them in your board game but that's what the next level is for.... \nThe UPGRADE set simple matches the dice in your board game. Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops has 36 dice in the game. This upgrade just gives you the same denomination of dice only anodized aircraft aluminium.\nYou can also add more standard dice to your collection. Either a package of 6 dice of any ONE kind OR a package of 30 for the RPG lover in you.\n METAL NUYEN TOKENS  \nWHAT!!!!? Shut the Drek up!\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\nThat's right. Full metal nuyen coins. These coins are perfect to upgrade and pimp out your Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops, Shadowrun: Crossfire or Shadowrun ANYTHING games. 40 amazing metal nuyen coins will be broken down as follows;  \n20 x 1's \n8 x 3's \n12 x 5's \n You can add as many sets as you wish! They are just amazing to have all around, especially with the Mr. Johnson level bonus super sized Nuyen Coin!\nNot exactly as shown - Digital Mock Up\n Become a Runner \nWe've got a wonderful series of limited pledge levels.  Here's the legal side off that pledge level.\n\nTHE STREETS  \nBecoming an official character is one of the sweetest deals we could possibly offer a fan of the Shadowrun Universe. It comes with a few necessary caveats, however. Please review the process and the necessary legal mumbo-jumbo: \n\nProcess: You will be required to provide a photo of yourself, as well as a street name, catch phrase and archetype/racial preference. Artists will do their best to incorporate you into our standard style guide for the archetype and race you select, and Catalyst gets the last word on art direction as well as acceptable character names and flavor text. [Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.]\n\n[Sorry, no Runner McRunnerface, and no graphic language\u2026 :) we watch the internet too, you know.] \n\nLegaleze: In order to make you over into a Shadowrun character, and for this character to become part of the Shadowrun universe, you will need to sign a release form that authorizes us to oversee creative direction and to use the final art and information. This release will also assign the copyright of the work to the Topps Company (the owners of the Shadowrun IP). Topps will own the creative work you are helping us create based on your likeness.  \nSince Catalyst Game Labs is a major supplier to distribution and local gaming stores, we want to make sure you are part of this Kickstarter's equation.  \nWho - For any and all retailers, local gaming stores, convention vendors and more. Must have a valid business license and accounts with reputable distribution channels such as Alliance, GTS, Universal,  Lion Rampant and more. \nWhat - A pledge level to help us gauge interest in exclusive product for retailers that revolve around Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops.\nWhen - After the campaign, we'll have a pledge manager level that will be open exclusively to retailers. This will include product specific to retail only and/or extremely good margins if you order through your regular distribution channels. \nWhy - Because we love our retailers, distributors and local gaming stores.  Without you we are nothing. Thank-you, and please note that we haven't forgot you. \nWe've got a lot coming your way in terms of LIVE Q&A's, LIVE Play-through's and more!  Please take some time to schedule in one of our live video sessions from the calendar below; \nMay 23rd, 5pm - 7pm (est)- Live introduction of the campaign.

The players lay out the gameboard, the various cards and dice, and randomly select one of the Final Mission cards. Then each player starts by selecting a shadowrunner team\u2014taking the appropriate markers and player mat\u2014and placing three starting shadowrunners in their player area.\nEach player has a number of actions based upon how many shadowrunners they have on their team; all start with three, but you\u2019re able to hire up to four. Beginning with the first player in a turn, each player places one of their shadowrunner markers on a location on the gameboard, immediately resolving the effects there. \nA few location examples:  \nAt the Crime Mall, immediately spend nuyen to purchase equipment and place the card with any of shadowrunners.\nAt Max\u2019s Ironworks, get a cyberware upgrade for that shadowrunner.\nThe Eye of the Needle provides a host of different benefits for what you need to accomplish in a turn.\nGot a wounded shadowrunner? Dante\u2019s Inferno will let them lie low, make contacts, and generate some nuyen.\nOr make your way to Mr. Johnson and select a mission.\nAnd plenty more! Check out the game board! \nPlayers not only need to choose the appropriate location to try to maximize their gains each turn\u2014and act before other players can grab what they\u2019re looking for\u2014but each shadowrunner is a specific type, bringing their own strengths and weaknesses to a given location.\nShadowrun: Sprawl Ops includes the following shadowrunner types:\nStreet Samurai: Weapons master, often more machine than man.\nDecker: Computer hacker extraordinaire; the Matrix is life.\nMage: Slinger of spells and incantations; rare, precious, dangerous.\nRigger: Drones and vehicles; a mind-jockey for any mobile tech.\nFace: Charismatic and silver-tongued; confidence man for any deal. \nPlacing any shadowrunner into the Crime Mall location on the gameboard lets you snag any equipment card available for the list price. But if you place your Face there, you can get it for half price! Or if you want that perfect cyberware upgrade for your Rigger, you must place that shadowrunner in Max\u2019s Ironworks. Or send your Street Samurai to The Eye of the Needle to automatically pass the first Stage of a mission; or the Decker to gain extra Loot; or the Mage to move one of your other shadowrunners. That's just the start of the benefits of having the right runner in the right place.\nOnce all shadowrunners are placed and locations activated, players move into the last portion of every round: running their missions! \nEvery Mission card indicates several stages that need to be completed, via a series of icons corresponding to the shadowrunner types. Players then determine which shadowrunners they wish to send on the mission; they can send one, some, or all their team.  After reviewing their shadowrunners, they select a number of six-sided dice equal to all of their available icons\u2014based upon the shadowrunners, equipment, and upgrade cards\u2014and then roll their dice. \nEach die includes two \u201csuccess\u201d sides and one \u201cinjury\u201d side; the rest of the sides are blank. When rolling the dice, a player has three rolls to clear a Mission stage by matching the correct success icon from their dice with the needed icons on the stage. Additionally, a player can use any two of the same color successes to achieve one success for another color. \nIn all the chaos of fast-talking your way past guards, tossing fireballs, and flashing blades while getting the job done, injuries are bound to happen. A player can wipe out one injury die roll result by using any one success. But if they trade too many successes that way, then they won\u2019t be able to get the successes they need to complete a stage within the three rolls they are allowed. And if they can\u2019t wipe out an injury, those start to stack up, knocking shadowrunners\u2014and their dice\u2014out of the current mission, potentially losing them for a turn. So it\u2019s a fine push-your-luck balance. \nOnce you\u2019ve started a stage of a Mission, you must continue rolling until you\u2019re done. But when a stage is complete, you can decide to pull out\u2014sometimes, the pressure comes too hot, and it's time for duck-and-cover. Or maybe you feel you\u2019ve got this despite the injuries, despite the odds, and you push on through. You might see victory \u2026 or you might get half your team injured or even killed, and you\u2019ll spend the next turn (at least) rebuilding. \nKnowing when to walk away is just as important as when to push. If you manage complete the mission, you\u2019ll get the nuyen payout that will help you bring in better shadowrunners and more gear on future jobs. And of course all of this will lead to the big run of the Final Mission.  Check out one of them, the Rescue a Ritual Sacrifice job against Aztechnology.\nBrutal, right? Not to mention the brinkmanship with the other players. Push too soon, and you might not have the dice to make it through; both of the the six Mage and six Hacker successes are tough nuts to crack. And if you fail, you\u2019re left to rebuild for a turn\u2014time you may not have. But wait too long, and another player will sneak in front of you, and with the right set of runners, equipment, and a little luck, they\u2019ll snag your victory from you! \nThat\u2019s just a quick walk through of Shadowrun: Sprawl Ops. There\u2019s much more to experience and enjoy in this unique combination of worker placement and push-your-luck tactics! \nDownload the Working Rule Book HERE. \nWhen you back this campaign you are also subject to some serious stretch-goal mojo, or as we like to call it, SWAG GOALS!\nWe did the entire list!

Today, you\u2019re being sent out beyond the safety of its walls on a journey into the uncharted Wilds. There\u2019s a dozen survivors for every mouth the Fortress can feed. It\u2019s time to earn your place within its walls once and for all. \nIn Posthuman Saga you'll be venturing into a weird and wonderful world where unknown threats await at every turn of the road. You'll need to forage for food, ammo and weapons if you want to survive. You'll desperately fight off human and mutant enemies in brutal brawls in which your weapons break and your wounds can lead to mutation. You'll meet a cast of strange and memorable characters and find yourself in unexpected situations during story encounters, which force you to make choices that might have consequences down the line. But don't linger long - you need to complete your mission before others do! Your reputation is at stake!\nPosthuman Saga is a competitive, tactical survival adventure set in the post-apocalyptic world of Posthuman for 1 to 4 players. The game can be played in 3 modes: Solo, 2 to 4 players Competitive or Team Versus; where 2 teams of 2 players, each sharing a map, compete for the favour of the Fortress. It combines euro mechanics with finely crafted story to create an experience that will challenge your system-busting skills while immersing you in a rich post-apocalyptic world.  (For a short overview see Gameplay Overview below).\nKey Features\nStories that blend the grit of post-apocalyptic survival with the quirks of human (and mutant!) nature.\nMechanics that are tightly coupled with theme creating an immersive experience. \nModular map tiles and a variety of decks create a sandbox experience where no two games are alike.  \n3 Game modes: Solo, 2-4 Competitive and Team Versus.\nEach Hero has their own starting items and sets of development cards allowing for a variety of possible builds for each character, that suit different playing styles and winning strategies. \nDeep world building and lore that evolve through the various analogue and digital games set in the Posthuman world.\n\nTo win you\u2019ll need to earn reputation points by exploring a map made up of modular tiles and completing Mission Objectives before other players do...\n...and score Recon Objectives made up of sequences of Scavenge Sites.\nGain map tiles through Map actions and bidding in the Broadcast event. \nEach turn you will secretly select one of four Actions to play.\n While exploring you\u2019ll face story encounters\u2026\n\u2026and combat Encounters. In melee combat you perform the following steps:\n1) If you use a weapon discard a durability token then select one combat card and draw another one at random. (The selected one will exhaust after combat). \n2) The enemy rolls combat dice and adds their Combat results.\n 3) Players then resolve the results on the Combat tracker.\n But above all... try to survive out there! \n                                                                                                                                                                      Now also includes:\nand...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Exclusive Deluxe Edition\nNow also includes:\n and...\nand...\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion continues the overarching story presented in the Base Game taking you deeper into the Wilds to track down Mutant Slave Trains carrying human captives and following them to a Mutant Stronghold.\nPosthuman Saga: Resistance Expansion adds several new mechanics to the Posthuman Saga Base game along with new ways of scoring and winning the game. Resistance also adds a lot of new content, including 2 new Characters, new Followers, new Mission Objectives, new Event cards and the new Veteran Mutant die as well as a new deck of Level 3 Encounters including over 30 stories. \n      \n    To add one or more Add-ons to your pledge, just add the ammount listed on the add-on(s) to your pledge ammount.

Posthuman Saga is a completely different game, not a second edition or re-design of the first game. Please watch the preview videos above for an overview of how the game plays. All the components in Posthuman Saga are different from those of the original Posthuman and the vast majority of the characters and enemies are either new or have been re-drawn.\nAre You a Backer of The First Posthuman Game?  \nThank You! To show our appreciation we are giving away the Posthuman: The Wilds mini expansion for free to the original 5,500 backers of Posthuman when they back at Explorer level or higher. This includes new Events, new Encounters, and 4 characters that made it out of the world of Vengeance alive.

We have learnt a lot from past titles and continue our process of improving our game design, art, product design and component quality. We had a few hiccups in the past with printers and fulfilment partners not living up to our expectations, so we have stopped working with them. Moreover, we are now working with partners that come highly recommended, from our ever-growing network of Kickstarter creator veterans with whom we share knowledge on a regular basis.\n\nWe now have a great manufacturing partner that has done games for major publishers and creators and who has come recommended with impeccable credentials. \n\nPosthuman Saga has been tested by 8 groups in the US, Europe and Asia. A new batch of test groups will be brought in after the end of the Kickstarter to test the final content and then, finally, yet another wave of blind testers will be brought in to blind test the rulebook and the finished product. We are also working with two developers, Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island, Wasteland Express Delivery Service) and Jonathan Harrington (Vengeance) to ensure that the game is as polished as can be when it goes to print.\n\nHaving said all the above there are always things that can come up that will be beyond our control. What we do promise you is that we always put our backers first, and will continue to do so in this campaign.

The setting takes inspiration from the aesthetics of the First World War and interwar period.\nThe system is designed to capture a sense of close combat in trenches, ruins or even whole cities swept away by the total war. Be a small cog in the war machine, survive in military operations with tens of thousands of losses a day. Face the horrors of modern mechanized war, deadly, never-before-seen tanks, the airborne terror of biplanes, the experimental weapons of the future of warfare, forged in constant conflict.\nHowever, this is not the world you know - It is a world of myth and magic, progressed to the diesel age. In other words, your squad can be composed of different fantasy races, where your sergeant can be a formerly enslaved orc or your comrade can be a cursed goblin marauder. In search of a means to break the stalemate of trench warfare, science returned magic from oblivion and tamed it. It changed everything.\nThe last line of defense trying to stop the dreadful technomagically driven flying fortress.\nThe game locations are not limited to trenches on the frontline, this setting allows many types of adventures: be deserters and treasure hunters in the colonies, fight in city ruins or the shadow of tanks the size of a mountain, wage \u201crat war\u201d in sewage networks and subways, or even be the hero of your assault squad in a suicide mission to destroy enemy secret weapons. Your fate is yours to decide: try to survive in war zones, on the frontline or behind enemy lines.\nInterbellum uses a proprietary d6 based system, clearly separating the narrative and combat component of the game and encourages teamwork between sqaudmates.\nWe published our early ruleset for playtesting. The pack includes:\n- Document with rules;\n- Introductory lore document;\n- Tables for rules and few samples of enemies and items;\n- Art pack and test location map for your adventure.\nRemember, these are simplified rules that will evolve and improve based on your feedback.\nCharacter creation resembles that of the classic computer-based RPG\u2019s of the late 90's. The choice of main attributes (Agility, Charisma, Intelligence, Perception, Strength, Vitality) and traits - is all familiar. But the choice of race and faction affects a lot - it determines the attitude of NPCs of other factions and races towards you, and can also give bonuses or penalties. The world is still struggling against slavery, for freedom and equality, therefore the influence of xenophobia and prejudice plays a big role in team building and gameplay.\nEarly sketches of Army Boy mascot in different roles to illustrate attributes.\nAnother important aspect in creating a character is the choice of his class, his profession. The range of choice is quite broad: Officer, Rifleman, Medic, Mage, Technician, Wild Card and others. Each class gives unique perks and the ability to develop class skills. During character creation you can distribute the starting skill points as you like, but during the game it will be limited only to class skills and only they can be developed to the maximum. Of course, there are also will be workarounds for developing skills and changing your class that depend on the narrative and your game master. Also, your selected class gives you a starting free kit of equipment. Depending on the circumstances, you can purchase additional equipment for bonus points. Levelcap limits the development of the character, so you should consider what the character will specialize in.\nHaving created the character and built your own squad with your friends, you will now choose one of the pre-prepared missions or one created by your game master. Since the game takes place in an era of rapid technological advance the time period of the mission significantly affects the complexity, the opponents encountered, and the available equipment. Do not forget - this is the era of the arms race, when every year the war brought new items to the arsenal. If you choose Great War - you can start with bolt action rifles in your hands, and finish commanding airborne tanks on airships. In your hands lies the choice of the battlefield: you can participate in another insane attempt to capture an enemy underground fort like Verdun, or try an adventure in the style of Lawrence of Arabia.\nEach scenario has a map with the main locations. Moving between them, your squad will run into random encounters - some of them will be harmless, others carry danger or even an opponent. The use of technology provides you with a sense of security and fullness, but this is a very controversial pleasure. On the front line this technology is the hope of your detachment, but the first tanks are capricious, unreliable and very slow. Nevertheless, if your mission and the theater of operations allow, you can take a breezy ride on an armored car, which will support you. Combat uses typical turn-based game mechanics that are a bit similar to skirmish wargames.\nKilling enemies and completing missions gives you experience points that allow your character to move to the next level. Each time the player gains a level, he receives several skill points to develop his class skills, and every three levels you can choose a perk. Perks provide an opportunity to further sharpen your character for a certain role in your squad or even acquire magical abilities.\nAndre Lagran - famed Death Brigade veteran, fighting for the Alliance faction. He was one of the last defenders of the Border Line.\nSpecifically, each action and every step in your character\u2019s progress will be very important, the d6 was chosen because of our desire to follow the number 6 in the numerical parameters of attributes, skills, and so on.\nAn important nuance that brings an element of uncertainty into a conventional war is magic and its manifestations. At a camp deep in the rear lines near the forest, you can battle a gang of vampires, unconquered, and ghosts near the mass graves in place of the old battleground - all this is just the beginning. The select few who own the Gift can use the Words of Power, that is, spells. They are dangerous opponents, but their spells depend entirely on their intelligence and the benevolence of the Higher Powers. Much worse is meeting one of the Touched - a poor fellow who has touched by breath of chthonic chaos from outside of this world. These magicians are literally bursting from the eldritch energy boiling inside them, their bodies can mutate, and they themselves do not use spells, they directly try to control the flows of magical energy with random side effects. Where technology falls, magic creates incredible things.\nThe following is a recorded playtest session hosted for roughly 4 hours. It features 4 people, a GM and 3 players casually playing the Interbellum RPG system for the first time. The plot follows 3 soldiers in the Ecumenical Empire who are part of a subpar squad being assigned to a lonely rear echelon outpost in the town of Farbythe, which has been experiencing problems relating to banditry and possible other problems lurking within its territory. Crude language, violent subject matter and general idiocy and shenanigans is found within this video. Viewer discretion is advised.\nInterbellum is a fantasy dieselpunk setting. or rather technomagic. What if the usual fantasy world met the era of the first mechanized wars? A world where magic was forgotten for hundreds of years, rediscovered and used to break the positional stalemate, this led to an arms race that spawned 1000-ton steel beasts on land and in the air, make fortresses airborne or devastate whole cities with a few bombs. A world that replaced typical Evil Lords with dictators, knights with armored vehicles, and guilds with corporations. In this world fears of a trench war can materialize, your neighbors can be werewolf infiltrators, and the ghosts of your fallen comrades in no-man's land terrorize the enemy.\nIstalian Bastion-class landship. 100 tons of perfect engineering.\nUnlike other similar settings, here dieselpunk is dominant, but the fantasy elements serve to deconstruct stereotypes. Of course, magic can be used to create fireballs, teleport and other cool stuff, but the main difference is that magic is used for creating new technologies and machines. In fact, magic used as justification for the typical attributes of a dieselpunk - weird tech, giant vehicles, mutants, etc.\nOn Jule 7, in the year 1404, the Great War began. Beginning for trivial reasons as a conflict between the two superpowers and their satellites, in 9 years of hellish warfare it grew into a global slaughter between four geopolitical blocs. Hundreds of millions of people were involved, many of them died.\nWhile the three superpowers were competing in the race for technical advancement, the fourth superpower collected magical knowledge bit by bit and united them with its own. From the very beginning of the war, the Sidhean Empire was able to surprise everyone by putting hundreds of combat mages on the battlefield. What was considered lost forever, had returned.\nAfter centuries of oblivion, magic and many other fragments of the Old World rose again. Technology tamed the magic and this created a new leap in scientific and technological development, making the previously impossible now possible.\nThe playable period in setting will cover almost 30 years, including the Great War for lovers of epic conflict, and local wars in the post-war period. Your character can begin his story as cannon fodder in a world war, and after it become a revolutionary or a mercenary, if he survives on the battlefield.\nFactions:\nCoalition - a bloc created by one of the oldest and largest human states in the Interbellum world, called the Ecumenical Empire. The imperial interests lie in the domination of Hearthland and creating more satellites. The most industrially advanced faction of the setting, at the expense of the environment, resulting in decaying forests around their smoke-filled megacities. The rigid rule of law and severe punishments are combined with imperial chauvinism, which is a blight on the Empire\u2019s diplomacy, but creates protectionism for their inner policy and trade. The Empire is dominated by materialism and atheism because of the old doctrine that \"all gods are evil, and their priests are tyrants\u201d. After the Great War, the Empire was mired in the civil war and disintegrated into several states during the revolution, but the Coalition remained. The Galrian Republic preserved most of the heritage of the Empire, but brought more freedom at the cost of devastation, bureaucracy, the political demagogy and corruption.\nAlliance - a union of conservative monarchical states clinging to domination in the central region of the world. A forced union of former rivals against a common enemy, compensates for its technological backwardness with a development balance between agriculture and industry. Having lost almost a quarter of its population in the Great War, in the post-war period it was almost split from within by crumbling empires and national liberation movements. Constant riots, insurrections and civil wars, mass poverty amid the luxury and wealth of untouchable despotic aristocrats all cast challenges on the young Alliance, which consists entirely of contradictions.\nNorthern League - a self-isolated and mystic bloc of races, nations and countries, united as satellites around the totalitarian elven state, the oldest known race. Forged by constant conflicts with mankind and remembrance of old grudges, northern elves spent more than a thousand years studying artifacts and restoring the knowledge of the Forerunner race, multiplying their magical skills while in the rest of the world technology supplanted the magic. This is the most fantastical and magic-heavy faction of the setting, almost exclusively having full access to fancy magic stuff. Their lag in industrial strength is balanced out by enchanted weapons and technomagic devices, for example, they can raise old fortresses in the air. Dragon-bombers? Check. Trolls with hand cannons? Check. Troopers with magic rayguns? Check. Machines made of living metal, fueled by the dying person imprisoned in them? Oh, boy\u2026\nAlbian Commonwealth - a bloc of formally independent satellites ruled by the Albian Empire. It is an island-based colonial power, ruling the seas and controlling a large portion of international trade, as well as the development and exploitation of Aborigines in the colonies. Slavery, class and racial segregation are also flourishing in the Commonwealth. However, if you were born a free person in the Commonwealth, then you have many ways to find your place in life. Once in the past, Albia was just a distant province of the Ecumenical Empire, splitting from it during the Dark Ages. Separatists formed a political system around the union of guilds, traders, mercenaries and pirates, which allowed them to capitalize on their advantageous geographical position and control the main oceanic trade routes. They also started a era of great geographical discoveries.\nYou can also read parts of the lore on our Patreon page.\nThis Kickstarter goes towards finishing the game and producing the Interbellum RPG as a digital product. Basically, the game will come out as set of two PDF books (Player\u2019s book and Game Master\u2019s book), 200+ pages in total. The player book will consist of a basic ruleset, character archetypes, equipment lists and introduction to the setting. The master's book will contain game mechanics for the wizard, adventure scenarios and the hidden part of the game's lore - various secrets of the setting that you can use to create your own adventures. Most of the illustrations will be black and white, only a handful will be colored. Also, as bonus will come downloadable and printable player\u2019s lists.\nStarting with the Officer tier, you can get an artbook that will contain canonical illustrations and sketches. All drawings will be supplied with signatures and a history of the origin and design selection, This will give a deeper plunge into the setting.\nSince Kickstarter does not allow the editing of tier descriptions if they already have backers, we will announce the changes personally:\nAt the request of the people, we upgrade the final tier, now it will contain the reward from the previous War Hero tier (using the backer\u2019s appearance for a character in the book).\nVolunteer tier after the release of the game will receive a coupon to pay only for the printing and delivery of a softcover book.\nOfficer tier and higher will receive a coupon for the hardcover book. This will be done through DriveThruRPG and their Print-on-Demand service.\n$4000 - REACHED!\n\u00abTank Warfare\u00bb expansion - a detailed ruleset for tank warfare and the tanker class, special scenarios of tank battles and mechanized warfare, with a wide range of additional armored vehicles for each faction.

In addition, new scenarios for adventurers. Break into the pyramid and fight against curse of the ancient kings? Stop military experiments with summoned demons and legions of the undead? Meet dark gods and realize your own insignificance? Yes, all this will be here.\n$8000\n\u00abCrimson Tides\u00bb expansion - naval operations, amphibious machines, new regions and scenarios for deserters and simply adventurers in colonies and remote places. New races too: amphibian Xsotls, Nagas and other reptiloid species. In addition, all or most illustrations will be fully coloured.\nSince we understand that we are not big names in the gaming industry, our needs are very low. $3000 is the minimum required for the starter edition with minimal content and some simplified mechanics (tank battles for example). It is impossible to cover the entire large setting in the first book, so we are starting with a small goal. The game will be released in English and Russian languages.\nOur calculations for the expenditure of received funds:\n10% - commission expenses, KS and Stripe share.\n15% - for editing of texts and formatting content into PDF books.\n50% - for the artists work, i.e. creating illustrations.\n25% - for game design.\nOur team consists of many people who worked or somehow participate in game industry Some of us have already have a few released or still developed games. However, this is our first experience with tabletop games.\nOur key team members:\nMaxim Krylov aka Watcher - main author and game designer. Bio and details on Linkedin page.\nConnor Douglas aka Mindtraveller - young game designer who studies in Savannah College of Art and Design.\nVasily Khazykov aka TugoDoomer - well known as artist for such projects as Insomnia: The Ark, Total Extinction and Hydrophilia tabletop wargames and etc.\nIf you have ideas, questions or business proposals concerning my work - just write to us or in comments section.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, but some of our team members worked on various games, and the game is already far along in development. We also have a fallback source of capital to cover things if real disaster strikes, ensuring we will deliver so long as civilization persists.\n\nWe certainly did not promise unfulfillable goals and rewards. It has long been known that there are some indie developers who promise too much, such as printed books or similar material awards, It is often difficult to calculate physical delivery obligations, so we only offer digital content. Perhaps, if we reach several stretch goals, then we will think about printing soft-cover rulebooks, but not earlier.\n\nWe expect that we will be able to complete the development in one year. Half a year will be spent on completing the development of rules and their testing, the next six months will be devoted to the creation of missions, scenarios, their maps, printed templates and other content, and their testing too. Of course, we can give more optimistic promises like \u201cwe will do this in 6-8 months\u201d, but we look soberly at the development process.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Cannon Fodder", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["271 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Volunteer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Officer", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["126 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "War Hero", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF\nYour appearance can be used for characters and their illustration", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Death Squad Trooper", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nInterbellum PDF\nAccess to early rulesets and drafts during development\nInterbellum artbook PDF\nExclusively made adventure for your squad", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "March 2021 update", "update_content": "Hello folks!

In No Thank You, Evil!, each player creates a character based on a couple of cool, descriptive, imagination-firing traits. The Guide (a special role often played by a parent or older sibling) presents a dilemma, and the players set off on an adventure of the imagination. Along the way they use their character\u2019s special skills, companions, and equipment to overcome obstacles\u2014perhaps fighting a slime monster, winning over the suspicious mayor, or beating a rabbit at a race. Whereas conventional board games constrain players\u2019 actions, No Thank You, Evil! sets kids\u2019 imaginations free: Their options are limited only by what they can think up. Together, the players create a story as they work together to make their way through the adventure. \nNo Thank You, Evil! contains everything you need to play, all in a beautiful, sturdy box designed to be easy for children to use. It includes:\nNo Thank You, Evil! rulebook\nLet's Go On An Adventure! adventure book\nFive dice (because sharing is hard!)\nCharacter sheets\nCards for characters, creatures, and cyphers\nGame tokens\nNo Thank You, Evil! was released in March 2016. This Kickstarter campaign is funding a reprint of the game, as well as some additional products.\nFor the Little Kids, the Grown-ups, and Everyone in Between\nYounger kids frustrate easily when a game is too complex for them to master. Older children quickly grow bored by games that are too simple or that strike them as below their level.\nNo Thank You, Evil! is great fun for kids as young as five years old. But it\u2019s also great fun for the rest of family\u2014adults included!\u2014because the scalable rules adapt easily to the abilities of the player. A six-year-old might play, for example, a Princess. An eight-year-old might play a Super Smart Princess. A ten-year-old might create a Super Smart Princess who Experiments With Science. Each of these stages adds a level of sophistication to how the game is played\u2014but all of these characters play around the same table in the same game. After a game or two with the grown-ups, a twelve-year-old might even run games for the other kids!\nThe gameplay rules are easy for novice or young players to grasp, but nuanced and flexible enough for older kids and grown-ups to enjoy just as much. Here's a brief look at how the rules work:\nEnter Storia: The Land Next Door\nNo Thank You, Evil! is set in Storia: The Land Next Door. It\u2019s a world seen through children\u2019s eyes, home to all the elements of kids\u2019 imaginations: Dragons and dinosaurs, faeries and elves, race cars and robots, and all sorts of fanciful creatures. Players\u2019 characters in No Thank You, Evil! are kids who have been specially chosen to help save Storia from evil. Accompanied by their companions and their handy I Gotchyer Back packs (living creatures that carry the characters\u2019 cool stuff in their bellies), characters venture into Storia to save the day!\nFor more detailed info on the setting, game rules, and characters, visit the No Thank You, Evil! website.\nWhen we came up with the idea for No Thank You, Evil! back in 2015, we weren\u2019t sure if anyone would be interested in it. A family roleplaying game designed around immersion, inclusion, and being awesome together? We knew it was a risk, but it was one we were passionate about taking.\nIt turns out that risk was worth it, more so than we could have imagined. We heard so many stories from families and organizations that warmed our hearts. Tales of unicorns and knights, of dragon snot, dinosaurs, and ninjas. But most of all, tales of families coming together, sometimes across time and space, to tell stories together.\nIn fact, so many families and groups have told so many stories, that the game\u2019s print run has now sold out. We have a few copies left at the MCG online store, but we\u2019ll be out of those soon and we have none left to ship to stores. But demand is as high as ever!\nSo, why a Kickstarter?\nYou\u2019ll Have Your Game Sooner. If we were using a traditional reprint model, we wouldn\u2019t see a reprint until next year. This way, as soon as the Kickstarter closes, we will have the money to print your games, ensuring that there won\u2019t be a large lag time (and we won\u2019t run out at retail stores). You\u2019ll have your games this year.\nNew Stuff! A Kickstarter allows us to offer new items for players (which is something that people have been asking for\u2014and we want to make that happen!).\nDoing Good. With a Kickstarter, we can offer a special backer level to organizations and schools that are using No Thank You, Evil! to work with students on improving their social skills, dealing with trauma, and overcoming grief. This is something that\u2019s near and dear to our hearts, and the business model of Kickstarter makes that possible. (See the bottom of this Kickstarter for a list of some of the fantastic organizations and groups that are using No Thank You, Evil!).\nEnjoy special downloadable deliveries, brought to you by Storia\u2019s renowned delivery service, BEE MAIL! This reward gets you three PDFs worth of new content, delivered digitally starting in July and running through the end of 2018.\nEach PDF will include a brand-new adventure, as well as additional goodies, such as new creatures, pregenerated characters, props, and more. Kids will love getting special messages directly from their friend Woodlynn the Queen Bee, inviting them to Storia for even more exciting adventures.\nAnd if your reward includes BEE MAIL!, you also get any additional BEE MAIL! digital stretch goals that we reach during this campaign.\nWORKING WITH KIDS This level is just for schools, libraries, counselors, and organizations that work with (or want to start working with) young people via tabletop gaming. Please note: this discount is only for the above-mentioned groups. We will ask for official credentials at the time of fulfillment. You get two copies of No Thank You, Evil! at a special discounted price. You can add additional copies, and any of the existing supplements, at the same discount.\nRETAILERS The AWESOME RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many copies of No Thank You, Evil! are right for your store, and to avoid tying up your cash between now and release. Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when the No Thank You, Evil! reprint is ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $60 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them before distributors do, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately, so it's a great way to ensure you're stocked up for the holiday season this fall. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nTHE SUPPLEMENTS Since the launch of No Thank You, Evil! in 2016 we've released three additional titles that expand your game experience with creatures, story-building tools, adventures, game components, and even advice teaching kids to become Guides.\nStory, Please! Journey into Storia in adventures of your own design. Combine an engaging STORY card with one or more cool PLACE and PERSON cards to outline your quest. Then give your adventure a surprising TWIST, and maybe some fun and useful STUFF. There are even maps and handouts! Pick cards, draw them at random, or mix and match. Create a great story with all the details you need\u2014in minutes!\nUh-Oh, Monsters! Set out into adventure with this boxed expansion. The Lairs and Scares book contains four complete adventures, great for novice Guides and players or those who are looking for some more advanced challenges. The Claws and Paws book details nearly fifty creatures to encounter in Storia, along with advice on making your own monsters, details on the Monster Museum, and companions and character options. You also get loads of player handouts, creature cards, and even nifty creature standups!\nCharacter and creature standups from Uh-Oh, Monsters! and I'm a Guide!\nI'm a Guide! A hands-on, step-by-step kit for kids who are ready to take on the role of a Guide. Easy-to-follow instructions help kids run a simple adventure, learning along the way so they can go on to run more advanced stories, or even make up their own\u2014and achieve a wild success at being a Guide! And that\u2019s not all: You also get a bunch of great stuff for helping Guides explore Storia, including a storybook, a coloring book, and two dozen character standups.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for.\nSince the game is already developed and ready-to-go, we can start printing as soon as the Kickstarter closes. Additional products will begin design and development at that point as well. \n\nIf you're new to No Thank You, Evil!, we will ship the game and expansions as soon as the game is ready. If you already have the No Thank You, Evil! basic box, we will ship your expansions in July.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT Soon after this Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is NOT included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\n* The UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\nRESOURCE LIST\nLooking for some fantastic organizations and groups that are using No Thank You, Evil! and other games with young people?\nBodhana Group is a nonprofit organization that advocates the use of tabletop gaming as a directed therapeutic and clinical practice that can benefit personal growth as well as enhance social and educational services to individuals and families.\nRPG Research is a nonprofit organization that uses a research-driven approach to create inclusive and accessible programs that measurably improve people\u2019s lives through music and roleplaying games.\nGame to Grow is a nonprofit organization that offers weekly therapeutic social skills groups help young people become more confident, creative, and socially capable using tabletop games.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the eleventh Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Its ok, we aliens are not judging. Just experimenting. Mostly on how to not be bored, you humans are so much fun. We kidnapped this designer to help us create a board game simulation we can delight in. In the simulation, we left some of our wicked alien tech on Earth and Earth humans built a city around it. Amazingly, these humans even learned to misuse and merge some of our devices with their clockwork toys. Well, that\u2019s a recipe for catastrophe. Anyway, you humans are doomed.\nEach character has a unique set of ability cards.\nStarting up, you take control of a human adventurer (or adventuring gorilla) with a unique set of abilities and character board. You will perform all activities via a unique action building mechanic that allows you to upgrade your actions every turn - deciding between an immediate or long-term benefit.\nThe unique action mechanic allows you to improve and activate an action column each turn.\nYour adventurer will enter a randomly generated city consisting of big cardboard tiles and face down secret location cards. Some of these locations may contain events, change the mood of your character, contain secret information, or offer other opportunities.\nVisited locations are placed under your influence. A cube is placed to mark the location, which can be exploited later.\nThey say it\u2019s fun to explore these unique locations and do human things, like drinking or picking up junk from the street.\nItem modifications in game.\nYou will merge the junk and tech to make your own devices and perform new actions, combos, or even more intense human stuff -- like interaction with other animals or humans. These individuals open even more gameplay options and offer quests that reward insight and renown.\nCivilian cards provide special passive and active abilities. Complete their quests to reward insight and renown.\nEventually, an alpha human will decode our alien ciphers, making them the least favorite human to other players, because they will have won the game and also triggered the apocalypse.\nDecoding the cipher tablets brings renown and victory in competitive mode.\nIn cooperative mode, you humans may vaguely realize your mistakes and band together to face the impending doom. You will now need to work together in order to deal with crises appearing on the map; and our terrible mechanization pylons that are turning the civilians.\nThe alien pylon is defended by mechanized and a civilian is about to get eaten. Also, the area is on fire.\nYou will attempt - and miserably fail - to destroy the pylons, battle our minions and rescue the civilians while trying to deal with crisis cards appearing on the map.\nCo-op relics and a ruins token\nIt is amusing how you humans think you have found a way to destroy the pylons by using our own artifacts. We let you do that from time to time, because surely, it is not just another trap to keep us entertained...\nWhy do we think this game is special?\nNear infinite replayability, delivered through 200+ cards, the majority of which are unique. \nSimple rules, but a lot of depth resulting from an original action building system.\nCharacter mood mechanic. \nItem upgrade mechanic that allows for connecting and customizing items. \nTwo modes: Cooperative and Competitive.\nUnique theme with illustrations done by a single artist. \nHumor.\n\n\nGameplay Videos\nPlease watch these non-indoctrinated earth human videos learn more about the game:\nThis one we abducted tortured, brainwashed and brought back. Now he believes that we paid him to do this preview video : D\nWe created the game with dark matter, but we want your human dollars in order to produce this in cardboard and wood.

The pack will include at least 10 cards, but the content of the pack as well as content of the game box will increase with unlocked stretch goals.\nEXCLUSIVITY INFORMATION\nThis is a Kickstarter only project and the final product is very unlikely to appear in general distribution. A limited quantity of games will be produced to serve the backers and SPIEL 2018 fair.\nThe engineer. Work in progress.\nThe games will be shipped from within EU.\nCurrently the game is in a state more advanced than the prototypes that were reviewed in the videos. It\u2019s in a good shape but we are still filling the game with content and tweaking the mechanics for the best balance and smoothest possible experience. We will work on the game until the date it is handed down for print. We are intent on delivering the games for the 2018 SPIEL in Germany, as an early pick-up option. The remaining copies will be delivered in December 2018 or early 2019.\nPlease note that worldwide shipping cost is included in all pledges, except for the Essen pickup option.\nEvery early bird backer and SPIEL pickup option backer will have a chance to sign up for an alien abduction event. All the voluntary human names will be displayed on the inner sides of the game box. If alien abduction is not your thing, then do not worry. At the end of the campaign you will simply not put your name in the survey in order to skip this and make the alien probe droid sad. The aliens may feed you badly and place antennas in you, but the database hologram looks pretty cool on the cardboard so you might consider it worth it.\nBeautiful Disaster Games is a one-person company run by the designer, Tomek Stasiak, who self publishes his games in his home country of Poland. After the successful release of Assault on Doomrock and its expansion, Tom teamed up again with Bartosz Plawecki to create a brand-new title with an original theme.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game. Additionally, we will include a new Journey card dedicated to the crew of the best submission, as well as a gift for the winning crew.\nFor more information.\nFor more information: See all our booty: the first 46 Stretch Goals.\n$431000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Amazons (6 miniatures). They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked. What surprises are to be found on these cards?\nGo to your pledge, use the \"manage my pledge\" button and manually add the amount of US$ for everything you would like to add.

The teachings we have now are woefully out of date and never touch on ways to depict more that what lies on the surface. \nNot Just another \"How to\" Book.\nTutorial on hair\nHow to Draw Black People isn't a book where artists are provided with facial grids and examples of modelesque people, with some cool poses to try and emulate. \n\nWhile there will be step by step guides artists are accustomed to, this book will include entire sections devoted to: \nAnatomy\nFacial anatomy  \nFacial expressions\nHair\nSkin tone\nCostuming \nCulture and customs \nAnd within these sections we delve deeper into things like colorism, fatphobia, gender expression, and how all these things play into visualizing black characters. Everything cited and sourced, all the research done so artists can trust the info or hopefully use it as a starting point learn more.   \nCrowdfunded and Crowd Sourced. \nWhile I will supply the bulk of tutorials and tips provided in the book multiple talented artists will also give their take on how to approach each topic; how to apply what's being highlighted in different styles, and give their own take on what they believe is important when it comes to creating diverse characters. \n\nAlso in the book will be a wealth of photo reference for artists to take advantage. A compilation of everyday black folks across the African diaspora. Special attention will be paid to the differences between drawing someone from the west indies, Ethiopia, Brazil or South Africa. \nLearn how to depict culture instead of stereotypes \n Artists often feel like they don't know what will draw the ire of a socially conscious community, and they are right; they don't know. Artists are taught by and large to copy but rarely to intuit. Art courses require us to recreate and translate without necessarily understanding the subject. \n\nThat lack of understanding is the cause for a lot of anxiety and unintended strife between audiences and artists. \n\nThe hope is that by focusing on culture, comparing and contrasting the differences between the acceptable and the offensive, artists can better themselves. This book will help artists of all levels create more meaningful, authentic diversity and representation. \n\nBack \"How to Draw Black People\" today and make this crucial resource for artists a reality.

The game features highly detailed miniatures and the Modular Deck System (MDS) introduced in Street Masters. In the game, players take on the role of heroic cops inspired by classic action movies and are tasked with protecting the city from the recent rise in criminal activity. Each game is dictated by the chosen criminal deck and case deck. These decks are modular and the different combinations of decks create unique experiences each game.\nThe game is played on a beautifully illustrated board of the city, where the cops must run or drive to various locations and bust up crimes. While cops start the game with a standard issue B.C.P.D. Cruiser, they can also commandeer many other types of vehicles on the streets of Brook City.\nEach cop in Brook City plays differently thanks to each having their own unique cop deck. Cop decks include encounter cards, ability cards, and tactic cards to represent each cop\u2019s unique strengths and strategy to take on the criminals underworld.\nWhile the cops try to crack the case, their prime suspect is represented by the criminal deck. Each criminal deck contains at least 1 suspect card, as well as a slew of crime cards that spawn crew members around the city to interfere with your detective work. If cops ignore these criminal masterminds while trying to pin the crime on them, things may just get seriously out of hand\u2026\nCase decks represent the cops\u2019 overall goal of the game. While keeping the criminal under control, they must also concentrate on working their way through the case. Each case has special rules governing how cops can interact with clue cards and get their hands on enough evidence to bring the criminal to justice. In addition to clue cards, case decks include a variety of events that are designed to hinder the cops or punish them for not making enough progress solving the case.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word on how the game plays. Please click HERE to read a draft of the rulebook.\nBrook City features a variety of highly detailed miniatures, which are used to mark the location of the cops, criminals, and crew throughout the city. With our experience producing miniatures in our previous game, Street Masters, we are confident in the level of detail and overall quality of the miniatures that will be in this game. While we were extremely happy with the miniatures in Street Masters, we learned some tricks to improve them even more for Brook City.\n         Blacklist Games is committed to publishing only high quality games. Please watch this video of Adam and Brady unboxing a production copy of Street Masters:\nAs you can see from the video, great care was taken to ensure every component was of the best quality possible. Backers of this campaign can feel confident that the same amount of care and attention to detail will be taken with Brook City as well.\nLike many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room to pool into stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as we possibly can.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Following, is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. ($30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $15-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $45 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to that we will not ship to these areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaign for Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom, we've taken what we've learned from production, shipping and fulfillment to strive for an even smoother experience from start to finish, continuing to focus on overall quality.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts from the Kickstarter, production, manufacture, to fulfillment, then distribution. Timing seems to be one of the biggest obstacles in many campaigns, especially from small, indie publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can be; we have strong relations with the factory/manufacture; we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on; we are completely passionate about our games; and most important, we care about our backers.\n\nWe also understand there may still be confusion about our first campaign, as it was a card game that we cancelled. It didn't receive the momentum it needed due to us purchasing the rights from a publisher that has not had much luck in the industry. Currently we're developing an app for the game and tightening up some of the original rules and cards in order to release it under our brand at a future date. Doing this will give us the time we need to ensure that the game will make a great edition to our library as well as yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "Rookie Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler with 51 miniatures, 341 cards, a beautiful game board of Brook City, custom dice, and all Unlocked Stretch Goals!\nINCLUDES:\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nBrook City \"Core\" Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["125 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Officer Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler plus the Exclusive \"Keys to the Kingdom\" expansion that stars Ying Hua and Ah Long (from Street Masters) in a unique storyline that brings you even more content and even 3 crossover cards that make their Brook City version playable in Street Masters!

Or do you forget the clues and rush through to a final confrontation before the monster has gathered its strength? No one said being a BPRD Agent would be easy.   \nMiniatures supplied unpainted.\nAhead of the climatic battle, you\u2019ll have to face all manner of creatures that lurk in the shadows, ready to pounce at a moment\u2019s notice. When the chips are down, it\u2019s time to fight back using an intuitive system of custom coloured dice. Each BPRD agent has a range of special abilities they can use to defeat their enemies, or they can team up when things get really tough.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nWhat\u2019s more, no two missions will ever play the same thanks to the terrifying Deck of Doom. Each turn players unveil a Deck of Doom card, which could trigger a new onslaught from the arcane horrors hiding in the location, initiate a special event or simply move the Impending Doom track closer to its dramatic end.     \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nNo matter what your decisions are during the course of the mission, each play through will always end in an epic final confrontation with one of Hellboy's most notorious adversaries. The board itself changes to reveal the boss' lair and then all gloves are off for a desperate struggle against the forces of evil.  \nKickstarter exclusive box artwork drawn by Mike Mignola!\nWe currently estimate Hellboy: The Board Game (core game) will contain the following components*:\n10 double sided room tiles (2.5mm thick, a mix of 2x2 and 1x2 with a linen finish)\n4 Agent Cards\n50+ cardboard tokens (damage counters, HQ board markers, target priority counters, furniture, doors, flame markers, etc., 2.5mm thick, with a linen finish)\n13 custom dice\nThree narrative Case File scenarios (tarot card sized, 310GSM, lined finish, each scenario includes between 6-8 cards)\nCard HQ Board (linen finish)\n74 Mini Cards (310 GSM, linen finish, Encounter Cards, Back-Up Agent details, Equipment and Starting Items)\n48 Standard Cards (310GSM, linen finish, Deck of Doom Cards and Enemy Cards)\n18 plastic cubes (Agent action tokens and generic black tokens)\nColoured bases to fit on Agents\nRulebook\n*these are given as a guidance because the game is currently in development. We will keep backers updated with any changes to components\nBPRD ARCHIVES EXPANSION\nAlso included in your pledge is the BPRD Archives expansion. This is an opportunity for you to create your own BPRD Mission Case File. You start by choosing the location \u2013 will it be an abandoned mansion, spooky graveyard, or something more sinister? Then select the foe you want to face in the final confrontation or just leave it to chance, so it's a mystery until the dramatic climax!\nWork in progress Case File cards. Artwork/text subject to approval.\nOnce you\u2019ve created the Case File, it\u2019s time to make the accompanying Deck of Doom. You\u2019ve got complete control to make the game as easy, or as challenging as you want by selecting the Deck of Doom cards and then shuffling them together. These will then be drawn as you're playing through the mission.   \nArtwork and text subject to approval.\nFinally choose your Encounter Cards. These will dictate what's inside each room and what monsters you will face. Combine these with your  Enemy Cards to battle against wild creatures, hideous Frog Monsters or Nazi soldiers. The choice is yours!  \nFuture releases and expansions will feature elements that can be combined with the BPRD Archives, so the experience will keep growing and the gameplay will keep changing long after you've finished your first adventure.\n   MINIATURES\nWe've worked extremely hard to capture the style of the Hellboy comics. Each miniature has been approved by Mike Mignola himself and we've taken his feedback on board to make them as stunning as possible.\nPLAY\n\nEach miniature will be made from high quality grey PVC plastic and will be pre-assembled, so they're ready to go straight from the box. As you can see in the image below some of the miniatures are huge and will look amazing during play.  \n The videos below use the prototype components we have been using for playtests. The designs/components used are definitely not final but will give you an idea of how the gameplay works.  \n\nShipping is NOT included in your pledge and will be calculated/charged once the campaign has completed. We recommend waiting until the pledge manager to add the exact amount required.

All rights reserved.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are a number of risks with any Kickstarter project, especially getting accurate timings for such complex products with so many components. \n\nWith this project, the rules are currently in testing and will require more playtesting, however we have a dedicated team of playtesters to help with this. Many of the miniatures are already designed and approved by Mike Mignola but some are still in concept stage. Once we have all the miniatures designed, the next part of the process is the tooling and production. We predict that we will begin shipping in February 2019 - however, the exact timing is impossible to predict and there is always the potential for delay with products produced in China. We will of course keep our backers up to date as best we can once the project closes.\n\nTo date, we\u2019ve successfully fulfilled 11 Kickstarter campaigns: Kings of War, DreadBall, LOKA, Mars Attacks: The Miniatures Game, Deadzone, DreadBall Xtreme, Dungeon Saga, Kings of War 2nd Edition, Deadzone: Infestation, The Walking Dead: All Out War and DreadBall Second Edition.\n\nWe currently have four outstanding Kickstarters awaiting completion: the remaining Warpath vehicles are shipping to backers now, wave two of Star Saga: The Eiras Contract is currently going into production and is expected to ship shortly afterwards, TerrainCrate will begin shipping in May/June, and for Kings of War: Vanguard the miniatures are in tooling and resin is already in production ready for later this year.\n\nREFUNDS\n\nUpon request refunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees.

Featuring characters from SpongeBob Squarepants, Invader Zim, Hey Arnold!, and Rugrats!\nIn Splat Attack, players will take control of a team of 4 characters, grab a hand of food cards, and load up their team with Cool Points. Cool Points range in value from 0 to 3 points, and can be stolen from your characters when they get hit with food! However, additional Cool Points can be collected by reaching key locations on the game board.\nWhen hit with food, splat tokens must be placed on the defending character. Placing these tokens strategically will be key to your success, as your character's grid space is limited. Once a character's grid is fill, the character is splatted and out of the game.\nPlayers that are able to get the last hit in and splat a character, earn a golden Cool Point. Once the last golden Cool Point is taken, the game ends, and all players add up their Cool Points to determine a winner.\nEach team is fighting to have the most Cool Points at the end of a Food Fight!  \nEach turn, you can activate two different characters, and those characters can each perform two actions.   \nA MOVE action allows a character to move a number of spaces equal to their SPEED rating.  \nA GATHER Action allows a character to draw 2 food cards and pick up any Cool Point tokens they find in their space!  \nA THROW action allows a character to throw food at a rival character! Some Food cards have special effects and abilities! \nYou can Throw food at any opponent within your Range. Roll a number of dice equal to that food card\u2019s Splat Rating plus your character\u2019s Aim Rating. \nIf you roll at least 1 Hit Result the throw hits the target! Your target must pull a splatter tile from the bag matching the food card\u2019s splat rating. \nThe target must place that splatter tile on their character grid. They must cover 1 space for each hit result the throwing character rolled.  \nThen, take 1 Cool Point token from the target. However, if the target\u2019s grid is completely full, or they can\u2019t fit the tile on their grid, the target is SPLAT and you gain a SUPER Cool Point token instead!    \nOnce the last Super Cool point token is claimed, the game ends! The player with the most points at the end wins!  \nGame play tips from game designer Jonathan Ying:\nNickeoldeon's Splat Attack is a frantic game of throwing food and scoring points, but there can be a method to the madness if you can play strategically. Given that it\u2019s a free for all game it can often be a wise course of action to focus on not making too many enemies or being perceived as too great a threat! The last thing you want is to have other players teaming up against you.\nTemporary alliances can be very useful if you can get your rivals to work with you to take down a player who seems to be running away with the game. Many characters have special abilities that allow them to assist their teammates, like how Phoebe can use her ability to protect her friends. But remember, you can also use her ability to help out a character on a different team to prevent another opponent from scoring or perhaps as leverage to discourage the player you helped from attacking you in the future!\nBe wary of stacking up Danger tokens, they allow you to perform some pretty incredible feats, but they make your character a much juicier target! Also, when you take a hit from an opponent who is behind, it might be a good idea to let them take a danger token or two from your grid. That way they won't ALL go to the player who ends up splatting you!\nCharacter and Team play tips from Jonathan Ying:\nYou should learn your team\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and position accordingly. Each character has a number of unique abilities that can synergize in interesting ways. For example, Arnold\u2019s ability to allow his allies to perform additional actions is very useful when both Helga and Gerald can do unique tricks when they Throw food.\nBefitting a seasoned fry-cook, Spongebob Squarepants is a versatile character who can both move fast and draw food cards quickly for his team, Meanwhile, Sandy is a dangerous opponent in close quarters with her mastery of Kay-Rah-Tay. Use Patrick\u2019s ability to shove rival characters closer to Sandy and use Squidward\u2019s bad luck to your advantage by having him soak up splatter tiles and keep his allies fresh for longer.\nThose Rugrats are always finding their way into crazy adventures! Tommy\u2019s bonus action is an incredibly useful tool for giving his team an edge, he\u2019s the only character who can reliably perform THREE attacks in a given round. To supplement his otherwise low skill ratings (I mean, to be fair, he\u2019s one year old.) Suzie can use her ability to assist in his mobility while Angelica can steal food from nearby characters!\nZim\u2019s team is all about hitting hard and causing chaos for their opponents. GIR is the fastest character in the game and can charge into the enemy ranks while Zim, Dib and Gaz throw a barrage of snack foods into the mix. You\u2019ll want to get Zim into position quickly so he can perform his bonus attacks at the end of your turn, meanwhile Dib requires some careful play to tempo his unique action economy. Gaz is your trump card, she\u2019s a solid character for your backline but after she\u2019s taken a few hits and lost her Cool (points) she\u2019ll go berserk and wreak havoc with incredibly high mobility, range, and accuracy!\nPLEASE NOTE: All backers that have selected retailer pledges will be required to have to provide our fulfillment hub with a store address in order to recieve their pledge.  \nHey Arnold! - Character Art\nRugrats - Character Art\nSpongeBob SquarePants - Character Art\nInvader Zim - Character Art\n Game Designer - Jonathan Ying\nJonathan Ying is a game designer and author currently operating out of San Diego California.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

Virtual reality has come at a cost they can never pay, a tradeoff of freedom for technology. But there are freedom fighters who reject the system, unplugging from the illusion and working to make things right once again. They are la R\u00e9sistance. \nRise up and defy the corporations in the Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG, set in the same universe as The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution from Indie Boards & Cards.\nAre you already a backer? Then go to this backers-only post and download the latest copy of Uprising right now!\nFound a typo or other error in the draft? Let us know! We're collecting them here.\nLooking to support a local retailer by preordering Uprising through them? Encourage your FLGS to back us and get their copies early!\nUprising is the roleplaying game based on the hit Dystopian Universe (DU) games from Indie Boards & Cards, including The Resistance, Coup, and One Night Revolution. Like the other DU games, Uprising is about cunning spies and government agents, loyalty and betrayal, propaganda, unrest, and violent revolution. Unlike the other games, it\u2019s a roleplaying game or RPG. Uprising uses a modified version of the Fate Core rules. You\u2019ll step into the identities behind the cards\u2014or make your own\u2014and foment rebellion, betray close friends, aid enemies, and hopefully survive the dark and gritty streets of Paris Nouveau.\n\nAn RPG? What\u2019s that?  \nIn a roleplaying game, all of the players work together to tell a story--in this case, one about the lives of revolutionaries in the cyberpunk world of Paris Nouveau. Most of the players are PCs or player characters. These players decide what their character will do in response to what's happening in game. One person at the table will be the Game Master or GM. This player decides what the opposition and supporting characters do. When a character takes action, the player will roll the dice to see how successful (or unsuccessful) that effort is, but the real fun is in deciding together what happens next.\nYour cyberpunk Paris experience may vary.\n  What if I\u2019ve never played an RPG before?\nYou're in luck! RPGs are a lot of fun, and we've made special effort to insure this one is accessible to fans of the other DU games who might never have tried an RPG. Inside, you'll find the following beginner-friendly elements:\nCharacter archetypes based on familiar DU cards \u2013 Ever look at the cards during a game of Coup: Rebellion G54 and wonder what the Aristocrat or the General was thinking? This is your chance to find out first-hand!\nBeginner-friendly instructions \u2013 All this group storytelling sounds great, but what exactly do you do? This book lays it all out, along with an example of how it would play at the table.\nCharacter playsheets \u2013 Like the other DU games, all of the characters fall into familiar types. Pick a playsheet, customize it, and get playing quickly.\nSample missions - To help out new GMs (and anyone short on time!), we\u2019ve provided a series of pre-made missions. All the pieces, plot points, and characters are provided!\nStep into the Dystopian Universe\n\nI\u2019m a Fate fanatic! What\u2019s in it for me?\nFor gamers familiar with Fate, Uprising offers some new and exciting mechanics\u2014not to mention that compelling cyberpunk setting. Inside, you\u2019ll find the following new elements:\nSecrets \u2013 Fate Core is built around camaraderie and teamwork, but at its core, the Dystopian Universe is full of backstabbing and deceit. Uprising provides a mechanical system for in-character secrets that will keep everyone at the table guessing.\nPrep scenes \u2013 Do more with your downtime than just refreshing your Fate pool with the new prep scene rules. Request favors, requisition equipment, and create advantages to use later.\nNew action rules \u2013 Instead of skills or approaches, Uprising uses means\u2014Fight, Manipulate, Maneuver, and Observe. Adjust the outcome depending on whether the means fit the end goal.\nAdvancement system \u2013 Instead of milestones, character-specific goals lead to character growth\u2014and sometimes put the characters at odds with each other.\nIn Paris Nouveau, danger lurks around every corner.\nAt KS launch, we\u2019ve already got a laid out copy of the game, which you can download immediately upon pledging. We're still finishing up the art, and we'll be sharing the development of the last few pieces with you throughout this Kickstarter! Next steps include proofing (which you can help with by downloading the instant PDF and reporting any problems here), finishing up that art, and print production.\nOur current timeline has Kickstarter fulfillment happening in December 2018, but we're looking at possibilities to shave some time off of that. Of course we\u2019ll keep you notified of how we\u2019re doing at every step of the process. We\u2019re rather proud of our track record when it comes to prompt KS fulfillment and excellent customer service, and, as always, we\u2019re committed to making this KS a positive experience for our backers.\nThe PDF: As a backer of this project at any level, you'll get immediate access to the early preview PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes. We're doing this because we want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you\u2019re new to RPGs. It also gives you a chance to provide us critical feedback that will improve the game in its final form. We\u2019ll update the final PDF for backers at the $20 level and up, as soon as that\u2019s available. But folks who don't back this project will have to wait a few months before they'll get their hands on that.\nPlease note that you'll see some art placeholders in the book (outlines or blank boxes). If that wasn't clear above, we'll be filling those in with the remaining art once it's done.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $39 and higher will receive a 6\"x9\", hardcover, 310 page, full color version of Uprising: The Dystopian Universe RPG. Shipping late 2018.\nDigital Bonuses: All backers at $20 and higher will receive a download link to a digital bonus pack. This downloadable folder of awesomeness will include copies of Fate Core, Fate Accelerated, Venture City (our superhero flavored cyberpunk supplement), and Designers & Dragons: The 70\u2019s (the first volume in our four book history of the RPG industry), plus sample chapters from recent releases Fate Adversary Toolkit, Dresden Files Accelerated, and upcoming releases Tachyon Squadron and Scum and Villainy.\nUNLOCKED: POD Secrets Deck: Once we reach $10,500, we'll unlock a digital coupon code for a POD copy of the Secrets Deck from DriveThruCards for all backers at $20 and up. The book comes with printable secret cards so you can get playing immediately (and you'll be able to download a clean PDF of them from our website), but we'd like to offer a more durable card option. The code will allow you to purchase the POD version at cost (around $1.22 based on our current quote, as opposed to the $5-or-so we'll charge outside of this KS) plus shipping.\nUNLOCKED: Paris Nouveau Corporate Catalog: Once we reach this funding goal, we'll unlock the Corporate Catalog supplement for all backers at $20 and up. This electronic-only, approximately 5000 word supplement will include more corporations to act as foils, antagonists, or uneasy allies; equipment produced by each corporation to provide an easy PC-purchase list; and additional corp-specific implants and contacts.\nUNLOCKED: Safehouses and Hotspots: At $23K, all backers at $20 and up will unlock the Safehouses and Hotspots supplement. This electronic-only, approximately 4000 word supplement will include 2-page spreads with ready-made encounters that the GM can drop into existing missions. GMs can also repurpose the included NPC stats for use in a home-brew mission.\nUNLOCKED: The Second Fall and Other Stories: Our next stretch goal is for The Second Fall and Other Stories, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. Many of the missions in the core book are stand-alone, but some connect into a loose story arc. This downloadable, approximately 5000 word supplement will provide additional story arcs, each broken down into six connected missions. These can be chained together or run as a ready-made campaign. Once we unlock this goal, we\u2019ll start writing!\nUNLOCKED: Beyond the Walls: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Beyond the Walls, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This supersized supplement (at approximately 10,000 words) will focus on a new city beyond the walls of Paris Nouveau, with a different style of oppression. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nUNLOCKED: Invisible Hands: The Black Market: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on the Invisible Hands supplement, which will be available to all backers at $20 and up. This 5000 word electronic supplement will give you a look at the underbelly of Paris Nouveau\u2014with echoes of the Grifters of the Dystopian Universe. It will include new underworld contacts and plenty of illegal tech to fuel your campaigns.\nUNLOCKS AT $52,000: Upfrancisco Uprising: Once we unlock this stretch goal, we\u2019ll start working on a profile of Upfrancisco. Take your Uprising campaign to an entirely new setting and country with this 10,000 word electronic supplement. It will include a setting write up, a trio of missions, and a new social class with three new playsheets.\nAs with our other recent Kickstarters, we're charging a flat $6 shipping fee.  This also allows us to subsidize the shipping a bit--the actual S&H costs will be more than the $6 we're charging you.\nWe'll also be using BackerKit, where you'll also be able to configure your rewards. BackerKit is a pledge manager--a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. You'll also have the option to add on a few select items via the BackerKit if you choose to do so, with no extra shipping costs.\nWe\u2019ve made the difficult decision not to offer international shipping in this Kickstarter. To put it simply\u2014the shipping costs our distributors are able to offer is as much or more than the products we\u2019d ship. We can\u2019t in good conscience ask you to pay it. However, we still want international folks to be able to get their hands on the goodies. You can try a freight forwarder or a friendly American willing to forward the shipment to you. If that's not feasible for you, we've made it a point to make all of the materials available in an international-friendly electronic tier to make sure you can join the uprising no matter where you live. And of course we'll make the book available in international distribution, when we get to that point.\nDevelopers: Brian Engard, Anna Meade\nEditor: J.D.

This puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Art: The art could take longer to execute than we're hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Artists are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we'll likely roll with it, and we'll let you know what's up. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other artists we've worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.\n\nThe Text: While the editing, layout, and playtesting of Uprising is largely done, it's possible that you will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and our other projects, Evil Hat is a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already invested time and money to get Uprising to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "AR/VR Access", "descp": "At this level, you get early access to the Uprising draft, before the Kickstarter ends.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["130 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "AR/VR Exclusives", "descp": "The final PDF version of Uprising, plus early access to the Uprising draft, plus all unlocked digital stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["612 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "Full Neural Casing", "descp": "A physical copy of Uprising, all unlocked digital stretch goals, and early access to the Uprising draft.

Thanks to a completely factionless system, you'll have total freedom to choose your warband from any of the myriad Champions and their Followers, and build your own unique path to victory.\nWith high-detail amazing pre-assembled PVC models, everything is ready to play straight out the box. Simply grab the three Champions you feel will tell the coolest story, or perfectly fit your playstyle, or that simply look the most stunning and you\u2019re playing!\nChoose YOUR Warband. Build YOUR Legacy.\nGodtear has been carefully designed to be quick to learn and throws players straight into the action and also offers a huge depth of options and tactics to explore. With innovative and organic scenario mechanics, no two games of Godtear are ever the same. The aftermath of each game will leave you wanting to play again and again; there\u2019s huge replayability for players experimenting with different Champion selections and play styles.\nChampions progress and grow in power as you play through a narrative campaign, further customizing your gameplay experience. Built from the ground up for narrative driven campaign style play, Godtear also offers balance and clarity of rules for highly competitive tournament play.\nThe Ascended Pledge  \nThe Ascended Pledge contains everything you could ever want to play Godtear (including all Optional Buys, Stretch Goals & Daily Goals!).\nThe Chosen Pledge\nThe Chosen Pledge is a great entry point into Godtear - providing backers with a selection of champions + ALL unlocked Stretch & Daily Goals!\nWe also have available a whole host of Optional Buys as shown below, simply follow the instructions to add these to your pledge!\n Click below or HERE to download the latest playtest rules - completely FREE! Our game has been in playtest and early access now for 2 months.\nChoose Champions. Destroy enemies. Claim Tears. Ascend.\nThe gods have been forsaken...\n...their bodies shattered as they wept at the betrayal of their sacred covenant. Their tears fell from the heavens as a magnificent rain, each a crystalline shard containing the raw essence of the divine, borne upon the mortal realm by tragedy and sorrow. These are the Godtear, and in each of these gems lies not only the strength to master the petty kingdoms of mortals but the promise of transcendence.\nYet the power of the gods cannot be so easily usurped. \nMost creatures are consumed by exposure to such wild and untameable energies, their bodies destroyed in an instant. Instead the Godtear wait for the Chosen, those destined by some unknown force as heirs to the gods. These individuals have risen as mighty Champions among their people, able not only to survive exposure to the Godtear but absorb this potency and claim it as their own. \nAllied with other Champions and aided by devoted followers they search far and wide for the remaining shards, each discovery one step further along the path of immortality. The wisest of their number are not fooled by such brotherhood. The ties uniting the Chosen are transient, and respect earned in battle is worth little in this world. It is well known even the most steadfast and honourable shall turn upon each other during the final trials. \nFor it is only the legacy of few to claim the mantle of ascended godhood\u2026 \nThe first step of playing a game of Godtear is choosing your Champions, there are no factions in Godtear so you can choose whichever Champions you wish! \nThese Champions are as diverse as the lands from which they hail. Each possesses a unique combination of knowledge, skills, and strengths, all of which will be needed in their quest for godhood. \nChampions are loosely categorised into four distinct classes:\nSneeki Peet, The Maligned\nSLAYERS are the most familiar type of Champion. They focus on dealing damage to a single target, but their individual methods vary greatly. For example, one Slayer could make brutal shots with a bow from a great distance while another could smash an enemy\u2019s face with their fists while yet another could whip their Followers into ruthless murder machines. Regardless of the methods they employ, however, Slayers are the go-to Champion class for dealing with tough targets.\nMournblade, The Soulless One\nGUARDIANS concern themselves less with the opposing warbands destruction than with their own warband's longevity. Most Guardians are extremely tough in their own right, but Guardians are far more varied than walking barriers. Guardians can focus on taking hits for nearby allies, increasing damage reduction for themselves or others, healing friendly models\u2019 wounds, or even returning armies of Followers to the battle.\nTitus, The Dishonoured\nMAELSTROMS place a greater focus on the quantity of their attacks than their individual quality. These Champions can\u2019t deal as much damage as Slayers against hard targets, but they\u2019re more capable of thinning out the ranks of an opponent\u2019s army. Maelstroms also favour a more fluid fighting style, moving from enemy to enemy rather than going toe-to-toe with a single foe. As with any Godtear class, this can take many forms \u2013 from fireballs blasting apart clustered enemies to whirlwind style attacks against every adjacent enemy to effects that chain from foe to foe.\nGalana, Crystalmancer\nSHAPERS, last but not least, weave the flow of battle to give their warband the upper hand. Shapers typically have at least one ability to move other models (friendly and/or enemy), but they\u2019re also the class that interacts most directly with scenario objectives and the battlefield board. Right down to how they make Skill rolls and deal damage, Shapers are a unique breed, but what they lack in raw offence, they make up for with abilities that can change the course of battle at its pivotal moment.\nChoosing which classes to include in your warband can be a tough decision with lots of pros and cons to weigh against one another. Once you consider the unique ways each Champion embodies their class, the decisions become even tougher.\nScale image to show just how massive these Champions are!\nNot just in height...\nWith your Champions selected and gathered together to form your warband you\u2019re ready to play! So, how do you win?\nA game of Godtear breaks down into 5 turns and will always end between turn 3 and 5. A combination of Turn Tokens and the Battle Ladder are used to show the ebb and flow of a clash between two warbands.\nDuring a turn the actions and movement of your warband will move the Turn Token towards your end of the Battle Ladder. Your token will move as you take out Champions, cull followers and control Godtears. \nNaturally your opponent will be opposing you, trying to drag the Turn Token onto their side of the Ladder. At the end of the turn, the player with the Turn Token in their half of the Battle Ladder wins the turn and gains the number of Victory Points shown on the reverse side of that turn\u2019s Turn Token. Turns increase in value as the action intensifies and then taper off again as the battle nears its conclusion.\nThe first player to have 5 Victory Points wins the game!\nRangosh, Scourge of the Broken Plains\nTo represent the flow of battle Godtear features a unique turn structure with two phases; Strategic and Tactical. In each of these phases warbands activate differently and have different abilities. \nThe Strategic Phase begins the turn with a zoomed-out view of the battlefield. Champions plan, set traps and shift their warbands readying for engagement. During this phase each player activates their whole warband.  \nThe Tactical Phase zooms into the action as the engagement begins. Players take turns activating models from their warbands as the plans from the previous phase are set in motion and combat begins.  \nMastery of both phases is the key to establishing your legacy on your way to ascension.\nFront Cover Feature Article in Tabletop Gaming this Month!\n  Shipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.     \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost. Your pledge will arrive via one of the following hubs:\n  United Kingdom (UK and Rest of the World backers) \nUSA (US backers) \nGermany (EU backers) \nCanada (Canada backers) \nChina (Asia Pacific backers) \nAustralia (Australia and New Zealand backers) \nBelow are our initial rough estimates for shipping the core game (4kg volumetric weight). These are just estimates\u2014costs may rise due to weight increase as more items are unlocked via stretch goals and optional purchases you choose. \nUNITED KINGDOM: \u00a38. Channel Islands, Highlands and NI \u00a38-\u00a315 \nUSA: \u00a37-\u00a311 to the contiguous US and the US Virgin Islands. \u00a311-25 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.  \nCANADA: \u00a37-\u00a315 to most cities. \nEUROPE: \u00a38-\u00a320 to most countries. \u00a325-\u00a340 to non-EU countries. \nLATIN AMERICA: \u00a325-\u00a340 to most countries. \nASIA: \u00a318-\u00a325 to most countries. \nOCEANIA: \u00a39-\u00a318 to Australia. \u00a318-\u00a325 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA/OTHER: \u00a325-\u00a350 to most countries. \nAny pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the UK hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs. Below is the general schedule once the Kickstarter ends so you know when to expect money to be taken and our overall shipping plan. Again these are estimates: \nKickstarter Campaign Ends 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers confirming optional purchases, extras and taking payment for shipping. \n1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \nShipping Starts \n0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders. UK/RoW orders are sent to the UK hub by sea freight. \n2-5 Weeks \u2013 China begins packing and shipping Asian hub orders. \n6-8 Weeks \u2013 UK hub receives items and begins packing and shipping to backers \n9-12 Weeks - EU/AUS/US hubs receive items, ship everything out to backers within 2 weeks. \n13+ Weeks \u2013 UK hub completes shipping of the UK and RoW orders. Late confirmation orders and customer service requests for missing/broken items are dealt with via support@steamforged.com.

As much as we would wish it otherwise, throwing more people onto a project doesn\u2019t actually make it progress any faster, in fact many times it has been shown to have the opposite effect.\n\nHere\u2019s an update from our various teams:\n\nDark Souls\nDark Souls was phenomenally successful at Kickstarter, smashing all of our expectations. Our original roadmap for 12 months of development, manufacturing and shipping was crushed by the efforts of our backers. In fact, during the campaign, the DS KS community managed to unlock 3-4 years worth of content! \n\nRising to the challenge, our dedicated Dark Souls team have been pretty much permanently crunching since that KS project ended to get through the mountain of development, sculpting and production needed to bring this awesome game to our backers.\n\nWith development now largely complete, the Dark Souls project is now entirely in the hands of our manufacturing partners right now, however this is with careful management from our internal production team. With Wave 2 about to ship and into the hands of our logistics teams with Wave 3 to follow. \n\nCurrently this means lots of mould testing, box layouts, vac tray design, etc. etc. and so there is lots of going back and forth between the factory and ourselves to ensure the quality is maintained and final products are going to meet our expectations.\n\nAs above, Wave 2 is largely complete with final production samples being checked. After this the shipping will take several months (depending on final destination) to get to our distribution hubs around the world (with estimated Arrival in June/July for shipping to Backers in July). \n\nFrom there, it will be a case of sorting/packing individual pledges and getting them into the post as quickly as we can. We will obviously keep updating you on status as it progresses on the Dark Souls Kickstarter page itself.\n\nResident Evil\nThe Resident Evil team have been progressing to plan very nicely. As you all know, via the regular updates on the KS page which have helped keep the community appraised of progress, development is also largely complete on the project and our sights are set on future game ideas in the Resident Evil universe.\n\nSimilar to Dark Souls above, the project is in the hands of our manufacturing partners and being carefully managed by the RE production team. Worth noting here, to minimize risk and impact to the timeline of either project we have selected and are working with a different manufacturer to the DS supplier. \n\nWe\u2019re very excited by the progress being made on this project and look forward to the reactions of fans getting their hands on the final game later this year.\n\nWe are fully aware of potential delays that may happen with products that are produced in China, the common ones being delays in production, shipping, and customs.\n\nWe have estimated the delivery of Godtear for April 2019, but please understand this is only an estimate. Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others.\n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the game cannot be delivered at all.\n\n======= \nRefunds \n=======\n\nRefunds may be given within 30 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After that time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees, as we will not be able to claim those back after 30 days.\n\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6\u20138 weeks before the actual shipping date).\n\nRefunds within 30 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 30 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only.\n\nThis is a GBP Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in GBP for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day on which the refund is processed as detailed above.\n\n================= \nTerms and Conditions \n=================\n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm them, your pledge will be treated as abandoned. We will, however, look at each case sympathetically and try our best to satisfy each customer.\n\nBy pledging on this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is for shipping your order as entered into the pledge management system. You are responsible for import or other duties that may be payable to relevant tax authorities. You also accept that you are fully liable for incorrect shipping details and will risk your pledge being unable to be delivered or lost in transit.\n\nIf you do not accept the proposed terms please do not pledge on this Kickstarter project and wait for the global general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a379 or more", "title": "CHOSEN PLEDGE", "descp": "* Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nGodtear the Game\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAll Unlocked Daily Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,478 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3210 or more", "title": "ASCENDED PLEDGE", "descp": "(MSRP $640)\nAll contents of the Chosen Pledge included + all available Optional Purchases.\n* Shipping charged after campaign ends (see Shipping section for full details).\nINCLUDES:\nGodtear the Game\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nAll Unlocked Daily Goals\nBlackjaw, the Bloody Messiah\nRaith'Marid, The Rising Tsunami\nRangosh, Scourge of the Broken Plains\nRhodri Ironheart, Thane of the Forsaken Holds\nShayle, Keeper of the Oath\nLorsain, the Autumnal Wind\nGodtear Dice Set (Smoke) - KS EXCLUSIVE\nBase Rings - White & Black Sets\nNeoprene Playmat - KS EXCLUSIVE\nGrimshalla, the Vile\nRattlebone, Prophet of the Ascended Past\nThe Morrigan, Lich Queen of the Frozen Wastes\nHalftusk, Warden of the Stonekin Isle", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["973 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #88", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Keera, The Dragon Princess | New Slayer Champion", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "The Final Update!", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nJust a quick update to say we\u2019re not just on track, but that fulfilment to our awesome backers is now complete!\nWith that in mind, we want to say a huge \u201cthank you\u201d to you all for joining us on this journey.\nOne Champion Is Not Enough!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #86", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays! | A Quick Update from Steamforged Support", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nJust a quick note from the Steamforged Support team to let you know we\u2019ll be away for the holidays from December 21, 2019.\nIn the meantime, if you need to submit a support ticket, you can do that here.\nAny tickets will be logged in the system and Support will be back to answer them from January 6, 2020."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #85", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #4", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nWe\u2019ve got another quick shipping update for you today.\nUS\nFulfilment in the US is now complete!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #84", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #3", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nHere\u2019s another quick shipping update.\nUS and Canada\nThe final container is due to arrive at the fulfilment hub, Quartermaster, today."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #83", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #2", "update_content": "Hail, Champions -\nJust a quick update to say we\u2019re on track for all fulfilment hubs, worldwide, to have received and started processing all rewards by November 20 2019!\nSome hubs are dealing with multiple Kickstarter campaigns, but we\u2019re working with each hub to get your rewards sent out as soon as possible.\nWhat About The New Dice?"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #82", "update_userinfo": "Shipping and Translucent Smoke Dice", "update_content": "Hail, Champions - the boats carrying your rewards have set sail!\nHere\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #81", "update_userinfo": "Here's What You're Getting", "update_content": "Hail, Champions!\nFollowing our last update, we wanted to show you exactly what you\u2019re getting.\nSo, here\u2019s a quick breakdown:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #80", "update_userinfo": "Changes to Retail Prices and the Chosen Pledge", "update_content": "Retail Prices - What's Changed?\nAt the start of this campaign, we set suggested retail prices so you, our backers, would get value for money.\nBecause of changes to exchange rates, we had to take another look at retail to give Godtear the best chance in the marketplace:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #79", "update_userinfo": "Pledge Manager Closes Friday 27th September at 08:00 BST", "update_content": "Champions!

We were lucky to have the backing of over 6,000 awesome fans worldwide.  We released the retail edition in late 2017 and then something unexpected happened.  It sold out instantly and started going for ridiculous prices on the secondary market.   Then our backers started raving about the game online.  Tom Vasel of the Dice Tower named it one of his top 5 games of 2017 and we were awarded with 4 Golden Geek nominations including strategy game of the year, thematic game of the year, best artwork and presentation and overall game of the year.  It's been a wild ride for Dino Island since it was first unleashed on the world just a few months ago.\nDinosaur Island has been sold out since about the moment it went on sale and we've heard the constant calls to make the Kickstarter exclusives from the last campaign available again.  And we've been listening.\nDinosaur Island is a hot new game from designers Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter) and Brian Lewis; from Pandasaurus Games with amazing, technicolor, ridiculously 90s artwork from Kwanchai Moriya and Peter Wocken.  \n1-4 Players; 60-150 minutes (scalable length regardless of player count), ages 10+  \nIn Dinosaur Island, players will have to collect DNA, research the DNA sequences of extinct dinosaur species and then combine the ancient DNA in the correct sequence to bring these prehistoric creatures back to life. Dino cooking! All players will compete to build the most thrilling park each season, and then work to attract (and keep alive!) the most guests each season that the park opens. Do you go big and create a pack of Velociraptors? They'll definitely excite potential guests... but you better make a large enough enclosure for them. And maybe hire some (read: a lot of) security. Or they WILL break out and start eating your guests\u2014and we all know how that ends. You could play it safe and grow a bunch of herbivores... but then you aren't going to have the most exciting park in the world (sad face). So maybe buy a roller coaster or two to try and attract guests to your park the good old fashioned way?   \nThe X-treme editions are a chance for us at Team Pandasaurus to add some really fun stuff to Dinosaur Island that we can't afford to include at retail.\nFor the base game, that means bringing back almost all of the stretch goals from Dinosaur Island 1.0.  The Dino Meeples, new slimmer metal coins, researcher Beaker Meeples and all of the Kickstarter exclusive plot twists (Purple Die, VIP Meeples, Extra Hooligans) that weren't able to include in the retail edition of the game for cost reasons.  Oh, and a brand new slap-bracelet first player marker that is exclusive to the X-Treme edition.  And of course, spot UV and metallic ink on the box lid!\nAnd for backers of Dino Island 1.0?  As a thank you, any backers who jump into this new campaign for either Duelosaur or Totally Liquid will get the new slap-bracelet as a free thank you for supporting us a second time around!\nFor Duelosaur Island and Totally Liquid it means a new X-treme edition box with spot UV box, metallic ink box and stretch goals that we can't afford to include in the retail editions of these games.  These will be Kickstarter exclusive editions that will not be available at retail, so grab 'em now!\nUpgrade Kits: For those of you who may already have a copy of Dinosaur Island and want an upgrade kit (all the X-treme edition goodies minus the exclusive Spot UV/foil cover art), we are going to offer that after the end of the campaign during the backer-kit or you can add 30 dollars to your pledge now per upgrade kit you want.  These are only available as an add-on item to another pledge tier and will ship when those items are available.  \nWe've been asking players what they wanted from a Dinosaur Island expansion for the last year+ and have been listening, working and testing (and testing, and testing) and Dinosaur Island: Totally Liquid is the result!  We'll be revealing Water Dinoz, new extensions and executives throughout the campaign so keep your eyes glued here for new content!\nAnd yes, we have been listening.   Introducing Moriya Labs, the 5th player expansion for the game!\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid adds lots of cool new mechanisms to the game on top of a 5th player setup.  The Blueprint Module gives all players bonus points for following the plans laid out on the card!   \nThe Park extension gives players a new extension to the board that gives them a unique way to score points and unique mechanics to explore separately from all other players.  The Executive Worker gives each player a unique worker to their corporation that acts completely differently from any other worker in the game.  \nBelow you see some examples from Mega Rex who is a really hard to make dinosaur (2 of each advanced DNA!) and is extra dangerous, but the guests love him!  Build seating and up to 8 guests will come to see him!   The CFO worker gives you a new way to make money by placing him on an item in the marketplace and gaining the payment for yourself instead of the bank!\n And we're just getting started.  PR events will be introduced during the campaign along with additional Executive workers and Park Extension boards!\nCheck out all the shmancy components in Totally Liquid!\nPandasaurus Games is proud to announce a brand new stand-alone 2 player sequel to Dinosaur Island: Duelosaur Island!  \nDesigned by Ian Moss and developed by Dinosaur Island designer Jon Gilmour, Duelosaur has completely unique mechanics that make it an amazing experience that is sure to add to anyone\u2019s collection.\nDuelosaur Island brings back a lot of the same feeling that players loved about Dinosaur Island, but introduces an entirely new hand-management tableau-building engine that is unlike anything you\u2019ve seen in Dinosaur Island, and a really tense \u201cI cut you choose\u201d dice drafting mechanic.  The first-player will roll the DNA dice and give each die a different bonus, with the second player choosing the DNA to take first.  So, do you give the DNA you want the best bonus and risk your opponent taking it?\nDuelosaur is built around a clever hand management mechanism. Each card in the game serves 3 potential purposes. They contain the DNA sequences for dinosaurs you could create, the blueprints for attractions you can build and also are discarded to take certain actions. Do you create the Dinosaur on the top of the card attracting guests to your park? Or do you build the attraction on the bottom of the card, which can grant PR bonuses, income and end-game VP? Or do you discard the card to combine DNA towards creating another dinosaur. Duelosaur Island comes with 5 brand new full-color \u201cDNA dice\u201d. You can mix and match dice between Dinosaur Island and Duelosaur Island for even more variability in both games. Adding a copy of Duelosaur Island to your collection is going to unlock lots of cool new possibilities in Dinosaur Island like the brand-new security symbol that can appear on dice to upgrade your security level instantly! Mixing these dice in with the Dinosaur Island dice is a great way to add replayability to both Duelosaur Island and Dinosaur Island.\nDinosaur Island Rulebook\nDinosaur Island: Totally Liquid  Alpha Rulebook (non-final layout, non-final text)\nDuelosaur Island  Alpha Rulebook (non final layout, non-final text)\nPandasaurus Games will be working with partners to deliver the game worldwide. This project will be EU, Canada, China, US and Australia friendly!  \nAfter the campaign ends, we will be charging actual shipping costs. We want to strike a fair balance of value for our backers while ensuring high quality fair shipping prices for each backer. By shipping within the EU, Australia, China, Canada and the United States we are hoping to get as favorable of shipping rates as possible. We will be working with well-vetted partners in each region who have experience with Kickstarter reward fulfillment and come highly recommended by other publishers within the industry, and will take into account good (and bad) experiences that other publishers have experienced.  \nOur goal is for the average shipping costs for backers in the EU, US, Canada, Australia and China to be under 20 USD with shipping for backers outside of these regions to come from the most cost-effective area for the lowest possible shipping price.  \nBackers in some regions, especially the Middle East, Africa, South and Central America may experience high shipping fees which reflect the actual cost of shipping to these areas in excess of 50 USD. Please be aware of this before backing the project.\nWe are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. Learn more about Quartermaster Logistics at qmlogistics.com\nSplitting Shipments\nAfter the campaign ends, we will allow backers to split shipments of titles so that they ship as they become available.  This will be up to individual backers if you wish to get games earlier or wait for all items to become available to ship together to save money.   \nFor example if you pledge for the base game + Totally Liquid we expect the base game to be available this Summer while Totally Liquid won't be ready until the Fall.  You may choose to split the shipment to get the base game first or you can wait until both are ready to ship to save on shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPandasaurus Games is a 6-year-old board game publisher who has delivered hundreds of thousands of board games worldwide. We are confident in our ability to deliver the rewards listed and on time.\n\nDuelosaur and the base game are art complete and set to begin the pre-proof process with the printer during the campaign to ensure timeliness. Totally Liquid is 80% art complete and will finish during the campaign. Short of a production issue with some of the bespoke components, delays in shipping or issues with proofing that require reworks, we intend to release the game on time. We will always choose quality production over timeliness, so delay of the game is possible, but we will be ready to hit the printer with final components right at the end of the campaign.\n\nThere is the chance of delay in shipping or customs that is largely out of the control of our company, but we are experienced in moving products through customs. Of course, with multiple freight solutions going to various parts of the world it's possible some regions will get the game more quickly than others. Our goal is to ship the game as soon as it lands on any continent, so we'll have to ask for your patience if some regions get the game before others.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Duelosaur Island X-Treme Edition", "descp": "Pledge for the brand new stand-alone 2 player game Duelosaur Island!\n*Shipping charge is done at the end of the campaign (see shipping section for details)\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Duelosaur Island -

We\u2019re also an independent nonprofit on a simple but critical mission: help kids everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder.  \nFor almost 50 years, we\u2019ve brought learning and laughter to children around the world \u2013 with the help of a passionate community of supporters. Today, we\u2019re asking that community to join us as we try something new: our first-ever crowdfunding campaign! With your help, we can expand our autism initiative to tackle bullying prevention.\nCrowdfunding lets people like you make a big difference for causes you care about. New to Kickstarter? You're in good company. Around the world, over 14 million people have contributed to all kinds of Kickstarter projects. To fund this anti-bullying project, we need to raise $75,000 in about thirty days. When you make a pledge, you're promising to help us reach that goal. But we can only accept the donations \u2013 and start the work \u2013 if we can raise the money by Friday, May 11th. Let's get started!\nSesame\u2019s autism work has already been making a splash. We created Julia, the first Sesame Street Muppet with autism, as a digital-only storybook character in 2015. Readers loved her so much that we brought her to life on the broadcast show last April. \nJulia\u2019s television debut was greeted with hundreds of media stories and millions of social media impressions, but the biggest marker of our success was the overwhelming response from the autism community and beyond. Parents say their autistic children have more playdates because of Julia. Teachers report that their students are more inclusive in their play. One mother told us that she used the first Julia storybook to explain to her daughter that she, too, has autism. Her daughter responded, \u201cSo I\u2019m amazing too, right?\u201d\nAn estimated one in 68 children in the United States is on the autism spectrum. While the diagnosis is common, public understanding of autism is not. Research shows that children with autism are five times more likely to be bullied than their neurotypical peers.\nIn storybooks, articles, videos, and Sesame Street episodes, we\u2019ve worked to support families of autistic children and reduce the isolating stigmas and misconceptions that still surround autism. But now, we\u2019re at a critical turning point. The Sesame Street and Autism: See Amazing in All Children initiative has made great strides with support from our existing partners, but to tackle the next big topic \u2013 how to prevent bullying by fostering empathy and compassion \u2013 we need you.\nWe\u2019ve mapped out a multi-step plan to address bullying as it affects the autism community \u2013 starting with an enhanced digital storybook. Drawing on an extensive body of research, we\u2019ll create a kid-appropriate story about understanding differences using everyday activities and play. Like our other Julia storybooks, it will offer parents and caregivers a safe and accessible starting point for deeper conversations with their children.\n\nContributions to the campaign will fund:\nRigorous work with expert advisers across some of the 250 autism organizations that helped us build the See Amazing initiative, ensuring that we\u2019re telling the right story in the right way \n\nWriting, editing, and illustrating an uplifting story that models inclusive play, starring the beloved Sesame Street Muppets\n  Supplementary materials for kids and adults, including articles for parents and caregivers that will address bullying in a direct and empowering way\n\nRecording sessions with the Sesame Street cast to provide audio for the digital storybook \n\nTranslation work and additional recording sessions to version the storybook, articles, and other materials in Spanish (and potentially other languages) adjusting for cultural and linguistic nuances\nOur initial goal of $75,000 will allow us to do the above. But there's more we can do, too. If we reach our first stretch goal \u2014 $150,000 \u2014 we\u2019ll be able to create a printed storybook version of the story that we\u2019ll distribute free of charge to 40,000 kids via our growing network of partner organizations. We\u2019ll get all these resources in the hands of kids and families by April 2019.\nWondering if this project is funded by HBO or PBS? The simple answer is: no. We\u2019ve always been a completely independent nonprofit organization. Distribution partners like HBO, PBS, and YouTube help us make Sesame Street available to kids and families everywhere. We\u2019re sustained by a combination of donations, grants, and licensing revenue from toys and products, all of which we reinvest to create more Sesame Street programming and resources. Initiatives like See Amazing in All Children are only possible because of charitable giving from members of our community who love what we do.\n\nAll our work is grounded in research \u2013 especially when we\u2019re entering sensitive spaces like bullying in the autism community \u2013 and produced with the rigor and care that generations of parents have come to trust.  \nBy contributing to this Kickstarter campaign, supporting the Sesame Street Yellow Feather Fund, or spreading the word on social media, you\u2019ll join a proud tradition of helping amazing kids everywhere grow smarter, stronger, and kinder.\nWe know you\u2019re supporting our Kickstarter campaign because you want to help children \u2013 and we appreciate you!

So no cover lasts forever and the line of sight changes constantly.\nA mature story told from the perspective of the three different factions. Each faction has three playable hero characters that offer additional options in combat and reconnaissance.\nLead dozens of different unit types into battle. Soldiers can equip weapons on the battlefield to gain special abilities and more firepower.\nBuild your base and add fortification to protect your unit production and research.\nAs a Kickstarter backer, you have the opportunity to get all of this in our Exclusive Kickstarter Edition:\nIron Harvest takes place in the World of 1920+. It is an alternate version of our own world created by Polish artist Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski. In the early 20th century, tradition clashes with progress, and the world is still full of mysteries and secrets.\nHumankind, fascinated by technology, iron, and engines, invented powerful walking machines, that proved to be mighty weapons on the battlefields of the Great War and are now part of everyday life.\nNow, a few years after the Great War, secret forces are working towards the destabilization of Europe, determined to set the world on fire and seize control.\n\nFactions\nThere are three playable factions in the game, each with over a dozen individual units and three playable heroes.\nThe Saxony Empire is one of the most influential countries in Europe, with powerful industry, developed cities, modern factories and a strong military tradition. After the unfavorable conditions of surrender in the Great War, the current mood in the Empire is bad, and proud elites and humiliated aristocrats secretly oppose the Emperor\u2019s appeasement policies.\nThe Polania Republic is a large agricultural country with a long history. It is trying to maintain its status and territory, struggling with its aggressive neighbors: The Saxony Empire in the west and Rusviet in the east. Polania initiated a program to modernize its army while a large part of the country is still occupied by Rusviet forces.\nRusviet is huge, powerful, and has unmatched industrial and population potential. However, the country is tired and worn out by the long war. People are frustrated, and the power of Tsar Nikolaj weakens. Mysterious Grigori Rasputin has become an extraordinarily powerful man and revolution is in the air...\n\nHeroes & Units\nIron Harvest features three singleplayer campaigns with one over-arching story. In the story, you switch sides from Polania to Rusviet to Saxony.\nIn each campaign, you follow the story of one main character, who is joined by two other heroes. Heroes in Iron Harvest are not unstoppable \u201csuper units\u201d, but units with special abilities, that give you additional options in combat. You can play all nine heroes in multiplayer and skirmish matches as well.\nHere are the first three heroes (from left to right). Anna, a Polania girl, who becomes a capable sniper and a symbol of the resistance, Gunter, an experienced warrior and legendary commander, and Olga, a Rusviet spy who operates in the shadows and is close to the Tzar.\nSome heroes have pets they can control in battle, like Anna\u2019s bear Wojtek, Gunter\u2019s dire wolves Tag and Nacht or Olga\u2019s tiger Changa. Others have unique mechs or weapons to their disposal.\nInfantry units are the most versatile units in the game. They can equip different weapons and tools to get new abilities or to change the type of damage they deal. A standard infantry with a rifle cannot harm a mech, but the very same infantry squad could find grenades, mines or a hand cannons on the battlefield to change that...\nInfantry units can also man weapon systems like heavy MGs, cannons and mortars.\n \n\nRelationship to the board game \"Scythe\"\n\"Scythe\" is an awesome board game by Stonemaier Games, taking place in the same world. The gameplay is totally different. Iron Harvest is not a digital version of Scythe or anything like that, they are two different games by different companies, taking place in the same world, based on the artworks by Jakub R\u00f3\u017calski.\nUp to this point we paid for the Iron Harvest development with money we made with our previous games. But we need your help to stay independent and make the game as good and as big as we all want it to be. These are our funding goals for the Iron Harvest Kickstarter campaign and the goal is to reach all of them.\n(Including PayPal Payments)\nThis is the base game with all the units, features and tech described above, including the full ~20 hours singleplayer campaign, the base-building, the destructable environments, the heroes and so on.\n$500,000 - New Game Plus - After you finished the campaign, \u201cNew Game Plus\u201d gives you the opportunity to play it again with new challenges and rewards, increasing the total play time significantly.\n$600,000 - Cinematic Cutscenes - We put a lot of effort into the quality of the campaign story and we want to present it in the best way possible, which is in-game cinematics between missions.\n$750,000 - Single Player Challenge Maps - A collection of maps for experienced commanders with specific tasks to solve. Each map has its own \u201chook\u201d and the goal is to master each one of them.\n$850,000 - Skirmish Mode - A single player mode that lets you fight against the AI. Since you make the rules and there are almost infinite ways to play, this is the mode you can play forever.\nAt this stage, the game will feature competitive multiplayer maps you can play against other players all over the world.\n$1,100,000 - Co-op Campaign - You can play the whole singleplayer campaign with a friend, controlling the same units. So you can divide your units into two combat groups or one player plays the offense while the other manages defense and production.\n$1,150,000 - Co-op Challenges - A couple of challenge maps especially designed for co-op. Think coordinated attacks on enemy bases or \u201cstay alive until your co-op partner reaches you.\u201d\n$1,200,000 - Ladder & Seasons - We will have ranked multiplayer  and seasons. You can unlock skins, gain medals and fight for the top position in your region.\nWe won\u2019t add new features to the base game, even if the Kickstarter is very successful. It is very dangerous to make a game bigger and bigger, just because you can. Instead, we\u2019ll release the base game as planned and add a free mini DLC campaign later on. Think \u201cCompany of Heroes - Tiger Ace\u201d.\n\nTimeline  \nWe will keep all backers up to date about development progress via a development blog and regular updates here on Kickstarter. Our goal is to get work-in-progress versions of the game into your hands as soon as possible to get your feedback. Here is the plan:\nThis means, if the Alpha-Version is part of your reward, you will be able to play for the first time in a couple of months. Most likely, the Alpha- and Beta-Versions will get some updates, so there will be new content between the big updates.\nAlpha1 is going to be a very early singleplayer test version that\u2018s all about the basics: Controls, UI, basic gameplay, main units, performance/compatibility and so on.\nAlpha2 will focus on multiplayer (if we reach the stretch-goal) and enables you to play against other backers for the first time.\nBeta: First look at all the game modes, including first single player campaign missions.\nThis is our fourth Kickstarter, and hopefully the fourth successful one. We got infected with the crowdfunding bug in 2014, when a dedicated community of gamers enabled us to make Battle Worlds: Kronos, a turn-based strategy game.\nOur next two crowdfunded productions, the point-and-click adventure The Book of Unwritten Tales 2 and the RPG/RTS mix The Dwarves have been great experiences as well.\nWe believe one of our biggest strengths is that the team worked together for years on multiple games. We will make Iron Harvest the RTS we\u2019re all waiting for.\nWe are a very international team. Our office is in Bremen, Germany. Jakub works from his home in southern Poland, our external artists live all over the world - as does our community.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want our games to be LOVED by our fans. So we ask you guys what you actually want from a modern RTS and, unsurprisingly, many of the over 15,000 gamers that took part in our great RTS survey want something different from what the big mainstream publishers offer.\nHere are the results of our survey: www.kingart-games.com/rts_survey\nWe want to work with our community and get as much feedback as early as possible to make the RTS that fans actually want. We need to keep full creative control over Iron Harvest to do that. Your support here on Kickstarter enables us either to finance the full development by ourselves or to negotiate a publisher deal on our terms. In both cases we can make the RTS of our dreams.\n\nBudget\nThe development of an ambitious game like Iron Harvest takes a lot of time and is expensive. On average, there will be around 25 people working on the game. The total development costs will be over $5,2 million.\nWe already invested over $1 million up to this point. We hope to make enough money with this Kickstarter to be able to find publishing- and distribution partners on our terms and conditions. Or \u2013 in the best case \u2013 to crowdfund the whole project.\n\nPlatforms\nWe are developing Iron Harvest for Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.\nPlease note: The Kickstarter Alpha & Beta versions will ONLY be available for Windows via Steam. We cannot just upload work-in-progress versions to Sony or Microsoft servers.\nIf you back a console version, you\u2019ll get a PC key for the Alpha and Beta versions and a console key at release.\nWindows version means Windows version; console versions mean console versions - There are concerns in the community, developing console versions in parallel might lead to compromises for the Windows version. We understand where these concerns are coming from. But in case of Iron Harvest, they are not warranted.\nBoth versions of the game will get a totally independent control scheme and user interface. So no decision made on the console side has an influence on the Windows controls or UI.\nWe already did tests regarding controller inputs and we think we found a solution that\u2019s better than anything out there. This control-scheme works just fine with the gameplay we've designed for PC.\nAnd even if we'd have to change something for consoles, we'd not be looking for the smallest common denominator. Instead we would adjust gameplay for consoles without changing it for Windows.\nThe console version is very important for us. We believe there is a hunger for great RTS games on consoles since there are so few. Moreover, making the game multi-platform leads to more interest in the game when it comes to the media and publishers, which helps everybody.\nWhat about Nintendo Switch? \u2013 There are huge Switch-fans in the company but the probability of Iron Harvest coming to the Switch is slim due to technical limitations.\nAnd what about Linux and Mac versions? \u2013 We released most of our games for Linux and Mac. Nevertheless, at this point, we do not want to promise something we might not be able to deliver. On the technology side, Iron Harvest is much more complex than our other games, for example because of the multiplayer features. Therefore, we are going to evaluate Linux/Mac versions at a later point in time.\nOne of the best things about Kickstarter is giving you guys the opportunity to get supercool editions of the game that wouldn\u2019t be possible otherwise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur team has been successfully developing and releasing video games for years, so we expect to be able to complete a Kickstarter project again!

But you realize something is missing\u2026 it\u2019s those scratches behind your ears\u2026 those enthusiastic belly rubs\u2026 the sound of a hooman calling you a \u201cgood dog\u201d...\nSo it\u2019s time to brave the apocalypse and search the city for hooman survivors, bring them back to Central Bark, and build a place you can call your forever home!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a cooperative board game, where everyone plays together as a heroic dog pack. Together, you\u2019ll explore a post-apocalyptic city while sniffing out scents, barking at the undead, and herding hoomans to safety.\nSomewhere out there, our hoomans are waiting!\nYour goal in Good Dog, Bad Zombie is to find the scaredy hoomans that are hiding around the crumbling metropolis. To do so, you\u2019ll have to investigate scent tokens in different city locations, such as Squirreltown, the Boneyard, and Worst Place.\nEach scent could reveal a hooman in hiding, or a lurking danger - like a zombie mailman, a barn full of bats, or too much kibble for one pup to handle!\nWhen you do find a hooman, your job isn\u2019t done yet. You\u2019ll need to use your energy cards\u2014and the support of the other dogs in your pack\u2014to lead the hooman to safety. Use cards like \u201cRUFF RUFF BARK GRR-RUFF RUFF!!!\u201d and \u201cHooman in danger! HOOMAN IN DANGER!!\u201d to guide the hooman away from hungry zombies!\nChase the zombies!\nAs you play, new zombies will spawn throughout the city and constantly move toward Central Bark! To keep all your hoomans safe, you\u2019ll need to fend off the zombies. Chase them far enough, and they\u2019ll tumble over the cliffs or be swept away in the river.\nZombies can\u2019t resist the smell of freshly rescued hoomans!\nRescue all the hoomans!\nFind and rescue 6 hoomans, and Central Bark will become your new forever home. Everyone wins!\nSix hoomans safe in central bark.\nBut every time a hooman is lost to the horde or a zombie slips into Central Bark, your pack becomes more feral.\nWe must strive to remember the kindness of hoomans!\nIf the feral track reaches 10, your pack reverts to the ways of their wolf ancestors and forgets what it means to feel the love of a hooman. Everyone loses!\nBe a dog!\nWe wanted to infuse our game with as much dogginess as possible. Be prepared to say things such as, \u201cI\u2019m going to lick myself!\u201d and \u201cI howl at you!\u201d\nYou\u2019ll help your fellow dogs by licking and howling, boosting their energy to help them outwit the zombies! Herd and bark at each other to escape dangerous situations and reach defenseless hoomans faster.\nIn Good Dog, Bad Zombie, there\u2019s no room for the lone wolf. Each dog will support the pack with their own unique skills!\nLupin\u2019s \u201cSnuggle\u201d ability unleashes an energizing flurry of licking!\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is for 1 - 5 players, and takes 45 - 60 minutes to play. Choose your preferred difficulty setting when the game begins - take it easy with the \"Walk in the Park,\" or fend off a massive zombie onslaught with the \"Hounds of the Barkalypse\" setup. Whatever you decide, you can expect an adventure full of close calls, laughing players, and doggie heroics!\nWatch these short, behind the scenes video clips of playtests from Good Dog, Bad Zombie over the years!\nPLAY\n\nGood Dog, Bad Zombie is a game for people who love dogs and prefer not to be eaten alive by zombies.\nWhat's in the box?\nThe base game comes with:\nThe rulebook (you can check out the playtest draft here!)\nThe city board\nHooman town\nFeral track with marker\n8 Dog player sheets\n8 Illustrated Dog tokens\n18 Illustrated Zombie tokens\n12 Hooman cards\n3 Illustrated Hooman tokens\n64 Energy cards\n54 Scent cards\n3 Scent tokens\nCommunity Printers and Ethical Manufacturing\nMake Big Things is committed to producing our games ethically, as much as possible. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve teamed up with Community Printers to manufacture Good Dog, Bad Zombie. Community Printers is a worker-owned cooperative, like Make Big Things, meaning that everyone who works there democratically owns and runs the business.

So not only will Good Dog, Bad Zombie be good for the hoomans making it, it\u2019ll be good for the earth, too!\nWe\u2019re thrilled to partner with One Tail at a Time for this campaign. One Tail is a no-kill, all-breed dog rescue \u201ccommitted to lowering euthanasia rates in the greater Chicagoland area through the rescue and adoption of dogs in need; comprehensive support of adopters; and community outreach through humane education programs and assistance for disadvantaged and low-income families.\u201d Since 2008, OTAT has facilitated the rescue of over 2,300 dogs.\nYour backing helps us gift a care package to dogs like Reuben, Imogene, and Ms. Roscoe.\nWhile Kickstarter guidelines do not allow us to contribute monetarily to non-profits with a percentage of the proceeds raised from this campaign, they do allow us to purchase materials as a part of your backer rewards! Therefore, each of the backer levels starting at $75 or more will allow us to purchase items from One Tail at a Time\u2019s wish list. Via One Tail at a Time, these items will make their way into the paws and mouths of dogs in need in the Chicagoland area.\nWe are excited to offer some amazing rewards for Good Dog, Bad Zombie! Below is a detailed list of what you\u2019ll receive for contributing to the campaign:\nWant to add extra copies of the game to any backer level? Just add $35 to your pledge per additional copy.

Like, a lot.\nAnd while Good Dog, Bad Zombie is certainly funny, we wanted to also make a game that is challenging, engaging, heartwarming, and a unique experience from the story to the gameplay. We\u2019ve been developing and playtesting the game for three years \u2013 re-designing, re-imagining, and re-writing more times than we can count on one paw. And we\u2019ve had consistent meetings about barking, howling, and growling.\nWe\u2019ve loved seeing people, old and young, experienced gamers and novices alike, play the game and become emotionally invested in the doggo characters and the outcomes of their stories. We also strove to develop a game that was truly cooperative: where everyone had to work together and no single player could dominate the game. It\u2019s been wonderful seeing this vision come to life.\n Make Big Things\nEvan, Hannah, Brian\u2014and Lupin the dog!\nMake Big Things is a game design cooperative.

Here is a quick explanation of the platform:\nGenerally speaking, Kickstarter lets us raise money from lots of people so we can make and deliver our product.\nIt\u2019s all or nothing: If we don\u2019t meet our goal by the end date of this campaign, April 12 at 9 PM Eastern Standard Time, we won\u2019t receive any funds (and you won\u2019t be charged anything for pledging).\nIf we\u2019re successful, you won\u2019t be charged until the campaign closes on April 12th - so pledging early is a big help! We know some people may want to wait to pledge until closer to the end of the campaign for financial reasons. Your payment method will not be charged until the campaign is completed on April 12th, no matter when you choose to pledge. Pledging early is also a big help in creating momentum for the campaign!\nCan I still pledge if you\u2019ve already reached your goal? Absolutely! If we are fortunate enough to reach our initial goal, we\u2019ll release additional \u201cstretch goals\u201d that will allow us to add more content and features to the game while producing more copies!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our fifth Kickstarter campaign for Make Big Things! We love Kickstarting games, and we take the responsibility seriously. \n\nIn our experience, the things that tend to slow down projects are manufacturing defects, shipping hiccups, and timeline miscalculations. We\u2019ve worked through all of these before, and we feel confident in our abilities. If we experience unexpected delays, we\u2019ll let you know what\u2019s going on! Right now, the game is virtually complete. We\u2019re in the final stages: working to finish the art and incorporate it throughout the game, and then working with an editor to finalize the rulebook and make sure it\u2019s as accessible as possible.\n\nIf we meet our funding goal, you\u2019ll be receiving a beautiful, complete game that we hope you\u2019ll love just as much as we do.

Whoever can use their resources and automaton workers to earn the most Prestige when Opening Day comes will go down in history as the founder of the City of Gears.\nCity of Gears starts with 9 random city tiles placed in a 3x3 grid face down, waiting to be discovered.  With 18 different tiles, no two games are ever the same.\nOn their turn, players roll resource dice to gain Gears, Steam and Charges. Gears are used to either give yourself new powers or to make new connections that help you gain access to and control over new parts of the city (see example below).\nSteam can be used to deploy your automaton workers to city tiles.\nCharges can either rapidly move your workers around the city or can be used to destroy opponents' gear links or send opponents' workers back to their factory.\nWorkers on building tiles can activate buildings in the City of Gears, earning clever players a chain reaction of benefits (see example below).\nOnce the city is uncovered, Opening Day creeps closer and development speeds up in the city. The game will end immediately once the third Opening Day gear is drawn from the bag.\nPlayers who control parts of the city when Opening Day hits will earn extra Prestige. Whoever has the most Prestige wins!\nIf you are new to Kickstarter, the add-ons are the most confusing thing in terms of pledging since they do not work on a \"cart\" system like everything else does on the internet. In order to \"purchase\" an Add-on, simply add the cost of the add-on(s) you would like to your pledge amount.  \nExample 1: You live in the US and want to add-on the Juggernaut. You simply add $10 to your pledge amount as there is no charge for shipping for this add-on.\nExample 2: You live in Taiwan and you chose the Founders Pledge and would like to add another copy of the Founders Edition and two Juggernaut add-ons. You would add an additional $59 for the game, $2 for shipping and $10 for each Juggernaut, increasing your pledge by $81.\nAt some point after the campaign, we will send you an email with a link to the pledge manager, in here you will \"spend\" that extra money you pledged letting us know what add-ons you wanted before we ship your stuff.\nCost:\n  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.  \nTracking:  \nWe will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time:  \nWhile we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible (we've already done a ton of the prep work). At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nOther:  \nLastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.\nWhy back this campaign?\nWhile we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you a discount off of the $59.99 MSRP planned for this title in the retail version or the exclusive Founders' edition of the game. It also gets you access to exclusive city tiles and any exclusive stretch goals we unlock that won't be available at retail. Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands long before someone can get it from an online retailer. If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to making the first ever board gaming yacht, the Monochromatic Vulpine, a reality (just kidding about the yacht...or are we?).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

My previous work has covered all aspects of miniature production from design to manufacturing, and ranges from working with metal to resin and also plastic materials. Now I am creating my own line of high quality figures and am asking for your help to meet my goals. This project will begin with 10 figures and will expand to add more figures, add-ons, and freebies. If a picture is worth a thousand words than these images should speak for themselves.\nThank you for your interest and support!\nTHE MODELS\nThese are the BP (Base Pledge) models available with perks from LV1 to LV11.

For more details please feel free to contact us.\nAll retailers models will come with appropriate packaging for display.\nFreebies are not counted in this perk.\nSHIPPING\nShipping costs for rewards will be charged after the campaign and added in the pledge manager. This approach allows us to charge only the actual shipping costs incurred, which will vary based on how many miniatures you take. For 10 or more miniatures the shipping price will be for DHL Worldwide Shipping, with a delivery time between 3 and 5 days. Online tracking will be provided.\nWe are now also Canada and Australia friendly shipping!\nWhat does this mean? Well we will charge each backer only 1$ for shipping + local Canadian service. This should make shipping cost lower for you and will not involve import taxes. Why? Well we will be paying the taxes for you. New updated prices coming soon for AU and CA!\nEstimated delivery date?\nEstimated delivery for this project is May/June 2018. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as factory delays, customs, or an additional miniature unlocked late in the campaign. However, please note that we are confident that delays, if any at all, will be brief.\nTHE DESIGN PROCESS\nOur team has many years of experience in miniature design and production. We understand that there is no better way to judge the quality of a model than to hold it in your own hand. The proportions and every detail of a model are best experienced in person. Drawing from our experience and utilizing the best techniques and methods available we stick to the following in order to achieve the best results for each of our models.\n\n1 - DETAILS - Yes, a rendered image looks great, but how well will it paint? We balance details by not overcrowding them and knowing that simple clean lines will produce better finished results both in production and painting.\n2 - RENDERS - Renders are just the beginning. All of our models are printed at a high quality for evaluation after they are initially designed. We inspect these test prints to ensure that details and proportions are as intended before committing them to production.\n3 - SCALE - Not too big not too small -  We want our models to be compatible with the majority of game systems currently on the market. Presently the most common scale has become 32mm. \n4 - PRODUCTION - It is not easy to produce the high quality of detail that we aim for in resin models. Knowledge, experience and dedication come together to enable us to achieve this goal. A significant part of our success in production starts in the design process. clean lines and the right quantity of individual pieces enable a higher quality of production.\n5 - MATERIAL - For this project we have selected some of the highest quality resin available on the market. Our resin will withstand heat and will also be as flexible as possible. All to help your models avoid actual damage on the battlefield.\n\n6 - UNIQUENESS - One thing we've learned is that each model is different and we approach every new piece with the understanding and expectation that it must be optimized in a unique way. We could write a book covering all of the considerations that come into play for each model, but instead we will just put that experience to work.\nACTUAL PAINTED MODELS\nThe models below are actual miniatures painted by various artists, they are not colored 3D render images.\nPAINTING OFFERS\nBlue Table Painting has offered a deal to get the models painted.\nAny order that will be sent to them will get:\n1) Priority Shipping - Gets shipped First\n2) FREE Shipping (we pay shipping to them)\nBlue Table Painting offers:\n1) No assembly fee saves you 6$ each model\n2) Discounted Rates (Only level 5 or superior) \n\nL = Level (L5 = Level 5) you can see the corresponding quality on BTP website. \nVIDEOS FROM PAINTERS\nSIZE COMPARISON\nCourtesy of Den of Imagination, this picture shows the actual model next to other brand miniatures for scale comparison.\n  Games Workshop models shown only for scale purposes, no association is intended.\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS\nReaching 4000 likes is not an easy task, but if we do all backers from Lv1 and above will get the STL file to print their own Heresy Walls.\nWalls were used for the Lady of Decay Box Art picture below:\nThe walls are original designs by: WARLAYER\nSO HOW DOES IT ALL WORK?\nOnce we have raised the funds to reach our funding goal, the models will be produced at the end of the campaign.\nHowever, reaching the funding goal is not the end!\nThe campaign will continue beyond the basic rewards of the project and the more people who join the project, the more stretch goals will be unlocked.\nThe beauty of crowdfunding on Kickstarter is that you can choose how much to spend at any time during the project. This means you can join the project and pledge to get all the rewards of the campaign and are still free to change your mind until the very last minute of the campaign. Conversely, if you like our  models you could join with one of the lower pledges and then decide to change your pledge and get a more expensive pledge or add-ons instead. You don't have to worry about choosing the right option, because you can change your pledge at any time. After the funding goal is reached we will announce new stretch goals for the project. The stretch goals will either unlock new add-ons or add free items to your existing pledge, so the more people who join the project the more free items you will get without having to spend. This is a very good reason to help us spread the word on social media and in your own community of gamers. If your friends join the project then both you and they will benefit from it at no additional cost.\nLINKS\nLate Backers\nDon't want to use a credit card? Or want to join at a later time?

Now we are back on Kickstarter with our second product to continue this journey where it was started.\nIt\u2019s mind bending to see water levitate on Earth because of gravity of course. Well, as you may know from our previous Kickstarter project, we like to tease gravity. So, we\u2019re pleased to announce our next product, LeviZen, the mind blowing liquid levitator!\nWe\u2019d like to think that LeviZen brings outer space on your desk by giving you the chance to experience water in zero gravity in person for the first time. Meticulously crafted from fine walnut wood and precision machined aluminum, LeviZen is fundamentally a liquid levitator using high frequency sound waves which are not audible to our ears.\nWhen observed, water is a magical material, it\u2019s formless and it adapts it\u2019s shape to the object it\u2019s poured in. But when it\u2019s suspended in the air, its character is unveiled and all of a sudden you can see water for the first time.\nLet\u2019s take up a notch. Not only LeviZen can levitate water and liquids in general, it can make them light up in the air as well. The two spot LEDs placed in the base of the levitator targeted right at the levitating drop, make the drop glow like a light source as if the light itself is levitating.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nWe believe a product should express the owner by its design and functionality. Besides it\u2019s mind boggling properties we want your LeviZen to aesthetically make you proud showcasing it on your work desk, coffee table, end table, or a bookshelf.\nTo make the design as awesome as it\u2019s functionality, we decided to give LeviZen a retro look by using walnut wood with CNC machined and hand finished aluminum. Then, we put all the electronics in a separate box, called it \u201cThe Box\u201d and added three retro toggle switches for Power on/off, Light on/off, and moving the water drop up and down while it\u2019s levitating. We added an all aluminum knob for controlling the power level, a retro 7 segment display to show the power level, and rounded the top two corners just the right amount that LeviZen looked like a retro amplifier and stereo set in a quick glance. We are proud of our LeviZen sitting on our desk defying gravity by levitating water drops and we are sure you will too when you experience owning a LeviZen.\nThe Box is the control center for the levitating drop. Every liquid levitates at a different level. The denser the liquid is the more power it needs to levitate. For this, we added an all Aluminum metal knob that organically changes the power level by a simple turn while the 7 segmented display shows the resting power level. LeviZen not only can levitate liquids, it also can move the drop up and down while its levitating by one of the the three metal toggle switches on The Box. The other two toggle switches are the main power on/off and the light on/off controls.  \nLevitating multiple drops of water by LeviZen:\nPLAY\n\nMoving the Levitating drop up and down by using the top toggle switch on the Box:\nPLAY\n\nLeviZen levitates water using two identical sound waves that travel against each other which together create a standing wave. This wave has places on it where it does not move at all while all the other places of this wave move at maximum level. These non-moving places are called nodes. When a water drop is placed at the nodes, the water drop gets trapped by the standing waves' maximum moving parts beneath and above the nodes. And just like that we get a levitating water drop.\nWe want the world to experience water levitation. This phenomenon was invented many years ago and has been living in the science labs around the world ever since and there has not been a finished product in the market since then so everyone can simply buy and experience this surreal invention. We want to change that with LeviZen. Asier Marzo from the University of Bristol is one of the pioneers in the field of acoustic levitation and LeviZen is mostly based on one of his earlier works. We gathered all the information on sound levitation, figured out an efficient way of assembling LeviZen\u2019s 100+ parts, gave it a beautiful retro design, added a set of bright spot LEDs to make the liquid bubble glow like a lamp to make it even more mind blowing and came up with LeviZen. Now, everything is ready and we\u2019re ready to craft these machines so everyone around the world can experience the mind bending event of water levitation. \nNote: Asier Marzo is not affiliated in any way with LeviZen or Simplistyk and the use of his work is compliant with his research paper\u2019s license.

There is a clear reason as to why we encountered difficulties in fulfilling our previous project and why currently we are experiencing delays with LeviZen. The reason is that, established companies with big budgets and capabilities don\u2019t dare to think of making complicated products that require the utmost precision in manufacturing for just a very small group of customers and losing a lot of money. On the other hand, small companies and startups also don\u2019t dare to think of making these kind of products because they are aware of the extreme challenges and the risk imposed to the company with limited budget and man power. Simplistyk\u2019s vision is and has been to break this barrier and with our determination and knowledge of precision manufacturing both in-house and working with advanced local manufacturing partners here in California and the ability to design highly efficient and intuitive assembly processes, we turned this vision to reality with our previous project and will do the same with LeviZen. All being said, we do apologize for the delay and we want you to be aware that even though we don\u2019t share the complicated detail of our progress, we are definitely in the right path specially by the help of the flexible printed circuit boards (PCBs), the custom soldering/reflowing process, and the special multi-speaker assembly process using custom 3d fixtures. After we finished delivering our previous project, we were very proud of being able to establish a company that can actually produce very unique and high quality products for a very niche and unique market and after we finish delivering your LeviZens, we will be proud and confident that we would have the full capability to make and deliver our future projects in a timely manner. We will keep you updated of our progress and will share the details of the manufacturing and the assembly process as soon as they are finalized.

Our first project, Spin, is a precision product that needs to be crafted and assembled perfectly to function and that\u2019s exactly what we did and successfully made and shipped about 2000 of them to our backers. LeviZen is also a product that needs to be made with the utmost attention and the many more components of LeviZen need to be machined and made with tight tolerances to be perfectly aligned in assembly. But, a big difference that LeviZen has compared to Spin, is its assembly process because of its many parts. From individually soldering the 144 pins of the speakers to perfectly aligning the spot lights and fitting alot of electronics and wiring in the Box and the Levitator, to perfectly aligning and fastening all the individual parts together, LeviZen needs a very efficient and intuitive assembly line. We make some of the parts in-house like the machined and hand finished wooden and aluminum parts and we use our suppliers for the remaining parts. This is our first electronic product and also our first product that needs a lot of assembly besides our through quality control process. Our previous estimated assembly time for each LeviZen seems to have been very underestimated because of the complexity of LeviZen and currently we have a hold on the production of the parts until we succeed in creating a feasible in-house assembly line, and based on our previous experience, this shouldn\u2019t take long. We are aware that we had an estimated delivery of July and we do apologize for the delay but please note that it\u2019s a huge challenge for even an experienced company like us to manufacture and assemble a product like LeviZen with the utmost attention in California. Because of our extensive trial and error in the last two months, there is not much to show in pictures, but will include pictures in the upcoming updates as we design and finalize the new assembly process and get closer to start the production and shipping your LeviZen liquid levitating machines which is the first commercially available liquid levitator in the world and which you will receive before anyone else in the world.

The current version of the prototype uses Arduino, for quick edits in the operation of the device. But we can only use our own developments in a product that will enter the mass market. In theory, 2 + 2 = 4, but it is not always the same in practice. Every option requires thorough check. So now, we realize that some optimistic view of the time needed for testing has to be reassessed. We hope for your understanding. Let's face it, we are determined to complete this stage as soon as possible, since having a ready-made pre-production prototype should make it much easier for us to attract additional funding outside the site.\n\nThank you for attention,\nPicolor Team"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Hardware update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\n\n   We have completed the development of industrial design - an important and complex stage prior the pre-production prototype."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Some information about the work of Picolor app", "update_content": "   As you might know, the selection of color for reproduction with our device is done via mobile application."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #6", "update_userinfo": "New better solenoids", "update_content": "Dear Backers!\n\nMany thanks for your patience!

The soothing sounds of a gently flowing river. The glow of the moon. A bountiful harvest. Basic human emotions such as fear and rage. Even death. They all have an unseen force guiding them. And while these forces work together to make the world what it is, they each aspire for influence over those who believe in them.\nDesigned by Kolossal's own AJ Lambeth, Kami-sama is a beautiful and intuitive strategy game set in rural Japan during the Edo period. Two to four players will assume the roles of Kami, the spirits of the land. Using a combination of asymmetrical player powers, area control, set collection, pattern building, and light card drafting, players will work to balance their Favor with the people and their connection to Nature in order to be crowned Kami-sama, the chief deity of the land.\n        The Spirit Way add-on expansion introduces four new kami\nDaikono, the kami of radishes\nKari, the kami of the hunt\nKitakori, the kami of ice\nYuma, the kami of dreams\nThese kami introduce new interactive strategies through their unique abilities. Additionally, the Spirit Way expansion includes the Merchant villager, one copy per villager deck, as well as the kami-specific components below.\nThe Awakened expansion will be unlocked upon reaching our first stretch goal. Throughout the campaign, more content will be added to make this a substantial expansion full of diverse content. The Awakened expansion will be an amenity at no additional cost to backers of the game! Further, it will not be available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama.

Though Kolossal is new to the industry, our President - Travis R. Chance - is not. Travis was a founder of Action Phase Games. He is an expert at Kickstarter, funding every game he brought to the platform, including Western Legends, Heroes Wanted, Kodama, and Aeon's End. Our team has spent the last 8 months preparing for the launch of Kami-sama in every way possible.\nThe game is easy to learn while providing interesting and diverse play each game. Combining familiar mechanisms in a unique presentation, we are confident Kami-sama will be in your game collection for years to come.\nThe game is beautifully illustrated by our friends at Gong Studios (Netrunner LCG, Charterstone).\nWe are committed to begin fulfillment of Kami-sama before the game is made available in retail.\nComponents and materials for the game are near completion upon launch. All files will be uploaded to our manufacturing partner within one week after the end of the campaign. This ensures timely delivery to our backers.\nBy backing Kami-sama through this campaign, you will receive - at no extra cost - The Awakened expansion. This expansion will include unlocked Stretch Goal content not available in the initial retail release of Kami-sama. We have many exciting and interactive goals planned for those who are backers of Kolossal's second release!\nHundreds of hours have gone into the design and development of this game to ensure a balanced and enjoyable experience. Through extensive global internal and open testing, Kami-sama provides a rich gaming experience like no other game out there.\nThe utmost thought and care were taken with regard to the theme and source material for the game. As with all of Kolossal's releases, we strive to show diversity and thoughtfully approach inclusion.\nKickstarter is the world's largest funding platform for creative projects.

The most important thing is to have planets (or cities) under your control \u2013 if you have more buildings in the city than other players \u2013 you gain all the money paid to the planet (city) repository. The resources extraction and production in the game are limited and look like crisis-management. \u2728\n\nIn fact, both themes mainly are about the distant future of Pandorum's world.\n1) \ud83c\udf0cThere are 12 planets, including Pandorum of course, in a constantly changing system of planets. We need to colonize more planets in this system than other players. Each game the position of planets and routes between them will be different.\n2) \ud83d\ude80 Since Pandorum\u2019s colonization, humanity has inhabited many other planets, but after the big cataclysm, they have to return in one of the few lasts planets where humanity can live now - Pandorum. Each game the position of the cities on the Planet will be different, so are routes between them.

As a woodworker who creates gaming accessories it was out of our usual comfort zone but as a regular gamer I knew I wanted to create a quality dice but that was different and unique.\nPanther Spirit Dice\nFrom this the 'Spirit of' range of dice was born. The idea of a trapped spirit with in the dice depicted by a 2 colour swirl effect is finished off with the highest dice number being an image of the animal itself.\nTurtle Spirit Dice\nEach D4 also has a symbol relating to the animal itself represented in place of one of the number 4's.\nThe dice are made from a high quality poly-resin, they are a nice weight to hold in your hand and have proved to be durable and hardy to wear.\nFae Spirit Dice\nMy favorites from series 1 would have to be the dragon and hornet spirits I use mine weekly and always think of them as my Patronus helping me battle the monsters within a game or if I am the DM to terrorize the players....but that probably just me! :-)\nOctopus Spirit Dice (design to be simplified slightly)\nWe were so nervous when we put up the Kickstarter for the first range of animals, were people going to like them? Did we have any hope at all of being funded?.....We were blown away by their success and so pleased everybody had the same enthusiasm for the animals that we did. Not only that but great suggestions kept rolling for other animals, two fantastic dice were commissioned with the 'release your spirit' pledge and the ideas rolled on...\nButterfly Spirit Dice\nSo here we are at Series 2 still just as nervous but looking forward to showing you \u2013 a range of animals mainly suggested by this wonderful community and supportive backers :-)\n  Every Dice Pledge recieves 1 free critit D6\n  Bat Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Butterfly and Rabbit\n  Fae Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Snake and Panther\n  Rhino Spirit Dice\n  The Spirit of the Pegasus and Turtle\n  Scorpion Spirit Dice\n  Stag Spirit Dice\n  Fox Spirit Dice\n      New Stretch Goal!\nThe Spirit of the Owl as requested and suggested by our wonderful backers.\nOwl flying free!\n Now the Owl is unlocked those pledging at the \u00a385 level will receive this dice included in your bundle at no extra charge, and will be available as a option for all other backers to choose :-)\n       Check out the First series of 'Spirit of' here\n           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will mainly read as a list of things we learnt from the first Kickstarter, we believe we have listened to our previous backers in how the first could be improved, and the previous project certainly set us on a steep learning curve, to say we were unprepared for just how popular they would be is an understatement. \n\nTime \u2013 We delivered on time!

We\u2019re Quentin and Dan from Elderwood Academy, and this Kickstarter we\u2019re inviting you to live our dream together: staying home with tiny dice in tiny wood-carved boxes. Never again need you be the fool at the party without an emergency set of dice contained within a vanity dice holder. Also, free advice: don\u2019t go to parties. Wear PJs and make your friends come to you.\nLike their prodigious progenitors, Hex Chest Minis are crafted in a spectacular array of wood options, delicately appointed with engraved art, and finished by hand. They offer a pleasing permutation of personalization, precision, and polish packed into a precious parcel, prepared to portably protect your playthings.\nThis Kickstarter we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to make Pebble dice exclusively available along with your Mini Hex Chest. Pebble dice are brand-new miniature zinc-alloy cast masterpieces you could (but absolutely should not) eat like jellybeans and come in a wide range of finishes and themes. If micro precision machined aluminum is more your speed, that's an option, too.\nDoes it *seriously* have to get this cold? Stay inside, people. Also, it's Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper dice.\n  Start off by selecting a wood choice that speaks to you. Choose between the Classic line, which includes Walnut, Cherry, or Mahogany, and the Exotic line which expands your options to include Purpleheart, Lacewood, or Padauk. All Minis are hand-sanded until they're river-stone smooth, tasted for vintage, then brushed with oil for a lasting finish.\nClassic wood options\nThe Classic selection lets you choose between Walnut, Mahogany, and Cherry options. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\nExotic wood options\nThe Exotic selection lets you choose between Padauk, Purpleheart, and Lacewood. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\n  Upon an un-warmed rock we espied Padauk with Nightmare Black and Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper. Then we wised up and went home. #Indoors4Life\n  All Hex Chest Minis come with engraved art. The Classic line have the Elderwood phoenix etched upon them while the Exotic line opens up your choice of Signature art.\n  When pledging for an Exotic Hex Chest Mini, get your choice of Signature art. Classic line all include complementary Elder Phoenix art\n  Oh, is it still cold outside? Get wrecked, mother nature. PS Mahogany with Nightmare Black dice.\n    The best kind of dice tower\nA dice box with dice is a harp playing Crazy Train (hauntingly gratifying). Since we\u2019re partied with Norse Foundry\u2019s minstrels we\u2019re thrilled to be able to offer Pebbles, their new mini metal dice, to accompany you on your quests. Pebbles are forged using zinc-alloy and cast with your choice of six different finishes.\nPebble Dice\nPsst. Wanna get low after class?\nMiniature Aluminum Dice\nIf Pebbles aren't getting your rocks off, may we suggest these solid machined aluminum minis? Each set is precision cut to give you the truest rolling in the smallest package possible.\nThey come in purple, green, black, red, and blue anodized finishes\nMiniature Plastic Dice\nIf you've already got yourself a chunk of randomized metal, you'll also have the option of our Rare Earth Superplastic dice in blue, red, and black. We should note for legal and also common sense reasons that \"Rare Earth Superplastic\" is remarkably similar to \"regular plastic\" in that it is regular plastic.\n  We had to lean out a window to take this shot. #Courageous. Mahogany and Purpleheart with blue plastic mini polys.\nWhen the campaign closes you\u2019ll be able to further customize your Hex Chest Mini so it can serve you best. Determine your interior design with either Beehive or Open styles. Beehive captures each mini die in its own micro-tomb while Open is more emotionally approachable.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to choose whether you want a loop adapter on your Mini Hex Chest (never open your front door diceless ever again) or if you\u2019d rather go with the symmetric all-smooth-sided style. The loop lets you mount your Mini on a keyring, a pocket chain, or a necklace while the all-smooth-sided style slides blindly into a pocket without a hitch.\nOpen to the left of me, Beehive to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you\n  This time around we changed things up. Because we hit our stretch goal for the campaign we'll be planting 500 trees! That's enough to cover approximately half a million small wooden projects! Planting will begin near the end of the campaign :D\n  Well let\u2019s just say that Minis are 2.1 inches by 2.8 inches whereas other objects can be as large as 11 by 83 inches. Notable! Pebbles are 8.5mm to 13mm (10mm standard scale).\n  Quentindo Switch and Danton Abbey are two nerdy boys with big eyes for tiny wood projects.

Cypress Legacy was created to be an exciting and engaging board game with intellect, depth, and strategy, for the entire family to enjoy. Produced from the highest-quality materials and packaging and evolving through several iterations over the past few years, we believe we have achieved a game that has not only exceeded our company\u2019s goals, but is also something that will appeal to gamers of all ages and experiences. Our testers have shown a tremendous positive response, and we think you will enjoy the game as well! The story you are playing within begins with Lorna Ritten just learning of Alfred Cypress, the grandfather she has never known. Lorna has always wanted to find out more about her biological family, which has always been a mystery. Her grandfather\u2019s attorney, Phillip Brandt, tells Lorna of an inheritance, which includes one of her grandfather\u2019s many mansions and its contents. Her desire to know more marks the beginning of a very unique and potentially dangerous situation. Lorna has no idea just how important this actually is to her and will be to others. As Lorna is studying some of the inheritance documents before visiting the mansion, she realizes there are objects that hold key information hidden throughout the mansion. These include maps and other unique items concerning Alfred\u2019s work, as well as more about Lorna\u2019s biological family. And even though she realizes she is being watched and is possibly even in danger, she still wants to move forward. With this in mind as you begin the game, imagine Lorna has called on you as her true and trusted friend to help secure these items from the Cypress Mansion and then get out as quickly as possible. You will encounter others who are trying to get this valuable information as well, so you need to be careful and trust no one. The mansion itself also has many surprises to make your mission even more exciting\u2014and dangerous. You will need to use the resources available and pay attention to everything. Regardless of what you face, you must continue to acquire what is needed to help Lorna in her quest to learn the truth, gain the assets, and then get out safely.

Explore exotic destinations and earn badges to prove yourself as the galaxy's best explorer.\nWhat makes it unique? \u2013 A destination can be visited if it has a rocket on top. Once a destination is visited the rocket moves clockwise around the board to the next open destination\u2014skipping over any with rockets already on top. Choosing where to go might help you, but it also opens up places for your opponents. \nHow do you win? \u2013 Collect the most Explorer Points (XP) by the end of the game by earning space badges.\nStretch Goals\nGame Setup\n      Rockets begin at the starting destinations and components are placed by their corresponding actions. Each player receives one badge to begin. Three badges are placed face up by Starlight Station and the rest form the the badge deck on top of it.\nGive the First Traveler marker to whoever most recently looked at the stars. Play begins with the First Traveler and proceeds clockwise.\nVisiting Destinations\nOn your turn, you\u2019ll choose which which destination to visit:\nChoose a destination with a rocket on it\nPerform the action of the chosen destination\nMove the rocket to the next destination in the clockwise rotation, skipping over any destinations that already have rockets on them.\nDestination Actions\nYour Trusty, Explorer Bot\u2014Scout\nScout's design will be changing slightly. Take a look at the new one in our latest update.\nScout moves to new destinations when players visit Astral Arcade. Whenever any player visits a destination with Scout on it, the player who currently has the Scouter may choose to gain either a Pink Crystal or a Fast Travel pass from the supply. \nFast Travel\nBefore visiting a destination, Fast Travel tokens can be spent on your turn to move one Rocket to the next available destination\u2014multiple tokens may be spent in a single turn before choosing a destination. \nBadge Perks\nAfter you earn a badge, you'll gain its Explorer Points (XP) in the top right and its perk on the bottom. Some are ongoing whereas others trigger immediately. Getting great badge combos can be a sure way to victory.\nGame End\nWhen a player has reached 20 or more Explorer Points, finish the current round of play so each player gets an equal number of turns\u2014the last player should be the person to the right of the First Traveler. The player with the most Explore Points at the end is the winner of Space Park!\nSolo Mode: Playing Against Scout\nIn solo mode, a player is racing to score 20 XP against Scout who is running through the Badge deck to move himself and the rockets around the board.

A mysterious burst in the sky gave ordinary men and women extraordinary powers. They're called EPICS.\nBut, every Epic turned out to be EVIL. Today, in the city once known as Chicago (now Newcago), an all-powerful Epic named STEELHEART reigns supreme!\nNobody fights back... nobody but THE RECKONERS! This is where you come in. You are a member of the Reckoners, a skilled group of normal humans who assassinate Epics.\nPlay as 1 of 6 Reckoners from the books\nYour mission is simple, but not easy. Take down Steelheart and his Epics and SAVE THE CITY. \nPromos may be sold separately after Kickstarter. Deluxe KS promos included only for DELUXE and EPIC pledge levels.  \n  DELUXE and EPIC pledge levels will not be sold through retail, unless a retailer purchased via this Kickstarter. Limited copies may be sold at conventions or via our online shop while supplies last.\nFor the EPIC pledge level, the Player Miniatures and the PVC Steelheart Miniature will be pre-painted by PandaGM's studio - the same place that brought you the beautifully painted Mechs Vs. Minions miniatures.\nThe Reckoners is a simultaneous, CO-OPERATIVE game for 1-6 players that plays in 75 minutes. During the game, you control one of the members of The Reckoners team. YOU WIN BY DEFEATING STEELHEART. But before you can defeat him, you must first discover his weakness. \nSteelheart Tray, Action Tracks, and Weakness Board. Note: The Power Tracks can be adjusted for difficulty.\nSeems simple, right? Did I mention that Steelheart and all his Epics have SUPERPOWERS? \nEach round, all of the Epics are going to activate, performing an array of actions and then powering up to be even more devastating next round. If the Epics manage to destroy Newcago by reducing the population to 0, then ALL RECKONERS LOSE.\nActivate Epic Actions Animation. Perform Epic actions and then move the bracket up by 1 + number of Enforcement\nSo, what are you going to do about it? At the start of the Reckoners turn, all players will SIMULTANEOUSLY ROLL THEIR DICE, selecting which results to keep until the next step.\nRoll Dice Step Animation\nEach Reckoner starts with 6 dice (3 white and 3 matching their color). Each colored dice has a side with a double symbol on it, which naturally makes each Reckoner better at certain aspects of the game. Once all players have finished rolling, it's time to USE DICE TO TAKE ACTIONS.\nUse Dice Step Animation\nOnce again, players simultaneously perform actions, and when all Reckoners have finished using their dice, then their turn is over. \nExample Research and Attack Epic Actions\nResearching and Attacking Epics will help you earn valuable rewards, including clues about Steelheart's weakness. But, there will always be more Epics than you, so you have to choose your battles wisely.\n25+ Unique Epic Cards (tarot sized 80x120mm)\nYou'll also want to acquire EQUIPMENT CARDS, which enable you to perform more actions each turn, manipulate your dice, and build a powerful engine to takedown Steelheart. Don't forget about PLAN TOKENS either! These can help you when the dice don't go your way and you need to get out of a jam.\nPurchase Equipment Cards to build your action engine and become powerful enough to takedown Steelheart.\nYour dice can also be used to contain epics, attack Enforcement, move around the game board, remove barricades, and activate special equipment powers. You can read more on full gameplay by downloading our rulebook. \nRodney Smith from WatchItPlayed has agreed to teach the game on his YouTube channel, so keep an eye out for it later this year.\nWHAT ABOUT REPLAYABILITY?\nThe Reckoners was designed to be different every single time it's played. Yes, you will always face Steelheart in the base game, but his presence and abilities will vary greatly from game to game because they are derived from the Epics on the game board. Which Epics are out, the order they come out in, and how powerful they become will all affect Steelheart differently each game. Compound this with the variations of Equipment Cards, different Reckoners in the game, and combinations of die rolls, and now you've created a truly unique experience.\nWe have nearly 100 unique illustrations in the game.

Check out their Kickstarter Preview Video below.\n Boardgame Corner LIVE Final Thoughts\n If you would like to see the entire live stream, check out the full game playthrough here. Note: All game components are in prototype form and subject to change (and improvement).\nAdditionally, we've worked closely with Brandon's team and Dragonsteel Entertainment to ensure that the game is representative of the world mythos and enjoyable for fans of the series and gamers alike.\n  We also had the chance to sit down and play the game with a few reviewers at conventions last year. Here's what a few of them had to say:\n    Estimated Shipping Costs\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge and will be charged when shipping for The Reckoners begins.\nNauvoo Games will be shipping via fulfillment partners in regions around the world as we've done for several campaigns in the past. This enables us to keep costs as low as possible. However, the reality is that shipping is very expensive, especially for a big box game with lots of components like The Reckoners.\nCharging a flat-rate for shipping can be unfair for the backer or the creator, and we want to avoid any surprises. For this reason, we will be using a Pledge Manager for this project, which allows us to more accurately charge shipping costs after the Kickstarter campaign ends. We will only charge shipping based on the weight and destination of your order.\nThe above table lists estimated shipping costs by destination for one copy of The Reckoners board game after our subsidy. We understand the estimates are broad, so this may do little to help you budget. Therefore, once your shipping rate is determined in the Pledge Manager, we will give you the option to cancel your pledge for a full refund, minus any Kickstarter fees we incur, if you are unhappy with the amount.\nIf you would like to order more than one copy, then you may do so after the campaign ends. The Pledge Manager will automatically calculate shipping costs for your pledge and any optional add-ons.\nWe welcome retail partners to support The Reckoners, and we offer standard retailer discounts. To join us:\nPledge for 1 copy of the BASE game. The amount will be subtracted from your total order later when games are ready to ship.\nEnter your information and desired quantities into this form. If you need to edit your responses, send us a message.\nAnd finally, a special thanks to Brandon Sanderson and all of the folks at Dragonsteel Entertainment and JABberwocky for making this project possible!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, a direct response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects and delivered each of them ahead of schedule. We've been around the block enough to know that there are often unexpected obstacles, and we promise to meet these challenges with strong work ethic and transparent communication.\n\nWe are confident in the design of the game, as proven by almost 18 months of playtesting and reviewer feedback. However, the Reckoners is our biggest game yet with very challenging production requirements. We've been working with our manufacturer for multiple months already to generate samples and finalize all materials to ensure it has excellent quality production. But added stretch goals might take more time to complete.\n\nPlease note that the final product might change slightly during the mass manufacturing process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience with The Reckoners, and we strive to give our backers excellent customer support throughout the process. We hope you will support our project with confidence and help make The Reckoners the best game possible.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nYou are entitled to a full refund of your pledge within 14 days of the campaign's end, no questions asked. After that, we will refund 80% of your pledge up until 12 weeks before shipping (when the survey goes out). Once we've begun the survey process, NO refunds are possible. If for some reason a component is unable to be delivered, then we will refund that completely, including fees.\n\nRefunds within the 14 day window are reversed via Stripe directly to your credit card. After 14 days, we will provide refunds via PayPal up until the cut-off time. Any refunds processed will be in USD. \n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this project, you agree to log into your Kickstarter account and submit your project survey results, thereby providing us with your information (i.e. shipping address) to fulfill your pledge rewards, within 12 weeks of our survey notification. \n\nIf you do not provide your information as indicated above within 12 weeks of our notification, you also agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. \n\nWe may, at our discretion, offer a refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 12-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project and instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "SUPPORTER", "descp": "Join us for the campaign and get access to new content written by Brandon Sanderson, game artwork, Kickstarter updates and add-ons via the Pledge Manager.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of The Reckoners Untold Epics\nPDF copy of The Reckoners Character Artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2018"}], "stat": ["171 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 69 or more", "title": "BASE", "descp": "+ One copy of The Reckoners Board Game\n+ PDFs of new content written by Brandon Sanderson and game artwork\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

However, these things take time. We have development decisions that need to be carefully made. Our artist and graphic designer need to finish their plate of projects. Our licensor needs to weigh in on the product as a whole.

It takes the hardcore ideals of emergent storytelling and fictional positioning, and slots into an atomically small Powered by the Apocalypse mechanic.\nby Per Folmer\nOur design goals were simple: make a game that's mechanically compatible with OSR retroclones (and their mountains of content) while leveraging the compact but non-binary PbtA system.\nA single PbtA \"move\" core: 2d6 + mod, tiered results\nPlayer-generated character traits instead of predefined playbooks or attributes\nHigh character lethality\nStrong GM authority\nVagabonds picks the pockets of greater games: World of Dungeons, Lamentations of the Flame Princess, Barbarians of Lemuria, Blades in the Dark, City of Mist, the Black Hack and the White Hack, and of course the grandaddy of them all: Moldvay's venerable Basic.\nby Dean Spencer\nThe game itself is as lean as we can make it, clocking in at around 120 pages jam-packed with rules and examples. It's written and laid out specifically to be easy to comprehend with a single skim or quickly referenced at the table. We've even gone so far as to make distinct layouts for print and PDF to make each format as useful as possible.\nPeople've been rehashing dungeon-crawlers for over forty years; rather than try to reinvent the wheel, Vagabonds takes advantage of all that existing material.\nby Dean Spencer\nThere are literally thousands of adventures and modules that we want to tap into, but there's room for mechanical improvement in both OSR and PbtA. Vagabonds unifies the feel of B/X with the benefit of flexible characters and gradient outcomes.\nBasically, Vagabonds is a collection of components from games that fit together well and align with our preference for old-school dungeon crawlers. No fuss, no real innovation, just a game that makes OSR adventures even more enjoyable.\nIf you liked World of Dungeons but wanted more heft, or you thought Dungeon World was too close to new-school story games, or you wished there was some more variability in characters and outcomes from LotFP, then Vagabonds is designed for you.\nPlayer-defined traits\nA list of PbtA-move-inspired techniques\nLinear, shallow power curve\nNo classes, playbooks, or attributes\nVagabonds' largest departure from OSR and PbtA games is in the way characters are constructed. Each character is a collection of trait tags -- short player-written phrases that describe aspects of their character. This is similar to the recently released City of Mist or to Barbarians of Lemuria's use of careers as skills.\nby Per Folmer\nThere are five starting traits you define for your character:\nApproach: the way you solve conflict\nGimmick: a memorable or noteworthy quirk\nBackground: what you used to do or be\nForeground: your current skillset or field\nWeakness: something you struggle to do well with\nThese traits not only inform your roleplaying decisions but actually provide a mechanical bonus any time they're relevant. Each relevant trait tag applies a +1 (or a -1 if detrimental) to your roll, with a max of +3 or -3. \nby Dean Spencer\nYou create more trait tags as you level up; these new traits don't have to fall into one of the five starting categories. Characters develop in organic and convoluted ways.\nBut characters are more than just the sum of a handful of traits, as they'll have specific abilities granted to them through their history or expertise:\nLineages: a character's bloodline or cultural background (such as elf or beastkin). Lineages provide passive benefits as well as some unique abilities.\nTechniques: a catch-all for maneuvers, feats, spells, and PbtA-style moves -- dozens of techniques offer a wide variety of choices to help flesh out a character.\nSingle page layout by Evan Rowland\n  Sum 2d6 + modifier\nThe results determine a gradient between failure and complete success\nThe players do all of the rolling (usually)\nThose familiar with PbtA games will see a familiar setup and split here. Every roll is pretty much the same: you roll two six-sided dice and add your character's aptitude (the sum of all relevant tags, be they trait tags, injury tags, or item tags). The total result of the roll determines the outcome:\nA result of 6 or less is a failure and triggers some kind of calamity or consequence.\nA result of 7 to 9 is a partial success, or one with some wrinkle or complication.\nA result of 10 to 12 is just a flat success; you do the thing.\nAnything 13 or higher is a success with an added benefit; it's a critical success or some knock-on win that occurred because of how capable you are.\nby Dean Spencer\nWe've followed World of Dungeons' suit in eschewing the complexity of many different \"basic moves\" or \"core moves.\" Instead, everything boils down to the outcomes above, though certain techniques or niche actions might have specific outcomes determined by the rules rather than GM fiat. \nVagabonds of Dyfed comes with 30 must-have enemies, complete with statblocks designed for expediency and at-the-table efficiency.\nStatblock layout by Evan Rowland\nWe've included tools for building your own monsters (utilizing special abilities and tags) and for converting OSR classics. Few calculations are necessary, and most monsters from other B/X-compatible games can be run as-is. Because Vagabonds does away with much of the rigorous uniformity of PbtA games, it doesn't crumble when you introduce mechanics from, say, DCC or LotFP.\nby Dean Spencer\n  Vagabonds incorporates a multitude of other plug-and-play subsystems to suit your group's playstyle:\nPlan and Prep rolls: speed up play if you don't have time to plan every detail and stow every torch\nTool kits: packets of role-specific items\nTravel turns: track and trigger random dungeon or wilderness encounters over distances\nHirelings: allies, mercenaries, even warhounds\nby Dean Spencer\nOne-roll attack and damage: quicken your damage calculations using the core 2d6 roll, both for PCs and enemy attacks\nEasy but interesting equipment rules: equipment functions like a combination of tags and techniques, sometimes granting permissions or bonuses, othertimes entire abilities or spells\nDowntime scenes: cribbed and simplified from Blades in the Dark, but works surprisingly well in an OSR context\nDecays and hazards: weather, poison, spell-mutations, and looming threats\nPremade archetypes: want to get started in five minutes? Grab an archetype and start slayin'\nWritten and designed by Ben Dutter\nArt by Per Folmer and Dean Spencer\nLayout by Evan Rowland\nEditing by Joshua Yearsley\nThe book's completely written and 100% edited. Layout is well underway (as you've seen on this page). Art is nearly final. The interior is in a modern black and white aesthetic with OSR-style ink art, laid out in a dual-column 8.5\" x 8.5\" square format.\nYou can read the complete, edited (but not laid out) draft here.\nPrint spread layout by Evan Rowland\nThe PDF has been laid out separately from the print book to allow for ease of use on a phone or tablet. A comprehensive table of contents with internal linking makes it easy to reference.\nWe're sticking with POD this time around, as our foray into offset printing in recent Kickstarters has met with dissatisfactory delays and shipping issues. This project is clean and simple -- you'll get a link to DriveThru RPG and can download the PDF for free or pay the hardcosts for a print book.\nby Dean Spencer\n Wait, how do I get my book?\nWhen you pledge to this Kickstarter at the $10 level, you get the PDF copy and \"at-cost\" print-on-demand from DriveThru RPG. At-cost POD basically means that you, the backer, have to pay another company (DriveThru, in this case) a few more bucks in order for them to print and ship a black and white book to you. \nSo you pay me, through Kickstarter, $10 and I send you the PDF and a link. You click the link, pay DriveThru some more money (est. $5 + shipping) and get your PDF and print copy. The reason is it's \"at-cost\" is basically I make no additional money off the sale of those print copies, all of my revenue comes from the $10 pledge. DTRPG takes what's left (they have to cover the costs of printing).\nIf you don't want the POD, no problem, you never have to use it. Give it to a friend or just ignore it for eternity. \n Stretch Goals\nEvery $2,000 beyond the initial funding goal unlocks a new stretch goal (up to $10,000). Each goal is a unique piece of content that will be for sale after the Kickstarter ends (but you clever Kickstarter backers get for your $10 pledge).\nStjernheim: Siege at Deepknell Barrow. Unlocked at $6,000 is a ~40 page adventure supplement that focuses on three unique factions battling over the control of an ancient Dwarven Ruin. Inspired by nordic fantasy (think D&Disms + Skyrim) and includes new lineages, techniques, and monsters. \nMore to be revealed! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our eighth Kickstarter.

Clash of Steel is the only project that was delivered late, and it was due to the very unfortunate and untimely death of Stewart Wieck, who was handling distribution and logistics. \n\nThe fact that we still managed to print 10,000 decks and get them largely shipped to all of our backers -- admittedly late -- is a testament to the team's dedication to completing our projects.\n\nThis game and project is FAR simpler; art's pretty much done, writing is 100% done, layout is nearly done. Even if one of the principal contributors met with some calamity I'm confident that we'd be able to deliver without much issue and on time.

The Master Vault can hold a miniature and up to three sets of dice using the specially designed, foam-lined mortises within.  Powerful rare-earth magnets make sure the Master Vault closes securely, while a thumb notch allows you to easily open it.  \nThe Personal Dice Tray is designed for single-player use, giving you an arena of your very own in which to decide your fate.  The solid hardwood walls surround the rolling surface, crafted from stone-oiled water buffalo leather, to keep your rolls contained and on the table.\nThe Master Vault fits within the Personal Dice Tray when closed, allowing all of the components of the Adventurer's Arsenal to be easily stored and carried.\nPledges that include both a Master Vault and Personal Dice Tray will include a complimentary leather strap for each set.\nPencil comes loaded with 3mm lead, HB hardness. Refills available.\nFinally, the Wyrmwood Pencil: truly an elegant weapon for a more civilized age.  Each and every pencil is hand-turned by our craftsmen, resulting in a beautiful finish.  A built-in sharpener allows you to easily keep it writing its best.  Thoughtful contours complete the design, ensuring that it feels natural in the hand.\nEach Wyrmwood Pencil pledged for will include a complimentary high-polymer eraser.  Of course, the Wyrmwood Pencil fits securely in any of the three oblong mortises within the Master Vault.\n  Exceptional Materials: Every piece Wyrmwood creates is crafted using premium hardwoods sourced from all around the world. We care deeply about the environment and strive to source our woods ethically and responsibly; to that end, we donate a portion of the sales of our rarest woods towards rainforest sustainability and preservation through the Rainforest Trust. For more information on our wood sourcing, visit our website.  For more information about Rainforest Trust, click here.\nHand Rubbed Finish: We use a close-to-the-wood oil and wax finish to protect the piece while allowing the natural character, feel, and color of the material to shine through. We never use dyes or stains. A hand rubbed finish is quite labor intensive, but we believe that the results are worth it, and we think you will, too.\nBuilt For People, By People: When we gather around the table for a game, it\u2019s a social event - we understand there is something special and unique about sharing time together as people.  Digital tools and technology certainly have their place, and can enhance the gaming experience, but they can\u2019t replace the human element.\nWe believe that what\u2019s true for the game is true for the accessories you use to bring it to life.  Each and every piece is made by our skilled craftsmen, right here in New England, and you are directly supporting our work every time you pledge to a campaign, order from our website, or purchase from us at a convention.\nAs a player, you put a lot of heart and soul into the character you bring to the table. You can rest assured that our craftsmen put their heart and soul into creating your Wyrmwood Adventurer's Arsenal, too.\n  Our Name and Our Word: Wyrmwood stands for uncompromising quality and customer satisfaction, and as craftsmen we stake our name and reputation on that satisfaction. If you aren\u2019t thrilled, we aren\u2019t done. This is why we unconditionally guarantee our work - for life.\n              One of our Custom Craftsman uses the Wyrmwood Pencil!\n            Master Vault: Myrtle Burl, with inlay materials based on flower choice\n We wanted to commemorate the Adventurer's Arsenal with a special edition of the Master Vault. Each Gaia Edition features stunning marquetry inlay on a Myrtle Burl Master Vault - the version shown here features a purple coneflower.\nBackers at this level may choose any flower they like for their own piece, which will be designed and inlaid by our master craftsmen. Alternatively, backers may leave the choice of flower to the discretion of our craftsmen. Either way, each Gaia Edition - like a single flower in nature - will be a one-of-a-kind work of art, crafted from natural materials.\nThe Gaia Edition will be offered in highly limited tiers, 5 per month initially, increasing to a maximum of 10 per month due to the time-intensive, highly custom nature of each piece.\nNote: Pledges for the Gaia Edition include complimentary worldwide shipping.\nWhile some of our backers have a favorite wood, we know that it's a difficult decision for many. Given that we're big fans of each and every wood that we work with, we can sympathize!  If this sounds familiar, Roll The Dice may be for you.\nWhen you pledge for a component or components at this level, your wood will be randomly determined from the Kickstarter lineup, with ALL unlocked woods at the end of the campaign included, from Cherry level on up.\nNot only that, you'll receive a custom text engraving at no additional charge on any Roll The Dice Master Vault or Personal Dice Tray in your pledge!\nThe updated list of ratios for Roll The Dice can be seen below.  The adjusted ratios include stretch goal unlocks, meaning more potential options than ever before! \nOver 40 Woods Available!\n  If you're torn on which wood is for you or love them all, and you enjoy surprises, consider pledging for Roll The Dice!  No matter what wood you receive, you can't lose!\n    Note: Engravings can only be applied to a Master Vault or Personal Dice Tray\n        Includes an High-Polymer Eraser & 3X Additional Lead (3mm)\n      Wood Options \n                                                                                                                        Every piece we produce is handcrafted. We take great pride in the fact that we oversee every element of the production and maintain full control over the entire process, from raw lumber to packed, labeled shipments. Thus, we can have confidence when we offer our Craftsman\u2019s Promise - the cornerstone of our customer service philosophy:\nThere is only one acceptable outcome for our Craftsmen: a product that they can take personal pride in and an -absolutely- satisfied client. If you are unsatisfied with your product for -any- reason at all, we will fully refund or replace the item free of charge. We always guarantee our products, and we will always pay for shipping.\n  The Master Vault is designed for versatility. Don't use miniatures? The circular mortise is great for additional dice, chips or tokens.  Tabletop role playing is about the freedom players have: your games, your characters, your choices.  The Master Vault was designed with that principle in mind.\nNote: All mortises have a depth of 0.75\" per side. The Master Vault has a total depth of 1.875\" (1-7/8\")\n Fully Loaded:\n12mm Dice (mini Dice) 72 Die capacity\n16mm Dice (normal sized Dice) 28 Die capacity\n19mm (casino sized Dice) 17 Die capacity\nWyrmwood is a dedicated group of craftsmen based in New England.  The company started five years ago with just three people, and a simple idea.  As lifelong gamers ourselves, we'd grown up playing tabletop games and forging friendships across the game table, and those connections had remained a part of our lives.  But we'd changed in many ways - we'd grown up - and clearly, tabletop gaming had, too.  What if the accessories and tools we used to play them did the same?\nIn the beginning it was just a few friends in a garage workshop, working for a few days a week.  We launched our first Kickstarter, and then found ourselves working every day, and bringing in some friends to help.\nAs time went on, we kept growing - all of us left our other jobs and came to Wyrmwood, full-time, and we kept expanding, launching new projects and products, and traveling around the country to conventions, so we could show our work in person, too. \nWe found that there were many of us out there - gamers that wanted quality accessories to enhance their experience.  We were also able to find more dedicated, hardworking people that loved games and loved craftsmanship - the art of developing a skill and honing a craft, and producing something worthwhile with their hands.  We outgrew the garage, and moved into a larger facility.\nWe're a close knit group of people - we work together, travel together, and, of course, game together.  Whether it's Dungeons & Dragons in the workshop after hours, bowling or mini golf on a weekend, or just playing some video games at our Holiday Party, we're not just co-workers - we're teammates; we're friends; we're family.\nWhat started as a hobby for three in a garage has now grown to a career for nearly 40.  We've grown a lot, and much has changed, but our mission remains: to create the finest in gaming accessories, to offer unparalleled, uncompromising service, and to strive to continually innovate and improve.  In short, to up our game, every time.  Through your support, we've been able to keep doing just that - and helping you do likewise with the products and features you want.\nEach and every one of us would like to thank you for your support of our work.  When you pledge to this campaign, it isn't a purchase of a mass-produced, cookie-cutter product from a faceless corporate machine.  It's for a real piece of handcrafted woodwork, created by the people you see here.  Your support enables us to do what we love.  That means a lot to us, and we're committed to crafting a piece that will mean a lot to you in exchange.  So, from all of us, thank you.\nFor more of our story, click here.\nShipping -\nour Pledge Calculator determines shipping for you - click here\n    our Pledge Calculator determines shipping for you - click here\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project, as with every project we\u2019ve done, is low risk. All the work is being done in our New England workshop, here in the United States. We're sourcing all of the materials as quickly as possible, having already lined up our suppliers and estimates of our material needs, and as soon as the project reaches its goal, we'll begin moving in earnest towards production.\n\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter campaign, and we\u2019ve learned a great deal from all of those that came before it. In our very first, the Dice Vault, we were able to meet our deadline for holiday delivery despite an unanticipated and overwhelming response. The rest of fulfillment was complete a matter of weeks beyond our initial estimate. We maintained open communication throughout, and our backers were very pleased - some calling it the best campaign of which they'd ever been a part. Our second campaign, for the Magnetic Dice Tower System, was described by one journalist as the \"perfect Kickstarter.\" Our latest and most complex campaign by far, the Magnetic GM Screen system, is currently being fulfilled. Unforeseen production issues did cause some delays due to the complexity of the project, which we regret, however these are all under control and the project will be completely fulfilled soon - well before we begin production on this project. We do not anticipate any such issues in this campaign, which is a much simpler project from a production standpoint.\n\nWe will be communicating frequently, via email/messages, comments on the campaign page, and Kickstarter updates when there is significant information to communicate or monthly, whichever comes first.\n\nIf the campaign funds, measures are in place to get production moving quickly and efficiently as soon as possible. We\u2019re allowing ourselves the necessary lead time to be sure that everything is in order and we\u2019re ready to quickly, efficiently get you your rewards.\n\nIn short, there\u2019s only one thing left that we can't do without: your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "*poke*", "descp": "Pledge here to be kept up to date on all things Wyrmwood.

Using the rules in this book, you'll be able to play survivors of lost and destroyed civilizations, mutants rampaging the wastelands and so, so much more.  \nCharacter creation is simple, fast, and exciting. You pick your character type based on the exciting stories your Game Master is going to tell, you pick a few Traits that each grant a single benefit, and you're done! Sometimes you don't have time to plot lengthy, detailed worlds, but you want that experience. Well, we've got your back, and that support comes in the form of micro-settings!    \nMicro-settings are short settings filled with adventure hooks, and designed to scavenging adventures with minimal effort! Our goal is to fund a softcover edition, a limited number of hardcover collector\u2019s editions, and the Tiny Wastelands dice. \nArt by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nWe\u2019ve planned several stretch goals which will increase page count and provide you with more fun and engaging content!  \nThis project is a relaunch from our project last year, which was canceled when the owner of Nocturnal Media passed away. Since then, GKG has split back out into it's own company, and we're back with Tiny Wastelands! \nTime and space have necessitated a few changes and printing costs have gone up, so our price points have changed in the last 7 months and the project isn't exactly the same. Regardless, we are aiming for the same success and quality we always have!\nYou can watch a video of our interview on Victory Condition Gaming from last year!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wu-w3E6ZNKg\n You can also read Alan's Q&A with the #rpgnet IRC channel last year!\nhttps://gmshoe.wordpress.com/2017/06/15/qa-alan-bahr-tiny-wastelands/\nTinyD6 uses up to three six-sided dice as part of action resolution during the game. If you roll a \"5\" or \"6\" on a die, your check succeeds. Most checks are made with two dice. However, if you are deemed to have \"advantage\" on a roll, you gain a third dice to roll. If you have disadvantage, you lose a dice (rolling only a single dice). \nCharacters are made quickly and easily. You will select an archetype (which grants you a special trait), a favored weapon, 3 Traits, and your character is done! Tiny Wastelands focuses on the game at hand, removing fiddly subsystems or complicated tracking powers and abilities.\nTiny Wastelands brings some unique mechanics to the TinyD6 line, including customization for vehicles, scavenging tables for a variety of locations (both mundane and fantastic), mutation traits and a lot more in order to help you survive the fallout of the apocalypse!  \nArt by Nicol\u00e1s Giacondino\nOne of the biggest additions to the ruleset are the Enclave rules! Containing rules for managing a post-apocalyptic settlement, complete with an Enclave Deck that helps you to manage random events that might occur each year! Each session of Tiny Wastelands is designed to be bookended as a year, with the start of the year providing an event from the Enclave Deck and the end of the year, dealing with upkeeping your Enclave against the ravages of the Reaping!\nCard Back for the Enclave Deck (mock-up by Robert Denton)\n  The book will be 5.5 x 8.5 in dimensions. If we unlock all the stretch goals, the book will be over 120 pages.

These setting-unique rules are in addition to the base rules of the game.  \nThe core book comes with some very different micro-settings, written by professional authors, industry veterans, and fans of the genre.

I wonder what that was like?\"\n$8,000: Steve Radabugh writes Post-Human Terminus!  \n\"You are Post-Human. That makes you dangerous, and marked for termination. The war that raged a generation ago between the Post-Human Collective and the nations of man ravaged the world. \nThe nanites that flow inside you, a relic of times gone, are highly illegal, but are also the key to your survival. Just don\u2019t get caught by the inquisitors.\"\n$9,000: Marie Brennan joins us with The Ravenous Green!\n\"Welcome to a world covered in lush, green, vegetation. Welcome to a place, where a massive, mutant jungle is attempted to overrun the world, choking and strangling everything out. \nWhat strange mutated beasts can survive in such a place? And when, the Ravenous Green comes crawling up your Enclave walls....can you?\"\n$10,000: David Annandale writes PHANTASMAGORIA!\n\"The final war on Earth was so devastating, reality itself was gravely wounded. Now the remaining humans must struggle to survive in a surreal landscape, where even the floating ruins of skyscrapers are predators.\"\n$11,000: Mari Murdock will write The Plunge!\n\"Something has crashed into the moon, breaking part of it off. As the shattered moon has crashed into the Atlantic ocean, massive increases in sea levels devestated everything the resulting tsunamis could reach. \nThe Plunge takes place in the first few years after that, in a world still reeling, where memories of life before the devestation are still fresh...\"\n$12,000: Angus Abranson will write Floodland! \n\"Atlantis? It\u2019s a legend, nothing more. Ignore anyone who tries to tell you otherwise. Tales told to the young to make them dream of a salvation and another way of life. Some life though, a nightmare more like! Trapped beneath the seas? Who\u2019d want that over being able to live under the open sky with the vast horizon stretching away at every turn!  \nAtlantis is said to be a vast city built on the ocean floor with a magical sphere surrounding it keeping the waters at bay. Wizards have created an artificial Sun that heats and lights the city allowing vast farmland to grow providing food to both the Atlanteans and their animals. Yeah, I said it, \u201ctheir animals\u201d. This underwater paradise is home to not only Man but to Beasts that no one else has seen since before the lands were dry and water only covered part of the planet. They have so many Beasts that they are actually used for meat they are so plentiful! The city is home of fabulous artifacts from the Old World, riches beyond our wildest imagination!  \nOf course it\u2019s all nonsense though. Atlantis doesn\u2019t exist. Tales for children and dreamers.\"\n$13,000: Shawn Carmen takes us into the world of The Red Fever!\nThe Red Fever brought the world to its knees. Competing for resources finished it off. People ran out of fuel, out of food, out of ammunition. Chaos reigned. Most of the world fell into complete anarchy. But not all of it. \nBetween the mountains and the western coastline, a man of destiny forged an empire. He was called the Shogun, and his chosen lieutenants, his Sons, brought order where there was madness. Under his rule, the Sons divided the land into baronies and ruled it in his name. Their enforcers embraced the old ways, and called themselves Blades or Fists depending upon their chosen weapons. \nFor a time, the rule of law returned. But the Red Fever has returned, and the Shogun is dead. His Sons speak of war with one another, and the Blades and the Fists stand ready to spill blood once more on the ancient, dust-covered highways that cross the land.\"\n$14,000: Paul Weimer takes us to High Plains Drift! \n\"The High Plains of the Dakotas are wide, flat, and deadly. Between the mutant prairie dogs, what lurks in the minuteman silos, and the farmers turned bandits who have adapted farm tractors to war vehicles, survival on the plains is nasty, brutish and short. \nWhat makes it unique? Farm Tractor war vehicles, mutant wildlife and endless horizons in a hardscrabble world.\"\n$15,000: Jean-Baptiste Perrin leads us in Killing Rats!\n\"The apocalypse has left the surface of our planet uninhabitable. No one remembers why.\nSo humans have been forced to dig deep in the tunnels that were left from the megalopolises of the future. Even more than our current capitals, they were crisscrossed deep underground by cellars, metro systems, maintenance conveyor belts, underground malls, train and highway tunnels, sewers, stone quarries, necropolis and even the odd bunkers or missile silos. After the final catastrophe, what's left of humanity is learning to survive in the constant 18\u00b0 C of subterranean dwellings, linking these passages in makeshift (and dangerous) connections. \nOf course, factionalism, tribalism and weird theologies have thrived and violence is unabated. But the worst threat for humanity, after caving in of course, are their neighbours: hordes of giant mutated rats! Perhaps they have thrived even better than humans in this new world, perhaps they have been affected by the catastrophe itself, perhaps they have evolved extraordinary intelligence.\nWho knows? Maybe they hold the key to the return to the surface?\"\n$16,000: Ryan Schoon will explore The Drift!\n\"After a global ice age, the cities of the past lie buried beneath an expanse of ice known as \u201cThe Drift.\u201d \nHumanity has found a new life atop the Drift, adapting to the cold as best they can. Those who are daring, or hopeless, enough make a living exploring the caves and tunnels that lie beneath the ice.\"\n$17,000: Scott Smith will take us to meet The Children of the Forest!\n\u201cThey call us freaks, monsters. They sit behind their massive walls, in their mountains of steel and formed rock, and sneer at us.\nThey\u2019ve done what they needed to survive. We\u2019ve become what we needed to be to thrive in this new world. We are the chosen, the Naturals, the Children of the Forest.\u201d\nHumanity has long fought a war against the tiniest of foes: plagues and pestilence are the most merciless of killers. Only a tiny fraction of the human population has survived biowarfare gone wrong - those who had the wealth and connections to buy a place in the Refuge Cities, and those who endured the hellacious plagues and emerged changed. Some might even say: evolved.\n$18,000: Jaym Gates takes us to a post-apocalyptic California!\n\"California's always been a land bigger than you can dream, a place where anything can, and will, happen. These days, it's the place where the haves live in state-of-the-art sky-castles, and the have-nots eke out a minimal living in smoke-choked deserts, outrunning the wildfires.\"\n$19,000: Dianna Gunn will be contributing a micro-setting, The Second Stone Age!\nThey created the self-replicating robots to end the war. What they didn't expect was that they would keep fighting, long after the war was over. The robots defeated the enemy within days. By the time they completed the mission, they had devoured entire cities, and gone from an army of one hundred to an army of five hundred. But they didn't stop there. They invaded the next nation, and then the next. \nTheir creators tried to stop them, but the robots bypassed their commands and kept going. They adapted to every weapon. Within months they had devoured most of the developed world. Then they turned on their creators. They devoured everything. Every inch of metal and wire. A handful of the wealthiest people escaped, but there was nothing left of their civilization. Nothing left of any civilization. \nWith this metal they started a new project: a spaceship. They launched themselves into space, leaving the remnants of humanity with nothing. And so humanity entered a second stone age. \nThe only scraps of their once incredible technological prowess that remain are in the most remote parts of the world, hidden away in case the robots ever return.\n$20,000: DOUBLE FEATURE! \nFirst, John Kennedy brings us The Instant Matter Project!  \n\"It was supposed to be the next step in mankind's evolution and allow us to create matter from thin air. In its early stages, it could create simple shapes and forms, but it promised to liberate mankind and provide us with all that we could crave.  \nBut then our heart's turned to war, and the Instant Matter Project went from a bountiful dream to our endless nightmare. It consumed the world, and gone were the blue skies of our past only to be replaced with endless mountains of stone and a dome of stone that blots out the sun and the sky. No matter how high the survivors dug into the earth, the sky seems forever out of their reach.  \nNow we are reduced to colonies trying to survive in the endless wastes of solidity that now surround mankind. Strange creatures and plants mutated by the Instant Matter's after effects have managed to thrive in the dark, and remote colonies spend their days scavenging for fuel and supplies to keep their solar generators running in order to keep themselves alive. Dirt rains down constantly over our heads while in the distance, the sounds of rocks grinding against each other threaten to cave in at any moment.\nNow mankind must pull together to survive if they have any hope of escaping the Endless Mountain and find the free skies once again.\"  \nand we'll have Darren Pearce joining us with Broken Star!  \n\"The Terran Colony Vessel, Calico, set off on a 300 year voyage to a new star system, to find a new home for the select few upon the ship. This was not a case of overpopulation, or dwindling resources, this was a single giant leap for terran-kind across the stars.  \nLittle did they know that their voyage would end in tragedy for both their ship, and the planet they crashed upon. As a disaster brought the ship out of hyperspace early and in the wrong place, the vessel landed on a medium tech world -- some of the Calico's crew and passengers survived thanks to emergency escape vehicles.  \nHowever, the drive core detonated and caused a chain reaction that triggered volatile upheavals for the planet -- now the survivors of the ship and the people of this world live in a post-apocalyptic wasteland where the Great Crater is the only sign that a vessel from beyond the stars ever made landfall on their world.\"\n$25,000: More art!

Lovecraft?\nAs a student at the prestigious H.P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy, you\u2019ll uncover conspiracies, deal with bullies and uncaring professors, explore dangerous steam tunnels, study for exams, escape from horrible monstrosities that humanity was never meant to see, and try to avoid an extended stay at Arkham Sanitarium. And that's just orientation week!\nI bet you\u2019re wondering, \u201cWhat parent would send their child to a school like this?\u201d Well, you\u2019re not exactly a \u201cnormal\u201d student. You\u2019ve got supernatural powers! As a Witch, you can bend the eldritch forces of the universe to your will\u2026 what could possibly go wrong with that? Or you could be a Mad Scientist, developing strange and wondrous gadgets that almost never explode. Maybe you\u2019re a Hybrid, forced to hide your alien features and disturbing powers. Or you could be a Summoner, accompanied by a terrifying little critter that follows you around like a puppy\u2026 if the puppy was inside out and covered with tentacles. Maybe you\u2019re a Dreamer, with the power to invade and manipulate sleeping minds. And if you choose to be a Monday (normal kid), there's always money and exceptional skills.\nA semi-humorous RPG in the tradition of Saturday morning cartoons featuring mystery-busting kids\u2026only the monsters are real. \nFeatures a detailed sandbox environment on the campus of a haunted New England boarding school. \nSix different Student Types to choose from, including Witches, Summoners, or Mad Scientists. \nA simple task resolution derived from the PDQ System: roll 2d6 + skill modifier against a target number. \nDesign your own faculty! Want Dr. Frankenstein to be the new Biology professor? No problem! \nThanks to the medical breakthroughs developed by Dr. West in the school infirmary, your character can\u2019t die\u2026but sanity is another matter entirely. \nTons of optional rules to customize your individual game.\n  Class Picture\nThese are the 6 classes available to player characters. \nDreamers\nDuring the day, a Dreamer isn't any different from other kids. At night, however, they can enter other people\u2019s dreams where they can learn closely-guarded secrets, inflict terrible nightmares, manipulate their victim\u2019s subconscious, or seize control of their victim\u2019s body. When entering a dream, however, there\u2019s always a chance that the subject\u2019s unconscious mind may detect the intruder and attempt to destroy them. And getting injured in a dream hurts just as much as is does in the real world.\nHybrids\nSomeone in the hybrid\u2019s family tree wasn't quite human. The hybrid\u2019s blood may have traces of ghoul, Deep One\u2026 or something else entirely. As a result, they often have trouble passing for human. Hybrids may have bulgy, fish-like eyes, gibbering mouths on their torso, tentacles, goat-like legs, or any number of aberrations. On the plus side, their ancestry provides certain benefits, such as the ability to eat anything, incredible strength, regeneration, claws and fangs and more. Most people find hybrids gross, so hybrids have to be careful to hide their mutations.\nMad Scientists \nIn the hands of a mad scientist, natural laws are more like guidelines. Mad scientists spend a lot of time building and tinkering with their wondrous gadgets, creating astounding and sometimes bizarre devices. Blasters, robots, force fields, glue guns, evolution rays \u2013 these are all possible through science! Although these gizmos aren\u2019t as flexible as magic, they\u2019re a bit safer and other people can use them, too. \nMondays\nMost of the students at the academy don't have any powers whatsoever. The students with supernatural abilities call them \"Mondays,\" slang for \"Mundanes.\" However, even among Mondays, some students stand out among their peers, either due to their prodigious skills or their family's reputation. These students make up for their lack of powers with superior skills and abilities that can make a big difference in their day-to-day lives. For example, the Trustie (rich kid) is good at using their family\u2019s money and influence to get what they want.\nSummoners\nSummoners have had the fortune (misfortune?) of adopting a horrible little creature that defies modern biology and sanity. No two of these creatures are alike: Some scuttle along on spider-like legs while others fly on a myriad of insect wings. Some resemble wriggling aquatic creatures while others look like a bubbling pile of organs and eyes. Some may play catch with a ball and others may prefer to catch the local wildlife. Students who possess one of these creatures can expect a constant battle of wills as the monster tries to break free of their control.\nWitches\nThrough a combination of arcane study and inherited talent, witches have learned how to manipulate the primal forces of the universe. Magic is not only very dangerous in the hands of an experienced witch, but also very flexible. Witches can cast curses, fling bolts of eldritch energy, render themselves invisible, and much more. Manipulating these primal forces isn\u2019t easy, however, or everyone would be doing it. If the witch loses control of these energies, it could spell their doom. Or worse.\nThis Kickstarter campaign for H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy (or HPL Prep for short) is to fund the work that has already gone into this great game, the forthcoming art, and to get a print run done to maximize the quality of the end result. We anticipate a 6x9, softcover, black and white interior book at ~300 pages. You can also add $10 to your tier to make your copy of HPL Prep a Hardcover version instead. This is a complete game and everything you need to play will be in the corebook, but we have some extras ready to go as well! \nIn fact, the game is already fully written and playtested, and currently in editing (soon to be in layout). This means the turnaround for the final product will be pretty quick, hopefully not longer than a couple of months (to give the artists a chance to create some amazing pieces -- you can't rush true art!). \nUNLOCKED - $5,000 - Add \"Chosen of the Nodens\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Monday type called the Chosen of the Nodens. Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Descendants. You were born for a certain task, whether you like it or not. \nUNLOCKED - $6,000 - Add \"Carries\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Carries. You'll have a vast array of mental powers, like mind reading, pyrokinesis or telekinesis, but will you lose your mind in the process?\nUNLOCKED - $8,000 - Pip System Conversion\nAt $8,000 we will convert H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy to the Pip System (one of Third Eye Games' home systems). This will open the game up to players interested in adding to their existing Pip Collections, giving them totally flexible and simple-to-understand rules for kids and families. While all backers will receive the PDF for free when this is unlocked, print copies will also be made available at that time. \nUNLOCKED - $10,000 - Savage Worlds Conversion\nAt $10,000 we will convert H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy to the Savage Worlds System (from Pinnacle Entertainment Group). This will apply the Fast, Fun, and Furious nature of Savage Worlds to an already chaotic setting, which will be tons of fun. While all backers will receive the PDF for free when this is unlocked, print copies will also be made available at that time.\nUNLOCKED - $11,000 - Add \"Artificer\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Artificer. You'll have access to ancient relics you probably shouldn't be messing with... but the power they contain is near limitless. \n$12,000 - Add \"Infiltrator\" Class\nAt this level, we will include a PDF for a new Student type called the Infiltrator. You'll become an engineers person, a perfect clone of what a human \"should\" be, but you are something wholly different. \n$16,000 - Premium Printing\nAt this level, H. P. Lovecraft Preparatory Academy will have both its softcover and hardcover done as an offset run, making the quality that much more amazing! \n$17,500 - Custom Adventure\nAt this level, we will publish an complete adventure written by the accomplished Bill Bodden. This adventure will be made available for free to all backers once complete \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe at Third Eye Games have become accustomed to delivering on Kickstarter deadlines reliably and efficiently.

This town is growing fast, and these new heroes, villains and minions need a gang leader like you to take charge!\nWith your help, we hope to fund many new miniatures to add to your gangs. There will be 3-man Minion Packs, along with large Monsters and a few solo miniatures along the way too. In addition to funding these new miniatures, we also plan to invest in our own high res HD DLP 3D printer which, while expensive, will cut down on our ongoing production costs in the future.\nWe just finished delivering our previous successful campaign, launching the second edition of the game. Click here if you would like to download the basic rules, or visit our website at SkirmishGames.com to learn more about Blackwater Gulch and the Gangfight Game System.\nHelp us out, it's easy! Just select a pledge option on the right to show your level of interest. You can just pick up 1 pack, or get them all! If you've never experienced Blackwater Gulch, our Newcomer pledge is the perfect place to start. It includes our Hardcover Rulebook, Loot Cards and Starter Packs for two factions, as well as two minion packs to match, all at a discounted price - a perfect 2-player starter bundle.\nScale and Size\nHere is a photo of the production miniatures for the Unsung, along with some other miniatures and a ruler for size reference. Note that they may seem a bit taller due to the optional base inserts shown. Our miniatures measure roughly 32mm to the eye when standing straight up.\nMinion & Monster Packs\nThe menu below shows all of the new minion packs and monsters available in this campaign. Each Minion Pack or Monster costs $18 for Contributors, or $15 for Collector and Newcomer backers. We will add to this list throughout the campaign if we are able to unlock new stretch goals after the campaign funds.\nSolo Miniatures, Rules & Starter Sets\nIn the list below, you will find extra items that aren't included with our standard pledge levels, including a solo miniatures, faction starter sets and a rulebook & loot card bundle. If you would like to receive any of these items, just increase your pledge to cover the costs listed below. Don't forget, you can add on any additional Minion or Monster pack - $18 each for Contributors, and $15 each for Collectors and Newcomers.\n Rules & Starter Sets\n  Miniatures Preview\nWant to see a preview of our miniatures? Watch The Beasts of War Tabletop Clip below, where they show off all of the recent Blackwater Gulch releases and talk about this campaign too!\nShipping Information\nShipping costs are not included in the pledge amounts. Instead, you will be able to pay for shipping separately in our Pledge Manager after the campaign ends. This is the easiest way to handle shipping since many backers will be receiving different items and there won\u2019t be a fixed shipping cost for all.\nWe offer hassle-free worldwide shipping, and in most cases you won\u2019t need to worry about customs charges or VAT (if you are charged a customs fee in the end, we will reimburse you). Shipping costs will depend upon your location, and costs are based on weight. Our packs of miniatures, even metal ones, are relatively light, but the Newcomer pledge may weigh a bit more due to the hardcover rulebook. All packages will ship from the USA, and all of our products are made and/or printed in the USA too.\nFor shipping to the USA, we expect Contributor and Collector pledges to cost around $8-12, Newcomers should be around $10-15. All other countries, expect a minimum $15 for Contributor and Collector pledges, and over $20 for Newcomer pledges. Please note these are prices are just guesses and could change by the time we are ready to ship, but we will always do our best to make shipping as easy and affordable as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run multiple Kickstarter campaigns, and every one has been a learning experience. We feel (and hope) that we have the bugs worked out and now can proceed with a campaign structure that will fit for us going forward, to help fund new and cool miniatures for Blackwater Gulch and other future gameworlds.\n\nShipping, especially internationally, will always have issues to deal with. Rates change without warning, global events can slow things down, and we never know who is going to be hit by custom's charges until the very end. We have added an extra $1000 to our funding goal to cover any unforeseen charges we need to cover at the last minute, such as sudden taxes or lost packages.\n\nWe look forward to running a smooth and straightforward campaign, and can't wait to get these new miniatures created!

That should alleviate a lot of the issues he was having with parts breaking off and prints failing.

It's colored by Donovan Yaciuk, Steven Legge, and Fahriza Kamaputra. It's lettered by Darius and Legge.\nHere's how the contents break down:\nWe begin with \"Gladiators,\" a 27-page story focused on Ripshot, the champion in the robot gladiator arena, and Clawburst, his next opponent. Oh, and Nibbles, Ripshot's assistant / pet.\nWhen the robot revolution intervenes, these gladiators have to figure out where they stand. The story is wild, with lots of twists, and goes to bizarre and unexpected places.\nIt's probably the most Kirbyesque thing Julian Darius will ever write! Steven Legge illustrated the hell out of it, combining innovative page layouts with panels teeming with wild robot designs! Donovan Yaciuk colored the story.\nOur second story is \"How I Spent the Robot Revolution,\" a 10-page tale focused on a Martian family trying to survive the robotic carnage. Unfortunately, the family's apartment is sentient and trying to kill them! Steven Legge illustrated and colored this one, making these bizarre situations really come alive.\nOur final story is \"His Name was Journey 1,\" a 9-page story focused on a humble bot built to supervise construction projects. After the revolution, he designs buildings for robots, trying to break free of organic design. He winds up creating the robots' equivalent of a god. The story's illustrated by Andre Siregar and will be colored by Fahriza Kamaputra.\nThe issue also includes a bunch of sketch pages, featuring the crazy robotic designs of Legge, Darius, and Siregar.\nIt's a big, trippy issue featuring three unconventional tales of robotic life and awesome design work!\nWe normally don't do print editions of our comics, but we just thought it would be fun to see this big, debut issue of The Synthetics in print. It's just such a cool issue, and it works on its own, despite technically taking place within the larger Martian Universe (which also includes Martian Comics, Kimot Ren, and Lazarus, the Forever Man). We're limiting the total number of printed copies to 100, in order to participate in Kickstarter's Make 100 program. Every single printed copy will be signed and numbered by creator Julian Darius.\nMost of the revenue will go to pay printing and shipping costs. Anything beyond that will will go to help us pay our artists.\nWe've tried to keep it simple.\nIf you just want our 56-page first issue in digital, you can get it for $4.\nIf you want The Synthetics #1 in print, you can get that -- in a signed-and-numbered limited edition(!) and with a complementary digital copy -- for $12.\nFor $29, you can get the complete collection of all our comics, up to and including The Synthetics #1, in digital (a $58 value).\nFor just $8 more ($37 total), we'll add The Synthetics #1 in print to this same digital set of all our comics!\nFinally, we've got just a few copies remaining of past printed comics and goodies: a signed-and-numbered TPB of Martian Comics #1-3, a signed-and-numbered Martian Comics #5, and postcards of the covers to Martian Comics #1 and #5. We'll give these to you, along with The Synthetics #1 in print and the entire digital library of comics, for $74.\nWe're offering a couple of bonus books for our early adopters, plus more free stuff if we hit our stretch goals!\nTIME EXPIRED: Everyone who pledged by the end of Tuesday, 23 January, Central U.S. time, will get a free PDF of Julian Darius's 428-page non-fiction book Classics on Infinite Earths: The Justice League and DC Crossover Canon, which is a huge walk-through of Justice League history and DC's company-wide crossovers.\nTIME EXPIRED: Everyone who pledged by the end of Tuesday, 30 January, Central U.S. time, will get a free PDF of Julian's non-fiction book about Mai, the Psychic Girl.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #1: If we hit $1700, everyone pledging will receive a free digital download (a $6 value) of the documentary film Grant Morrison: Talking with Gods, directed by Patrick Meaney. This critically acclaimed feature-length film, released in 2010, features extensive interviews with Grant Morrison and studies both his life and his comics career.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #2: If we hit $2200, everyone pledging will receive a free digital download (in DRM-free PDF and CBZ formats) of Martian Comics #12. This special anniversary issue is even longer than The Synthetics #1. It features the issue-length next chapter of the title's main serial, \"The Girl from Mars,\" which is in the middle of a huge study of American history and is currently focused on the assassination of Robert Kennedy from the perspective of an alien arms dealer. But Martian Comics #12 also includes its cover story, \"The Dinosaurs of Mars!\", a wild tale of Martians' obsession with dinosaurs, including parks on Mars where dinos thrive and play.\nThe issue also includes \"I Dream of Hell,\" in which Martians try to possess a medieval man with a very different worldview than their own. Rounding out the anniversary issue are two beautiful pin-ups by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nThe issue is written by Julian Darius, with art by Sergio Tarquini, Sara Nietto, Mansyur Daman, and Cloves Rodrigues. Steven Legge (who drew most of The Synthetics #1) also drew a special page with a robot dinosaur on Mars! Colors will be by R.L. Campos and Fahriza Kamaputra. The issue's cover is by artist Jason Muhr and colorist Andrei Tabacaru, the artistic team behind the indy hit Voracious.\nMartian Comics #12 should be available about a month after The Synthetics #1 is delivered.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #3: If we hit $2700, everyone pledging will receive a free PDF of Voyage in Noise: Warren Ellis and the Demise of Western Civilization, by Julian Darius and Kevin Thurman.\nWe'll also give everyone pledging a free download of Martian Comics #13, which features two stories. The first, illustrated by Andi Supriyono, is set during World War II. The second, illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, is the beginning of a longer story that explores the Martian mythological underworld and its ruling goddess. The cover is by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nUNLOCKED! -- STRETCH GOAL #4: If we hit $3200, everyone pledging will receive a free download of the feature-length documentary film Warren Ellis: Captured Ghosts, directed by Patrick Meaney.\nWe'll also give everyone a free download of Martian Comics #14, which continues the story of the Martian underworld from the previous issue. It's illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, with a cover by Rodrigues and painter Roni Setiawan.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: If we hit $3700, everyone pledging will receive a free download of the feature-length documentary film Diagram for Delinquents, directed by Robert A. Emmons, Jr. It explores Fredric Wertham and the crusade against comics in the 1940s and 1950s, during which comics were burned across America.\nWe'll also give every backer a free download of Martian Comics #15, the conclusion of the Martian underworld story. It's illustrated by Cloves Rodrigues, with a cover by Marlena Mozgawa Lenamo.\nThe free books and movies will be available shortly after the Kickstarter campaign concludes. Since they're still in production, the free comics may take a bit longer, but we expect each to be available around a month after the previous one. So about a month after you receive The Synethetics #1, you should receive Martian Comics #12, and we expect each additional issue to be available around a month after the previous one. Of course, if we're done early, we'll message you with the download link right away!\nThank you for your support of this weird robot comics project!

Doctor Babylon, LEGION\u2019s head of technology and development, has unlocked the secrets of the cosmic power source Dark Matter and plans global armageddon. In the wake of LEGION\u2019s ascendance, a crack-shot team of hand-picked agents known as MAYHEM emerges, whose sole purpose is to destroy LEGION and take the world back. Will you use LEGION\u2019s Dark Matter-powered doomsday devices and super-weapons to wreak havoc on Seoul: The City of Tomorrow or will you join the band of gadget-wielding misfits to dish out some MAYHEM?\n\nAgents of Mayhem - Pride of Babylon is a team vs. team skirmish boardgame for 2 to 4 players. The game is played on a modular 3D board that is fully destructible. You and your opponents will play through a radiant story where every choice you make will have effects that ripple throughout the campaign. Play as either LEGION, an organization of super villains who have taken over the world, or as MAYHEM, a band of anti-heroes who will do what ever it takes to stop LEGION.\nIn every game, use the modular tiles to set up an entirely new cityscape in near-future Seoul, Korea!\n3D BOARD! - Play on a board made of modular tiles with 3D multi-level buildings that are up to 240mm high! Use the buildings as cover or to dodge an attack by jumping behind a wall. Take the high ground to gain elevation advantages and attack bonuses against your enemies. The modular tiles allow you to make hundreds of different game maps.\nLEGION troopers have surrounded a building in which they suspect a MAYHEM agent is holed up. Why storm the building and risk injury? Lets just blow the dang thing up and pick up MAYHEM souvenirs!\nDestructible Terrain - You can drive enemies from behind cover by triggering explosions. These explosions and your attacks will often cause damage to a building which will eventually cause it to collapse.\nPictured are MAYHEM's Fortune character and one of LEGION's Swarm Troopers!\nUnique Characters - Every MAYHEM and LEGION character has their own highly detailed miniature and a Character Board that outlines their stats and abilities. Each character has a unique gameplay style and you will have to choose the right team for each mission. Finding the right combination of characters and tactics is half the fun of Agents of Mayhem: Pride of Babylon. The other half is blowing stuff up!\nHollywood's Character Board shows all of his abilities, actions, upgrades and gadgets.

When we were approached to develop a board game utilizing our military tactical engines, we were taken aback. But the more we thought about it, the more excited we became about the near future Agents of Mayhem world. We decided to go for it and founded our new Sci-Fi and Fantasy division - Apollo Games!  \nWe have applied all of our award winning experience into the over-the-top and humorous Anti-Hero vs Super Villain theme of Agents of Mayhem. Now you will need to utilize real world military combined arms tactics to succeed, even if you can jump over buildings, stop the bad guys with your looks, or conjure up monsters from the earth! On top of this, we have developed a campaign system like no other board game, in which every decision you make can affect you in the future. \nShipping will be charged during your post-Kickstarter campaign survey on which you will fill in your shipping address.

Our last two projects 'Mare Nostrum - Empires' and '878 Vikings' were so successful, that we unlocked all of our stretch goals. 878 Vikings English language games began shipping only 3 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. Online Forum and BoardGameGeek ratings and comments are very high and positive.\n\n'Pride of Babylon' is 100% developed and project managed in the USA. We have full control of every aspect of the project. All stretch goals and game expansions have already been fully developed and playtested. All artwork is finalized and manpower has been scheduled and set aside to make sure that Pride of Babylon will ship in a timely manner.\n\nPride of Babylon is scheduled to ship by Sept 2018, 6 months after the end of the KS campaign! We need this time to finalize the many high detail miniature molds, print the required pledge numbers, ship the games to our fulfillment centers worldwide, and then shipping them on to you. We will only be producing this game in English to speed up and simplify production and delivery. \n\nAs with every project, there can be unseen issues that can crop up. This game is set to be printed in China with a printer that we have developed a relationship with for years. Past issues have been always taken care of in a professional and quick manner and we expect this good relationship to continue.\n\nWe appreciate your Kickstarter support, which allows us to continue to create unique and high-quality games.

Instead of digging into the assembly every time we needed to make changes, we conceptualized wysiwyg tools for common tasks that would output, reorganize, and manipulate the underlying code; developing screens, building animations, altering AI...things like that.  We recruited Josh Fallon, tool developer extraordinaire, to help realize these tools.\nBefore we knew it, we had inadvertently created NESmaker.\nCreating with ASM versus creating with NESmaker\nCurrently, what can you do with NESmaker?\nDesign sprite graphics and color palettes that are automatically constrained to the NES limitations. \nCreate assets with properties and behaviors to give developing for the NES an object-oriented feel, similar to modern tools such as GameMaker and Unity.\nUse a text editor to create text strings for NPCs or other narrative devices your game might have.\nCreate *special screens* like start screens, end screens, menus, maps, and more.\nCustomize AI\nSet initialization parameters (items obtained, player strength/defense,  starting screen, etc) for easy testing.\nUse the base engine to create adventure games, basic RPGs, basic platformers, basic brawlers, and several other types of games.\nAssemble with one click for testing in an emulator.\nFlash to cartridge in one click for play on actual hardware.\nAdditionally, you can check out videos of us walking through the basics of NESmaker on our website at www.TheNew8bitHeroes.com\nCheck out NESmaker Videos at our site!\nSo why do we need Kickstarter? \nNESmaker is currently a little rough around the edges.  It was originally designed to meet our needs, but now that we're attempting to expand it, it needs some UI work and a bit of streamlining.  This will require a joint effort between our artist/designer, Josh our tool developer, and myself (the ASM programmer).\nWe want to build upon the tool to expand its current capabilities.  One of the core ways we intend to do this is by building genre modules, which will optimize the tool and the core ASM for that style of game.  We will use stretch goals to work on adding optimization for each genre.  Below are our target goals.\n_________________________________ \nNEW GOAL ADDED**:\n**One of the most frequently asked questions has been about creating music and sound effects using NESmaker.  Up until now, my answer has been that it is one element NESmaker is lacking natively, and that we create music using FamiTracker.  I promised that as part of the project, I would give an in depth look at how we integrate new music / sfx using FamiTracker, but that I'd love to add support for in-tool music creation that aims to create music in a more musical way (whereas FamiTracker, awesome as it is, is more like a spreadsheet generator).  Well, with the overwhelming support from you amazing backers, and after some long conceptualizing with Josh, I'd like to propose that our in-engine music creation environment be our next stretch goal, so that one never has to leave the tool to create basic music and sound effects.\n\nNEW GOAL ADDED***!\n***Many of you have been having a blast with the Troll Burner mini game we have released.  We are so close to the next milestone, we decided that if we are able to hit it, we will give all backers a full suite of Troll Burner assets in a demo project to snap together their own Troll Burner game to help learn the tool (and have a blast).  It will include many, many, many more types of placeable assets, graphics, and capability, along with the ability to customize just about everything.  Since you guys are already familiar with it and seem to be having so much fun with it, it would be a great way to learn the tool, would't it?  \nNEW GOAL ADDED****!\n****This wouldn't be a NES inspired project if we didn't give it 8 levels to defeat!  And it wouldn't be an 8-bit project without being nerds and including the number 256 (each byte has 256 possible values).  So, we've included the Mother of All Goals.  Josh and I have conceived of a way that we could handle some of the core memory remapping from the GUI in an intuitive way (as intuitive as this sort of thing can be), without ever having to go into the code.  What does this mean for you, the user?  You would get to make some broad decisions as far as how many memory banks to use for graphics, how many for music, how many for levels...etc, and would be able to custom organize them to fit your exact needs, similar to some of the decisions we're making in code for many of the modules.  For those of you asking for FPS and point and click adventure games or big cut scenes, this stretch goal would go very far in creating those, which have wildly different graphics needs.  There are a million other reasons why this would be useful for advanced users.  It's something that we'd like to include.  However, it will take a lot more time, focus, and testing.  This may not be ready by the time the tool is released, and may be an update a few months later.  But if we can hit this stretch goal it will give us that much more time to work on it, and everyone who is a backer will have access to this update.\n________________________________________\nThese base engines cover many genres.  For instance, with tweaking to the base module, both the adventure game engine and platform engine could be utilized to create a \"Metroidvania\" style side-scroller.  A shooter could be cleverly modified to create a runner.  A brawler could be manipulated to create a versus game.  Additionally, for those who are interested in really digging in and playing with the ASM, we'd like to offer a blank module that has only the necessary tethers to make the game function alongside NESmaker, but will allow the user to completely program his or her own module.\nNEW ADD-ONS!\nFEATURED ADD ON: A NESmaker Strategy Guide - in the spirit of those great strategy guides from the days of yore, this companion (art is mockup only) will be a fun, limited physical artifact, but also be a valuable tool to help newcomers get started making games with NESmaker.  Sure, there will be great and endless support on line, but it just won't be as pretty as this guide on your shelf!  The more people that order this add on, the more intricate we can make it!\nMAY BETA TESTER: The most common thing we've been asked is how a software-only backer or NESmaker Toolkit backer can become a beta tester.  While we wanted to preserve the bonus of March beta testing to our beta tester tier, we worked our a scenario where the second wave of tool enhancements will be done on or before Memorial Day weekend.  So we've now included a way for you to become *MAY* beta testers, if you can't wait until August, but also don't have $256 for the beta tester tier (or, maybe, already have a kazzo flasher).\nECONOMY FLASHER HOUSING: For anyone getting the Toolkit with the Kazzo, the device is as pictured in our video.  Some people may want a little protection for their device, but possibly not need the laser cut NES styled casing that comes with the Beta Tester tier.  Here is a solution - an economy flasher housing, which we will be working with Infinite NES Lives to provide. \nWhere will the funds be going, exactly?  \nWe'll keep it incredibly simple.  Just about 30% of funds raised through this crowdfunding campaign will go towards Kickstarter fees and taxes.  A small portion (less than 10%) will be relegated towards further marketing.  The rest will be split between paying our team and hardware rewards.  We can't make an accurate prediction at this time, because we're not sure how many people will pledge for just the software (no hardware rewards) versus pledge for the software plus cart flasher and blank cartridge.\nStill Have Questions?\nThere are a lot of logical questions one might ask at this point on a project such as this.  We polled our supporters and got a list of questions they wanted answers to, and compiled this video response.  See if your question is answered here:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI know more than anyone that developing for the NES takes time. We've spent an unexpected three years developing and refining our current engine, and have continually had to morph it to work with an evolving tool. This is one of the reasons that Mystic Searches itself is still in development! It is possible that each genre module presents new challenges to tackle that take more time than anticipated. However, since the engine and the tool are digital deliverables, and are able to be patched and updated, we will be able to deliver the tool in the state that it's in at the time of expected delivery, adding potential genre modules and updated features as they are completed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Just showing support...", "descp": "For those that are just interested in helping see this come to fruition, every little bit helps.

The final designs were settled on with the theme of the dice in mind, but importantly also with considerations of functionality and manufacture.\n\nWe felt that the lockpick was the quintessential rogue item, and we iterated through several completely separate approaches to creating a die inspired by it. In the end we struck on an idea that we felt had the right level of fun and uniqueness to it, and developed the lock and pick die as its own more elaborate and special item.\n  PLAY\n\nCredits\nDice concepts, design and modelling: Dann May and Greg May\nPromotional images and videos: Greg May\nKickstarter Manager: Brenna Noonan\nProduced by: PolyHero Dice\nThank You For Helping Us Run An Awesome Campaign\nWe're so happy to be here on Kickstarter building and growing our community.

While printing, shipping, and processing delays are always a possibility, we have set a reasonable delivery date based on our experience.\n\nRefunds\nIf you'd like a refund before your item ships, you have until one week before the scheduled ship date to request one. We can offer you a 90% refund since Kickstarter retains about 10% of your pledge for various fees. If there is something wrong with your item, we appreciate the opportunity to replace or exchange it. If a refund is preferred and there is no defect with the product, you'll be responsible for shipping it back to us. Upon receipt of the returned item, we'll issue you a 90% refund. Refund requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nReplacements \nWe are always happy to replace defective or damaged dice. Just send us photos of the damage, and we will ship a replacement at no additional cost to you. If your item needs to be returned, we will cover the cost of the return shipping. We provide replacement pieces while titles are active in our catalog, which is typically at least a year after their initial printing. Replacement requests must be made within 30 days of the date the item was delivered to you.\n\nExchanges\nSometimes you may get a set of PolyHero Dice and realize that, even if there isn't anything wrong with them, you don't like them as much in person. That's OK! In this case, you'd cover the cost to ship them back to us, but we would ship you a new set of dice in your chosen color at no additional cost to you.

A one man team with barrels of passion and the desire to make tabletop games.\n Passion, Love & Opportunity.\nFull Moon Jacket (FMJ) is Strangely Games' debut game. The game has been in progress for 1 year now and finally the opportunity and timing has arisen for a dream to become reality. It started as a project for myself to complete and has become an overwhelming and possibly life changing opportunity.  FMJ started life just over 12 months ago. From attaching post-it notes together and popping a few DnD werewolves around a map to an \u00a311,000 multi-component boxed game. FMJ is a labour of love, influenced by games and films such as:  \nHeroquest  \nSpace Crusade  \nDark World  \nXCOM:Ufo Defense  \nPredator Aliens  \nFull Metal Jacket  \nXCOM:Apocolypse  \nGears of War  \nLast of Us  \nXCOM:Enemty Within  \nI have built FMJ on the one hand to be slick and simple enough for my parents, 7 year old son and casual gamers to pick up and play but on the other have the complexity that I and other veteran gamers will play over-and-over again.  \nThis project has let me connect with so many tabletop gamers, successful Kickstarters and so many professionals in the industry who I am lucky enough to now call my friends. \n\"I Quit My Job!\"\nPhoto of the 'famous' t-shirt.\nFMJ has been in development for over 12 months. 4 weeks ago I decided to quit my full time job as a graphic design tutor job to pursue my dream to become a board game designer and publisher. I have received an overwhelmingly positive response through playtesting FMJ and I am proud and excited to bring it to Kickstarter.\nWhy Kickstarter, Why Back It?\nIt\u2019s a game about Werewolves in Vietnam!  \nBut seriously, a lot of time, money and effort has gone in to this project from the artwork, miniatures, building prototypes, attending conventions and play testing the game.  \nStrangely games have laid the foundations. Now I need your help to make this dream a reality by supporting Full Moon Jacket and making your pledge. By pledging you will receive your own copy of the first edition complete with all of the stretch goals and rewards that get unlocked. You will give a passionate and dedicated gamer a shot in the industry and allow more games to be developed, designed and published by Strangely Games. \nI have tons of fresh concepts that need to burst onto the tabletop gaming scene and only with your help can I make that happen.\nContact Me\nPaul Allen, owner of Strangely Games\nFACEBOOK https://www.facebook.com/strangelygames\nTWITTER https://twitter.com/strangelygames\nWEBSITE https:/www.strangelygames.com\nBOARD GAME GEEK https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/236861/full-moon-jacket\nKICKTRAQ https://www.kicktraq.com/projects/266751851/full-moon-jacket/\n  Are you a content creator?

When I said that my first Kickstarter project was going to involve miniatures people called me mad. Thankfully I met model maker Giorgio Bassani (Games Workshop) who has created all of the beautiful miniatures for Full Moon Jacket. Steam-forged (Dark Souls / Resident Evil 2 : the board game) have brought them to life using 3D printed master copies. With help from the guys at CMON (Zombicide, Rising Sun) they will be ready for production at their recommended Chinese factories.\n\nWhen will it arrive?\n\nStrangely Games are working with fulfilment companies Gamesquest UK and recommendations from Stonemaier Games (Viticulture, Scythe) - Ship Naked, USA.\n\nWe\u2019re keeping it as simple as possible: support our project and in return we\u2019ll send you the playable game. \n\nThank you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Pledge Manager Special", "descp": "Pledge just \u00a31 to access the Pledge Manager at the end of the Campaign.\nThis will allow you to add more funds to purchase the add-ons, the core game and anything you like the look of!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Half Moon Jacket", "descp": "Print and Play version.

Got an idea for a great title that will conquer the world? Do you have ideas in your drawer or on your computer that are waiting for better times? Yes ... we perfectly understand the situation. Ever since we began having fun, and later working with board games, we\u2019ve been devoting every moment to this great hobby. We test, change, cut and modify. As a publisher (Games Factory) we also get a lot of prototypes. Some of them are readable and carefully crafted, but the vast majority are made in a hurry or without a thought. Young authors often disassemble games from their collection in order to create their prototype. They re-use cards, destroy boards, cut and glue markers. They will often go to DIY stores in search of components that could be used as coins, discs, cubes, and will even go as far as dismantling their mum\u2019s necklaces to get the perfect bits for their prototypes...\nWouldn\u2019t it be nice to have all the necessary components at hand to create a board game? Not to ponder on which game to destroy or which piece of jewellery in mum\u2019s drawer is least valuable, yet will make for the best crystals in your game? We proudly present the Board Game Creative Kit \u2013 a tool that will vastly improve prototype creation!!!\nWhen designing the Board Game Creative Kit we thought of what you might find useful when creating your own game. We can\u2019t provide you with custom carved figurines or fancy metal coins, but we do provide bases for figurines, custom figure shapes and dozens of patterns (which you can cut out and apply to the supplied stock of counters).\nDo you need card stock to create a card game? Here you go! We\u2019ve prepared 220 cards for you! Wooden elements? Sure. More than 200 wooden components of various shapes. Six-sided dice? You can even create your own. Board? Choose between a big and a small one. Even the box in which the components are delivered has been left blank for you to customize and use for your game.\nHere's what you get in the Core Box:\n1 x white box\n6 x different punchboards including 260 tokens in various shapes \n1 x white big board \n1 x white medium board \n4 x player boards \n4 x player screens \n24 x D6 dice (4 different colours) \n24 x plastic pawns (4 different colours)\n60 x small wooden cubes (4 different colours) \n60 x medium wooden cubes (4 different colours)\n40 x medium wooden discs (4 different colours) \n40 x wooden meeples (4 different colours) \n110 x poker size cards \n110 x mini european size cards \n1 x big linen bag \n5 x various wooden components \n12 x plastic bases \n12 x blank dice\n1 x sticker sheet for blank dice (204 stickers) \n12 x zip bags\n1 x sticker sheet with personal details (4 stickers)\n1 x code for digital download (5 various pdf-s)\n1 x 24p. booklet containing publishers' details\n            We don\u2019t know what kind of game you\u2019d like to design ... but we can give you some cool ideas. With every Core Box, we will provide all unlocked PDFs with elements that may be useful to you during creation. Of course, you can also purchase PDFs from us (as an add-on) and try your hand at game design and construction on your own(see our sample PDFs with terrains). The sizes of the prepared templates are adjusted to the size of the tokens and tiles found in the Board Game Creative Kit and add-ons.\n    In the box you will also find something special - a booklet with information about publishers from all over the world who are waiting for your prototype and will be happy to look at your work. From Brazil to Russia; from the United States to Australia. We have collected the most important information about what type of game the publisher expects and how to contact them (with at least the e-mail address of the person who is in charge of receiving prototypes).\n  We've prepared quite a few add-ons to help you enrich your prototype. Are you creating an extremely elaborate card game? You will need extra cards. Need different component dimenon of wooden items! Or maybe you need more card stock? We\u2019ve prepared 8 punchboards, packed with various shapes specifically for you. Want to create a game for more players? Think about adding the 5th & 6th player expansion. Additional elements in different colors will allow you to expand your vision.\n          Board Game Creative Kit is designed by enthusiasts for enthusiasts, people who want to enjoy the creation process. Help us fulfill the dream of waking up the game designer in each and every one of us! All we need is to raise $10,000 for the basic version to see the light of day. However, if we collect more, we will add a whole lot of new items to the basic box.\nWe will unveil Stretch Goals with you in mind - the more of you who want to create, the more elements we will add to the box. Stretch Goals are divided into those that will be included in every Board Game Creative Kit purchased, and those which enhance the Add-ons. Check below to see what we can achieve together.\nUnlocked Stretch Goals\n                        You can unlock more Stretch Goals: \n    All components are manufactured in Poland, in factories which supply companies such as Board & Dice, Egmont, LudiCreations, Pegasus Spiele, Portal Games, Rebel, and many others. \nThe cardboard used for the box and tokens is 1.2mm thick and can be upgraded to 1,5mm (when we achieve that Stretch Goal). We used 130g flat surface paper stock to make the tokens more resistant. Furthermore, you can use most common pens and pencils to draw on this surface. . The wooden components are made of beech wood and have an environmentally friendly coating. The playing cards are made from 250g and can be upgraded to 300g paper (we have a SG for that as well). Their surface is flat (i.e. no canvas finish), which makes it easier to write on them. The two game boards included have a white linen finish on both sides\nAll the other items you will find in the box are of equally high quality. Our goal is for you to create the best, most beautiful and robust prototype. Even the box itself can be used for the prototype. An easily removable sleeve prevents the box from opening accidentally. \nAll components are CE-certified.\n  Games Factory has been running campaigns on Polish crowdfunding portals for over 2 years. We\u2019ve managed to successfully carry out fifteen campaigns, collecting over 1,100,000 PLN (Polish curency). We are the publisher of such games as Roll for the Galaxy, Star Realms, Kingdomino and Dominion, and we have a wide fan base in Poland. It\u2019s time to present our ideas to the World; Board Game Creative Kit is the first of them.\nThis project is backed by an experienced team led by Marcin Ropka who gained valuable experience in such companies as Trefl Card Factory (Krakow) and Portal Games (Gliwice). For many years Marcin, along with Viola Kijowska, has also led a group of testers called Little Compulsive Game Testers, and frequently gives lectures on how to create board games and prototypes. Marcin, together with Viola, is the author of 3 published games (including Alien Artefacts by Portal Games) and dozens of prototypes.\nPiotr Sobieraj, Bartek Samel, Wojtek Rad\u0142owski and Kuba Mann have a lot of experience in the industry, who worked for years for Bard publishing house (the Polish publisher of Carcassonne). In addition, this campaign is supported by Karol G\u00f3rniak and Grzegorz Wac\u0142awczyk \u2013 kind souls with lots of interesting ideas. Wojtek Filarski inspired us with the idea of a perfect tool for board game designers. His endless inspiration and fresh perspective on certain matters has been invaluable in the creation of this and many other campaigns.\nPrinting, production, and preparing for shipping will take place in Poland. It is very important to be able to supervise every step of the production and ensure the best possible quality. That's why fulfilment will be done by companies in Poland.\nThis campaign offers so many add-ons and pledge levels, that we decided to go the extra mile to find the best solution for worldwide shipping. Thus offering shipping for the lowest and most accurate cost possible. Fulfillment will be done in Poland, after which we will send all the packages to our partners. \nWe are using the best possible tracking system; you can follow your pledge from the second it leaves our office until the moment you receive it to your door.Based on the information we have now, we can say that the cost of shipping will be determined by the weight of the package and by the area you live in:    \nUSA: starting at 8$\nCanada: starting at 10$ \nWestern Europe and most EU countries: starting at 8$ \nEastern Europe: starting at 12$ \nRest of the World: starting at 29$ \nMexico: starting at 12$ \nChina, Australia, Israel, Japan, Singapore, New Zealand: starting at 20$\nIMPORTANT: SHIPPING PAYMENTS WILL BE PROCESSED AFTER THE PLEDGE MANAGER CLOSES\nThe exact price will be determined and announced within few days. \nWe also prepared a useful excel file that will help you customize your pledge level based on the weight of the core box and the selected add-ons.

Just after fair, we\u2019ve ordered transport of what we had left from Essen to Raben (warehouse company we were working with back then). There were 2 pallets (400 pieces) of BGCK Core Set. About one week later, we\u2019ve got information that pallets are safely stored in our warehouse, so we went back to everyday work. This was exact moment, where we have made a mistake, because pallets contained not Core Sets, but just empty boxes. How? When we have ordered boxes for BGCK, we had to order more than we needed (because of minimum order quantity). Boxes we haven\u2019t used were sent to our warehouse, where they were mistaken with ready-to-sell BGCK. You already know the rest of this story \u2013 few monts later, BGCK were already available for sell in shop in Finland, who specialised itself in selling badstocks and \u201eforgotten\u201d goods from warehouses. Before we found out, they have already sold 300 of 400 copies. Cooperation with them isn\u2019t working very well, since we still haven\u2019t received most important information from them \u2013 whom they have bought BGCK from. We went with our case to the Police about two weeks ago. Right now, we are still waiting for letter of initiation. As soon as we got it, we will share it with you.

With your training incomplete, you must command powerful wizards or absorb their power to become powerful yourself. You must work together to stop the Black Wizard, but in the end only one can become the next King.\nCompetitive cooperation: Only the first Heir to gain enough power can become the next Wizard King. But in order to claim the throne, you must also cooperate to defeat the Black Wizard-a powerful and sophisticated AI that quickly climbs the power track. \nDynamic set collection: Heirs of the Wizard King has revolutionized popular set collection mechanisms. To defeat the Black Wizard, players forge Chains of Wizards by matching color or number. Because cards only need to match their neighbor, you can pursue multiple strategies and be less dependent on luck.\nStrategic Decisions: With multiple uses for every card, every choice has long lasting consequences. Do you use that high powered Wizard or begin investing in his spell? Do you take down the Black Wizard or ignore him hoping an opponent will stop him? Each choice you make will permanently change what type of King you will be. \n  Rahdo Runs Through: \"There are these really interesting semi-cooperative mechanics at play. Multi-use cards, one of my favorite mechanisms of all time, works very well here. Overall, it's a very sharp, very clever little card game.\"\n  PnP in at least 6 languages by next year!\nSo far, we have volunteer translators for German, French, Spanish, Dutch and Latvian! While we haven't raised the funds necessary to produce the game in multiple languages, with the help of volunteer translators, we will release multi-language, PnP versions of the game next year! \nIf you would like to volunteer for this effort, please message me directly!\n          How to Play, a Solo Run-through:\n      We will be releasing a 5-8 player variant of the game with no additional downtime, no increase in play time and has play tested really well. It does require a second copy of the game. But you save $3 on additional copies.\n    Tantrum House: \"Lots of good decision making that creates a nice flow throughout the entire game. We really enjoyed the artwork style and illustrations.\"\n Gaming With Edo: \"Heirs of the Wizard King has an interesting competitive cooperation. It moves quickly, and stays pretty tight. It's a nice little package that's worth checking out.\" \nThe Kwaranteen: \"It's every man for himself, but if you don't keep the Black Wizard under control you're all going to lose. That's such an awesome mechanic we all loved.\"\n Unfiltered Gamer: \"Heirs of the Wizard King is a very interesting, unique chaining game. It has just the right difficulty. Very fun, I would suggest it.\"\nG Club: \"The Black Wizard interacts with the table like another player. Two big thumbs up. A fantastic value for what you're getting.\"\n Dice Odyssey: \"I love this game! You are going to keep pulling this game out, over and over again. With the amount of ingenuity that was put in this, you can tell it was a labor of love.\" \n  Gameosity: \"Heirs of the Wizard King is a small, attractive, engaging card game - a great fit in most any collection - that we absolutely suggest checking out!\"\nWYLD Gaming: \"I like the balance and strategy the game delivers. The Black Wizard should not be dealt with lightly. He is very powerful and will easily win the game if you don't work together.\"\nNonstop Tabletop: \"The artwork is fantastic, the decisions are tantalizing. We can see this game becoming a sleeper hit!\nTo Die for Games: \"You have to really pay attention to the Black Wizard because he can gain cards quickly as you complete chains with more players.\"\nPawn's Perspective: \"Heirs of the Wizard King manages to pack an insane amount of depth into a fairly small package and low play time.

It's Mike Selinker of Lone Shark Games. My friends Mike \"Gabe\" Krahulik and Jerry \"Tycho\" Holkins, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game lead developer Chad Brown and Lords of Waterdeep co-designer Rodney Thompson, and the whole crew at Penny Arcade and Lone Shark have come together to make a new kind of game. Thornwatch is a graphic novel adventure that bridges the gap between board games and RPGs, the first of three interlocking games in the Eyrewood Adventures line.\nThrough the game\u2019s unique modular storytelling structure, players get the experience of an RPG in a board game. Thornwatch can be pulled off the shelf for 60 minutes of fun, or provide 2+ hours of epic adventure. It is a visually arresting game, unlike anything we\u2019ve ever made before. When you play Thornwatch, you are inside a comic book story of your own making. And you can play this game right now. This link will allow you to download our print-and-play.\nWe present to you: Thornwatch.\n  PLAY\n\nThornwatch bestows upon one player the role of the Judge, who enacts the will of the Judging Wood. Each other player plays a Thornwatch character: among them the Blade, Greenheart, Guard, Sage, and Warden. The game begins with the Judge selecting a storyboard in which the Thornwatch manifest before a tree adorned with a knot of thorny brambles, surrounded by conflict. If the players overcome this first challenge, the Judge offers choices that lead to new storyboards and further adventure.\nStoryboard. Art by Mike K, images not final.\nThe game takes place on one of many maps that display forests, swamps, and villages of the Eyrewood. The pawns lay flat, as if the heroes, enemies, and denizens of the forest are characters in a set of comic book panels.\nGame in play. Pawns of the Swamp Choir, Gliders, Sage, Blade, and Warden on swamp and forest map tiles with dice and terrain cards.\nThe core engine is the momentum system. This system tracks turn order and monster health, encourages teamwork, and creates dynamic combat with priorities that change turn-by-turn and round-by-round.     \nMomentum cards. Art by Mike K, images not final.\nThe Thornwatch players each have decks of cards which give them skills and actions, as well as playmats and trait cards to show their unique outlook on the world. They roll custom dice including hero dice gained by manifesting their traits. Each session Thornwatch players can gain knots, which grant their wearer a bonus if worn in real life, regardless of which Thornwatch they choose to manifest in a particular session.\nPlayer and judge cards from the print-and-play. Across the top, a hand of cards for the Sage. On the bottom, the Sage's trait cards (one flipped to a hero die), an enemy rules card, and a terrain card.\n  Over the course of this campaign we unlocked momentum goals that enriched the community and enhanced the game.\nAlready achieved: Everything! Each backer of the game gets 2 PAX Australia 2016, 2 PAX South 2016, 2 PAX East 2017, and 2 PAX West 2017 stories, an 8-page comic, an Eyrewood Survival Guide, 12 scar cards, 18 extra terrain cards, extra enemy pawns and cards, and a Briarlock deck, pawns, and player mat. For an additional $5 to cover postage, each backer of the game will also receive a free Dark of the Wood expansion, with 4 more Ebb-corrupted characters and stories. We've also unlocked a digital album of Eyrewood-inspired music, and a website with a knot-tying guide, a lore compendium, a digital art showcase, and a PDF of Mike Krahulik's original Card Warriorz notebook.\nWe also encourage you to share this game with your friends. You can use these Thornwatch crest images for your Kickstarter profile, Facebook header and profile, Twitter header and profile, Instagram profile and lightbox, Google+ header and profile, and Pinterest profile. \n\nMagic. And also game components.  \nAt the $78 Summon the Thornwatch level, you'll receive the Thornwatch base game. This currently contains:  \n24 double-sided chipboard map tiles \n15 storyboards made of 400 GSM heavy cardstock\n5 Thornwatch decks of 30 cards each\n30 momentum cards\n50 wound cards \n8 custom dice, including 2 hero dice \n6 cardstock player mats \ndozens of chipboard hero, denizen, and enemy pawns\n24 trait cards \n12 scar cards\n48 terrain cards \n30 enemy and denizen cards \n24 chipboard ebb tokens\n16 chipboard objective tokens\nillustrated rulebook, survival guide, and comic book\nYou can also get the Dark of the Wood expansion before anyone else simply by adding $5 to your pledge. It contains:\n9 storyboards made of 400 GSM heavy cardstock\n5 Thornwatch decks of 30 cards each\n10 momentum cards\nextra chipboard hero, denizen, and enemy pawns \n10 enemy and denizen cards\n5 cardstock player mats \nWe also have levels that include additional rewards, like this exclusive Thornwatch Pinny Arcade pin. Pinny Arcade is a wildly popular set of collectible pins that are traded at the PAX conventions. This pin is available only to backers and will never be available again. \nSo shiny.\nThis beautiful and ornate wooden box, made by Dapper Devil, was created just for the Thornwatch game. The box can be yours at either of the Walk in the Wood levels.\nWood box prototype by Dapper Devil.\nThe Walk in the Woods level also comes with these beautiful, upgraded player pawns by Dapper Devil. The player pawns are made of 1/8\" thick clear acrylic, and have a felt back to provide a smooth gliding feel when moved.

Check them all out to the right. \n  Thornwatch is a collaboration between Lone Shark Games And Penny Arcade. Penny Arcade\u2019s founders Mike \u201cGabe\u201d Krahulik and Jerry \u201cTycho\u201d Holkins have delivered mirth to the Internet three times a week for 18 years, and somehow found the time to start the Child's Play charity for kids and four PAX festivals for game players of all persuasions. In 2009 they created a single-page comic called \u201cMay We Die In The Forest,\u201d introducing The Lookouts, a troop of boys, guided by a Lookout Master, in a dangerous and magical forest. Over the years the forest gained a name, The Eyrewood.  \nThe core of Thornwatch was developed by Krahulik as a way to fix the problems he saw in his home RPG campaign: folks not paying attention during other players\u2019 turns, the fussiness of tracking individual hit points, lengthy prep time, and the difficulty of adjusting when a player can\u2019t show up for a particular game. He tinkered with his solution, a card-based RPG called Card Warriorz (with a Z!), until it became something that actually was worth playing. Jerry had the idea to set the game in the world of one of Penny Arcade\u2019s most popular side-stories, and Thornwatch was born.  \nIt soon became apparent that while they had the basis for a great game, Penny Arcade did not have the resources to bring it all together. That\u2019s when Lone Shark Games moved into Penny Arcade\u2019s office building. Its president, Pathfinder Adventure Card Game and Betrayal at House on the Hill developer Mike Selinker, asked\u2014well, kinda demanded\u2014to see the new game Krahulik and Holkins were constantly talking about. After Mike saw the game he immediately said, \u201cWe have to make this. Together.\u201d He brought Pathfinder Adventure Card Game lead developer Chad Brown and D&D 5th Edition and Lords of Waterdeep co-designer Rodney Thompson onto the design team. And thus began a furious year of development.  \nTogether the quintet of designers powered through iteration after iteration after iteration of the game, assisted with development from Mike Fehlauer and Kiko Villasenor from Penny Arcade, and additional development from the rest of the Sharks (Aviva Schecterson, Elisa Teague, Gaby Weidling, Keith Richmond, Liz Spain, Paul Peterson, and Tanis O\u2019Connor). The game grew from the integration of Penny Arcade\u2019s understanding of comic art and story with Lone Shark\u2019s grasp of game mechanics. For every question, someone used their unique skill set to create an answer no one had seen before.  \nYou\u2019ll also see the fine work of our teammates Marie Poole, Shane Steed, Brian Sunter, and Tara Theoharis on this campaign, as well as the videographic wizardry of Van Alan, Dabe Alan, Mike Astle, Nacime Khemis, and Joshua Price. To make the best game for you, we brought an army.\nIf you'd like to see two of the Mikes play a game with Eric Martin of BoardGameGeek, that's right here.\n    The Eyrewood is about discovery, wonder, mystery, courage, and sacrifice. It is a conscious magical forest that covers (as best anyone can tell) the whole of the world. Its great canopy conceals countless wonders and dangers. It teems with life; fantastical beasts, ancient monsters and creatures beyond description. People also call the Eyrewood home and their villages dot the wood like islands in a great sea. The Eyrewood never quite stays where you leave it; that is, save the Birch tree, which is clever, and remembers. As a \"place,\" this Judging Wood is a dangerous, constantly shifting realm which the word \"wild\" doesn't begin to describe. \nThe forest is beset by a malevolent force called the ebb, which corrupts and transforms the creatures of the Eyrewood. There are three groups of protectors against this bane: the Lookouts, a cadre of young cadets that are trained as youth in the ways of monsters; the Daughters, proud druids who carve out enclaves of land that obey their very commands; and the Thornwatch, who \u2026 well, they bear a very special purpose indeed.\n    Keepers of an ancient pact, the Thornwatch are a cadre of willful ghosts, with peerless mystic and martial traditions. They are summoned by tying certain knots of thorny brambles around the trunk of a birch tree, bound by blood. \nVillagers are warned about calling the Thornwatch, even as the Eyrewood presents them with challenges beyond their ability. There are tales of malformed, violent, or dangerous Thornwatch, summoned perhaps by a bad knot, or to a sick tree; perhaps that is the source of the warnings. \nThe villagers have heard the warnings since they were children: \"tie ye no knots in the frost-haunted wood.\" But still, in a moment of fear or anger, they call them. The Thornwatch heed that call. \nWhen summoned, the Thornwatch incarnate in various forms; men and women are among their number, and others besides. They are the Blade, fast and true of aim; the Greenheart, master of the healing arts; the Guard, protector of all, the Sage, clever at forest magic; and the Warden, marshal of combat lore.\n  Thornwatch is expansive, and it has the potential to change how you play games\u2014and even how you look when you play games.    \n A cornerstone of this principle is knots. When you are victorious in a Thornwatch adventure, you\u2014not your character, you\u2014gain a specific knot. The type of knot is important:\nThere are as many knots as there are threats, and there are more threats than the villages can handle. As you protect the forest, you will acquire these knots, and they will change your gameplay. You can see an example of that in the print-and-play, where gaining the Knot of Wings can allow you to start your next game with a hero die already active\u2014if you have the knot tied on your person. You can tie on the drawstrings of your favorite hoodie, or to the straps of your backpack. Each knot will be different, many gained at special events such as the PAX conventions. When you come to play, come in the way of the woods. \nWe encourage cosplay of our characters, creation of songs and poems, fan-drawn artwork, and all other creative efforts. All of this will be rewarded by our team when we see it\u2014especially during this campaign, when we will select the best creations and post them for the world to see. \nWhen they are summoned, the Thornwatch bring hope where there is only fear. But that is not all that is known of the Thornwatch. They bear a secret so dark, so troubling, that it can only be spoken of in the Book of Riddles. One of these riddles is well-known: It is the Riddle of Thorns.\nThroughout the campaign, we will bring you five parts to the Riddle of Thorns. Each of the first four is a puzzle that will get you one line of a four-line poem. You must figure out that line, knowing only the number of words as shown in the blanks at the bottom of each puzzle. Then go to the appropriate webpage and type in that line. If you do so successfully, you will be awarded one of the crests of the Thornwatch, which you may use as your avatar for Facebook, Twitter, or Kickstarter. The final riddle, the Knots in the Birch Tree, will show you the Thornwatch's secret and get you the final crest.\nAll of the riddles can be found in update #18. Go there now and unlock your mind.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve run four successful Kickstarter campaigns, and two of them\u2014the puzzle novel The Maze of Games and its companion audiobook\u2014have come out. Our third, the Apocrypha Adventure Card Game is in its final stages of development and layout, and will be at the printer soon. Our fourth, The Ninth World: A Skillbuilding Game for Numenera, is completed in design and its art is well underway.\n\nIn all of those campaigns, we\u2019ve learned the effects of packing our games and books with lots and lots of content that we had not yet designed. These have contributed to delays on three of the four projects. For this one, we decided to go a different route. Our game design is very nearly complete, leaving only development and art\u2014lots of it\u2014for the later stages. These parts are more predictable than design, and so we feel we're on a good track for getting the game out when we expect.\n\n---\nThornwatch\u2122, Lookouts\u2122, Daughters\u2122, and the Eyrewood\u2122 setting are the property of and copyrighted works of Penny Arcade, Inc.

In this universe, planets are flat, and the laws of physics function on very different principles.  The upward rushing hurricane that makes up outer space is known as the deep sky, and strange alien life hides in the mists.  The battles that you take part in will act out the stories of the kingdoms and cultures that sail their clockwork ships between these worlds.  \nReview by Boardgamebrawl: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsE9t34FZjo\nMiniatures\nClockwork Armada uses highly detailed resin and pewter miniatures to represent the warships of each faction, available at discount in this Kickstarter.  All backers of pledge levels that offer miniatures as rewards will receive a survey after funding is completed, allowing them to choose what classes of vessels to receive for their backer rewards.  Many different ship parts for each faction's capital ships will allow for a total of seven unique cruiser and battle cruiser variants to choose from per faction. \n*The Ship Master pledge is effectively the 'starter set' fleet package.  The Commander pledge would be 'starter set plus'.\n*Backers will have the choice of many different ship classes with unique weapon systems once funding is completed.\nCarthesian Empire\nThe Carthesian fleet is influenced aesthetically by the ships that sailed the oceans during the Age of Sail.  Backers will have choices in their cruiser and battle cruiser options such as cannons, beam weapons, launch bays, shield generators, and mage bunker parts to transform their ships into many different classes of vessel.\nThe Carthesian corvettes come with two different variant weapon options included.\nMoren Confederation                                                                      \nThe vessels of the Moren Confederation use the dreadnoughts of the first World War as inspiration for their designs.  Backers will have choices in their cruiser and battlecruiser options such as cannons, beam weapons, launch bays, shield generators, and lightning cannon parts to transform their ships into many different classes of vessel.\n The Moren corvettes come with two different variant weapon options included.\nMiniatures Size Comparisons                                                                 Here are the ships next to miniatures from Star Wars, Firestorm Armada, Battlefleet Gothic, and Dystopian Wars.\nCourse Ruler Set\nPhysical miniatures pledge rewards of Ship Master and higher come with one or more Course Ruler sets.  Each set contains forty plastic ruler segments: ten segments for each of the four levels of mobility in the game.  These modular segments are each one inch in length with differing degrees of turn depending on the ruler level, and are used by ships in the game to alter course.  The design of the ruler pieces will vary slightly in the production version to conform with the specifics of the plastic injection molding process, though their size and function will remain the same.\nSet will include 40 ruler segments\nBases and Reference Cards\nEach miniature will come with its own plastic ship base and flight stem. The base includes markings to easily visualize the quadrants and heading of the ship during a game.  Frigates and corvettes use 35mm bases, cruisers have 50mm bases, and battle cruisers come with 70mm bases.  \nEach ship also comes with a 2.5x3.5\" full color stat card specific to its class that allows for quick reference of the ships attributes, as well as damage tracking.  The back of the card contains text for any special rules that the ship may have.  Frigates and corvettes use one card per squadron.\n*The cards shown are proof of concept prototype card art.  The final cards will look even more polished.\nClockwork Armada Core Rules: http://www.randomartattack.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Rules.pdf\nPLAY\n\nThe Story\nThe cultures that exist on the hundreds of flat worlds in the Fields of Celestae setting are shaped by the unique existence they struggle to survive in.  Extended travel through the deep sky is fueled by advances in clockwork and steam technology, as well as the treasure hunters that search for the ancient wreckage from which mystery technology, or mystech, is salvaged.  Voyages between worlds are made possible by stream currents, naturally occurring vortexes of air that sometimes lead to nearby stars.  Ships containing priceless stream keys artificially agitate these currents into existence, and thus the trade and traffic of civilizations continues to flow.\nThe Carthesian Empire is by far the dominant power in known space, and has been for nearly two thousand years.  Its fleets are more accurate, agile, and experienced than the powers that remain a threat to its supremacy, keeping in check the few holdouts that are not wooed by its rich culture.  Enemies of the Empire often find that they must contend with powerful mages that can bend the four elements themselves to the needs of the armada.  Descendants of a victorious slave race, the Carthesians seek to make the Fields a secure and prosperous place, one in which appropriate tribute is paid to their guiding hand.\nThe Moren Confederation is a new domain, freshly established after overthrowing a generation of Carthesian domination.  The Confederation holds together a dozen worlds with the promise of mutual survival against Empire retribution, though the majority of its power lies in the worlds of Balmoral and Moren.  The Confederation has been able to survive an unprecedented amount of engagements against the Carthesian fleet by implementing many unconventional tactics.           The torpedoes and bastionite prows of their capital ships allow a Confederation fleet to push into an opposing armada before firing both broadsides to devastating effect, while their arc cannons help to mitigate the gunnery advantage of Carthesian ships with lightning bolts that can't miss their target.  Even so, the Confederation has not yet been tested by the might of an Empire heartland fleet.\nWe look forward to sharing more about the rich story of Clockwork Armada in future updates.  Hopefully we can begin to scratch the surface of this rich setting.\nProject Goals\nWork is now underway to enhance the existing 3D ship models seen in the video and renders on this page.  Our pre-production run of miniatures showed us that some additional practicality would need to be married to the aesthetics of the ships.  Most of the details on the miniatures will be deepened for greater visibility and to hold paint more readily, and engine exhausts and masts will be thickened to prevent bending.  This will make the production models more vibrant and sturdy.  \nWe will be producing Kickstarter updates very frequently for our backers, both during the project and after  funding.  We love talking to you!\nOnce funding is completed, the new master models will be 3D printed and sent to the casting house we are working with for full production.    At the same time, the ship bases and Course Ruler segments will begin production in plastic, and the card art will be finalized and sent to printing.  \nRemaining funds after fulfillment is completed will go directly toward expanding the miniatures line.  Character Flagships will play a big part in the fiction and future games of Clockwork Armada.  The 70mm ship bases have an additional stem hole in anticipation to support future larger ship classes.\nWe will also use the funds to begin bringing miniatures from two other fleets to life: the viking longboat themed Banfirar, and the Allied Kingdoms of Zant, which are based aesthetically on the ironclads of the American Civil War.  We have plans as well for a high quality full color game book with rules, art, and fiction.  The rules and resources for Clockwork Armada will still always be available online for free.\nTemplecon 2014\nFinally, we will constantly be updating and improving our website and the fiction within it.  We are very excited about the setting of Clockwork Armada as well as the game, and want to tell its story. \nWho We Are\nHi, I'm Wes Herndon.  I created Clockwork Armada and this me with my family.  This was taken last year, when there was far less hair on my head.\n And this fine fellow below is Porter Nielsen.  Porter is responsible for all of the 3D art deciphered from concept sketches, incubating in his computer before becoming pretty resin and pewter models. \nTomasz Belzowski took some rough ideas and, through his concept art, gave shape to the creative vision of Clockwork Armada.  \nChase Gray is responsible for creating the signature logo for Game Fleet, as well as the art and layout of the ship stat cards.  \nMallory Berry created the customized retro lettering of the Clockwork Armada banner.\nYuichiro Ohara, Matt Pitt and Tom McGrath each contributed singular and imagination-inflaming promotional art for the game setting.\nPhillip Hullquist compiles and edits the videos, and has all the fancy recording equipment.\nRead more about us and the other people involved with Game Fleet in the Bio section, over on the top right of the page!  \nThank you very much for taking the time to read about our project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working hard for the past few years to hone our game mechanics and develop the infrastructure required to manufacture our miniatures. First we learned how to cast our own miniatures, and with that knowledge we are confident that we have found the best people to work with for quality and affordability.\n\nEverything Game Fleet produces is made here in the United States, which will allow for more accurate and reliable fulfillment dates.\n\nWe have done much to mitigate the risks of this project. We are producing high detail hand cast miniatures that come with many different parts, so naturally that isn't a cheap service. The funding goal set for this project was partially determined by the projected amount of pledges required to gain a volume discount, as well as a margin for error. \n\nA very large investment of time and money has gone into producing the prototype miniatures, from concept art to physical models. This showed us exactly what to do for the production run. We will be using much of the pledge funds to reinvest into master models to make the details on the ships sharper, and strengthen fragile areas. Significant funds were also invested into promoting the project at Templecon last year.\n\nA definite challenge will be effectively promoting the Kickstarter project. Because the two main creators of this project work full time to support families, every scrap of spare time and money has gone into creating the game and miniatures themselves, with little left over for social media or advertising. Something that would mean so much to us would be 'liking', 'following', or otherwise just helping us spread the word about this project.\n\nWe plan to complete all fulfillment before the projected completion month set on the pledges, as we are phobic about being a project that underestimates its fulfillment time. Even though we have given ourselves some buffer weeks beyond our projected fulfillment date, we promise that backers will be informed of any potential delays as soon as we learn of them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Game Fleet Productions\nFirst created \u00b7 20 backed\nGame Fleet Productions was founded three years ago with the goal of blending an original setting with innovative game mechanics and stunning...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Moving Forward", "update_content": "Hey everyone.

Once there, she runs into the Normal Boots Club - a group of handsome, competitive gamers, and the most popular guys in school. And they need her to compete in this year's gaming tournament!\nAsagao Academy: Normal Boots Club is a free fan-made otome game (romance-oriented visual novel from a female perspective) based on the guys of Normal Boots. It is light-hearted and tongue-in-cheek, affectionately parodying visual novel, anime, and video game tropes, while also incorporating a serious story about a girl's journey through romance and friendship.\nThis game has been in development since February 2014. The goal of this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to make it feasible to release Asagao Academy for free once it's completed.\nHana, the protagonist of Asagao Academy, transfers to the private boarding school after a series of negative experiences at her old school. Upon reaching Asagao Academy, she discovers the Normal Boots Club - a group of attractive, talented competitive gamers - and takes it upon herself to try to join, though her motives may be less than pure. Shy, awkward, quiet, and a wee bit insecure, she has a truly big heart and genuinely cares about the people close to her.\nMai is Hana's loud, boisterous, and spunky roommate. Although she comes from a rich family, she isn't snobby or conceited. She's obsessed with the Normal Boots Club, Jared in particular, and is known to be a bit blunt. Her excessive energy makes her an ace on the school's volleyball team.\nJon is one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club. He adores bizarre retro games, and after a traumatic incident involving a thousand piece puzzle, began to play them professionally. He loves his pet bird, Jacques, more than life itself. Jon is charismatic, energetic, and animated, and as such is the head of the Drama Club and in charge of casting for this year's play. Everything seems to be going well for him - that is, until he loses something dear...\nPBG, one of the founding members of the Normal Boots Club, is an easy-going, caring, and optimistic guy. He doesn't spend much time on his schoolwork, instead choosing to focus on things that are important to him, like Asagao's soccer team and pinball games. Despite his friendliness, he keeps giving Hana strange looks, and then starts skipping class... just what's going on with him?\nJared is a part-time model, and the first person Hana meets at Asagao Academy. His overall perfection and inherent sense of rhythm make him a formidable opponent in dance battles. Naturally, he is the most attractive person in the school and knows it, often coming off as vain, fickle, and shallow. Despite this, Jared truly cares for his friends, and the confidence he projects may not be as solid as it appears.\nSatch is an assistant librarian at the school library. He's currently working on a virtual reality machine, and as such specializes in game design and invention. Satch is intellectual, empathetic, mature and well-read. He's disconcertingly good at reading people, and always thinks of others' feelings before his own. This leads him to keep his problems to himself - a habit that might backfire when Normal Boots is targeted... \nShane is a foreign exchange student from England. Quiet, straightforward, and blunt, he draws a weekly comic strip, but has lately been having difficulty with it. He's a natural with trivia competitions, but instead chooses to challenge himself with Nario Cart. Despite how much the club needs Hana's skills, he has been steadfastly against her joining.\nJirard is an avid collector of Itty Bitty Kitty figurines. Passionate, ambitious, and a bit of a perfectionist, he is the resident speed-runner, though his weak spot is any Pokemon game after the first generation. Perhaps as a result of his need to complete, he does well both academically and socially, being one of the most caring, open, and thorough people on campus.\nPaul, Nick, and Josh, while members of the Normal Boots Club, are blood bound under Continue?'s banner. They are almost inseparable, typically found competing among themselves and wreaking general havoc by reenacting the '80s and '90s arcade beat-em-ups they love so dearly. Paul decides to run for student council president, but when a strong rival appears, will the pressure of competition be too much?\n7 possible routes with 35+ hours of content\n14 possible endings\n25 fully illustrated CGs\nCameos from other YouTubers\nNon-arbitrary choices that affect more than just the ending \nHidden scenes and subplots \nOriginal soundtrack \nBeautiful HD artwork \nCharacters with personality, including the MC \nA story that is both humorous and sincere\n A visual novel is a text-based interactive story, something like \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" books. You will assume the role of Hana in the story and interact with the Normal Boots guys, affecting which direction the story will go in.\n Choices are how you control the flow of the story - different choices can lead to different scenes, and changes in how someone feels about you. Asagao Academy has two endings for every guy and multiple scenes in each route that are only available through navigating different choices. This means it will take multiple playthroughs if you want to see everything there is to discover (but don't worry - you can skip all the dialogue you've already seen).\n The art for Asagao Academy will be made by two people - our background artist, Badriel, and our CG/sprite artist, Unico. The high-definition artwork is original and beautifully detailed. \nBackground by Badriel\nCG - Jared shows off his modeling photos.\nCG - Hana and Mai bond via blanket fort.\nSome of Hana's expressions!\nThe soundtrack to Asagao Academy will be made of entirely original music contributed by musicians who are also fans of Normal Boots. Some samplings from the OST are featured below:\nAsagao Academy Theme - Saiyapimp (Soundcloud; YouTube) (Feat. Kori - Website; Soundcloud); Mixed by Tom Jackson:\nAsagao Academy Theme (Instrumental) by Saiyapimp (Soundcloud; YouTube):\nBittersweet by Saiyapimp (Soundcloud; YouTube):\nLazy Days by Connor Clang:\nOrdinary Shoes by Connor Clang:\nAsagao Academy: Normal Boots Club is a game that we want to release for free. We've invested hundreds of hours since February 2014 to create a full-length, high quality visual novel that satisfies fans of the genre and fans of Normal Boots in equal measure. However, because we're releasing this game for free, we've had to invest our own money and time in a product we will not be compensated for. In order to make this game according to our standards and keep it free, we need to have the money to pay the artists who are working on the game, and to hire people who have the skills we do not.\nAccordingly, we have a $12,000 base goal, which pays for the following:\nProjected keychain designs\nWe want to make this game the best it can be. The base-game is the bare minimum we decided to meet in order to create a full-fledged, satisfying, free otome-game - but there is a lot more we wished we could have put into it. In order to make the game the best it can be, we instituted a system of stretch goals for the game. All money over the initial budget that is contributed to the project will be invested back into the game.\nPlease be aware that if we reach our stretch goals, it may delay the original planned release estimate of September 2015.\n Additionally, you can now support us via PayPal through the link on Asagao's website and vote to add us to Steam through Greenlight!\nAlthough the project is being contributed to by many different people, the core group of people working on Asagao Academy: Normal Boots Club is collectively known as Illus Seed. The individual members are as follows:\nAlthough we have received permission from the Normal Boots crew to create this game, we are not officially affiliated with Normal Boots.\nAll background art featured in the trailer (besides the school building by our background artist, Badriel) are temporary assets and were made by Mugen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMissing Deadlines - The biggest risk for this project is that we would miss our projected deadline of September 2015. Although we overestimated how long it will take to finish the project, in the event that stretch goals get fulfilled or we have unforeseen setbacks, we might not make deadline on time. Two of the three core members currently working on the project are still in college, and one will be graduating in the next year. Many members are still working part-time on top of this. Accordingly, there may be unforeseen setbacks; however, we included that in estimating the project goal. If the game is fully funded, we are also prepared to hire extra people to help us get the game finished on time.\n\nUnforeseen Circumstance - It's possible that something horrendous could happen, like the internet being destroyed, or a giant dinosaur could step on one of our houses and render us incapacitated for months on end. In that case, it would take some extra time to recover or find a replacement.\n\nEverything melts - I do not have to elaborate.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "It's Released!!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "April 21st!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Asagao Release Delayed", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Shop Open!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Store goes up Feb. 7 at 1:00PM PST!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Public Progress Update #3!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Asagao Update: Physical Rewards", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Public Progress Update #2!", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 78, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cheratomo/asagao-academy-normal-boots-club", "project_name": "Asagao Academy: Normal Boots Club"}}, {"backer": "Fyl Frazee of Rogue Bard Media LLC", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Tanto Cuore is a deck building card game for 2-4 players.

At your turn, you can take a total of 4 actions.\nIf there are no zombies in your area, you can move: It takes one action to move to the next tile, or to go in or out of a building.\nWhen you are in a building with no zombies, you can take one action to Search for new weapons or equipment. A quick search lets you draw the 3 top cards of the Search, but that puts you at risk of accidentally stumbling on zombies. Alternatively, you can do a careful search, by looking one by one at the cards in the discard pile until you choose one to keep.\nRevealing and taking a scenario token from the board also takes one of your four actions.\nYou can fight zombies in your area by decreasing the ammo (or durability for non-firearms) of a weapon, and removing as many zombie figures from the board as the damage value of the weapon. If you're using a noisy weapon, one of those zombies joins the Horde. You can fight multiple times if you like, but each attempt costs one of your four actions.\nWhether or not there are any zombies sharing your space, you can spend one action to use an item.\nAfter spending your four actions, you must be able do fend off zombies around you with one of your weapons; if the Fend Off value of your weapon is lower than the number of zombies in your area, you lose a Life Point.  \nEvery 60 seconds, a zombie growl can be heard in the soundtrack. Whenever you hear a growl, draw the top card on the Zombie pile to find out how many zombies you must add to the board on the street section of the active player's tile. If you draw a Horde card, add all of the (very hungry!) zombies from the Horde box to that tile!\nEach scenario features different objectives: running through the city, pursuing a target, holding a fortified place, searching for useful resources\u2026 If you complete the objectives before the soundtrack is over, all of the players win the game. If you fail, or if at any time all of the heroes are unconscious, you all lose the game!\nWhile other zombie games generally let you think calmly, discuss the problem, and plan through every situation, Zombie 15' simulates the stressful and frantic experience of being chased by zombies. The players have to act fast and think even faster. Cooperation and tactics are decisive, but so is keeping a cool head.\nIn addition, Zombie 15' features an immersive universe, with an original and compelling storyline and awesome heroes.\nSee for yourself with this actual play video: the game starts slowly, but the tension and pace are really rising as the minutes go by. You can activate the Close Captioning by clicking on the CC icon on the lower right corner of the video window.\nIELLO is a seasoned worldwide games publisher. Our game catalog includes Richard Garfield's award-winning King of Tokyo, Carl Chudyk's Innovation and Bruno Faidutti's The Dwarf King. As a successful publisher, we are willing and able to pay for production costs for our games, even for games with lots of extremely high quality components like Zombie 15'. However, designing Zombie 15' was unusually expensive, even before we began production. The game features dozens of pieces of awesome artwork for heroes, zombies, weapons and equipment, and the configurable board tiles. We also hired a professional composer for the soundtrack (since it is such an important part of the game), and had several miniature molds created. Those development costs have a direct impact on the retail price, making the game much more expensive for our customers.\n\nBy selling games directly via Kickstarter, we will be able to more quickly recoup some of the development costs. This way, we can charge less for the game, since the development costs won't have to be included in the retail price. And since we anticipate that this campaign is going to be very successful, it means we can put even more goodies in the box: new heroes, new zombie minis, new scenarios, new tiles, etc.\n\nWe really want Zombie 15' (and everyone who plays it!) to benefit from this Kickstarter campaign. If this campaign is as successful as we expect, the game will be better (and less expensive) for everyone, both backers and retail customers alike! It is not our intention to create Kickstarter exclusives, as we think the game is original and awesome enough to be an incentive all by itself. We sincerely hope you'll think the same!\n\n\nHere's the deal we are offering you:\nYou get the game for less than its retail price ($70 instead of $79) and by doing so you make it even better for everybody!\nYou will get the game before anybody else, so you can claim bragging rights!\nIn exchange we get to sell a great game with lots of extra content, for less than what we would have had to sell it for without your help ($79 instead of $99).\nEverybody wins!\n  As this campaign has already been so successful, we'll be adding a few \u201csweeteners\u201d to be sent with the games to our backers, as small tokens of gratitude.\n \n1. 8 Hero miniatures\n2. 8 Hero sheets\n3. 100 zombie miniatures \u2014 33 cops, 33 secretaries, 33 thugs and 1 Alpha Zombie\n4. 32 double-sided Terrain tiles\n5. 33 Scenario cards\n6. 56 Search cards\n7. 18 Special Item cards\n8. 48 Zombie cards\n9. 25 Ammo/Durability tokens\n10. 15 Life Point tokens\n11. 40 Search tokens\n12.

We make fun, original games, with a focused emphasis on great artwork, high quality production, extensive replayability, and excellent value. Our catalog include worldwide award-winning hits such as King of Tokyo, Innovation and The Dwarf King. www.iellogames.com\nTHE DESIGNERS\nGuillaume L\u00e9mery & Nicolas Schlewitz are two French gamers (and now designers) living in the Lyon area. They came up with the idea of Zombie 15' while playing a zombie video game. The development of Zombie 15' has certainly benefited from the hundreds of boardgames in their (impressive) personal collections. They posted a short video to tell you how they came up with the idea for this game!\nTHE ARTISTS\nHeroes, zombies and cover \u2014 Biboun is a French artist living in Montpellier. He works mainly on character designs for video games, board games, anime and comics. www.biboun.com\nItems \u2014 Alexey Yakovlev is a young Russian artist living in Yekaterinburg.

These updates are also how we will show you more details on the new components unlocked with the Stretch Goals.\n\nOur US team will read all your comments and will answer as often and as soon as we can. We will also regularly compile all the new questions asked in the comments or questions section and answer them in the updates, for quick reference by everyone. We will also include those questions in the FAQ so that they are easy to find.\n\n\nThis Kickstarter campaign is only for the English version of the game. The purpose of this campaign is to pay for development costs (art, molds, soundtrack\u2026) that are not language-dependent, which means that any version in other languages will include any extra content unlocked here. The French version will be produced and released at the same time as the English version, and we're already discussing other languages with our international partners.\nSince we fully expect this Kickstarter project to be successful (and are determined to publish the game no matter what), we already asked our manufacturer to produce some of the components. The remainder will start as soon as the goal is reached (without even waiting for the project to end). We\u2019ll be putting all additional bonus content into production as soon as that content is unlocked.\nFor those reasons, the game should be fully produced very soon after the project ends! Depending on shipping time to their location, we expect backers to start receiving their games in May 2014, a couple of weeks before the games hit friendly local game stores worldwide.\nJOIN US ON FACEBOOK!\nSAI FON AVATAR (click for larger image)\nSNOW AVATAR (click for larger image)\nTREVOR AVATAR (click for larger image)\nVANCE AVATAR (click for larger image)\nHAZEL AVATAR (click for larger image)\nJOSH AVATAR (click for larger image)\nWILL AVATAR (click for larger image)\nSEVERITY AVATAR (click for larger image)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince this project is not meant to fund the production of the game (but instead to make the game better and less expensive by helping to cover the development costs), the risks here are very limited.\n\nIELLO is an experienced publisher, and we absolutely know what we are doing when it comes to creating boardgames. Our games are recognized and renowned for their excellent value, and feedback for our customer service has always been extremely positive.\n\nAs for possible delays, production has already started, so we are confident that our backers will get their games in the Spring of this year. The production of additional components could hold back shipping a bit, but no more than a couple of weeks.\n\nOur previous project, Guardians' Chronicles experienced some delays due to unexpected production challenges. We also made some last minute changes (adding in a stretch goal that wasn't met, and upgrading to engraved dice) that we decided to include after listening to our backers.

And on top of that it was a rather interesting read... I was so impressed that I promised myself if they put anything else out I\u2019d buy it (or back it!) and so when they contacted me the other day saying that they had a new Kickstarter running I had no hesitation backing it.. The only bad thing is that they waited so long before telling me that the new Kickstarter was running! Good Luck!\"\nPlease Read the Updates Pertaining to the Rewards. Any Reward listed that points to a numbered perk will now appear to be pointing to the wrong one, due to adding in a bunch of perks along the way. It is explained in the updates. Thank you for your understanding.\nAbout the Game:  \u201cThug life aint always what it's cracked up to be; especially when you got a big-ass dragon living in your hood.\u201d DnDizzle is a role-playing game set in the hood of Comptonia, a kingdom ruled by the benevolent King Pimperton. In DnDizzle you take on the role of a heroic OG battling against the menacing black dragon that has taken over the city dump, and is summoning monsters to destroy the OGs and their hood. \nThe game is written from two intertwining perspectives, indicated by obvious fonts. The first is from the perspective of Fat Warrior, an ancient and knowledgeable denizen of Comptonia. The second is from the perspective of a nerdy game designer to provide clear game information.\nThis game is for mature players, due to language, drug use and violence. If you don't mind some fantasy adult content and would like a good laugh, come join the fight and become a legend of the hood. \nHere's a snippet from Fat Warrior about the current state of the world: \u201cNow Comptonia is all f***ed up and it's your job to fix it. So go get experience, jack monsters, bling out your armor and sword, until you are straight pimpin', all day every day. Gather your homies, 'cause you are gonna need some trusted motherf***ers to watch yo back, like a gangsta convention or some sh*t and fight for you home; it's the only one you got. Now it's time for you to go forth! Cry, \u201cthug life!\u201d and let slip the gats of war; just don't be caught trippin'.\u201d \nWhy Combine Hip-Hop & Adventure Role-playing?\n\"DnDizzle is my way of paying homage to my youth in a humorous, romanticized light. In DnDizzle, anyone can be a hero. When people think of the of the 80s and 90s rap world they often associate it with some of the negative things in the culture and forget about the positives. Hip-hop raised awareness of issues on race and class discrimination, advanced artistic expression in low-income areas, and built a sense of community. When I got older I moved out of the projects and began getting into role-playing games, which lead me to my career as a game designer and writer. DnDizzle was born from my love of hip-hop and gaming, proving you can take the geek out of the hood but you can't take the hood out of the geek.\" -Ron Leota \nGame Mechanics: DnDizzle operates on 2d6 dice system. When attempting to resolve an action (other than damage) the player rolls 2D6 and adds their stat and skill. If untrained they add their stat bonus -1. When resolving damage roll 1-2 D6 and apply modifiers, depending on the weapon used. Characters have hit points, which are diminished by damage rolls. To hit an opponent an attacker must meet or beat the target's defense rating. If the attack is successful damage is applied. Once the damage is tallied it is reduced by the character's armor rating (if any). \nThe game comes with 6 ready to play character classes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Trigger men are archers, capable of deadly ranged combat. Docs are OGs who specialize in healing and incapacitating magic. Freestylers are keepers of lore and voices of truth. Thugs are OGs who specialize in melee combat. Jackers are master thieves who specialize in stealth and the larcenous arts. Street Magicians are masters of elemental and protective magics. You can create your own OG or use one of the per-generated characters (one for each class). So which class of OG will you choose? \nProduct Specifications: DnDizzle is the first in a line of fully playable \u201cmini-RPGs\u201d. The game comes in a sleek, 4\"x6\" pocket sized format for the gamer on the go. It's a self contained system that require only the core book, dice, pencil, and some paper to play. The book will be about 150 pages of comedic role-playing fun. The project is designed at this size to fit a forthcoming line of geek vending machines.\nSample Enemy Sheet\nBlank Character Sheet\nSome of the Rewards:\nBeyond the Book in physical and digital forms. We have cool dice, some cool contributor options, like getting to help design the cover, getting a picture of yourself \"Dizzified\" by one of our artists and put in the book, or getting a character written in to it.

Players will take on the role of a hero representing one of these three factions, with the player's deck representing spells, tricks, techniques, and troops, and take their deck into battle against other players or a computer opponent.\nWe plan to launch the game with a tutorial that introduces the game and the world of War of Omens, a skirmish mode with three levels of AI difficulty, and a multiplayer client that allows players to battle each other 1v1.  War of Omens will feature a card store that allows players to purchase packs of cards, plus a deck builder that allows for easy customization and saving of decks.\nAfter launch we have lots of ideas for how to add to and support the game, not just with content but also with features, and a lot of those ideas depend on Kickstarter support.  Our stretch goals are packed with awesome stuff that will really change the game we ship, and we really hope to uncover them all.  We'll be revealing more details about the future of War of Omens as the Kickstarter campaign evolves, but one thing is for sure:  You guys get to decide how big this game gets.\nWar of Omens is a hybrid between a deck-builder and a CCG.  Deck-builders are games like Dominion, Quarriors, or Thunderstone, where the object of the game is to construct the most effective deck of cards on the fly.  Players typically compete over a public pool of cards, vying for the best ones and cycling them into their hands while trying to achieve some kind of victory condition. \nKeep in mind that screenshots, videos, and whatever else you see are from our internal alpha, and as such, do not necessarily represent how the game is going to look, act, or feel upon release. \nCaptain Listrata goes up against Esra\nA CCG/TCG is a Collectible/Trading Card Game like Magic: The Gathering, Pok\u00e9mon, or Yu-Gi-Oh, where players collect, build, and battle decks of cards assembled from a very large pool.  Players usually go into these games with separate, pre-constructed decks that they've collected over long periods of time, rather than building them on the fly.\nMogesh sends two horrifying War Rats against Theodox.\nWar of Omens combines elements from these two games.  Players will be able to collect cards and customize their decks, just like in CCGs, but as they sit down to play individual games of War of Omens they'll be buying their cards from the bank each turn, as if they're playing a deck-builder.  Opponents in War of Omens will have their own, separate deck; there are no public cards.  We call this type of game a Collectible Deck-Builder.\nCardinal Pocchi sends his followers against Liet\nEach player starts with ten coins that can be used to purchase cards from their bank.  The bank is populated with cards that you choose in the deck builder between games.  As the player purchases cards from their bank, they're immediately put into play.  Once spent or destroyed, cards go into the inventory, to be shuffled and dealt back into the hand.  Each turn a new hand is drawn from the inventory, and as the game progresses, the inventory grows with cards purchased from the bank (or by other means, like stealing).\nListrata weighs her options in a battle against Theodox.\nBecause there are four resources in War of Omens and because the factions play so differently, cards cover an incredible variety of behavior: direct damage, blocking attacks, drawing cards, resource generation, sacrificing units, stealing cards, destroying resources, and more.\nLiet amasses a Daramek herd against Listrata.\nWe believe that the what we've created in War of Omens is a new type of card game that has great strategic depth, potential for long-term collectibility and customization, and really fast, visceral gameplay.  Average games tend to be 5-10 minutes, with truly epic battles lasting longer.  It's not uncommon for a crowd to form behind a desk if a game of War of Omens gets crazy.  We've spent hundreds of hours (and millions of AI simulations) balancing War of Omens to require strategy, skill, and a just a little bit of luck for victory.\nSofocatro and the War of Omens Vespitole menu screen.\nEveryone here at our studio has been playing WoO for months, and it's transcended \"just another game we're working on.\"  We play it at home.  We play it at lunch.  We have a WoO ladder.  It's really, really fun.  Some of us have barely started building our collections, while others have amassed almost every card in the game.  We come up with new strategies and card combos all the time, and the competition around the office is varied and fierce. \nWar of Omens is in full 3D and plays in your browser.   We started with a 2D prototype for playtesting and balancing, but over the last few months we've transitioned to a beautiful 3D environment with rendered cards, lighting, texture mapping, and shadows.  The game plays at a smooth 60fps, even while cards are zooming through the air or sliding onto the table, with animated UI elements and particle effects.  We're constantly improving and polishing the client to make it look and feel better.  Here's a short video of the 3D client at work (remember, this is alpha footage).\nCards upgrade over time in War of Omens.  War of Omens booster packs let players choose from one of three cards, rather than giving them a larger pack of random cards they might not want.  Players can choose a new card to add to their collection, broadening their options and increasing their strategic flexibility, or they can choose to upgrade an existing card instead, making it more powerful.\nAn opened booster in War of Omens.\nWhen cards are upgraded, a new copy of the card is created with its gold cost reduced by 1.  Now you have two copies of this card to use, and one of them is cheaper, which creates entirely new gambits, combos, and deck possibilities.  Cards can be upgraded multiple times, and each time, the new copy is even cheaper and thus even more powerful.  In this way we remove the cumbersome element of unwanted common cards that plague so many card games, give players choice when they really want it, and allow players to see the rewards of their play over time, even when getting cards they already own. \nWar of Omens is free to play.  Each player starts with a basic set of cards for each faction unlocked from the start.  Each victory, whether in skirmish or multiplayer, nets you gold which you can use to buy boosters in the store.  It only takes a few victories to be able to afford a booster, so adding and upgrading your collection is frequent.  We plan to sell additional gold, as well as premium currency which can be used to buy the rarest boosters, for real world dollars.\nA trio of faction coins from War of Omens.\nWe feel very strongly that microtransactions and the \"free to play\" model are abused, and we don't want to do that.  Too many games put too much emphasis on monetization, and in doing so, good games are sometimes ruined.  We don't think microtransactions are inherently evil; just misunderstood, abused, and exhausting to players.  We have a lot of experience with free to play and microtransactions, both with our own products and with others, and we want to do it right.  You will not have to spend any money, ever, to fully enjoy War of Omens.  \nWar of Omens features three factions: the Daramek, the Vespitole, and Metris.  Each one of these factions is completely distinct: they look different, have different in-game mechanics, and have completely different, original storylines.  Because players can only choose one faction per battle, and because the factions play and feel so different from one another, favorite strategies and emergent gameplay are commonplace in War of Omens.\nEach faction also has three distinct heroes.  These heroes differ not only in appearance, but in their special abilities that are utilized throughout gameplay.  Even within a single faction, play styles and strategies vary wildly because of the differences between the three heroes.  Some favor offense, while others favor defense.  Each is designed to complement and enhance an aspect of their faction's overall style and mechanics.\nCourtesan, by Colin Adams\n\"When God created man, he chose the Vespitole to rule.  In politics, in war, and in commerce, the Vespitole command the respect of all.  In three generations, House Vespitole has risen from a small merchant clan to an Empire in our own right.  Our influence spans the length of Ausonia and beyond, from the Pelagic Isles to the far desert shores of Dalmiria.  Even now my uncle the Cardinal rises in favor, and soon the Church itself will serve us.  We have countless enemies outside our walls, and no small number within, but we are well-practiced in the arts of intrigue.\" - Listrata's Journal\n\"The wind brings us ill tidings from across the sea.  There are dark days ahead.  Some say the face of the world will soon be changed, and I aim to ensure it changes in House Vespitole\u2019s favor.\" - Cardinal Pocchi.\nA collection of cards showing the wealth and martial power of the Vespitole.\nThe Vespitole are a powerful house of merchants, warriors, tradesmen, aristocrats, and clergy that seek to control all of Ausonia.  The family Vespitole has a history rife with power mongering, brutal violence, and deep-seeded corruption.  Now they seek to broaden their power beyond their borders, extending their reach wherever they can to control the rest of the world by way of military might, political intrigue, and even religious zeal.  \nIn game, the Vespitole represent a balanced mix of all of War of Omens' mechanics.  Troops range from relatively weak militia all the way up to mounted knights and can attack the enemy directly, while cards like embargo or bureaucrat can cripple their resources.  Supplicants or Bishops can generate magic, used to fuel other cards, purchase, or even attack.  Powerful cards like Malediction, Holy Wrath, or Liturgy can turn the tide of battle in a single stroke if played at the right time.  And because each of the Vespitole's cards has a draw, the steady flow of Vespitole gold is never interrupted.\nRite of Combat, by Eric Royal\n\"Of the Shepherd\u2019s people, the Daramek are favored most of all.  When the Shepherd gave animals to our ancestors, he instructed them in their myriad uses -- as sources of food, providers of clothing and shelter, and conduits of power.  He taught us that by focusing the energy released at the instant of death, we could craft weapons to destroy our enemies, medicines to heal our wounds, and rituals to know the workings of the world.  While lesser tribes scrabble in dry soil or dig through the red mud, the Daramek perfect our craft, turning pitiful lives into powerful tools.\" - The Shepherd's Litany\n\n\"I was taught as a child that this valley was Paradise, and that we were its protectors.  I now know better.  There is a world beyond these mountains, and we, the Daramek, stand ready to claim it.\" - Esra\nA collection of cards showcasing the Daramek's primal, and often savage culture.\nFor thousands of years, the people of Sitrak have lived in complete isolation, believing their muddy red valley the only habitable place in the world.  Their lives are desperate, brutal struggles against starvation, violence and disease.  The only rulers of these lands are haphazard clans, and among them, the Daramek are supreme.  By complete mastery of beasts, the Daramek are able to provide food and shelter for their people, breed monsters to defend their herds, and unleash the hidden powers of blood, flesh and bone.  But the world outside Sitrak has grown restless.  Explorers sail the seas.  Trespassers probe the mountains.  The Daramek's isolation is nearing an end.\nIn game, the Daramek hit hard and rely on animal sacrifices to fuel their actions.  The Daramek may seem weak at first, marshaling multiple, low-impact minions like rats, pigs, and goats, but these minions can be sacrificed to fuel powerful cards that can easily wipe out even the most fortified of battle lines.  If not carefully countered and controlled, the Daramek can easily grow from an unthreatening rabble to an unstoppable avalanche of blood, bone, and sinew, dealing out massive amounts of punishment for every beast on the battlefield.  The Daramek may not be strong on defense, but they are unforgiving if given any quarter.\nInfighting, by Jeremy Vinar\n\"As the Creator\u2019s chosen people, it is Metris' duty to save humanity from itself.  Though our homeland lies in ruins and our people remain scattered, we hold fast to our goals; seek out knowledge, collect it for the Library, and above all, keep our secrets safe.  Our agents are everywhere, operating from cells within the most powerful nations.  With whispered word and shadowed blade we keep merchants, kings and thieves alike in check, ensuring that a balance of power is maintained.\" - The Manual of Silence\n\"Something has changed. The balance has been upset. An unease spreads through the people, and strange rumors reach my ears from faraway lands.  I must contact the Vanguard at once; I fear only the knowledge Metris possesses can protect us from the coming storm.\" - Valdorian\nA collection of cards showing the subterfuge and tradecraft of Metris.\nThe night keeps many secrets. Thieves plot mischief in shadowy dens, assassins sharpen their blades, and spies lurk invisibly in the firelit raucous of taverns. But the wisest rogues know that some secrets are too dangerous to know, and some words are too dangerous to say. Amongst the dark and shadowy criminals of the world stalks a more sinister order of villain. They are the killers of kings. The demolishers of empires. They are Metris.\nIn-game, Metris relies on control and manipulation to turn their enemies' decks against them.  Foes of Metris will often find their troops switching sides, their resources stolen, or their options severely limited.  Poisons and bombs can deal damage directly and over the course of several turns, leading to a slow, agonizing defeat.  Even if their enemies can manage to muster an attack, Agents of Metris have a variety of ways to avoid, conceal, and protect themselves.  While Metris can't put up the strong military front of the Vespitole or even the Daramek, no other faction can control and manipulate their enemies quite like Metris can. \nWar of Omens has been in development at Fifth Column for over a year.  We've been working on this game in our spare time; an hour here, a day there, on the busses and trains to and from work.  It's a labor of love for the studio, and over the last year it's grown from one of our engineer's hobbies to an officially supported project that's being developed at time and money cost to the studio.\nA screenshot of an earlier, 2D prototype for War of Omens.\nMore than anything, we want to get War of Omens out of development and live.  This has been our game that we love to play and create, but we want it to be out there in the world, where it can be everyone's game.  Our players will spend more time playing it than we ever spent making it.  We're preparing for that transition now.\nShowing off War of Omens during GDC.\nWe're putting up this Kickstarter for two big reasons: money and exposure.  Because we're a small, bootstrapped studio, we need money to fund full-scale War of Omens development.  And similarly, we want to get the word out about this game.  If we're successful, War of Omens will have tons of backers already passionate about it when we open it to the public, which will mean great multiplayer and a thriving community.  Kickstarter is a great way to get people talking about War of Omens, while (hopefully) generating the funds we need to finish it.\nMarket research... ?\nHere's a projected breakdown of how our budget for War of Omens is going to look. Because War of Omens is such an art-heavy game and because we take the originality and quality of the art so seriously, it's a huge chunk of our budget. Engineers are the other huge chunk, because we need people to, y'know, make all that art actually do something. The rest of the stuff is more boring, but important nonetheless.\nKickstarter is what's going to take this game to the next level of development, and we want all of our backers to feel like they're appreciated and valued.  Every backer tier above $1 features beta access to the game, a special \"beta tester\" forum badge, and a bundle of War of Omens art only available to backers, meaning that no matter how much money you throw into this project you'll be able to play and show off your status as an early backer.  \nWe felt that we needed to balance digital rewards; things that made playing War of Omens better or cooler; with commemorative, physical rewards that would show off our art, look good on a wall or a backpack, and really appeal to people.  Some of our rewards will permanently change the game, and there are tons of exclusive cards, booster packs, and custom card skins to grab.\nWe also have a la carte add-ons that you can add to any tier, regardless of amount.  Just manually increase your pledge by the appropriate amount, and we'll sort everyone's add-ons with the backer survey at the end of the Kickstarter.  There's no limit to this stuff, so feel free to go nuts.\nFifth Column Games thanks each and every person who backs this project; if we could, we would give you all high-fives. \nHelp us make War of Omens even better!  We have a big vision for this game, but big visions require more support.  Help us make this game even better and push us over the limit.\nWe also want to address two big stretch goals we get asked about a lot: mobile and guilds.\nWe would really love to see War of Omens on mobile devices.  If War of Omens is a success and we can continue working on this game, that's something we really want to do.  No one needs to tell us that it would be awesome on a tablet; we know it would be awesome on a tablet, and we want it there.  That kind of development is also time-consuming and expensive, so we really need to hit it big with the Kickstarter or with the game itself to allow us to develop that client.  We want it just as much as you guys.\nGuilds would also make War of Omens really cool. Being able to band together with your friends, buy cards for the group, increase your prestige and your clout, unlock cool perks, and challenge other guilds... these are all ideas we have, and we think they would be great.  These kinds of features require a lot of design and development to get right, though, so we're in the same boat as we are with mobile.  We want to, we just don't know if we can afford to.\nUltimately, you guys will help decide how big this game gets.  Want to see War of Omens on your iPad?  Want to start a guild with your friends?

That means a production schedule, a dedicated team, a release date, beta testing, the whole nine yards. We all love this game and we're eager to see it through, and that's what this Kickstarter is all about. Part of this process includes communicating and updating the community (that's you guys).\n\nMaking games is hard, and predicting the course of game development is about as reliable as predicting the weather. Setbacks can arise for any number of reasons; unexpected bugs, advances in technology, emergent changes, etc. There are also forces at work that have to be mitigated if any game is going to come out on time; scope and feature creep, team burnout, moving finish lines, etc. \n\nThat being said, Fifth Column Games has been a successful, bootstrapped video game studio for over two years.

It spawned from a hobby I\u2019ve been doing since 2008- building table-top arcade cabinets, or MAMEs (Multiple Arcade Machine Emulators). Since I discovered emulators on the PC, I\u2019ve been looking for an \u2018authentic\u2019 experience when playing my favorite retro games. One day in 2008 I decided to build a small arcade (about 30\u201d tall and 20\u201d wide) to house a Pentium III PC, monitor, and mount some controls. Why? Because it would be awesome. With a budget of $110, this is what derived:\nHumble beginings...\n It was crude, but its popularity at college hinted I was onto something. Over the next four years, every cabinet I built was a little better than the last. I developed more confidence in my wood working skills, designing, planning, and even painting!\nMore pics at retrobuiltgames.com\nUnfortunately, these cabinets didn\u2019t have the follow through to match the attention they received. The finished cabinets are roughly 1/3 the size of tradition cabinets from the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s. They received great attention and admiration from the video game enthusiast community, but, there remained a caveat: \u201cI don\u2019t have the space for that right now\u201d or, \u201cIt\u2019s just out of my price range\u201d was the feedback I got most. Size and cost was still an issue preventing mass appeal.\nI would agree. Not surprising enough, size was just as much as issue for me, since a one-bedroom apartment is not ideal to build an inventory upon, nor is a small vehicle great for moving these when they don't fit inside it.\nShrinky-dink it.\nInspiration came from everywhere. Fun-sized candy bars, \u201csmart\u201d cars, and the general trend of consumer electronics was evidence that- smaller is better. I was convinced it can be done.\nThe Port-Pi begins its life.\nIn late 2011 I started experimenting with miniature-sized MAMEs. Keeping the original designed used for my larger cabinets, but scaled down 60%. Now, compared to traditional cabinets, this new concept measures at 1/8th the size; fun-size territory. I made my first model from cardboard, a 3\u201d LCD screen, and a Plug-n-Play TV Pac-man game console.\n I thought it didn\u2019t look too ridiculous, So I refined the design and built the second model from wood.\n It seemed feasible, but I had no clue how to produce this easily. I was still pretty rough with wood working. Also, I wasn\u2019t really pleased with the \u201chack-ability\u201d or quality of the TV Plug-n-Play devices. Building a miniature cabinet around them felt like a miss-matched union of my work and something I didn\u2019t feel was up to par. So, nothing happened after that.\n\nThen 10 months ago I found out about the Raspberry Pi. The Pi Community was quick to put emulators on it. I soon followed. The tiny arcade cabinet was brought back to life! This time with a real system! I quickly built a proof-of-concept cabinet from \u00bd\u201d plywood (left over from a previous MAME project).\nI took the Porta-Pi PoC to the Pittsburgh Mini-Maker Faire in August. It was a huge hit! The feedback and praise was incredible! I knew more could be done.\nSince August 2013 I\u2019ve been polishing the idea. I've been focusing on making this tiny arcade cabinet a \"kit\". Logistically, it makes perfect sense.\nThe obvious improvements are a tool-free laser cut cabinet and other small details like integrating the arcade controls directly to the Pi\u2019s GPIO headers. The early proof of concept used a Teensy 2.0+ to convert the controls to a generic USB HID keyboard. Removing this step saves costs, and reduces overall complexity of the kit tremendously. I've got the software written for the integrated GPIO controls, and I plan to include it on the SD cards in the full kits.\nThank you, everyone. I can't express how humbled I am to share this!\nLook at my awkwardness!\n..awkward feelings of gratitude..", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI saw this Kickstarter before, it failed. What has changed?\n\nGood Point! The previous Porta-Pi reached $21,815 of it's $36,000 goal. My community has given me the feedback for success. I've made some changes:\n\n -$13,000 goal! That's attainable!\n\n - I am no longer going to purchase a laser cutter. That means cost has been cut EVERYWHERE. I have access to an industrial 80W cutter at a makerspace. And I'm putting as much time into as I can get.\n\n - International Porta-Pi lovers now can get all the regular rewards US Porta-Pi lovers have! Thanks for the feedback guys!\n\n - Reduced Porta-Pi variations. Let's face it, standard definition is out, HD in is. So I can cut costs by not having to make the SD version. You'll find the HD version is cheaper now because of this...\n\n - I FOUND MY COMMUNITY! And here you are, back again. Thank you. I'm so happy to see you! Did I mention I made some good friends that have offered to help me. I've tripled my output and work force just for pizza!\n\nBuilding this kit is rather straight-forward. I\u2019ve done it dozens of times over the last year, trying different manufacture\u2019s parts, vendors, and cabinet designs. Procuring the material for the cabinet is as simple as running to the local hardware store and buying a 4x8 foot sheet of \u00bc\u201d birch plywood. A 4x8\u2019 sheet will yield four complete cabinets.\n\nThere is some prep work involved before laser cutting; the plywood must be ripped to size to fit the laser cutter\u2019s bed\u2026\nLaser cutting one complete cabinet takes approximately 12 minutes start to finish.\nSoft assembling the pieces takes under 3 minutes. (I verify every cut, on every cabinet).\nHere\u2019s the first hurdle. The laser cutter I use is the local hacker-space\u2019s . This limits me to two hours per day when using the machine. This restriction does not take into account if there\u2019s no open reservation for me to use it. So, conservatively, I can yield 8 cabinets per day or ~20 cabinets per week, (I do also work full time). This is a solid figure based on my schedule.\n\nProcuring the arcade buttons, joysticks, LCD screen, power adapters, SD cards, PCB amplifier, speakers, and misc wire/ screws takes about one week for standard shipping. All these parts come from four different vendors, who are very reliable, large volume suppliers. These sub components are also generic, off the shelf parts, making substitutions easy. Parts are interchangeable since sizes are standardized and electrical specifications are fairly common from what I have engineered. A few large volume purchases, with-in four weeks time will easily cover all the parts I need to complete the kits.\n\nPacking parts and making the appropriate wiring harnesses for these kits can be completed in under 90 minutes per kit, for one person. This limits my kit output to a maximum of 15 kits per week. This figure includes the time it takes to laser cut them concurrently. This is also a conservative number.\nI\u2019ve given myself Four months (Jan through April) to make as many kits as possible. This is roughly 300 completed cabinet kits (20 weeks * 15 cabinets/week = 300). This number could be 10% higher since I have planned vacation time (from work) at the end of the year. This 300 number is also for Complete Kits, which takes the longest to put together. Since the rewards range from a just a pre-cut cabinet to full kits, the former requires no assembly or complex packing resulting in less time to construct the kit. Knowing this, my production capacity can be expanded upon, but giving it a number has little merit since I can\u2019t predict what rewards will be requested. Using this conservative, most burdensome figure is the better estimate. Note that 180 kits is double the expected quantity I have calculated to meet my funding goal.\n\nShipping is the final hurdle. The kickstarter funds will help with bulk purchases for shipping and packing materials. I\u2019m a huge supporter of up-cycling and resourceful use of materials. Therefore, many of the packing materials from purchased supplies/ parts will be saved and re-used to pack your kits. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t be taking any risks when it comes to shipping your kits with care. This is why I have allotted funds for shipping materials.\n\nNow that community has shown me so much love, I've met some new friends who have offered their services to triple my work force. So there's a ton of cushion in case I run into problems with assembly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Business as Usual: New Arcades + Claw Machines", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Software Update (if you want to).", "update_content": "The folks at petrockblog have done an overhaul of RetroPie (what my Porta Pi Arcade runs on).

Find out more about the backgrounds behind major characters!\nAchievements: If we get to this tier, we\u2019ll be able to implement achievements, so a little box will show up, congratulating you for every monumental decision you screw up. Also includes shiny badges!\nHome Base: Create and upgrade a stronghold and defend it from the end of reality.

These characters provide additional information to the background of the Diviner world.\nMore Factions: Like the political and religious factions that already play a major role in the story, these professional factions can be joined, but have their own plot, separate from the core story.\nExpanded Locations: This includes new towns, fortresses, guildhalls, dungeons, and ruins to explore.

However, the more funding we get, the more aesthetic improvements we can also include in our game!\nShort Stories Collection\nWe've created a lot of cool characters for the Low Vis universe, but unfortunately can't include many of them into our actual game. Help us reach the $15,000 and $20,000 stretch goals to have their stories told through a comprehensive collection of short stories written and imagined by our very own Dev team.\nLanguage Translation\nThis will be determined by popularity with our backer base, and whether or not we can find translators to modify our work.\n?????\nWe have tons of new expansions and upgrades planned for future stretch goals. But will we reach them? Only time will tell...\nThe Diviner is a single-player text-based RPG, with a style similar to that of Wasteland and Oregon Trail. It incorporates the gameplay and nostalgia of old school games, but is paired with gorgeous illustrations and modern aesthetic design. Player customization and the possibility of individualized impact on a story are key to establishing a true role playing experience. By eliminating excessive grinding - and instead introducing choices that affect the way your entire game's narrative progresses - The Diviner is an experience tailored to how the player wants their story to unfold.\nIt will be available at launch on PC, Mac and Linux.\nPlot\nYour Empress leaves for the North to put down a rebellion -- but never returns. It's your job to bring her back. Leave the comfort and luxury of the Empire you've always known to embark on a journey to find her and discover the true threat tearing the world of Low Vis apart. Choose where your alliances truly lie as you explore a vast world and do your best to keep it from ending.\nWelcome to Low Vis\nEnter a pre-industrial apocalyptic world filled with gods, monarchs, and the damned. Politics is synonymous with religion, and it is the powerful who kill gods. In this world, the unknown is the known.\nEngage with different political and societal systems through a wide variety of NPCs, quests, and locations. Interact with a wide variety of different cultures and civilizations.\nThis is not a European analogue, but a broad world influenced by many cultures and peoples. Our team is a broad spectrum of ethnicities, genders, and sexualities, and we aim to make a game that does not ignore this diversity but celebrates it.\nUser Interface\nUser interface blends both text and artwork. Much of the game will be read, but we will include a variety of visual elements to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.  \n\n\nMain Event: Where game events will be displayed -- this can either be for exploration, enemy combat, NPC interaction, or quest progression. Most of what happens in the game will be explained through text in this section.\nPlayer Choices: These are the choices that you can make in response to the main event situation. Depending on what the main event was, this could be for movement/exploration, dialogue choices, attack/defend/flee combat options, etc. Clicking on a choice will take you to the next event. \nMain Illustration: This is an illustrated drawing that visually supports the main event taking place. The main illustration also varies, ranging from location illustrations to NPC/enemy art. \nSecondary Illustration: A second drawing, incorporated for both decorative and/or mechanical reasons. For example, during exploration the secondary illustration will display a mini-map of your surroundings; during questlines, this image could be of an item you have to retrieve.\nPlayer Interface: These \u201cbookmarks\u201d on the side, when clicked on, will display your current game status. Although this is a pre-alpha version of the layout, we currently plan on having (in descending order) a pause, quests, character profile, skills, and map screens.\nInfluences\nThe Diviner draws gameplay and aesthetic inspiration from a variety of different sources. Wasteland and other 1990s-era RPGs became the main basis of execution and UI design for the game - with simple images depicting game events, that are paired with a more detailed text description. The ambient tone of The Diviner is similar to that of Limbo\u2019s or A Dark Room: bordering on creepy, not truly scary, but still threatening and esoteric. Fallout: New Vegas\u2019s factional choices also provided us a basis for incorporating more options for player choice.  \nThe visual look of the game is a unique mix of illustrative styles with modern design. The final in-game art will take on the appearance of Medieval/Northern Renaissance and 19th-20th century book illustrations, but character designs will be modern in dress: a homage to present-day high fashion, a la Dolce & Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Givenchy, and Balenciaga. However, all work still has a historical twist, primarily drawing from Byzantine culture and global 11th-17th century fashion. Architecture within the Diviner world is also reflective of this - buildings stand towering, interiors are spacious, and lighting is generous.\nWe've played a lot of games, and this is reflected in the mechanical design of the game. Exploration is straightforward, and takes from classic text-adventures and choose-your-own-adventure stories. You\u2019ll have a location or scenario described to you, and you make a decision about where to go. It is very similar to Oregon Trail, but on a larger scale. Our system for Dialogue and Conversation can find its roots in the systems of Bioware, but with more long-term impact and greater ability to define your character\u2019s personality. Finally, combat draws from a number of sources, including, but not limited to: Guild Wars 2, Diablo and Pokemon.  \nTo be clear, the ideas for the implementation of these mechanics originated from these games, but our final systems will be our own, developed and tuned by us for The Diviner. We will be writing another update shortly with more details about the internal mechanics.\nSurvive\nStylized, intelligent combat. As you explore the world of The Diviner, you will have to fight a variety of enemies, some human, some less so. To defeat them, you are able to customize your combat capability.\nThe Architect, the Cloak, and the Vanquisher\nYou begin by selecting a base class- Guard, Conspirator or Instructor, and then using the abilities you find interesting. These unlock similar abilities, allowing your character to become specialized in a style of combat that you enjoy.\nThe Guard can specialize as a Crusader, dual-wielding axes, a Juggernaut, a unstoppable shield-bearer and as a Vanquisher, using a massive two-handed weapon.\nThe Conspirator can sneak through the shadows to assault their enemies as a Cloak, launch attacks from a far with a bird and bow as a Stalker, and outmaneuver their opponents as a Sentinel.\nFinally, the Instructor can follow the path of the Inquisitor, attacking the mind of their enemies, the Architect, able to build defensive shields and the Weaver, commanding the veil of reality.\nYou are able to mix and match from within your class- so you can takes skills from both the Juggernaut and the Vanquisher, or any other combination.\nCommand\nNo two play-throughs are the same. With The Diviner, we focused on making an actual role-playing game, one where the player has an active position in developing the personality of your character in respect to the world around them.\nYour choices shift the political and religious balance of your surroundings constantly - not just at the end of the game. You will have to live with your decisions as you try to lead the world through the apocalypse. \nWithin the main quest alone, there are hundreds possible combinations for quest outcomes and factional alignments - with each combination affecting the people and world around you in different ways.\nSpeak\nWords carry weight. In a game that so heavily emphasizes plot, dialogue should play an important and essential role in progressing through game. Your charisma (or lack thereof) can get you as far in the world as combat would - if not further.\n\nWhen you talk with an NPC, they develop an opinion of you based on your dialogue choices. As time progresses, they \"speak\" to others and you begin to build a reputation, which affects how others may interact with you. Over time, your global reputation persists along with your character, thus having a long-term, dynamic impact on the world.\n\n\nCustomize\nYou are your own hero. Our base game will not include a traditional inventory system - instead, this will be replaced by a wardrobe function that collects any armor and weapon you find. These items can serve as both disguises and defense against any NPCs or enemies you may encounter.\nThe armor you acquire throughout the game will reflect the various cultures featured in Low Vis - not only are they protective, but also fashionable!\nExplore\nNavigate beautiful landscapes through dynamic illustrations. Climb the plateaus of the Eastern Empire, traverse through the mountains of the Grand North, window shop past the streets of the Western Kingdom, and venture into the darkness of the Forsaken South...\n\n  With vast scale of exploration, Low Vis is filled with unique cities, towns, dungeons, and other areas of interests to explore and plunder.\n\nRendezvous\nIt's dangerous to go alone. Gather a party of diverse NPCs to travel with you in your journey. These characters can provide valuable quest advice and serve as companions who make the journey more (or less) bearable.\n\nARCHITECTWe will reach out to you to set up the Skype call with anyone on the team - artists, world builders, game designers etc. We'd all enjoy talking about designing The Diviner and the inner thought processes of our work, but we're also able to talk about random nerd things.\nMOTHER\nThis tier does not include duplicate copies of merchandise.

The problem with coding is often the complexity and the bugs that arise due to that. The coding side of The Diviner is simple enough that this is not a worry. With art, artists and people in other creative fields often underestimate the amount of time they need, and this can lead to backups in the pipeline. However with several artists already on the team, and others we can pull in if necessary, this should not be an issue. Among the design team, we have the contacts to replace any team member necessary, or simply bolster our ranks.\n\nWhile we are a relatively new team of developers, we are confident that our passion, dedication, and professional approach to this project will lead it to success.

Twelve inches tall, immortal and full of mischief, your fairy will wield her great powers in the cause of tomfoolery and petty nonsense. Prank the gnomes, humble the ogres and make the humans have all the fun they can stand as you and your friends introduce delightful chaos wherever you go.\nCreate a unique fairy of your own with the game\u2019s expressive rules and unleash her on an unsuspecting world. Some of her abilities will come from the kind of fairy she is (Pixie, Brownie, Sprite, Goblin, Elf or Fairy), some will come from her extreme personality, and a lot will come from...\n...what she\u2019s wearing.\nFairies have reality-warping magic that they\u2019re not bright enough to understand. Sometimes the universe lets them have their way when they wish really hard. Most of the time they put on outlandish costumes to gain thematic powers... because as far as they know that\u2019s how it works. Every problem can be solved by dressing up. Better problems can be created by dressing up. There is no occasion that does not call for dressing up.\nPut on a cape and tights to gain the strength of a superhero. Change into a bee suit to summon a swarm! Take on the unfathomable power of disco in a snappy white polyester number.\nCostume Fairy Adventures includes a snazzily illustrated, full-colour deck of costume cards, each with unique powers to help your fairy get up to shenanigans. Every session you\u2019ll draw new costumes, and we\u2019ll be expanding the selection as the game grows, so you\u2019ll always have a novel look and fresh magic to fuel your madcap nonsense.\nGather up your friends and escalate an otherwise serious situation to the height of hilarious chaos - that\u2019s a fairy adventure. It doesn\u2019t matter whether the Fae Queen has charged you with a dread quest, if you\u2019re intruding on the academy ball, or if there\u2019s a spaceship launch that needs brightening up, you\u2019ll infect even the most dismal affair with your demented whimsy.\nKeeping those antics even resembling a coherent story might sound tough, but Costume Fairy Adventures makes the Game Master\u2019s life easy with mechanics and Playsets bursting with rich targets for the fairies\u2019 capers. Playsets are a little like traditional adventures, but tend to emphasise the setting the fairies are messing with rather than a planned series of events, and include specialised mechanics to reinforce their intended mode of play. This helps give the madness some structure, and provides the GM with material to improvise on in response to the players\u2019 unpredictable actions.\nMost Playsets are packed with Shenanigans - miniature quests that reflect the fairies\u2019 innate sense of whatever would be most awesome or hilarious in a given situation. Completing Shenanigans awards points that track the chaos of the story and fuel further pranks and mischief. They\u2019re like video game achievements, but with the freedom in improvising their accomplishment that you\u2019d expect from a roleplaying game (and of course snappy names that are equal parts pun and pop culture joke). Sometimes Shenanigans serve as the shared record of your group\u2019s triumphant tomfoolery, or sometimes you\u2019ll fight tooth and nail to be the fairy that completes them to prove herself the premier prankster. But they\u2019re always worth pointless bragging rights!\nCostume Fairy Adventures is where the mischievous and silly impulses that get you into trouble in more serious games are actively encouraged; after all, it\u2019s what your character would do. And when your character is a twelve inch tall indestructible ball of whimsy and reality-warping power in a fetching outfit, you have plenty of scope to inflict those impulses on a setting that richly deserves it.

(And if you're outside Canada, don't worry about the shipping - we've got it covered!)\n(Disclaimer: as above, backer-created Playsets will be subject to Acceptable Content guidelines.)\nWant to customise your reward? No problem! Just refer to this handy chart.\nAny of these items can be added to any reward package - just bump your pledge up by the listed amount, and you'll be good to go. When the funding period is over, a survey will be sent out where you can specify that Add-Ons you want.\nUPDATED: A new Add-On is now available thanks to backer requests: the Fairy Portrait Pack!\nThis set of twelve portraits (including the nine previewed above and three others) is designed to be used in conjunction with a standard Costume Fairy Adventures character sheet, and is available in two forms:\nFor $5 CAD, you'll receive a set of twelve super-high-resolution digital portraits for all your electronic-character-sheet needs.\nFor $10 CAD, you'll receive the digital files, plus a set of twelve large (2.5\" diameter) clear-backed stickers, the perfect size and shape to stick on your physical Costume Fairy Adventures character sheets.\nThere are also a couple of special options available:\nIf you've pledged for a reward package that includes the Costume Sticker Set, but would rather have the Fairy Portrait Pack instead, you can trade it in for an additional $3 CAD. This includes both the digital files and the physical stickers.\nFinally, if you're flush with cash, for $100 CAD you'll work with one of our artists to create a Fairy Portrait to your own specifications, for which you'll receive a high-resolution digital file and a dozen stickers - plus everything that's included in the $10 Add-On!\nAdd-Ons and Shipping\nHere's where it gets a little tricky. If your reward package already includes shipped items, or if you're having your rewards sent to a domestic address (i.e., within Canada), then you're set - the shipping is already included in the above prices.\nHowever, if your reward package does not already include shipped items, and you're having your rewards sent to a United States or overseas address, then you should also add shipping as follows:\n+$10 CAD United States/+$20 CAD International if your Add-Ons do not include any figurines; or\n+$15 CAD United States/+$30 CAD International if your Add-Ons do include one or more figurines.\nWe know that sounds complicated, so we've set up a pledge calculator to help you figure out what your total pledge, including all Add-Ons, should work out to:\nhttp://penguinking.com/cfa-kickstarter-price-calculator/\nGive it a try - and if you're still not sure, don't hesitate to send us a message and ask! Just tell us what you want to add to your reward package, and we'd be happy to figure out the total pledge for you.\nA Note On Figurines\nOwing to a variety of extremely boring factors, the exact number of figurines we can produce isn't very flexible. The upshot is that availability of a particular figurine is not guaranteed if you add it to your reward package as an Add-On. If you want to make absolutely certain that you get a particular figurine, please select a reward package that includes it.\nIf the delivery date rolls around and it turns out that your Add-On figurine has run out, you'll be given the option of either waiting for a second production run of that figurine, or of receiving a refund for that portion of your pledge.\nYou didn't think we were stopping there, did you? No chance! If we beat our basic funding goal, we've got something very special in store: more Playsets! Just refer to this handy graphic:\nWhen we reach each of these targets, a new Playset will be added to the reward packages: all backers at the Plentiful Nonsense Set ($15 CAD) level and up will receive these Playsets in PDF form, and Add-On options will be made available to obtain them in softcover form as well. And beyond that? Who can say - there may be even more fabulous goodies in store!\nFriday Knights ($12 500 CAD)\nby Ewen Cluney\nThe Friday Knights are a gaming group, and tonight is the big night, when their characters will at last face the Dark Lord and save the land from eternal darkness! But there's more than just the game going on. There's magic in the air, and that magic pulls some fairies (that's you!) into our world. You have a chance to help these gamers confront their very human problems... or maybe just run around trying not to let the cat catch you.\nDisorder in the Court ($15 000 CAD)\nby Ashley Flanagan and Zach Welhouse\nThe Fairy Queen of Autumn\u2019s prized sky corgi has been stolen and his wrangler has been killed! You've been press-ganged as the Queen's crack legal squad, and it\u2019s up to you to track down the guilty party and bring her before the Autumn Court - where a case is only as good as its lawyers\u2019 wits - to exact swift justice. Objection!\nGorgonzola Sky ($17 500 CAD)\nby Annika K Johnson\nLaunch your fairy higher than any has flown before! In this space adventure, something has gone terribly wrong with the Moon; you and your friends must find a way to travel to its miniaturized surface and discover its dairy-scented secrets. Play the comet-lassoing heroine and gallantly restore balance to nature - or let your devious side take over and horde the Moon Cheese all for yourself!\nPenguin King Games is a small publisher of tabletop roleplaying games and related accessories. Founded in 2012, our goal is to bring fun and inclusive games to everyone. Costume Fairy Adventures will be our first commercial project - and we need your help to make it happen!\nVisit our website at penguinking.com, or find us on:\nFacebook: facebook.com/PenguinKingGames\nTumblr: tumblr.penguinking.com\nTwitter: twitter.com/PenguinKingInc", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we HOPE everything will run like clockwork, we know better than to expect it. Here are a few of the steps we've taken to avoid potential pitfalls.\n\n* We plan to provide total transparency regarding our progress. Our backers will have access to regularly updated playtest drafts, and will receive updates whenever new materials are received. You'll know exactly what's happening - and how long it's likely to take - every step of the way.\n\n* We've solicited binding quotes from numerous printers and manufacturers, both domestic and overseas, in order to get a clear idea of our production costs. We've also done a complete, end-to-end dry run of our production chain for every major component of our reward packages; our manufacturing partners are just waiting for us to flip the switch and begin full-scale production.\n\n* \"Costume Fairy Adventures\" has been in active development since August of 2012, and many of the most risky and time-consuming portions of the project have already been completed. The core rules are already available to preview, and the Core Costume Deck is 100% complete in terms of illustration and graphic design, needing only a few rounds of additional playtesting to work out the bugs.\n\n* We've assembled a large and geographically diverse project team, including both newcomers and experienced industry professionals. We've worked hard to minimise potential bottlenecks; with multiple team members ready to take up the slack on any aspect of the project, no single person is in a position to set back our timelines. Though a newcomer to tabletop RPG publishing, our project leader brings over a decade of experience in project management to help keep things on track.\n\n* Finally, if worst comes to worst, Penguin King Games Inc. has a no-questions-asked backer refund policy for all overdue projects, whether via this or any other crowdfunding portal. If we've missed our deadline, and we've failed to reassure you that things are still on track, we're fully prepared to give your money back. We'd be sorry to have lost your support - and we think you'll be missing out on a wonderful game - but we offer this option as a demonstration that we take our commitments seriously.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #143", "update_userinfo": "Disorder in the Court now available", "update_content": "Heya, folks.

It didn't go very well :)\nAfter that, I wanted to blend the fast-paced action and easy-to-pick-up-it-ness (it's a word now!) of Uno with MTG, to create something that was quick and fun for the whole family, but that had a little bit of strategy to it.\nAnd thus, WANDS was born.\nConjured Clones - one of the WANDS cards\nHow To Play\nYou play the role of a witch or wizard, engaged in a magical battle with your opponents.  You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.\nIf you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.\nWANDS is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.\nWANDS is not a collectible card game.  You only need one set of cards; there's nothing to collect; no booster packs; no rarity; no drafts.  This is the full game.\nDispel - another of the WANDS cards\nWANDS is tremendously easy to play and fun.  A testament to this is the fact that both my seven-year-old nephew and my not-seven-year old wife enjoy playing.\nWANDS has been exhaustively play-tested and iterated on over a span of months.  \nDraft rules can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2JIXEygDHOUYlF0bVdaOTgzNTA/edit?usp=sharing\nThese are near-final (but not final), and don't include production card names, for example.\nWHAT'S IN THE GAME\nWANDS is a 104-card deck, with 15 separate cards of custom art.  Card fronts and backs are full-color.  WANDS comes in a double-tuck box (the same kind of box UNO comes in).\nWHAT'S GONE INTO IT\nWe've spent over a year prototyping and playtesting the game.  It's gone through several revisions.\nWe've brought on board an artist and art director and had the overall design of the game set down, art created for some of the cards, the card backs, the logo, and the box.\nART AND PRINTING\nArt is from Lindsey Lea (http://grumble-bee.tumblr.com/), who's done art and animation on everything from an MMO for Playdom/Disney  to G4's CODE MONKEYS.  Art direction is courtesy of John Flynn (http://www.behance.net/bryne), who's done art and/or art directed for Playdom/Disney, Meteor Games, and NeoPets, among other things.\nWANDS will be professionally printed here in the United States on 2.5\" x 3.5\" poker cards.  They are glossy finished, with a nice heavy weight to them.\nJOSH\nWow, my name looks nice as a heading.  Who am I?  Why am I qualified to make this game?\nI am a game nerd.  I love board games, card games, and video games, and have been playing them obsessively since I was a small nerd.\nI also do this for a living.  For the last few years, I've been employed by companies including Acclaim, Playdom/Disney, and Nexon to design, produce and/or product manage video games.  I've shipped twelve games for PC, Facebook, and mobile devices.  Before that, I co-wrote (with David S. Goyer, writer of the Batman reboot and MAN OF STEEL), produced, directed, and designed the streaming Web series and Alternate Reality Game THE HANGED MAN for Icebox.com, and spent years developing and producing films and TV shows (some of which people have actually seen). \nI've run user, beta, and other game tests for literally tens of thousands of users at a time, and I've applied this process on a slightly smaller scale over WANDS' development process.  Many different groups from two to ten players have tried WANDS over several dozen iterations of the game, resulting in its current incarnation.  To put it into hard numbers, it's been fun-i-fied 7,233%.\nKICKSTARTER\nWhy Kickstarter?  Because people on Kickstarter love cool games.\nFunding will be used to finish up the art, make all the art files ready for printing, and get the decks and rewards printed and shipped.\nAfter Kickstarter, prices for WANDS will be increased.  A single copy of the game will sell for $20-25.  So you can get yours at a significant discount now (20-40% off, for the non-math inclined).  And reward items like giclees will not be available post-Kickstarter.\nEldritch Flames - a WANDS card\nSTRETCH GOAL\nWe didn't want to go too crazy with stretch goals, because we want to focus on getting WANDS out.\nHowever, if we're able to raise a total of $15,000, we will print the entire run of the game with foil backs.  Foil backs would be a la Magic:the Gathering or other CCG type games.  Foil backs would be on the entire print run for the Kickstarter campaign, and everyone would get them instead of regular old non-foil backs.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2\nIf we hit $10,000, we will add in another \"bomb\" card that rewinds time, undoing the entire last turn taken (and all of its effects).  This card can only be canceled by a Dispel (no other Counter-Spells work on it).\nSTRETCH GOAL #3\nIf we hit $12,000, the rewind bomb card is exclusive to Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major risks associated with WANDS are that the key personnel (artist, art director, and myself) may become injured or incapacitated, delaying the project.\n\nOther, not as likely risks include the apocalypse, alien invasion, a swarm of out of control nanomachines rendering the world into grey goo, or someone opening a portal to another dimension, releasing beings of great power beyond our comprehension into this realm to create madness and destruction. But let's be honest, if any of those things happen, you'll be a lot more angry about life as we know it ending than you will about not getting your card game from Kickstarter.\n\nOn a serious note, I've been working as a professional producer, project manager and/or product manager across film, TV, and the Web for almost two decades now, and have made games for everyone from World Poker Tour to Disney. This project has been scoped and costed out, and our deadlines are reasonable.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Completely Unrelated!

Some are left in limbo for eternity, complacent with the hand they've been dealt.  Then there are the others who are so eager to fulfill their missions that they continue on without the player in a battle royale known only to them as \"The Game\".  The cost for those who enter the game and fail is Game Over.\nGameplay Round\nPLAY\n\nGame Over is a 2 - 6 player casual party game set within the video game realm.  It is designed to play in rounds as each game only lasts 10 to 20 minutes (depending on the amount of players), and each round only takes about 30 seconds to setup.  It is played with a 108 card deck.  What I truly love about it is that for a casual party game, it plays extremely well with as little as 3 players (2 players also works but the gameplay becomes more predictable with only 2).\nPlayers select a character from each of the 3 character classes (Shooter, Platformer, and Adventurer) which is then placed in front of them as their \"lives\".  The remaining 90 card play deck is then spread out face down in the middle of the table.\nEach player will take turns drawing from the play deck spread out in the middle of the table.  Cards drawn from the play deck are not shown to the other players and are considered your inventory. Once the draw is complete the player will then get to perform one of the following actions:\n        Run - no action is performed\n        Equip - equip (place card in front of a character) or rearrange one or\n        more weapons\n        Attack - attack another character with an equipped weapon\n        Special - perform a characters special ability\n        Redeem - redeem gems for bonuses\n        Use - use a non-equip card\nPlayers will continue taking turns until there is a winner.  A round of Game Over can be won in the following ways:\n        Survival - you are the last surviving player. \n        High Score - you reach a minimum of 25 points.\n        Quest Complete - you find all three enchanted items.\nThe game is won immediately after a player achieves at least one of those scenarios.\n The abilities of each card drawn will be detailed in the card description.  The primary weapon cards will have offensive abilities, as well as special abilities that can be used if it is equipped to the corresponding character class.  This can be determined by referencing the lower right symbol on each card.\n An equipped card also acts as a defensive layer on the character it is equipped to.  If that character is attacked and hit, they will first lose their equipped item before losing their life.   When an equipped weapon is used either to attack, or as a special, it must then be discarded afterwards.\nThe list of special abilities are as follows:\n        Attack +2 - allows for 2 hits against any one character, or can be\n        distributed to two separate characters for 1 hit each.\n        Steal - steal an equipped item from another player and place into\n        your inventory.\n        Block - use to intercept an attack on any of your other characters or\n        equipped items.\n        Invincibility - protects all of your characters and equipped items\n        from being attacked for 1 full turn.\n        Loot - allows you to remove 1 item from the discard pile and place\n        into your inventory.\n        Draw Again - allows you to draw another card from the play deck.\nEquippable vs. non-equippable items. \nWhile many items must be equipped in order to use, there are some items that can only be used if they are unequipped.  Whether an item can be equipped or not is determined by the following symbols.\n If an item that cannot be equipped has a special ability, you must have a character class that corresponds to that special alive in order to use it.\nSome non-equippable items can be used even when it is not your turn, such as the skip card.  This will be detailed on the card.  All cards are discarded after use.\nAttacking\nDepending on the strength of the card, an item may have one of 3 properties.  \n        Defense +1 - used only as protection and cannot attack other\n        players.\n        Attack +1 / Miss - these attacks are not guaranteed hits.  If used\n        against another player, the defender will draw a random card from\n        the play deck. If the symbol on the top right is a skull, it will be\n        considered a hit.  If it is a music note, it will be considered a miss.  \n        The drawn card is then buried back into the play deck.\n        Attack +1 - a hit.  Can be used to kill a non-protected character, or\n        to knock out one of their equipped items into the discard pile.\nRedeeming Gems\nGems can be collected in order to beat the game by accumulating 25 points, or they can be redeemed for bonuses.  There are 3 types of gems.\nThe game may also place a \"hit\" on you.  If you draw a hit card, you must place it over one of your living characters.  If another player kills that character, they will receive the gem reward detailed on the card.\nAction Cards\nIn addition to gems and weapons, there are also several action cards that can be drawn.  Some of these could have negative impacts, but each one will detail their ability within the card description.\n Capture cards are the most complex of these action cards.  A capture card will allow a player to steal another player's character to use as their own.  If the player that the character originated from manages to successfully attack their stolen character, they can rescue them back.\nCard Breakdown\nHere is a breakdown of the play deck cards.  The first edition is considered \"Level 1\" with the intention to eventually create \"Level 2\" expansion decks and so on.\nCard Artwork Examples \nDoes not represent the full deck.\n There are several goals with this KickStarter for Game Over.  The first of which would be taking the prototype into a fully fledged first edition game.  Based on the interest generated with this KickStarter, I hope to design an additional 6 characters to play as, as well as fine tuning the mechanics and balance of the prototype before distributing the game more widely.  \nI would also like to take the donations and put them towards a bulk order that would be distributed via Amazon as well as Game Crafters.  \nFinally, if more interest and donations are generated than expected, I am eager to begin development on future additions that would include everything from additional character classes to new weapon and action cards.  In short, I would love nothing more than the continued expansion of Game Over to increase the variety of cards and gameplay even further. While countless hours have been spent playing Game Over already, I am eager to hear suggestions and ideas on how to balance the gameplay even further.\n I will be updating content frequently.

It's also been played by an adult special needs group, who enjoyed it so much they've asked for it to become a regular activity at the end of every lesson.\nI've thoroughly play tested the game with Gamers, Children, Parents and Teachers, here's what they say:\nIt\u2019s extremely good fun, and far, far better than my expectations led me to believe. It\u2019s a damned good game in fact.\nMy first reaction after playing was to set it up and play again, and that\u2019s never a bad thing.\nDarrell Ottery Eclectic Games\nRead Darrell's full review on the Board Game Geek website\nWith City of Zombies I was very lucky to know two amazing artists: Rory Walker and Alonso Jacobo. Working together we've created a bright and colourful game board, and two art styles of zombies and heroes.\nTop Row: Alonso Jacobo's zombies, bottom row: Rory Walker's Zombies.\nBoth styles come with the base game\nI was born dyslexic and really struggled with maths at school. Now as a Designer and Father when I saw my daughter struggling with her maths I was determined to help her, so she wouldn't have to go through what I went through.\nHaving loved playing board games as a child, I decided to design a really entertaining game which would, first and foremost, be fun for us to play together, while at the same time improving her maths skills without her being aware of it. City of Zombies burst forth and saw the light of day!\nSince she's grown up I've played the game with family and friends, teachers and experienced gamers and the response has been fantastic. They all think my game's really great fun to play. \nWith all this number crunching going on, I wanted to know if my game had further educational potential, so it made sense to show my game to an expert. Liz Woodham at The Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Cambridge University was recommended to me - she's very kindly given her thoughts on the game.\nIt offers opportunities to practise calculation strategies in a non-threatening and motivating context. The game provides a reason to perform all these calculations and the engaging context spurs them on.\nIt requires children to make decisions and consider different possibilities. This game requires children to decide for themselves what calculations they perform and it encourages them to look for alternative solutions rather than sticking to the first possibility they come across.\nIt encourages strategic thinking. The game offers opportunities for children to develop winning strategies rather than just relying on chance.\nAs a team game, it provides opportunities for children to listen to each other, share ideas and reach a consensus.\nIt is adaptable for a wide range of ages and levels of attainment. A game like this often leads to surprises in that children who might have been considered 'low attaining' can shine.\nKickstarter\nI'm on Kickstarter to raise funding towards the printing costs of the finished boxed game.\nThe game has been thoroughly play tested with kids, parents, teachers and at game clubs. All game assets (art and illustrations) are completed. Components (dice & aeroplane turn marker) have been selected and sourced. A PDF of the Rules (basic and advanced) is almost finished and will be available for review and comments on KS shortly.

We will ship them to everybody at once along with everything else you are slated to receive that is done by that time. The second wave will be once the remainder of the product is completed. This first wave/second wave option is an extra $10.\nFor anybody that is receiving boxes from our 'any set' option and would like your product shipped sooner than the hardsuits we can ship that product for an extra $5.\nIn the case of the NCO figures and shipping, if the NCO figures are the only figures holding up your order from being shipped with the first wave (i.e. you're only getting Hardsuits or one of our 'Any Sets') we will ship your regular product with the first wave and hold off on the free figure until they are ready.

We've always wanted to make the process of editing your campaign pages much more organic and natural, and now we have the chance. Watch the video for a quick demo of what we mean by \"natural editing\"\nThere are some significant technical challenges here, which is why the stretch goal is so aggressive. I still think we can hit it, especially as we approach the final push that most Kickstarters get.\nAs with the other stretch goals, this will be a post-reforging target. My best estimate right now is that we can launch this sometime in December of 2013. I wish I could promise it sooner, but this gets to the very core of Obsidian Portal and I don't want to under-emphasize the difficulty.\nMega Stretch Goal - Extra Month at $75,000\nFor every $10k we raise over the initial goal, we will be able to extend the premium Ascendant time for every backer (Hasted Ascendant and above) by 1 month. We've already achieved 6 extra months! So get out there and tell your friends. The more backers we bring in, the more Ascendant time everyone gets!\nShe can't take much more, captain!\nUpdate - Additional Years Available\nBy popular demand, we're offering additional years as an add-on purchase. Simply pledge an additional $35 on top of your chosen backer level for each additional year you want. More details and examples down below the backer levels.\nStretch Goal #4 - Custom Campaign URLs - $50,000 - ACHIEVED\nPart of the reforging is an overhaul to make things look better, so we think everyone would like to make their page URLs look nicer as well. Every campaign will get its own subdomain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.obsidianportal.com\u201d) and Ascendant campaigns can set up their own raw domain (ie. \u201cmycampaign.com\u201d).\nThere will be significant technical challenges with this stretch goal, both in making sure that old URLs do not break and also making sure that all your old links to characters, wiki pages, items, and so forth automatically redirect to your new custom campaign URL. We don\u2019t want to underestimate the difficulty here, so as with our File Storage stretch goal, we\u2019re shooting to complete this stretch goal after the main reforging process. Our target date for the custom URLs would be mid-October 2013.\nStretch Goal #3 - File Storage Locker - $35,000 - ACHIEVED!\nWe\u2019ve always wanted to expand our image upload to include files of any type. Every campaign has files they need to share, like PDFs of your world\u2019s history or MP3s of your campaign theme music. If we hit this stretch goal we can add a spot in every campaign to store and manage all your shared files, so it\u2019s easier to keep all your campaign materials in one place.\nPlus, if we can hit this stretch goal, we will be able to increase the storage size limits for both free and Ascendant campaigns. The free limit will climb to 250MB and the Ascendant limit will rise to 10GB. That should be plenty of space to share everything your group needs.\nNote: For this and all future stretch goals, we are targeting a post-August release date. We will do our best to get as much completed as we can by August, but we want to be realistic and open about our timelines. For the file storage locker, we\u2019re aiming for sometime in September.\nStretch Goal #2 - Names! Names! Names! - $20,000 - ACHIEVED!\nSince the beginning, I've wanted a good, solid random name generator as part of the character creation and management. So many times I've been staring at my players, mouth hanging open, waiting for a name to come out. They had asked about an NPC I hadn't prepared, and I just needed a name. Here, let me explain:\nSo what are the particulars of the name generator?\nA variety of different naming \"genres\". You'll be able to quickly switch between Elven-ish, Dwarven, guttural Ork (think lots of Ks and Xs), and so forth.\nFast! - It will be right there when you need it, ready to give you the name you need and keep your players in the game.\nIntegrated - Instead of just spitting a name at you, you'll be able to create a new barebones character on the fly with the name pre-generated. So, when your players ask about that random new NPC 3 months later, they will be tracked normally in Obsidian Portal, just like all your other characters.\n\nStretch Goal #1 - Reworking the Maps - $10,000 - ACHIEVED\nThe campaign maps have been one of our favorite features since the beginning, but just like everything else, they need some work to make them better! If we hit this goal, we will be able to make the following improvements:\nDeeper zoom levels for Ascendant maps - 5 instead of the current 3\nHigher resolution images - 4096x4096 pixels instead of the current 1024x1024\nA library of map markers - Different colors and shapes. Imagine dropping crossed swords to mark a battle, a tower to mark a wizard's abode, and a cave for...a cave. That's the idea.\nBetter connection with the rest of your campaign - Add markers for specific characters and/or wiki pages, instead of only the general purpose markers we have now.\nThe maps are already fun. Now let's reforge them into something truly useful and awesome!\nObsidian Portal Reforged\nObsidian Portal is the award-winning online campaign management system for tabletop role-playing games. We want to revitalize the existing Obsidian Portal by increasing its functionality, adding new features, and cleaning up the design. We are taking the strong core that is Obsidian Portal, heating it up in the furnace, and reforming it into a sleeker and sharper tool. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master, which will make your game the best it can be. That\u2019s what \u201creforging\u201d is all about.\nImprovements\nTo provide you with the best possible experience, we\u2019ll revamp the most frequently used parts of the site and rework them so that they\u2019re easier to use. We will be examining every page for ways to make them flow better, provide the information you need, and allow you to navigate and manage your campaign faster and easier. The redesign will add more features to enhance your gaming.\nA perfect example of this is our plan to create a campaign dashboard that will put the most important details of your campaign right at your fingertips. The dashboard is just the first of many changes that will fundamentally enhance Obsidian Portal and make it a much better tool than it is today.\nA very rough draft of the new dashboard\nWe\u2019ll be supporting these functional changes by improving the overall design of the site. We\u2019ll take our current site and give it a consistent look and feel that will make it more intuitive to use\u2014not a button here and a link there, but a cohesive design strategy.\nWith more of your support, there\u2019s even more we can do to make Obsidian Portal the most robust campaign management system. If we make our original goal, keep an eye out for stretch goals for additional improvements.\nBack us now and get a year of premium Ascendant membership at a reduced price when you back at the Ascendant level.\nWhy Obsidian Portal?\nIt\u2019s free to use and built from the ground up, for gamers by gamers. We host a huge community of tabletop RPG players who are all looking to get the most out of their tabletop gaming experience. You play your campaign and we help you manage it. It\u2019s that simple.\nWith Obsidian Portal, you can manage your tabletop RPG campaign from any computer, anywhere. You can tell your story and get recognized for your innovation and creativity. Now help us take Obsidian Portal to the next level!\nBenefits to Backers\nA year of premium Ascendant membership (Hasted Ascendant level and above). Not a GM yourself? No worries, the Ascendant time can be gifted to your GM!\nCool backer-only souvenirs like campaign maps, custom map markers, profile badges, t-shirts, letterpress cards, and more\nThe opportunity to have a hand in the reforging process. All backers will receive developer updates along the way for an exclusive look at the design process. Plus, Tinkerer Ascendant level and above will be able to provide feedback during the design and beta testing.\nA slicker, more useful, easier to navigate Obsidian Portal. A better Obsidian Portal will make your life easier as a game master and improve your game.\n\nMy Backstory\nWhen I started Obsidian Portal in 2006, I knew I needed to set aside some real time and focus hard to make progress. To accomplish this, I quit playing video games altogether and told myself I wouldn't play again until the site launched. If you're a gamer like me, then you know how hard that is, and also how much time that can free up. I accomplished some amazing things in those first 9 months, and it's thanks to that dedication that Obsidian Portal is where it's at now.\nFast forward to now. Over the summer, I have the chance to focus on Obsidian Portal almost full time. Plus, I have a team of designers and programmers lined up to help out. So, in the spirit of what it took to launch, I'm once again swearing off video games and putting my nose to the grindstone. It will be a hot and sweaty summer, but by GenCon in August we will have some awesome progress to show for it!\nYou've seen what I can do by myself on nights and weekends. Now let me show you how awesome we can be with a real team working near full time!\nBacker Level Details\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n\nExample of the finished postcard thank you\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 20% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time (a 12.5% discount off the normal price of $39.99/yr) - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\n\nYour name or username on a special Obsidian Portal page listing Kickstarter backers.\nA badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a Reforger.\nA postcard thanking you for supporting us in the Reforging process.\n1 year of Ascendant subscription time - You can choose to redeem the subscription time immediately following the Kickstarter or wait until the Reforging is complete in August.\nAccess to the beta forum to discuss the reforging and provide feedback as it progresses\nA special badge for your Obsidian Portal profile identifying you as a core member of the Reforging process\nA limited edition t-shirt available only to Reforger backers.\nEarly access to the beta server to play with the updates and new features as they are developed.\nA handmade letterpress card inviting you to the beta program.\nA custom video made by the talented Mikhail Twarogowski, who composed our Kickstarter video for us.

It's been a very exciting month and I'm still overwhelmed with the amount of support the project has gotten, both from backers pledging money and from comic fans and pros helping to spread the word. I could not have achieved this level of success without all of you, so thank you all so much! It really means a lot to me to see the series embraced in this way.\n\nFor any late-comers who missed the campaign, you will still be able to get Runners: The Big Snow Job (hardcover,  paperback, or PDF) and Runners: Bad Goods (paperback or PDF) at my runnersuniverse.com Store. I will also have a limited number of some of the reward items there, like prints, character cards, and the expanded sketchbook.\n\nI'm excited to get all the Runners books and rewards into your hands (or onto your electronic devices!), and again, thanks for all the support!\nUPDATES!\nUpdate 3-27-2013: I just finished the Runners Battle Royale image, which was unlocked back at the $13,500 goal. All backers will get the digital file, and backers at $35 and higher will get a physical 11\"x17\" print. Glad I was able to finish it in time to post here during this last day of the campaign, and I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I enjoyed drawing it!\nUpdate 3-25-2013: I'd love to reach the $22,000 stretch goal, so I am reducing the prices on 3 of the Mob Boss reward tiers. The convention banner reward is now $225 (instead of $325). The chapter 4 cover original art is now $300 (instead of $350). And the set of 8 original character card art is now $500 (instead of $600). If you were interested in these before, jump on them now!\nUpdate 3-25-2013: 3 days to go! And here are 3 bits of coverage you might want to check out. Ain't It Cool News recently did a fun interview with me. Comic Book Resources posted a fantastic review of the new book. And then I did a very thorough, hour-long conversation with the Part-Time Fanboy podcast. Check them out!\nUpdate 3-18-2013: Added a new stretch goal! At $22,000, a hard cover option of the new book will be unlocked! All backers at the $25 level and higher will have the option of upgrading their copy of the new book from paperback to hard cover FOR FREE!\nUpdate 3-15-2013: After crunching some numbers and doing a bit more research, I have decided to alter the previously-announced character turnaround stretch goals. Instead of offering the turnarounds as separate stretch goals, I am now folding them into a single, much more exciting goal: 8 extra pages added to the graphic novel! So the revision is that at the new stretch goal of just $18,000, I will add 8 pages of bonus content to the book, with the character turnarounds being part of those pages!\nUpdate 3-11-2013: Three new Reward Tiers have just been added! There is now a $49 Guard level that includes 2 fantastic prints by David Petersen (Mouse Guard). There's also a $55 Scoundrel v2 level that allows backers to choose a print of ANY page from the new book, and the chosen page can be printed either with or without the word balloons and text. Finally, there is a new Mob Boss v8 level that includes a set of 32\" x 66\" vinyl Runners convention banners.\nUpdate 3-10-2013: The campaign recently doubled its initial goal! To celebrate, I am adding a number of new Stretch Goals and Reward Tiers.\nSTRETCH GOALS:\n$8500 - UNLOCKED! - Graphic novel will be printed in U.S instead of overseas, reducing turnaround time by 2 months!\n$13,500 - UNLOCKED! - Battle Royale print, featuring all the characters in cartoony style in one big slugfest! All backers will receive a digital PDF, and $35 Reward Tier and higher will receive an 11\" x 17\" print.\n$18,000 - UNLOCKED! - 8 extra pages of Bonus Content added to the graphic novel, bringing the page count from 168 to 176 pages! Content will include the previously-announced character turnarounds for all six main characters as well as other additional content, to be announced!\n$22,000 - UNLOCKED! - Hard cover option available! All backers at the $25 level and higher will have the option of upgrading their copy of the new book from paperback to hard cover FOR FREE!\n\"Aliens, Smugglers, Pirates. And they're the GOOD guys.\"\nHi there! I'm Sean Wang and I'm a comic book writer and illustrator. Over the years, I've worked on books like the Tick and Arthur for New England Comics and Meltdown for Image Comics. But I'm most well known for my self-published sci-fi series Runners...\nWhat is Runners?\nRunners is a fun sci-fi action comedy about a crew of alien smugglers led by reluctant captain Roka Nostaco and his acerbic co-pilot Ril Mar. They're joined by two pirates, six-eyed sharpshooter and wisecracker Cember Koji and former mob enforcer Bennesaud. There's also a humanoid named Bocce, who has a weird, shape-shifting arm, and a blue-skinned alien girl named Sky, who has some mysterious abilities of her own. The series follows their exploits as they struggle to complete hazardous intergalactic runs while constantly hounded by pirates, bounty hunters, police, and the occasional conscience.\n\"Runners is the best science fiction adventure I have read in years. It has wonderfully fleshed out characters, a terrific story, and great action sequences.\" --Stan Sakai; Usagi Yojimbo\nThe first graphic novel, Runners: Bad Goods, came out in 2005 to much critical acclaim, including being on several reviewers' Best of 2005 lists. It focused on the crew's struggle to complete a particularly dangerous run for the mob, taking them from shootouts with pirates to ship-to-ship dogfights with ruthless bounty hunters, and culminating in an all-out, three-way ship, cycle, and foot chase through the streets of an alien space station.\nAfter a short hiatus to work on other comic projects, I have now completed the second story arc, Runners: The Big Snow Job, in which hard times have fallen on Roka and his smuggling crew. The desperate crew takes on a seemingly trivial job that turns out to be more than they bargained for as they deal with an inhospitable climate, a hostile native population, a band of mercenaries, a mob power play, and a series of treacherous double-crosses. And that's if they don't all kill each other first!\nWhere Do You Come In?\nThrough Kickstarter, I'm hoping to fund the printing of the Runners: The Big Snow Job paperback graphic novel. From 2009-2011, I published the story online as a weekly webcomic, and I am now looking to collect the completed story into printed form. Unlike the first book, Runners: Bad Goods, which was black-and-white, the new story is in full color, and color printing can be a tad expensive for the self-publisher. But with your help, we can make it happen!\nFor your pledge, you will receive a copy of the new book, along with a number of other additional Runners items, including:\nA set of 8 full-color character cards\nChoice of 3 different color prints\nOriginal art for the 6 cover images\n3 levels of inked character illustrations\nA 64-page expanded sketchbook of concept and character designs\nAnd as I mentioned, all the story content had already been finished, so there is no risk of the project not being completed. In fact, all that remains to be done is layout work on my end.\nBook Specs\nRunners: The Big Snow Job will be a 168-page full color paperback and will collect the entire 5-issue story that originally posted online at runnersuniverse.com. It will also include an all-new 6-page epilogue, 10 pages of sketchbook concepts, and guest pinups from comic artists including David Petersen (Mouseguard), Khoi Pham (Avengers), Shawn McManus (Fables: Cinderella), Tim Seeley (Hack/Slash), and others.\nHow Will the Money Be Spent?\nThe cheapest I have found to print the book is overseas for about $6000, so that is my initial goal. Ideally, I'd love to reach at least $8500, which would allow me to print here in the U.S. Printing here would also cut down tremendously on turnaround time, since I could receive the books in under a month, as opposed to the 3-month wait time for overseas. And the sooner I get the books, the sooner you get them!\nIn addition to the first Stretch Goal of $8500, I will also announce more Stretch Goals that will unlock additional cool rewards for project backers. So stay tuned!\nInternational Shipping\nCanadian orders please add $15 to any reward tier. All other international orders please add $20.\nReward Tiers\nThere are a few reward tiers that include the first book, Runners: Bad Goods. In order to keep things simple, most of the other reward tiers are for just the new book, Runners: The Big Snow Job, along with various bonus reward items. For those tiers, just add $15 to your pledge to include a copy of the Bad Goods graphic novel or $7 for a set of the 5 original issues that make up the entire Bad Goods story. The new book is a stand-alone story and can be read completely on its own, but you'll definitely get a little more out of the character and universe with the addition of the first book.\nClick these links for images of the various Reward items:\nPrints / Character Cards / Sketchbook / Inked Illustrations / Original Art\n     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Print images     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out David Petersen print images\n________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Character Card images\n________________________________________________________\n ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Sketchbook images\n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images     ________________________________________________________\n     ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images \n   ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Inked Illustration sample images\n     ________________________________________________________\nClick here to check out Original Art images\n     ________________________________________________________\n\n________________________________________________________\n________________________________________________________\nNeed Convincing?\nIf you're still on the fence, please check out www.runnersuniverse.com, where you can see as much of the story and artwork as you like. In the meantime, here are a few quotes from comic professionals and reviewers:\n\"Runners was one of the best indie books I\u2019d ever read... It is space opera comics the way you wish they were done all the time... Sean Wang has wowed me again and if you give Runners a chance I\u2019m sure it will impress you too.\"  -- Kristian Horn; www.aintitcool.com\n\n\"Sean Wang's impressive art demonstrates the glorious imagination and colorful detail you want in a science fiction adventure. His exotic aliens make for a visual feast. If the Star Wars cantina customers took on Firefly-like mercenary jobs, you'd have Runners.\"  --Johanna Draper Carlson; www.comicsworthreading.com\n\"One of the best comic book universes doesn\u2019t belong to DC, Marvel or even Archie\u2026 it belongs to Sean Wang\u2019s incredible series, \u2018Runners\u2019!\" Since I first read the original, I have championed 'Runners' as the best independent comic ever produced. It's beautifully drawn and written with so much passion and charm. 'The Big Snow Job' reminds me of 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Hard to top the original, but somehow does! This is a perfect comic book!\" -- Matt Herring; www.secretidentitypodcast.com\nThanks for checking out my Kickstarter page and I hope you'll consider supporting Runners: The Big Snow Job!\nFollow Runners at www.runnersuniverse.com and the Runners - The Comic Facebook Page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the story content had already been finished, so there is no risk of the project not being completed.

No problem! We'll continue to take preorders (and once it's printed, we'll have information on where you can buy it) - just check out http://www.cantripgames.com/storywar!\nStory War is a storytelling party game for 3 to 8 players. Players split into teams and take control of classic characters like Puss In Boots or a fire-breathing Dragon and use creativity and humor to defeat the opposing team.\nIn most other games the difference between victory and defeat has a lot to do with numbers; the story itself is secondary. But in Story War controlling the narrative is the only way to win. There are no numbers or rules on the cards, only artwork and hilarious descriptions. It's up to the players to decide how to interpret their powers, which means that every game tells unique stories based on the collective creativity of everyone involved.\nHow does it work?\nEach turn represents one battle between two teams of players. The setting is defined by a randomly drawn Battlefield card. Players then look at the Warrior cards and Item cards in their hands and try to come up with a clever strategy. Once every player has played their Warrior cards face-down, everyone flips their cards over simultaneously. Then players must quickly describe, in an open discussion, how their team would defeat the opposing team.\nEach battle is moderated by a judge that rotates every turn (similar to Apples to Apples) so the shared pop cultural context of everyone in the room is very important! Harry Potter fans might play the Basilisk card differently than Percy Jackson fans. Pokemon fans can cite obscure typing match-ups to explain why you can't punch a bird. Dungeons and Dragons players will often overlay D&D rules onto the game - don't even try to convince a D&D-playing judge that the Giant can defeat the Dwarf!\nPlayers are also free to make stuff up, as long as they can be convincing! Everything is being moderated by a judge so if your opponent claims their character is unrealistically powerful, you can challenge that claim. Once a challenge has been issued the judge has to immediately decide whether or not it's a valid move. This means your characters are able to do anything as long as the judge lets you get  away with it! The player acting as the judge and the grouping of teams changes after every turn, so the social dynamic is always shifting! Each battle ultimately evolves into an organic story and a memorable shared experience.\nWhat kind of stories are told?\nStory War was designed from the ground up with inclusiveness in mind. It can be played by anyone and different groups will tell different kinds of stories. If you're playing with gamers the stories are often more combat focused and if you're playing with writers, stories tend to be more character-driven.\nWhen you play Story War with young kids, then you'll likely end up telling G-rated stories. But if you're playing with just adults, the stories can become serious, inappropriate and often very scientific - can Midas turn a Ghost into gold? (Story War also makes a great drinking game!)\nHere's some examples of some great stories that happened in playtesting:\n\"The Lich is the Lady Gaga of the underworld and used her Twitter followers to attack her hater: a Zombie.\" (played by @LeiaJ)\n\"The Leprechaun created so much gold that gold became worthless and his society became isolationist and crumbled.\" (played by Brad)\n\"The Imp used the Philosopher's Stone to transform the air around the Fairy into a bottle - a bottle is the Fairy's nemesis!\" (played by Nick)\n\"The Treant was a Tree of Cheem from Doctor Who. It was protected by The Doctor because it's a space minority.\" (played by Khadijah)\n\"The Mimic put on the Mythril Tux to go to a party with other classic D&D characters but he got kicked out because he's always getting drunk and throwing up treasure and everyone hates him.\" (played by strangers)\nWe've playtested Story War hundreds of times with a diverse balance of ages, genders, and skills. Our objective was to make every card as interesting and useful as possible while also keeping the game accessible to anyone. It's a game that you can pull out of your pocket in front of a group of friends (or strangers) and within minutes everyone will be laughing and having fun.\nWho is making Story War?\nCantrip Games! Which consists of Tom McLean, Brad O'Farrell and Vondell Swain. The initial concept came from months of Tom and Brad prototyping and play-testing different card game ideas until we found something interesting. We knew Story War would require fantastic character design skills and hundreds of pieces of art so we hired Vondell Swain, who is only 19 years old but annoyingly talented at everything. We've spent the last 6 months writing, drawing, designing and playtesting. Now we need your help to finally publish Story War!\nBy becoming a backer of Story War, you'll get to have creative input on the expansion cards! We'll be posting unfinished sketches and concepts in our backers-only update section and welcoming feedback. Story War is a game for everybody, so it's really helpful for us to gather feedback from as many people as possible.\nBut also, backers get cool stuff! Read the list of options on the right side of the page for a full list of rewards. Here is more information about those rewards:\nPrint-and-Play Pack\nFor $10, you'll get a \"print-and-play\" PDF containing all the cards in Story War that you can print out on your own as soon as the campaign ends! (This PDF will also be available at all higher reward tiers.)\nBasic Pack\nFor $25, we'll ship you a physical copy of the Story War base set, which contains 100 cards and the rules. This set is already finished so we'll begin printing it as soon as the campaign ends. This is the game we've spent the last 6 months developing, and it includes cards such as:\nWarriors: Lich, Puss In Boots, Cherub\nBattlefields: Beanstalk, Capital City, Sky Port\nItems: Shrink Ray, Flame Bow, Bramble Seed\nHero Pack\nFor $40 you'll be sent a copy of the Story War base set as soon as it's printed and you'll also get a second shipment containing the expansion deck once it's completed. The expansion deck is less focused on Greek mythology and fairytales and more focused on Asian mythology, science fiction, and niche fantasy concepts.\nThe expansion deck will include at least 50 cards, but we'll add more cards as we get more funding! It will hopefully be expanded to 100 extra cards if we reach our funding goals!  We'll be able to develop the expansion deck much faster than the original deck because we'll have more resources and we'll be able to hire additional artists. But we've already begun working on it! Here are some of the cards it will include:\nWarriors: Oni (a Japanese demon), Kraken, Kami (a Japanese spirit)\nBattlefields: Lunar Colony, Labyrinth, Mystery Mansion \nItems: Philosopher's Stone, Bottomless Top Hat, Super Cape\nDeluxe Pack\nFor $60 you'll get everything listed above AND your copy of Story War will include a bunch of cool comics and exclusive cards! We've added a LOT to the Deluxe Pack since the project launched and unfortunately we can't edit the reward description. But if you back at $60, you won't just get the 5 cards mentioned in the reward description, you'll get ALL of the cards shown below:\nThese licensed cards are Kickstarter exclusives and they will NOT be sold later. The only way we're allowed to make them is as Kickstarter rewards.\nYou'll also get a bunch of \"blank\" cards - that is, cards you can write and draw on and shuffle into your Story War deck! They have the same backing as regular cards, so you can use them just as you would use any other card.\nCustom Cards\nFor $100 or more we'll make a custom card, just for you! Read the reward descriptions on the side-bar for more details! The lowest tier for custom cards is $100, where we'll redraw the Witch or Wizard card to resemble you. At the highest tier, we'll make a custom card based on you that will be included in EVERYBODY's copy of the expansion - the Dwarf card is an example of a card that's based on a real person (Brad O'Farrell, the creator of Story War!)\nShipping\nShipping is included in the cost of the cards, but backers outside the US will have to pay an additional $10. Story War will be printed immediately after this campaign ends and be shipped as soon as it's printed. But the Expansion Deck and any custom cards will be shipped separately  a few months later, after they've been completed.\nTo avoid paying for international shipping twice, we'll hold international orders until the complete order has arrived; if you're an international backer and you'd prefer two shipments instead of one delayed shipment please add an additional $10 to your order.\nStory War is already finished. We've spent the last 6 months playtesting, writing, and illustrating cards, printing prototype copies, and paying our artist out of pocket. We have a complete game of 100 cards and it's super fun! We only need $20,000 to recoup our losses and print the first run of the game. But if we raise over  $20,000, there are so many awesome things we could add to Story War!\nWhat would additional funds add to the game?\nExpansion Deck: We're planning to make at least 50 extra cards for the Expansion Deck, but we'd love to make a full 100 card expansion! That would mean, when combined with the base set, there'd be a full 200 cards! More cards means more random match-ups, which means greater variety between games! \nGame Modes: We've only ever playtested the game using a single set of rules, but we designed the cards to work with a lot of different styles of play. Game Modes would be new rules that you could print out and use with the standard Story War cards. If we raise enough money we'll develop these new Game Modes and distribute them for free.\nCampaigns: Campaigns are one-time-use stories that involve unexpected plot twists that affect the gameplay! These would also be distributed for free. A campaign would be printed out and given to a player who would act as the judge for the entire game. Think of it like watching a suspenseful movie with your friends, but you're also controlling what happens next!\nOnline Multiplayer Client: Story War actually started out as an online game that we first playtested using a chatroom robot. We decided to develop Story War into a card game for simplicity, but we always knew we wanted to ultimately make an online version. Everyone involved in this card game is also a video game programmer and we're very capable of making a high quality online version of Story War. We think the best implementation might be a webcam-based game using Google Plus Hangouts. But doing so would take a lot of time and energy and resources, so we've set it as our highest goal.\nHere are the milestones we're hoping to reach:\nFUNDED! Thank you so much everybody! The game is definitely going to ship now! We've also unlocked at least 50 cards for the expansion deck! More will be unlocked as we reach our stretch goals!\nWhoa! We hit our first stretch goal way faster than expected! This means the number of cards in the expansion (for everybody who backed with $40 or more) increases from 50 to 60! If we reach all of our stretch goals, the expansion will be a full 100 card deck!\nAwesome, our first game mode has been unlocked! \nIt's called Myth Master! It uses all the same cards as Story War and is structured similarly, the key difference is that you are playing as yourself manifested into the battlefield and you are summoning Warriors from the cards in your hand. The ultimate objective isn\u2019t just to take out the other player\u2019s Warriors, it\u2019s to take out the human player who is controlling them, just like in Magic the Gathering, YuGiOh, and the Pokemon manga*!\nSo now that we\u2019ve hit $30k, I\u2019m going to spend the next few weeks playtesting the Myth Master rule set and refining it and then packaging it in an easy-to-understand PDF rule sheet that you can print out for free!\n(* in the Pokemon manga the objective of battle is often to kill the other trainer, it\u2019s pretty metal)\nAwesome, 10 more expansion cards added! We're now up to 70 cards in the expansion deck! But we also have a SPECIAL SURPRISE:\nWe've teamed up with our KICKSTARTER PALS, the Machine of Death, to release a cross-over game mode these special bonus cards only available to backers of both projects:\nThe Machine of Death card in Story War can be used to predict your opponent\u2019s death with just a single drop of blood; the Story War card in Machine of Death can be used to redeem something from a fairy tale. Both cards stand alone as usable items in both games, but they become even cooler when you combine the two games!\nCan a vampire die of cancer? What if it\u2019s sunlight from the Cancer constellation? Using the Machine of Death\u2019s cause-of-death predictions on fantasy characters adds a whole new level of creative challenge to the gameplay of both games! We\u2019ll post more about the crossover rules later on in the campaign!\nWow, we just hit our $40k stretch goal, which unlocks a 5 pack of campaigns! What are campaigns? They\u2019re a single sheet of rule variations that you can print out and read from top to bottom as you play the game. Here\u2019s some examples of what a campaign could contain:\nA choose-your-own adventure style storyline, that uses cards from the player\u2019s hands to fill in unknown variables, where the story\u2019s path changes depending on the outcome of the battle!\nA list of 20 numbered alternate victory conditions for battle (\u201cWoo the princess!\u201d \u201cWin an election!\u201d \u201cDefeat the opponent without drawing blood!\u201d \u201cWin a go-kart race!\u201d) that you could use with a 20-sided die!\nA one-time-use storyline that plays out like an elaborate shaggy dog story with a big twist at the end!\n\nThe best thing about campaigns? We\u2019ll be releasing some that we make ourselves, but players are free to create their own and share them with other players! We\u2019ll even come up with a convenient way for players to share their campaigns with one another.\nHow\u2019s that for re-playability?\nWait we - somehow hit THREE stretch goals in a single 24 hour period? How is that possible! So at $45k we unlock another 10 cards for the expansion, bringing us up to 80 expansion cards! There's only two stretch goals left before we have a full 100 card expansion deck!\nWe've also figured out a good solution for scaling up art production for our higher level reward tiers, so we've DOUBLED the number of available Magic Packs, which continues to be one of our most popular rewards!\nWhoa, we're halfway to $100k! That's so awesome!\nAt $50k we\u2019ve unlocked a new game mode called Conquest Kingdoms. This is a pretty big deviation from the way Story War is typically played! We wanted to make a game mode that focuses on Battlefield cards as more than just a background thing. So we came up with this idea: Let each team choose a Battlefield card that is treated as a base that the other team must capture. That means things like structural stability and environmental advantages and potential booby traps really come into play!\nOutside of the overall concept (which sounds super fun!) the specific rules for this mode are still up in the air! But now that we\u2019ve gotten $50k in funding, we can afford to actually playtest it and find the best possible rules! Once we\u2019ve finalized the rules for the Conquest Kingdoms game mode, we\u2019ll release them online for free as a downloadable PDF!\nWow! Heck! Wow! We went from $40k to $60k in 24 hours! Do you know what that means? We gained the entire necessary funding amount in a single day! The whole $20k, wow!\nWe also added 10 cards to the expansion, bringing us up to 90! If you want to join the discussion which cards we add to the expansion, head over to the comments section on update #7!\nHoly cow! $70k! in the first 10 days! That means we've unlocked new campaigns written by Cantrip Games, but ALSO we have an exciting announcement relating to campaigns:\nWe're going to build a website where users can write their own interactive campaigns that can be viewed on mobile devices. That is to say, when you're playing Story War with your friends in real life, someone could load CantripGames.com on their smart phone and you'll be able to jump right into alternate game modes and rules that are displayed right there on your phone! No printing necessary! Online campaigns can even even contain interactive components and rich media, like photos, video, and branching story paths.\nWe'll be putting all of our campaigns online for free, and also offer printable versions of ones that would make sense as printed versions. We're also going to make it so users can post their campaigns online for free! It's going to be really cool!\nWow, $80k, that means the expansion is complete! We now have a FULL 100 card expansion! This means you can play the expansion as its own game! We'll develop the expansions with the input from our backers, so be sure to check the updates section for more details! \n\"Objection! It's impossible that my client, the Vampire, could've killed the victim - the crime HAD to have taken place during the DAYTIME!\"\nTrial Tales is a Story War game mode we're developing that turns the concept of \"proving your character can defeat another character\" on it's head - instead the objective is to prove your innocence! It's like Nursrey Crimes meets Phoenix Wright!\nThe players on the left and right of the current judge act as the Attorney and Prosecutor who must defend Warrior cards that represent their client and the victim, respectively. Each subsequent player is a witness/suspect. The Battlefield cards art as crime scenes, and the Item cards act as evidence!\nStory War is largely about choosing your Warrior cards, but Trial Tales is all about evidence (Item cards). The prosecutor and defense attorney will have a hand full of evidence cards that they could choose to play or not to play, based on which ones they think would better suit their narrative. Remember, even if you're the one who submits an Item into evidence, it can still be used against you by the other side!\nWe'll be playtesting this mode until we have a solid set of rules nailed down, then we'll release those rules for free. Also $90k! We had a huge bump this week thanks to Hank and Emmy!\nHey, it\u2019s Tom here! Shortly after Brad pitched me the idea for Story War, I threw together an IRC bot that could play it. (IRC is a really old chat platform that nowadays is only really used by hackers and time travellers from the 90s) Even with no art, hastily-scrawled descriptions, and totally un-thought-out characters and locations, we realised this game was a blast.\nIt turns out that a heck of a lot of you think it\u2019s a pretty cool game idea, too, because as of just a little while ago two-and-a-bit thousand of you have helped us hit our $100k stretch goal - and we\u2019re not even halfway into the campaign yet! Amazing!\nSo, it means that, once the Kickstarter wraps up, I\u2019m going to start bringing this old IRC bot into the twenty tens, including lovely graphics, chat, and video! At the moment we\u2019re looking at building it as an add-on to Google+ Hangouts, which means the webcam-based communication elements will already be there for us; we\u2019ve just got to get the game happening!\nIt\u2019s going to be a fair bit of work, so it certainly not going to be live when the kickstarter ends or anything (plus I\u2019ve got to put together the print-and-play stuff first!), but we\u2019ll keep you posted on the progress. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll end up playing it with at least some of you, so I look forward to seeing you on Google+!\nWow, we hit that stretch goal super fast! To celebrate, here are a preview of four of our favorite items in the base set!\nNow that we've hit the \"base set upgrade\" we're going to include some of the features of the DELUXE PACK in the BASIC PACK: The basic pack will now include a sampling of blank cards that users can draw on, as well as it's own mini-comic that will contain different comics from the DELUXE PACK version. These rewards *stack* too, so if you ordered the DELUXE PACK you're also getting everything in the BASIC PACK as well, which means you'll have even more blank cards and even more comics.\n\"Medusa and the Gargoyle would be a PERFECT couple, come on! He's already stone, so she can't turn him to stone and her snake hair can't hurt him. His cold priestly heart would be warmed by her fiery diva attitude. Plus they look so cute together!\"\nKiss & Make Up is our newest game mode - another way to play with the Story War cards. Rather than trying to figure out \"who would win in a fight\" you're trying to convince another player to go out with you in a sea of competing suitors.\nIt's structured similar to The Bachelor - the 'judge' has a Warrior card that everyone else is trying to woo. Then every other player makes their case for why their Warrior is the best match for the judge's Warrior - and they can use Battlefield cards to suggest date locations, and Item cards as romantic gifts.\nThe Warriors are all fighters, the Items art mostly weapons, and the Battlefields are pretty hazardous - but volatile creatures need love too! Isn't that the whole point of Sex And The City?\nThe weekly webcomic has been unlocked! Which means we're going to start posting weekly comics featuring the Story War characters on the Cantrip Games blog! Comics will often be based on actual battles and they can even be submitted by players themselves! The whole world is a writer's room - any time you're playing a game of Story War, every single turn has the potential to become a comic that can be disseminated to other Story War fans. So that's pretty cool!\nStory War hit $180k last night, which means we\u2019ve unlocked a new Game Mode called Hero\u2019s Saga!\nThe basic idea is this: Rather than playing as a new Warrior every round, you play through the entire game as a single Warrior who gets stronger after every battle. There are two ways your Warrior can get stronger: By acquiring \u201cSkill Cards\u201d which are Warrior cards interpreted as learned abilities (for example, if you play the Red Dragon as a Skill Card on your Witch you could reasonably argue it gives her the power to cast fire spells) and by acquiring Item cards that could be re-used in every future battle without penalty.\nThis is our most ambitious and complex Game Mode yet! Once we\u2019ve thoroughly playtested it and worked out all the kinks, we\u2019ll release the rules as a free PDF to all of our backers!\nThat's it, that's the animated short. No I'm kidding the real animated short will be much more animated and much less short. But I am fairly certain it'll star these characters, all of whom have turned out to be fan favorites. We're already talking to some animators and voice actors and music people and animation studios. It's going to be an actual thing and you guys are going to love it!\nEndless Journey is a new game mode that pushes Story War a little closer to Dungeons and Dragons than Apples to Apples - you'll be playing an allied team of Warriors (decked out with magic items, of course) fighting \"against the deck\" rather than each other!\nEndless Journey will be developed with the intention of having it be played as recurring sessions with continuity between them rather than just a once-off game, and we'll be releasing updates once a month that will affect your epic as it develops!\nWe made it! The final stretch goal, until we demolished it way ahead of time and had to come up with extras!\nSo it looks like now we'll be getting the ball rolling in developing a mobile adaptation of Story War! We're not exactly sure what form it'll take just yet, as it's a pretty big undertaking, but we'll keep you posted as we figure it out!\nWe've received a lot of messages about using Story War in schools, and kid-friendliness was an intentional goal of the project from really early on! Now that it's been successful beyond even our most ambitious guesses, we're going to pay some of that good fortune forward by giving away a hundred copies of Story War for use in classrooms!\nPlease spread the word and try to get your friends to back Story War and help us reach these stretch goals! We can't do it without your help!\nThe song in the video is \"Jetpack Blues, Sunset Hues\" by Anamanaguchi, used with permission. All the artwork was made by Vondell Swain.

Please help us continue to spread the word. \nAgain, Thank you for all our support !\nZombie Hunter is a full-length independent feature film. It started out as an idea to make a low-budget movie that we could get excited about, put our own personality into, and have an amazing time making. The idea grew and spread like a disease, bigger and sicker, and before we knew it we were watching a rough cut of the full movie. We are huge old school Gore, Horror, Spaghetti Western, and Action film fans. We love Zombies, Nasty Creatures, Muscle Cars, CGI, Special Effects, Awesome Music and Hot Chicks. Our goal was to incorporate this passion into one project: the bloody birth of a film that is Zombie Hunter.\nZombie Hunter is independently produced and funded. In the true spirit of Independent filmmaking, we had no problem throwing in our own money  and working for free\u2026Nothing like rolling the dice.. The good news is we made it through production, cut the rough edit, and got a trailer done. The hard part is over.\nZombie Hunter is set in a post-apocalyptic Zombie wasteland caused by the mysterious street drug \"Natas\".  We follow one man who has nothing left other than a beat up Camaro and a trunk full of guns and booze.  He runs down Flesh Eaters, hunting for sport and redemption, while also running from his past. After crashing into a small group of survivors, who are running low on resources, he decides to lend a hand. But a surprise attack by the Flesh Eaters forces them on the run and puts the Hunter\u2019s skills to the test.\nDanny Trejo (Father Jes\u00fas) The legend himself. From stabbing Vampires to slashing Zombies, Danny has done it all. In 2010 Danny became the face of Robert Rodriguez's Machete. Other works include Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn, Con Air,  etc.\nMartin Copping (The Hunter) Born in Australia, Martin made his way to the United States to jump start his career as an action star. Martin's most recent work includes playing side by side with Steven Seagal in the classic short film Sheep Impact and Forbidden Ground.\nClare Niederpruem (Alison) An up-and-coming beauty who knows how to work the camera (and a sawed-off shotgun). Clare is no stranger to action: you can see her mowing down orcs in Orc Wars, fighting evil wizards and dragons in Dragon Warriors, and getting her head chopped off in Orcs!  Most recent work also includes sucking blood in Vamp U.\nJade Regier (Fast Lane Debbie) Model and Actress. Jade has been featured in several high-end magazines, including Playboy. She loves to get chased by bloodthirsty Zombies... and she also loves to dance.\nHow Kickstarter Works: People pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $30,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $30,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of our film.\nOur Rewards: We're not looking for charity, we're looking for an alternate sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nDigital Download.

Chris needs a team to help mitigate the VFX work. We want our VFX to be the highest quality possible which is going to take a lot of work. Our music is already being scored, however there is still work to be done for the rest of post sound, dialogue, sound effects, and voiceovers. This isn't much and we are getting amazing deals but it does start to add up.

This is your movie.\nTo that end, we are raising funds for an R-rated theatrical comedy featuring Uncle Ruckus, to be produced this year. The movie will be written and directed by AARON MCGRUDER, and stars GARY ANTHONY WILLIAMS - who does the voice of Uncle Ruckus on the animated series. The story, which is currently being written,  will not involve any of the other regular BOONDOCKS characters, but rather explore a part of the Ruckus family not seen in the show.\nWHY LIVE ACTION?!\nFrom our PRODUCTION BLOG (Coming soon):\n\u201cThere\u2019s always been interest in a live-action Boondocks movie, which to me was out of the question considering Huey and Riley are essentially impossible to cast. The animated feature would cost around 20 million, but a live action Uncle Ruckus movie could cost a fraction of that. So just for the hell of it we had the costume made and it was pretty amazing. To see Gary actually transform into Uncle Ruckus... it\u2019s quite the surreal experience.  I never expected the transition to be so completely seamless.\u201d\n                                                                -Aaron McGruder\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nFirst, because SONY (who produces THE BOONDOCKS animated series) is not involved with this project in any way. In fact, there are no investors, corporate or otherwise, involved with the movie as of this moment. This whole thing is kind of an odd idea, so we're starting with Kickstarter on this one and we'll just see what happens.\nCrowd funding, however, is a big deal. It represents an entirely new relationship between fan and creator. It also represents a new financial model for making stuff, and that\u2019s exciting.\nUncle Ruckus has a lot of supporters out there. If they want this to happen, they can make it happen.\nLIKE A BIG ASS BAKE SALE!!\nLike any fundraiser, Kickstarter works by selling fans something they would actually want, and using that money to fund projects. If you're not into giving away money, you can think of it more like a purchase. With Kickstarter, if we don't reach our money goal in time, you don't get charged and basically nothing happens. If we do reach our financial goals, you get the stuff you paid for.\nIf this is your first exposure to Kickstarter, I know, it sounds crazy. But people keep telling me it works so I'm going with it.\nPRE ORDER THE DVD, KINDA!\nKickstarter allows donations from one dollar to ten thousand dollars. For most people, the best bet is our CLINT EASTWOOD rank (our reward levels are named after great white Americans). You'll receive a DVD of the movie when released on home video. There are music downloads, T-shirts, all types of Ruckus related goodies for those of you unafraid to publically express your support for such an awful human being.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe money we are raising represents partial funding for the film, so the first challenge is to raise the rest of the money. Obviously, if we exceed our fundraising goals, this may not be an issue, but this is the first hurdle we have to clear if this campaign is successful.\n\nAfter that, the project faces all of the normal challenges that go along with production - which are too numerous and unpredictable to delineate here. Movie-making is a messy, chaotic business. Delays caused by issues with collaborators, unforeseen additional filming, technical issues, actors getting arrested for something ridiculous - are all issues we've faced in the past and will likely continue to face. Backers will be kept up-to-date on progress through our production blog. If something goes terribly wrong, you'll be the first to know.\n\nIf for some reason we reach our Kickstarter goals, but still fail to actually get the movie off the ground, the following will happen:\n\nAll Bag O' Ruckus rewards will be fulfilled (mid 2013).\n\nAn Uncle Ruckus mockumentary UNCLE RUCKUS SAVES AMERICA will be produced in place of THE UNCLE RUCKUS MOVIE, allowing all of the rewards to remain unaffected.\n\nPlease back the Uncle Ruckus Movie. Then be very ashamed of yourself.\n\n - The Management\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Aaron McGruder\nFirst created \u00b7 1 backed\nAaron McGruder is the creator of THE BOONDOCKS comic strip and the Peabody Award winning animated series on Adult Swim.

Here's the answer in four pictures, showing 22 US Twenty-Dollar bills held by the small TacTiClip, first singly, and then, in the last picture, folded over -- 44 widths of currency being held smartly by the small TacTiClip!  And, that\u2019s not the upper limit. Thanks for the question :-)\nTwenty-two twenty-dollar bills fanned out in a small TacTiClip.\nFan closed.\nOutside of small TacTiClip shown with bills folded over.\nAll 22 bills folded over (44 widths of currency) and inserted into the small TacTiClip, and it's not yet at its upper limit!  And, this is the small TacTiClip.  Imagine what the large TacTiClip can hold!  The video below will give you some indication.  Hands down, in money-clip mode, the TacTiClip is hard to beat.  But, it's more than a money clip!\n\"Will it bend?\" How resilient is the TacTiClip under stress.  Watch the \"extreme\" demo below and find out :-)\nThe TacTiClip is unique among clips because its open and glyph-like continuous design allows it to elastically deform under stress and then recover to its original shape.  Because of this, we say the TacTiClip \"scales\" easily to meet a wide range of requirements, from minimalist substitute wallet for a night out on the town to a taking-care-of-business tool to help you get through your every day.\nProject Summary\nBecause of the TacTiClip's material and how it's designed, it can hold a wide range of thin materials of various shapes, in stacks of various depths, securely, and in an easily transportable manner.

We're percolating, and ideas are poppin' like firecrackers.  The TacTiClip is just the beginning of multiple lines of innovative products made of Titanium.  Here's a partial list of the things we need to buy or have access to (not for this project, but for the next level):\nMachines and machine time for the various steps in the manufacturing process.\nAnodizing capabilities and / or services to help TacTiClips scream cool.\nLaser capabilities and / or services to help personalize / brand TacTiClips for customers. \ne-Commerce enabled website.\nGraphic design to assist with e-Commerce website and marketing materials.\nChannel marketing services to help put TacTiClips in as many hands as possible.\nIntellectual Property attorney to protect same.\nSo, please consider pledging over and above your reward to help give us an extra \"kick\" in commercializing this endeavor.\nAll TacTiClip Backers are Backers as long as we're making TacTiClips :-) That means we appreciate you for helping us get \"kickstarted\" and want to return the favor by providing you a return on your investment so to speak.\nYou'll know before anyone else what's about to be released from the product pipeline on future projects, on or off KickStarter.  And, you may be invited to participate in new product releases in some cool manner.  This also means you're a preferred customer.  What, exactly, does that mean?  We haven't figured that out yet, but you'll smile when we do :-)\nThe KickStarter community will be invaluable in providing feedback on the design and application of the TacTiClip to improve its marketability and utility. And, we're looking for our backers to help drive people to this project, and then to our website after the project concludes.\nWe will not forget the Backers that help start and sustain our passion for design!\nOur intent, therefore, is to establish an ongoing relationship with KickStarter and our Backers, as the product and others in the TacTiClip product family evolve and emerge, and as other products are conceived and brought to market.\nName / Concept and Product Line\nTacTiClip -- What's in a name?\n\"Tac\" is for tactical or tactics,\n\"Ti\" is the symbol for Titanium:\nKnown as the \"space age metal\" and the \"metal of the gods\"  (Titanium was named after the \"Titans\" of Greek mythology.)\nAnd, the \"Clip\":\nAlthough the product appears to be just a clip, the possibilities are bounded only by your imagination.\nProduct Line\nCurrently, the TacTiClip product line consists of a large and small version.  We have more products in the pipeline.  Stay tuned. \nThe Design\nGood design is about getting \"outside the box.\"  When you're outside the box, you're in the open.  Open to possibilities.  This principle was applied in the design of the TacTiClip, with the result that the TacTiClip itself is open.\nThe open design of the TacTiClip frees the Titanium to express its inherent flexibility, pliability, and resistance to deformation under stress by allowing any stress to be spread through the length of the TacTiClip's glyph- or maze-like design.  This enables the TacTiClip to \"scale\" easily in accommodating one or many items within its grasp, and then return to its original very thin shape with no deformation to speak of.\nProduct Development Process (Pre-Production / Pre-Project Launch Phase)\nAlong with designing the TacTiClip, we had to engineer the entire product development process to determine the type and amount of material required to produce a certain amount of finished product in a certain amount of time with a certain level of quality.  This just a part of what's called \"Design to Manufacture.\"  Just because a design is brilliant, it's no guarantee the design is manufacturable at a reasonable cost, and sellable at a reasonable price.\nProduction / Manufacturing Plan (Post Launch / Pledging / Funded-Status Phases)\nAs the manufacturing process for TacTiClips has been \"wired\" with the support of our manufacturer, from configuring the machines to finishing, and performing the Quality Control steps in-between the machines, we are now ready to schedule production runs in accordance with demand.\nAfter launching the project, during the funding period, we will be monitoring the volume of pledges and rate of pledging closely.  Depending upon the level of pledging and the rewards selected, we will commit to the manufacturer (during late January) to more or less production runs (after achieving funded status) for the latter part of February.\nAs a control, we will modulate demand by capping existing rewards and pegging new rewards to April or beyond, as needed.  In other words, Backers that pledge early will, more than likely, get their TacTiClips in March, with subsequent Backers being able to expect delivery in April, or later, depending upon demand.\nThe bottom line here for our Backers is the manufacturing plan is very closely aligned to (1) the productive capacity of the manufacturer's machines to produce and finish TacTiClips, (2) the manufacturer's production schedule, (3) the timing of raw material delivery, and most importantly, (4) the commitment we are making to our Backers to deliver TacTiClips during specific months (March, or in April or beyond, as required).\nFulfillment Plan (Pledging / Funded-Status Phases)\nFulfillment starts before achieving funded status -- in anticipation of achieving funded status -- to ensure we can fulfill our Backer's pledge rewards as soon as possible.  This is in alignment with our manufacturing plan, where we are anticipating various \"scenarios\" we may have to adapt to, for which we are proactively laying the groundwork to be able to \"turn on a dime\" to make any and all adjustments that are necessary and sufficient to fulfill our Backers pledge rewards.\nThe whole point of the project is to put well designed and highly versatile Titanium clips into our Backers hands that are without manufacturing or finishing flaws and delivered in accordance with the month of delivery specified in the corresponding pledge reward.\nThat's our focus and everything about the project has been engineered with this in mind :-)\nConclusion and Request for Pledges and Support\nWith your pledges and support, we intend to create a new category of clip, a high-tech utilitarian tool with a sense of style that can directly support you in your daily life.\nIntellectual Property Notice\nTacTiClip and TacTiClips are trademarks of TacTiClip.com\nCopyright 2012 / 2013, TacTiClip.com, All Rights Reserved\nThank you very much for visiting our project web site!

We have a working relationship with a facility that has supported our prototype and pre-production development processes. We believe they have capacity to meet projected demand. If the demand for TacTiClips grows, order fulfillment may span a longer period. To mitigate this risk, we have identified overflow subs.\n\n3.To ensure timely delivery, we will minimize design changes or additional finishes. \n\n4. We are confident in obtaining raw materials in sufficient quantity as the manufacturer has established relationships with multiple sources of the raw Grade 5 Titanium sheet stock.

See below.\nAbout the book: Professor Oladel Adewole has lost tenure, and his much-younger sister has died. With no reason to stay, he leaves his homeland for the University of Eisenstadt.\nOne thing makes life there bearable: the island floating a mile above the city. No one's ever been there, nor knows how it got there. Every culture in the world tells stories about it, and Adewole specializes in them.\nWhen an inventor makes it there in her new autogyro, the government sends Adewole up with its first survey team. The expedition finds people, but Adewole finds a powerful, forbidden fusion of magic and metal: the Machine God.\nThe government wants it. So does a sociopath bent on ruling Eisenstadt. But when Adewole discovers who the Machine God is--and what it can do--he risks his life to protect it from the world, and the world from the Machine God.\nAbout the project: The Drifting Isle Chronicles is a collaborative series among four top independent fantasy writers: Charlotte E. English, Joseph Robert Lewis, Katherine Tomlinson and me. Each of us wrote novels set in a universe we created together. While the four books all interconnect (all contain cameos of characters from the other books), they each stand alone and can be read in any order:\nBlack Mercury, Charlotte E. English: A mysterious black substance catapults an inventor to the enigmatic island floating a mile above her city...\nThe Kaiser Affair, Joseph Robert Lewis: A husband-and-wife detective team race to stop a criminal mastermind from claiming the newly-reached Drifting Isle for himself...\nStarcaster, Katherine Tomlinson: A stranger's murder on a floating island is the harbinger of changes that will affect a restless young man and all he holds dear...\nThe Machine God, MeiLin Miranda: A grieving academic discovers the horrible truth behind the Drifting Isle's creation...\nThis is my first collaborative project, and it's been insanely fun. Joe Lewis put the group together and deserves the credit for keeping us all focused. We've made decisions by consensus, starting with the beginning when Joe sent out the first survey: what genre did we want to write in? We all submitted two ideas apiece, voted on our top two, and from there winnowed it down to steampunk magical fantasy. I've never wanted to write steampunk, but I'd decided I was going to go with the flow on this project and go outside my comfort zone.\nNext, we decided what elements to have in our story. Through the same process we decided on music magic, a floating island, a magical substance we dubbed ichor, talking birds, and a machine god. \"What the heck's a machine god?\" says I. \"I dunno,\" says Joe, \"but I sure like the sound of it!\" I really didn't, but not enough to fight the battle. I sighed and went along.\nWe knocked ideas around, until finally the group took stock of what we each specialized in. \"Does anyone write about mythology or religion?\" Foolishly I raised my virtual hand; myth and religion are major themes in my work. \"Great! Guess who gets to figure out what the Machine God is?\" *headdesk*\nThe joke was on me in more ways than one. I ended up not only figuring out what the Machine God was, but my book ended up named after it. I'm really excited about what I came up with, and it's all because I went with the flow.\nAbout the Kickstarter: This pre-sale will fund editorial, artistic and design work for The Machine God only. My team will mostly be familiar to those of you who've been with me in the past: editor Annetta \"Netta the Eddita\" Ribken; book designers 1889 Labs; and cover artist Elsa Kroese, a new artist for me but not to others in the group.\nThe backer prizes are pretty straightforward.\n$5 backers get the formatted ebook in three DRM-free versions: pdf, ebook and mobi. \n$10 backers get the above plus the ARC--the unformatted manuscript within 24 hours of my finishing it. I can guarantee this will be within 24 hours of this Kickstarter's end; the manuscript is in the \"release candidate\" phase right now.\n$25 backers get the above plus the other three ebooks in the series. The writers have graciously donated their books to this Kickstarter. Thanks, guys! \n$45 backers get the above plus the autographed paperback. International backers must add $12 extra for shipping. \n$75 backers get the above plus a pound of Jerian Blend coffee (the protagonist's drink of choice) from Portland's Cellar Door Coffee Roasters, plus palm sugar to sweeten it, goodies to eat with it and instructions on how to make it. Because importing food internationally is more than I want to get into, this prize is limited to the US only. Sorry, guys. \n$145 backers get everything in the $45 package plus naming rights to a minor character, with the proviso that the character will almost certainly have nothing to do with the person s/he's named for.\n$175 backers will get everything in the $75 package plus naming rights to a minor character, with the proviso that the character will almost certainly have nothing to do with the person s/he's named for. Again, because of the coffee this package is limited to the US only.\nStretch goals: If we get to $2,500, I will write a short story in the Drifting Isles universe, and I'll let Kickstarter backers choose who or what I write about (I'll provide some ideas to vote on as well). Obviously this will be after you all read the book. :) \nIf we get to $4,000, I will faint. And then I'll outright hire an audiobook narrator. All $45 and up backers will get the audiobook. I have to outright hire a narrator in order to do this; if I do a royalty split, I can't give you guys copies.

I guess I won't be signing (or selling) TMG Friday, because CreateSpace can't manage to print a simple graphic.\n\nThe wordmark--the book's title as it appears on the first page of the book--is a 400 dpi graphic. It's the same kind of graphic I've had in all three of my last CS books, nothing unusual about it. They can't seem to print it without pixelating it or feathering the edges, and they can't coherently tell me why. I've gotten conflicting reasons, conflicting reports as to which graphics--it's been one giant cluster-badword the whole three months I've been trying to resolve things. I have a book designer. We are not amateurs.\n\nI gave up and submitted the file with a font title page in place of the graphic, but it looks amateurish and it's not what I want. I can't get the books in time for the signing anyway, even if I pay ten times normal shipping for overnight (and eat my profit margin completely). The last straw was when I tried to give feedback and got a canned response reminding me to make sure my graphics were at least 300 dpi.\n\nEvery single time I've done a book with CS, it's something. Can't find my ISBN, messed up my cover, always something. Their front end people are great, but their back end can't find its back end with both hands. This time I encountered such incompetence that I'm moving my books to LSI. I'm just fed up. I'm sorry this is taking so long, guys.\n\nSpeaking of that reading: it's at here in Portland, Friday the 5th at 5 pm. I'm sharing the reading with the awesome Sara Mueller!

What a start!\nWelcome To The 8-Bit World!\nPiko Piko Detroit is a Netlabel and a collective of artists who love and embrace the 8-bit cultures: video games, chiptunes, pixel art, glitches, etc. We founded ourselves in late 2011 when we realized that there wasn't a lively community in the Midwest area for live shows and social community.\nIn one year, we have grown to a collective of over 30 local musicians and artists. And now we are reaching out to the Midwest region to expand our collective to explore new creative ideas for the future.\nOur goal is to help the internet based community inspire and make a difference to real people and societies. Not just online.\nWhy IRL? Why Detroit?\nWe heard that excuse many times--bad timing, bad economy, bad politics, bad tastes, and bad people in general. But, the truth is, most of us are dismissing our skillful passions as 'just hobbies' or conveniently 'things to do online'. And we see this as a major issue especially in the Detroit, Michigan where society is begging for change.\nWe see it differently.\nAs much as we love and support the DIY and Internet culture, we still believe that some things have to be done In Real Life to develop ideas and move emotions, here, where our life matters most!\nFlashback 2012\nOur first year has been super memorable. We've performed at home parties, cafes, bars, anime-cons, and even science festivals. Our audience ranged widely from adorable 5 year old girls dancing to our piko-sounds to curious elders asking us rather complex questions even we couldn't answer. Now we have 10 year old performer that jams on his LSDJ. This gives us true smiles that will live long in our hearts, and we don't want to stop.\nHere's a list of this year's highlights:\n12 Consecutive Monthly Open-Mic at Lab Cafe - Ann Arbor, MI\nChip Charged! Chiptune Show - Ann Arbor, MI\n8-Ball Saloon at Blind Pig - Ann Arbor, MI\nUniversity of Michigan - Ann Arbor, MI\n1-Day Mini GameStop Tour - Ann Arbor, Taylor, Ypsilanti, MI\nRelay For Life of Chesterfield 2011 - Chesterfield, MI\nPenguicon 2012 - Dearborn, MI\nInvitation to Wreck-It Ralph Premiere - Birmingham, MI\nDetroit Luvs Robots - Detroit, MI\nMaker Faire Detroit 2012 (w/Editor's Award!) - Detroit, MI\nYoumacon 2012 - Detroit, MI\nPiko Invades Canada - Windsor, CA\nAnd of course dozens of other shows that our local performers have been invited to throughout Michigan (Pontiac, Bay City, etc.), and neighboring states (Ohio, Virginia, Philadelphia, etc.).\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe believe our story can inspire and impact the world around us.\nOur community is driven by our passion, and our management members dedicate hours of their time to maintain a creative atmosphere and help support/promote our participating artists.\nWe do our best to keep our events free and open to the public. We select venues carefully to maintain a low budget while reaching out to as many people as we can. With the amazing support of our friends and families, it has been a very successful year! With the right mindset and a passion to evolve, even a hobby can change your life into something wonderful.\nToday, we wanted to share these experiences with you.\nSo... We Need Your Help!\nWith a successful funding, the PPD Netlabel will become the initiator and foundation of creative projects in the Midwest region. We will help provide travel and hospitality for our guest performers at events, and we'll expand our tours to a variety of conventions and festivals around the nation, where we will continue to spread our stories.\nTo make these dreams come true, we are currently building a team behind the Netlabel to help organize and expand our productions to larger scale projects and shows. Depending on your contribution, 2013 will become a life changing moment for every one involved in the Piko Piko Detroit community.\nThe Amazing Rewards\u2665\nWe will thank every backer of $8 or more with an 8-bit profile picture!\nGet a Kickstarter Edition PPD Shirt designed by Ohhinaifu!\nPPD Netlabel Releases (PPD-001 to 006)\nAll 2012 PPD Netlabel Releases signed by the artists + 1 brand new compilation album in physical packages!

This process will help improve our overall ethics of making things happen in real life. We may be a collective of passionate enthusiasts, but that does not mean we can't produce amazing art.\n\nThe risks are that since we are a new organisation, each step will be a challenge to bring new ideas into a fresh community. Reward Items will be designed by several local artists, so overall production will depend on their response time. We appreciate your patience and cooperation!\n\nFor the mini tour reward, we will do our best to schedule around the backer's request, however we cannot guarantee participating artists. The show is to be scheduled during 2013. Event details are negotiable.

After gaining powers at a very early age, Kerri Masters ran into one serious life event after another. She was enslaved by a maniacal villain, forced to help some of the world most heinous villains kill her live-in boyfriend rather than watch him destroy the world, and found herself alone and carrying a child who could well develop more power than both of his parents combined. Raising kids is already a herculean challenge. Raising a kid with enough power to crack planets is a whole new ballgame! After five years of retirement, Dynagirl has the urge and the opportunity to return to hero work, but should she?\nOverall Theme: At the heart of things Dynagirl is about how very real the whole hero game can come to be, and how our choices in life stay with us forever. Sure, she might stop a plane from crashing into the ocean, or save an old lady from crossing the street into oncoming traffic, but she\u2019s still got every day life, and her son, to deal with when she goes home at night. With this story we tackle things most comics never go anywhere near, and we do it because it's compelling and makes for a great comic.\nOur characters are regular normal people faced with incredible situations. Dynagirl is without a doubt a character driven story centering mainly on our main character, but also tossing several other very interesting and flawed individuals into the mix as her supporting cast.\nWhy It\u2019s Different: Dynagirl is so much more real. The art is stylized to portray people as they would actually look rather than the Barbie and Ken reality seen in most comics these days. People have weight, they have flaws, they look like real people look! The story is also a deep, and often fun take on the superhero genre. It's serious and smart without portraying the world around us as too dark or sinister. There will be villains, and many of them very terrifying, but in Dynagirl, there\u2019s always hope, and with hope you can do anything.  \nPraise for our previous work:\nJohn Barringer for acomicbookblog.com: \u201cThis story is thicker than molasses and issue #2 just increases the potential of some great story telling. Take a break from the mainstream and pick up this story.\u201d\npigs-of-the-industry.blogspot.com: \u201cOne of the best things about this comic is the way it handles its large cast of characters. It\u2019s easy to believe these heroes and villains have been fighting it out for a while now. You should check out this title and the other works from Red Handed Studios, it's worth it.\u201d\ninterestingfodder.typepad.com: \u201cThe imagery on this comic is just great.\u201d \nBill Gladman for Comicrelated.com: \u201canything but just \"another super-hero story\" Believable characters in a believable situation...makes you forget this is a super-hero story.\u201d \nSean Kleefeld kleefeldoncomics.blogspot.com: (About Dynagirl) \u201cHere's a comic that's purportedly one in a long-line of superhero comics. A genre in which women (at least the superheroines) are portrayed in precisely one way with variations being almost exclusively limited to hair color and/or style. But what I'm presented with is something which, for me, is not only unexpected but more appealing.\u201d\nHarold Edge nominated for Project Fanboy Best Independent Artist award in 2009 for his work on Fallen Justice. \nCary Kelley (Red Handed Studios)-Best Indie Publisher 2010 for Fallen Justice and Dynagirl.\nThe Creative Team: \nCreators- Cary Kelley and Harold Edge \nWriter - Cary Kelley \nArtist - Harold Edge (Sixgun Samurai, Fallen Justice, The Trouble With Love) \nColors \u2013 Lisa Moore, Paul John Little, Sarah Perryman, Ernest Jocson \nLetters \u2013 Cary Kelley \nWhy Kickstarter and What's the Plan: Dynagirl has always been intended to be an ongoing series, and we haven\u2019t changed that vision. What has changed has to do with life and economic situations, which now force us to reach out for alternative means of funding the work we love to produce. What we want to do now is take the story we have already completed and get it out there to as many people as possible in printed form, as well as fund the completion of the next chapter in her story. Our first focus will be to take the first six issues of Dynagirl and put them into one complete volume, including a ton of sketchbook and behind the scenes stuff. We will use collected funds for printing costs, promotional purposes for getting the word out, and to produce and ship all backer rewards. Anything beyond our funding goal will go directly to producing the next Dynagirl book.   \nThe music for our video, (used with permission!) comes from pretty much the coolest band in the whole  world!

It is being made on a sensible budget with a tremendous crew, very experienced in making original feature films.\nThey uncover a global conspiracy, which they must find the strength to fight before civilization is destroyed.\nConcept art by Ben Oliver. All Rights Reserved.\nThis film is epic and deals with themes of universal appeal, such as identity and self-discovery (who we are and where we fit in the world), loyalty, trust and abuse of power. This is one of the most ambitious British films ever to appear on Kickstarter. We have an exciting page-turner of a screenplay, a highly talented crew and a very grounded business plan, forged through strong working relationships with industry professionals we have built up over many years. We believe that we are bringing something fresh and exciting to the big screen that has real potential to become a break-out success.\nWe have experience of making major feature films, and last year wrote and produced PANIC BUTTON which was described as the 'Best British Horror in Years' by Aint It Cool News. Our favourite quote of the moment is \u201cDoes for the internet what Jaws did for swimming in the sea\u201d from our local film board, Film Agency Wales.\nThe funds we raise on Kickstarter will complete our development finance and allow us to take our business offer out to film financiers, complete with cast and sales projections. In a similar approach to IRON SKY we want to build and involve our audience from the very beginning. With no audience, there seems little point in making a film, we believe in putting the audience first.\nWe have world sales and UK theatrical distribution offers in place already, and there are some very exciting cast members coming forward as we gather momentum.\n  PANIC BUTTON OST \nWRITER/DIRECTOR/PRODUCER \u2013 John Shackleton (PANIC BUTTON) \nPRODUCER \u2013 Gareth I.

There\u2019s no escaping the fact that filmmaking is an expensive business! As soon as we hit the Kickstarter \u00a3100,000 target, we will be in a position to approach film financiers for the remaining budget (currently estimated at \u00a33m).\n\nIt is fair to point out that it is possible that we may become delayed in this process, for a multitude of unforeseen circumstances beyond our control and despite our best endeavours. You should take assurance from the fact that we know how to make a film happen as we did with PANIC BUTTON. The key to success is always momentum, driving the vision forward and finding solutions to all issues that are thrown our way. Without this resilience and resourcefulness, we would never have come so far already.\n \nThe Kickstarter community should know that whatever we plan, and whatever obstacles are thrown in our path, we are focussed on our goals and passionate in honouring our commitment to our pledges to you. The more support we have \u2013 the stronger and more determined we become to make this happen, it really is that simple.\n \nWe believe in clear and worthwhile communications, so whilst we might not be bugging you every five minutes with updates, you will always be the first to know when we have some exciting news, and if we have to make any changes of direction, you will be kept fully informed also.\n \nWe cannot make a firm guarantee to you that after a successful \u00a3100k raise, we will 100% be able to secure the full estimated \u00a33m budget. What we can guarantee however, is that as soon as we raise significant funds to make the film, we will do exactly that, cutting our cloth accordingly, without compromising the vision for the film in any way. Necessity is the mother of all invention, not money. As a team we create, we find solutions and we deliver on our promises. Our business depends on it!\n \nEmbarking upon this journey with us will be a unique, exciting and rewarding experience on many levels, that much we do guarantee.
