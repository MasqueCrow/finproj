They live independent or in small groups near mountain slopes and prefer to hunt at night. \n Models will be delivered via kickstarter messages as digital STL files. We test every model before delivery. Pre-supported versions will be included to the archive.   \nCredits\nWe would like to thank all people, who helped us during creation process and provided us with useful information about the results of test prints. Also we specially want to thank those, who gave us examples of painted miniatures.\nAnimation in trailer was made using Unreal Engine 4 specially for \"The Mines\" series.

So do we. War Games was very fortunate to have partnered with the incredibly talented Justin Redmond of Red Revolt Design for this project, and we couldn't be happier with the way everything turned out. Check out the rest of Justin's work HERE \n\nKicking Tables interview with OMG Nexus and our CEO, Justin Burgess\nBoard's Eye View \n\"If you're looking for a fast, fun push-your-luck game with enough atmosphere to keep you argh-ing throughout its 30 minutes or so playing time, then Rolling Plunder is the treasure you've been craving. And tho', with dice rolling and card flipping, there's inevitably a high luck factor, there are enough opportunities for the calculating captain to play the odds.\"\n\n The Friendly Boardgamer- \n\"Rolling Plunder is a small box card and dice game with straightforward rules that are easy to understand. Players start off with a small, basic ship that improves as the game goes on. Your ship stats determine how many re-rolls you get when pursuing the other ship. I really like the re-roll mechanism and it adds tension and a hint of push your luck when trying attempting to hunt down or defeat another ship. The higher your sail or cannon value the more re-rolls you get.\"\n\nNRN Gaming- \n\"Players can have a lot of fun trying to fight for ships that outclass them. If a player picks up a R.M.S. ship early in the game, going on offense pays off. You can also slowly build up your power while getting a complimentary crew, which seems to be the best \u201csafe\u201d strategy. \u201cZerg Rush\u201d and defense are present, but less applicable in this game, thus Rolling Plunder earns a strong 7.5 strategy score.\"\n\nSolitaire Times-\n\"The game takes place in the 18th century, and the goal is to upgrade your ship to a galleon and then earn more points than your opponents. In the solo mode, you win if you manage to upgrade your ship within 7 turns. After you shuffle the Crew, Ship, and Plunder decks, you place six Crew cards in the middle, face up. You begin with a hand of 2 Plunder cards, one sailor card as your starting crew, and a schooner as your starting ship.\"\n\nWV Gamers-\n\"I really like the concept and the overall straightforward mechanics of the game. Who doesn't like a fun dice chucking pirate game where you are hunting ships, building up your ship and crew, and taking on the Royal Navy.\"\n\n Game Enthus \n Aspie Gamer Girl \nClick here for a downloadable version of the rules!\nCrowdfunding Innovation \nStretch Goals\nOnce our first stretch goal is reached we'll open the next two levels, and our backers will get to chose which option they want to pursue. During the campaign each new level reached will unlock additional choices, all determined by YOU. The first is a custom 1st player marker with the Rolling Plunder and doubloon logo for marking turn order! \nGameplay and Strategy\nRolling Plunder is a mechanically distinct game with a unique combat system. While your ship card's stats are used as the base, it avoids the \"numbers win\" problem of many games that causes an early lead to become a game-winning snowball effect. The dice rolling combat is balanced by the custom die faces, ships' attack and speed stats, and the interaction of Crew and Plunder cards so that players always have the chance to win a fight but a hard-earned advantage still means something.\nThere is also a social element that allows players to play each other as well as the game. Buy plunder from each other, trade captured ships for their Victory Points, form temporary alliances or truces... you can even save an enemy from an impending mutiny! Provided the price is right, of course.\nMany cards have multiple uses and can be saved for defense or used to aggressively pursue a lead. Crew members provide set benefits every turn, or they can be sacrificed for a greater bonus at a key moment. \"Unique Crew\" members are stronger and more valuable, but each pirate can only have one at a time on his or her ship. The Unique Crew you choose can substantially change your play style or which risks you're willing to take. Just choose wisely, or your opponents will overtake you. In the end, only one pirate can become the greatest on the high seas.\nMore product information can be found @ WarGamesLLC.com\n\n\n\nOUR TEAM (drawn by our kick-ass artist Justin Redmond) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith COVID-19 still sweeping the globe, the War Games team debated for a long time about whether or not to go live, and ultimately decided that this crisis wasn't going to beat us. However with a lot of people tightening their belts and wallets until the crisis is over, we were risking a failed campaign. So we decided that in addition to running the Kickstarter, we're going to give the digital game away for FREE to anyone who backs us, and they'll get the game immediately. So not only will backers be supporting a veteran-owned small business, but they will get the chance to play Rolling Plunder as soon as they join our campaign.\n\nEven if we fail, we will have provided our game to the public and hopefully brought just a little bit of joy to their lives in tough times.\n\nAs for the product and campaign itself, Rolling Plunder will be our 4th Kickstarter and we will be applying the lessons learned from our past 3 successful projects (FUBAR, Blue Falcon, and WTF, Over?) to ensure Rolling Plunder goes above and beyond the high expectations we've already set with our previously satisfied backers.\n\nCreatively, there is also the possibility that the pirate theme is not unique enough to keep interest in our concept.

You will receive the pieces in \"clean\" STL files, in STL files with the supports, and the Chitubox file in case you want to modify any of the supports.\n\n\n\nMEGATERIO (Megatherium americanum) - The Megaterio was a giant ground sloth that could measure up to 6 meters and weigh 5 tons. Standing on its hind legs reaching, the branches high of the trees and feending on fruits and leaves. They were originally from South America. During Great American Biological Interchange (G.A.B.I.) some species migrated to North America shortly before their extinction eight thousand years ago.\nDOEDICURO (Doedicurus clavicaudatus) - The Doedicuro was a great armadillo, 4 meters long, weighing 3 tons, belonging to the Glyptodonts group. It was a South American herbivorous slow. The current armadillos have an articulated carapace.Glyptodonts had rigid carapace. Its shell made it impregnable it also had a long tail provided by large spikes that served as an excellent defensive weapon.\nFORORRACO (Phorusrhacos longissimus) - The Foorracos were giant birds belonging to the group of the so-called terror birds. They measured 2.5 meters and weighed 200 kg. They lived from 15 million years ago until their extinction approximately one million years ago. They inhabited Patagonia and were without a doubt the super-predators of those times. Their reign probably ended when saber-toothed cats from the northern hemisphere arrived in their territories.\nGONFOTERIO (Stegomastodon platensis) - The Gonfoterios was proboscides extinct relatives of the present elephants. They are originating about 12 million years ago in the northern hemisphere and arriving in South America during the G.A.B.I. 1 million years ago, becoming extinct about eight thousand years ago.\nSABER TOOTH (Smilodon populator) - Smilodon populator was the species most powerful of saber-toothed cats. They belonged to the extinct subfamily Machairodontinae, distantly related to current felines. They were originally from the northern hemisphere.From the formation of the Isthmus of Panama, colonized South America approximately 2 million years ago. Their distinguishing feature was their long upper canines. Laterally compressed like daggers would have been very effective in penetrating the tough skin of the large herbivore mammals of the ice age. These characteristics, although, effective would make them quite fragile, so the bite had to be very precise and do when the prey was immobile enough not to expose the teeth to possible breakage.\nTOXODON (Toxodon platensis) - Toxodon platensis was a species belonging to the extinct order Notongulata. Exclusive to South America, Toxodon platensis originated during the Eocene 27 million years ago. It had two large rodent-like curved incisors and lower incisors arranged horizontally like a spatula, which allowed it to feed on tough grasses and shrubs. They became extinct about 10,000 years ago.\nMACRAUQUENIA (Macrauchenia patachonica)- Macrauchenia was a large native South American mammals long-necked, and long-limbed, of three-toed of the disappeared order Litopterna. In life, Macrauchenia may have resembled a humpless camel, nevertheless like other, litopterns it is most closely related to the odd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla), horses, donkeys, zebras, etc. The oldest fossils in the genus date to the late Miocene, around seven million years ago, and M. patachonica disappears at the end Pleistocene around 10,000 years ago. Charles Darwin discovered one specimen during the voyage of the Beagle. It fed on plants in a variety of environments across what is now South America.\nMARSUPIAL SABER-TOOTH (Thylacosmilus atrox) Thylacosmilus atrox was a highly specialized carnivorous Marsupial species. It was the size of a modern mountain lion.Its large 15 cm long canines sat on a bony cheek present on the lower jaw when the mouth was closed. It was a South American super predator that reigned during the Miocene 7 million years ago until the saber-toothed cats arrived from the northern hemisphere, causing the extinction of these, incredible marsupials 2 million years ago.\n\n The first stretching goal was unlocked.\nENTELODON (Entelodon sp.) - They are known as: \"hell pigs\" were a group of extinct mammals related to modern artiodactyls (pigs, deer, sheep, etc.). They were the size of a large bull. They had formidable teeth with which they could hunt. They stayed marks from their teeth on the skulls of large Oligocene herbivores thirty million years ago. They dominated the plains of the northern hemisphere until their extinction 5 million years ago.\n The second stretching goal was unlocked.\nINDRICOTHERIUM (Paraceratherium orgosense) It was the largest terrestrial mammal that ever existed. It reached 8 meters in height and weighed 15 tons. It was a relative of the Rhinos although, its conformation resembled a giant giraffe. It lived in southwestern China during the Oligocene 30 million years ago. Due to the dramatic climate change caused by the formation of the Himalayas, it became extinct during Miocene 16 million years ago.\n\n Special offer:\nYou can purchase STL files of the stretch goals (a maximum of 5), increasing your contribution by 3 US$ for each STL file chosen. \nMake your contribution before the end of the campaign.\nEnsure the acquisition of your STL files of choice and also help with your support to unlocking stretch goals more. \nIf you participate in this special offer at the end of the campaign, you will get:\n- STL files of the core set. \n- Stretch Goals unlocked. \n- Additional files your choice and according to your contribution.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThey are digital files, so the risk does not exist.

Clash of Deck is a card game which has been played and tested by hundreds of players throughout its first year of existence, as a French version. The game was published in 2020 in an atypical form: cards you cut yourself from a folded sheet of cardboard. A new standalone expansion was published each month. \nToday, thanks to the feedback and support of its community of players, Clash of Deck takes off with a new edition, available in English.

We recommend the Draft format for your first plays. Each turn, the players draft cards from a common deck to build themselves an efficient deck. For the Draft format, you only need one copy of the Starter Kit. The Constructed format is destined for experts who've mastered the game's mechanisms and the synergies brought by special abilities. Players build their own decks by choosing 10 cards among all the cards from the game. Their opponent will banish two of those cards at the beginning of the game, to form the final 8-cards deck. For the Constructed format, each player must have a copy of the Starter Kit.\nEach player receives a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card. \nPlace the 2 \u201cBridge\u201d cards in the play area. \nShuffle all the other cards into a draw pile. \nThen, reveal the top 4 cards of the draw pile. First, player A chooses 1 of the 4 available cards. Then, player B chooses 2 of the 3 remaining cards. Finally, player A takes the last remaining card. Repeat the operation, but this time, player B chooses the first card. Repeat until each player has 8 cards. Each player shuffles their cards, constituting their hand. They then place their \u201cWatchtower\u201d card in the leftmost place in their hand.\nThe player who crossed a bridge last becomes the first player. For their first turn, they begin the game with only 6 Mana.\nPlayers play their turn one after another. A turn consists of 3 phases:\nPhase 1 \u2013 Mana Regeneration:\nThe player gains as much Mana as the number of cards in their hand (including the \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d card). Mana is used to pay cards costs. The player can use it during phase 2.\nPhase 2 \u2013 Summoning:\nThe player can spend the Mana gained during phase 1 to play cards from their hand. A player can only play the 4 leftmost cards in their hand (ignoring the \u201cWatchtower / Stronghold\u201d card). \nA card\u2019s Mana cost is indicated in their upper left corner. Mana that isn\u2019t spent during a turn is lost. A player cannot spend more Mana than they gained during their previous phase 1. The play area consists of two lanes. When playing a card, the player chooses in which lane to place it. \nPlayers only summon units in their respective Realm: player A places their card on the left of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards and player B places their cards on the right of the \u201cBridge\u201d cards. There is no limit to the number of cards in a lane. A summoned unit is placed from the player\u2019s hand in the play area, face up, in the lane of their choice, behind their other units already in play. The card remains in play as long as it isn\u2019t destroyed.\nPhase 3 \u2013 Assault:\nA unit has Health Points (HP), and an Attack Value (ATK). A unit cannot attack the turn it enters play. Each unit a player controls inflicts their ATK value to an opposing unit. Units automatically activate in a predetermined order: first the upper lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d; then, the lower lane, from the unit further away from to the unit closest to the \u201cBridge\u201d. \nWhen a unit suffers at least as much damage as its HP value, the unit is destroyed. It suffers the entirety of the damage caused by the attack and the card returns to its owner\u2019s hand, in the rightmost place.\nThen, move all the units on the lane closer to the \u201cBridge\u201d so they fill the gap. Units regenerate their HP at the end of the turn. During an assault, a unit inflicts its ATK value to the closest opposing unit on the same lane. If no opposing unit can be attacked, the unit then inflicts its damage directly to the opponent\u2019s \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d.\nWhen a \u201cWatchtower/Stronghold\u201d suffers damage, shift it that many places to the right in the player\u2019s hand. \nWhen a \u201cWatchtower\u201d reaches the rightmost place in a player hand, it is destroyed: flip it to its \u201cStronghold\u201d side and return it to the leftmost place in the player\u2019s hand. Excess damage inflicted to the \u201cWatchtower\u201d does not carry over to the \u201cStronghold\u201d. When a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand, that player loses the game.\nEnd of the game\nThe game ends as soon as a \u201cStronghold\u201d card reaches the rightmost place in a player\u2019s hand. Their opponent then wins the game.\nThe Solo Mode allows you to play Clash of Deck alone, through a Quick play or a Custom play.  Before playing custom games, we recommend you practice with a few Quick games to learn and discover the rules and the peculiarities of Clash of Deck\u2019s solo mode. Fine-tune the AI difficulty level and try to reach level 5!  \nThe games will be sent from France in an envelope with an inside bubble wrap sheet for extra protection.

In another crazy project!\n\nYes, this time the project is really peculiar!\nIn our family we have 4 nieces and of course they are super in love with princesses, and various fairy tales, that they make us read or see on repeat!\n\nAt a certain point we asked ourselves what would happen if the princesses weren't so sweet and cute anymore, but they would get angry and go crazy?\n\nAnd here is the result!\n\nIn addotion we discovered that the classic fairy tales, the original ones, are anything but cheerful, they are dark and disturbing!\nAnother good reason for our girls to go crazy!\n\nBy now 3D miniatures are an established reality.\nWhen in 2017 we launched the first kickstarter with this formula many called us heretics, avant-gardists and dreamers.\n\nToday, just 4 years later, it is a widespread market and a reality that is increasingly entering people's homes.\n\nAnd we are proud to have been the forerunners of this new technology and therefore also on this occasion we offer our sculptures in stl version ready for your 3D printer!\n\nPLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\n\nAll models have been presupported (where necessary)\nSeveral printing tests have been carried out to get the Best result possible, and we hope that you will also get an optimal result with your printers.\n\ncross lances is committed, as always, to solving any problem you may encounter in printing, fixing the files and creating together with you an ever-improving product.\nAlso this project has many sculptures and many varieties: we thought to satisfy as many people as possible: from collectors who love to print their miniature in resin and paint it, from fantasy football players who in recent years have often supported us, and also to those who are dedicated to filament printing and love scenery and decorative elements.\n\nSo let's go to present all our sculptures!\n\nThe first set is about Alice's fantastic adventure in Wonderland!\n\nWe decided to accompany it with three classic characters: cheshire cat , queen of hearts and mad hatter.\n\n\nHere we introduce a new famous fairy tale: Beauty and the Beast.\nIt seems that its origin is inspired by an event that really happened in Italy, in Viterbo in 1550.\nBut then various versions have followed in history.\n\n\nSleeping Beauty is another classic fairy tale that has been passed down through time and come down to us.\nWe have documented a bit on the history of this fairy tale, and the first versions are anything but cheerful, indeed they are very disturbing and not suitable for children, if you are curious I recommend you to document and you will be amazed, and perhaps horrified\n\n\n\nLittle Red Riding Hood\n\nIt's not a princess, no that's true, but it's perhaps the most famous fairy tale of all!\n\nThis story also underwent several changes in the story going to cut very bad scenes and inserting a happy ending.\nIn the past the stories didn't end very well I would say....\nFrom what we have been able to learn, this is the oldest fable that we are going to discuss.\nIt seems in fact that the origins date back even to the Egyptians, and over three hundred versions have been made in history.\nTraveling around the world has collected variants from China, Persia, Russia, England and who knows how many others up to the present day.\n\nAnother traditional fairy tale.\nThis time the origins are Danish and we can say that it has more recent origins, in fact it was published for the first time in 1837.\nBut even here the story is a little different from what we remember, and the ending is rather sad.\n\nThis story has also undergone numerous variations over time and has traveled throughout Europe, there are many ways in which the prince becomes human again.\n\nThe most famous is surely, as often happens, the one created by the Grimm brothers.\n\n\nRapunzel is another classic in the history of fairy tales.\nThe myth of the maiden locked in the tower has its origins in ancient Greece with the mythological figure of Danae.\nBut it seems that the true origins of the story come from Italy from a racocnto of 1634.\nAlso here multiple versions and variations, some more alelgre, others decidedly less happy.\n\nAnd here's the prince!\nYes, because in every good fairy tale there is a prince!\nBut we wanted to interpret him in a nice way:\nGoing to know more about the classic fairy tales and how they have evolved in history we discovered that these princes were often not so beautiful, good and kind.\nSo we imagined that the princesses got in the way of the prince in revenge for his misdeeds, and he was put to \"work\".\n\nHoping this is nice and doesn't offend anyone!\n\n\nWe decided to dedicate a small area also to lovers of scenic and filament printing.\n\nWe created this castle, partly modular, in fact you can freely assemble the pieces in order to create the composition you prefer.\n\nThe castle is in fact composed of 16 elements!\n\ninspired by the most famous fairy-tale castles in northern Europe.\n\n\n\nWe said we would make a small dedication to our Fantasy Football supporters as well and here it is!\n\nSculpting the seven dwarves from Snow White we realized that a team of dwarves with this design would be beautiful!\n\nDuring our kickstarters we are used to unlock many add-ons.\nWe generally ask our backers what they would like to see within the campaign and try to make it happen.\nUsually we get a lot of suggestions and not all of them can be realized, but we will try our best this time!\n\nIn addition we have already preset some small goals that will be unlocked as the campaign progresses!\n\n\nfirst add-on unlocked!\n\nPumpkin carriage.\nMaybe it would have been better on halloween but we liked carving it anyway.\n\nInside we left it open for those who wish to turn it into a lamp.\n\nThis time it's Sissi's turn, when we talk about princesses, we can't help but think of her, even if she doesn't belong to a traditional fairy tale but is a historical character who really existed.\n\nHere is our interpretation of Princess Sissi!\n\nAnother add-on unlocked!\n100 backers.\nAwesome!\n\nHere is the dice throwing tower!\n\nThanks again, this add-on has also been unlocked.\n\nthis time it's up to another character from the famous novel \"alice in wonderland\".\n\nHere is the white rabbit!\n\nWe went to sculpt another of the most famous princesses: the princess on a pea!\n\nWe have made another of the most famous fairy tales in the world: the three little pigs!\n\nOkay, they're not exactly princely, but we think they might like it! \nAlso this time we have moved away from the world of princesses, but it is a fairy tale that is very close to our heart, from the tales of Collodi here is Pinocchio and the Turquoise Fairy!\n\nWe promised more surprises for fantasy football lovers and here it is!\n\nA whole new team made of many little pinocchios.\nWe really liked the pinocchio sculpture so much that we decided to make a whole team.\nWith the addition of a fire-eater!\nWe hope you like it too!\nWhat would a fairy tale be without a dragon?\nAnd finally here it is for you, all our princesses (but not only) without weapons.\nDuring the campaign at the same time we will release three more miniatures related to the project.\nYou can find them on our patreon and make them yours with only 1 euro!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/crosslances\nSo don't miss this funny scene of Hansel and Gretel cooking the witch!\nThe roles are reversed!\nThese miniatures are not available on the kickstarter!\nWe would also like to point out our \"Print and Paint\"

This fourth Cotta's almanac playing cards deck was originally published in 1809. There is no known evidence of any deck issued in 1808, and so this red almanac issued in 1809 is considered to be the fourth in a series.\nCourt card figures depict Arabs in various costumes, which could have been taken from sources of the seven climes (Persia, China/Turkestan, Khw\u00e2razm, Slavonia, North Africa, Byzantium, and India), which as well adds another historical value to its rarity. \nAdditionally to the series of Cotta's almanac decks, all influenced by notable authors, this one might also draw on aspects from another Schiller's work - especially the translation and his intriguing epic symbolic adaptation of Turandot, the famous commedia dell'arte (Italian comedy) play by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762 after and originated in supposedly Persian story of Calaf's adventure in the theme of the Arabic and Persian tales from the collection (Thousand and One Day) Les Mille et un jours (1710\u20131712) by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix.   \nThe artwork also may have been inspired by the Arab population that migrated to Germany or even studied in T\u00fcbingen where the Cotta's publishing house was founded. But mostly there was a friendship between Schiller, Goethe, Cotta, and Gozzi, who died in 1806, a year after Schiller in 1805, what might have been the true impulse.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed (Linen) Finish \n52 Cards + 2 Extra 17th-century Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible 16th-century Art Cards \nMetallic Ink On Box & Card Backs (Both Versions of Tucks and Card Backs inside) \nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series (Inking Vary by Tuck Version) \nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nAfter the success of the first blue 1805, the second green 1806, and the third yellow 1807 Cotta's almanac decks, again we come with two versions of the fourth red 1809 Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\".\nAs campaigns before, we are limiting this 4th \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered). Both versions will include the same gold metallic inked card back design inside of the tuck box.\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks...\nThat's why the entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand as a \"collection of historical books\" with their mysteries and secrets hidden inside up to your findings...\nSeries of decks will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck \"book\" spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born.\nPuzzle Spine Image \"Digital Demonstration\" to present Ink Combinations of Both Tuck Versions\nIf you are interested in more information about historical details with a profound and beautiful story behind Cotta's Almanac playing cards creation and idea, or about the famous and noble people connected to these unique transformation playing card decks, you can find reading after scrolling down this project page.\nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers' work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink. \nInking and Tuck Design Inspired by Old Books\nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\nMuch of historical happenings, influences, and activities would find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves...\n4th almanac deck: \"Arabic Turandot\" (Year 1809) \nAfter the first blue deck themed on Joan of Arc play by Schiller, the second green deck themed on Jean Racine's plays, which were translated into the German language by Schiller, and the third yellow deck themed on Wallenstein, here in the fourth red deck, again the images on the court cards might be the characters somehow connected to another Schiller's translational work (1801), the Turandot by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762, and so those Arabs displayed on court cards might be deeply inspired by Schiller's reverse thinking about the Turandot tale's true origin, as up to the present day, this play in its variety of settlements is considered as an enigma since original ideas were mostly filtered through many versions and their translated adaptations around the world over time.\n\"Nizami Ganjavi\" Jamal ad-D\u012bn Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad Ily\u0101s ibn-Y\u016bsuf ibn-Zakk\u012b is considered the greatest romantic epic poet in Persian literature, who brought a colloquial and realistic style to the epic.\nCourt card figures depict Arabs in various costumes, which could have been taken from sources of the seven climes (Persia, China/Turkestan, Khw\u00e2razm, Slavonia, North Africa, Byzantium, and India), which adds another historical value to its rarity. These seven climes may stretch back into the old stories, which are eventually also linked as a source idea for Turandot anecdote - Persian masterpiece Seven Beauties, by the Persian \"wisdom\" poet Nezami (died 1209) who recounts the romantic history of the pre-Islamic Persian king Bahram. The story of his journey from \"black to white\" also refers to Bahram\u2019s spiritual development from darkness and ignorance to light and illumination, uniting himself with the source of light. He grows to a Perfect Man and an ideal king.\nThe plot of this story is very complex but significantly filled with mathematical, astronomical, cosmogonic, medical, spiritual, and mystical symbolism, which is surely interesting background for playing cards and their purposely hidden deep meanings...\nAnd why Arabs? Turandot = Turan's daughter \n(The name derives from the Persian compound name Turan and dokht, meaning the daughter of Turan. Dokht is a shortened form of dokhtar or \"daughter\", \"girl\". As Persian belongs to the Indo-European family of languages, the word dokhtar has cognates in European languages. Turan refers to the northeastern borders of Persia. Turandot recounts the story of a Turkestan/Chinese princess who kills her suitors when they fail to decipher riddles.)\nAdditionally to the series of Cotta's almanac decks, all influenced by notable authors and works, it is more than likely, just by continuing pattern, that even this 4th red deck might also draw on aspects from another Schiller's work - especially as mentioned above, the Schiller's translation and his intriguing epic symbolic adaptation of Turandot, the famous commedia dell'arte (Italian comedy) play by Count Carlo Gozzi from 1762 after and originated in supposedly Persian story of Calaf's adventure in the theme of the Arabic and Persian tales from the collection (Thousand and One Day) Les Mille et un jours (1710\u20131712) translated from Persian original by Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9tis de la Croix.\nCount Carlo Gozzi (13 December 1720 \u2013 4 April 1806)\nThere is also evidence of the first theatre premiere of Schiller's adaptation of Turandot in 1802, specifically at the \"old\" Weimar Hoftheater by Johann von Goethe, who had been the theatre's director since its inception in 1791. Schiller had begun a collaborative friendship with Goethe in 1794 which lasted until Schiller's death in 1805, after which Goethe forsook ballads and turned to the completion of Part one of Faust, as well as the Cotta's almanac deck series, started in 1805, marked and influenced by these significant occurrences, and then even Gozzi's death came about a year after in 1806, and this deck's theme might be the tribute to Gozzi.\n(If you are interested in more info about Schiller, Goethe, and Cotta's relation to this series of Cotta's decks, you might scroll down to read in the part of \"Story About\".)\n\"R\u00e9ba Roi Arabe\" (Lettered on King of Spades Court Card)\nIt's not all just about Schiller's famous works...\nAs the first blue and the second green and the third yellow deck before, also this fourth red deck was threaded by majestic and noble roots... Besides the noble publisher of the deck, Johann Friedrich Cotta, again there was another person involved in the graphical part of this deck creation.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta (April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832)\nFor the fourth time, again, cards were designed and stipple engraved by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824).\nProbably, she was creating illustrations for decks in Stuttgart as detected from letter communication addressed to her mother in Britain that contained writings about the Cotta's decks... Her mother was Lady Diana Beauclerk (n\u00e9e Lady Diana Spencer; other married names Diana St John, Viscountess Bolingbroke; 24 March 1734 \u2013 1 August 1808). Also, there in those letters is a mention about her mother's health failing what later resulted in a fatality, which probably might have been the main reason for the missing Cotta's almanac deck right for the year 1808 of the series. \nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs.\nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nAces\nSpades\nDiamonds\nClubs\nHearts\nIn contrast to previous Cotta's decks' issues where the court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King, here the court cards of this 4th issue, Jack and Queen are not described, only King is described as \"Roi\".\nAmong all courts, the only single named figure of King R\u00e9ba, the Midianite King of East, is represented as the King of Spades.\nJack of Spades - African\nQueen of Spades - Noblewoman \nKing of Spades - King Reba*\n*Reba was one of five Midianite kings (E\u02b9vi, Re\u02b9kem, Zur, Hur, and Re\u02b9ba) killed during the time of Moses by an Israelite expedition led by Phinehas, who was the grandson of Aaron (the elder brother of Moses) and the son of priest Eleazar (nephew of Moses), according to Numbers 31:8 and Joshua 13:21.\nJack of Hearts - Merchant \nQueen of Hearts - Noblewoman in ordinary home dress \nKing of Hearts - Regalia Nobleman\nJack of Clubs - Ordinary man \nQueen of Clubs - Countrywoman \nKing of Clubs - African\nJack of Diamonds - Infantryman \nQueen of Diamonds - Maiden in summer dress \nKing of Diamonds - Nobleman\nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created most of the Cotta's decks...\nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided)\nEARLY BIRD:\n\"RED\" #4 Cotta's Almanac Deck Rewards: \nCOMBINATION of previous STANDARD Cotta's Decks with actual \"RED\" #4 STANDARD Deck: \nDid you miss some of the previous decks? \nYou can add some decks to your original tier pledges with no extra shipping costs. \nStandard version of the decks are $10 each and limited version are $12 each.\nPlease note Limited #1 is not available at this time.\nYou will also have the option to add-on after the campaign and add additional items such as uncuts and other items based on availability.\nClick on manage your pledge and add bonus support for the desired amount; for example, if you would like to add 1 limited and 1 standard version of a deck you would add $22 to additional support.

You will also have the option to add-on after the campaign.\nMarch 19th, 2021 - April 4th, 2021\nSince this 4th deck's theme might be mostly inspired by the work of Count Carlo Gozzi, Schiller's translational work on Gozzi's Turandot, and even their friendship behind, this 4th deck might have been issued as a tribute to Gozzi, who died on April 4th, 1806, a year after Schiller, so we set symbolically end date of this 4th Cotta's deck project just to this memorial event...\nCharming beginning of \"Karten Almanach\" series\nThe story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany.\nThe idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks...\nThe color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\nMax Playing Cards\nWorshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards\nWorld of Playing Cards\nUnited Cardists\nThe Magic Cafe\nKardify\nMagic Orthodoxy\nGentleman Wake\nEnder's Game Reviewer\nThe Card Club\nPlaying Card Collector's Club\nRepeat Super Backers\nFellow Creators & Social Media Friends\nMy Family & Staff\nFulfillment\nBy PlayingCardDecks.com with a safe delivery guarantee and emailed tracking.

Many Patreons and Kickstarters have crazy good looking sculpts of various huge bosses, or overly fragile dynamically posed monsters - but nobody is designing minis for the working DM, who wants to throw a set of monsters on the printer before work, come home and they are sitting there finished (with no print errors), slap some paint on them quick, and use them in tonight's session.\nThis Kickstarter is designed for every DM - regardless of what kind of fantasy game you run, what kind of printer you have, or what kind of models you are looking to fill out your ranks with, this campaign will have something for you. We have sets of all your basic monsters (orcs, goblins, gnolls, kobolds, undead, etc) plus MANY stretch goals planned out, with a backer voting to help add even more stuff to the pledge.\n\nThese minis are designed for your standard fantasy game, and are scaled ~32mm with somewhat heroic proportions. They'll look great next to your existing 3D printable figs, HeroForge, Reaper Bones, etc.\nMinis are designed to print with zero slicer supports - just drop it on your build plate and print away.  Each mini is provided unbased, based on a simple flat base (for you to decorate to your own liking), and also based on a \"quick release\" bevelled and channeled base (for resin printing, which makes removal from the build plate easy).\nIn addition to carefully modeling designs to be support free, we have another advantage: I am a software engineer by trade, and developed an algorithm to help check and remove overhangs in the modeling/repair process, which leads to even easier to print minis!\nThis campaign is easy to understand. There is one pledge level, and it gets you everything pictured on this page! All the minis below are included with your pledge. These minis will be delivered to you as  STL files, with all the base options noted above. I've also release a ton of BASES , and am working on another free base pack for this campaign you can use to base these minis if you want more decorative bases.\nAs new stretch goals are unlocked, I'll add them to the list of included minis below.  There's 31 minis in the core pack, and I'm expecting to have nearly 100 minis in this campaign when all is said and done!\n\n** PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\nTo see a high-res gallery of zoomable renders of each model shown, CLICK HERE\n \\\nHOW IT WORKS\nEvery $1k we hit in funding, I'll choose, at random, a current backer. That backer will pick a set in the list above, then I'll roll a d4 and whichever tier I roll will be unlocked! If I roll a tier already unlocked for a set, I'll re-roll. \"Backer vote\" means we'll do a 48 hr vote to unlock a mini, \"Backer Pick\" means that backer will choose a mini to add to the campaign (based on my discretion of course). Some minis above are single minis, other are sets of minis.\n\nUNLOCK HISTORY\n $15k : Tyler Sawher picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 4,  Backer Vote - unlocked  the MAD KING\n $16k : Thomas Milazzo picked Set #6, 1d4 roll = 2 , VAMPIRES unlocked\n $17k : Bryan Larson picked Set #11, 1d4 roll = 1 , UNICORN unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set 4, 1d4 roll = 3,  HOBGOBLINS unlocked\n $18k: David Schilt picked Set #7, 1d4 roll = 4, Backer Pick - David chose BLIGHTS\n $19k: Christopher Darren Arnold picked Set #9, 1d4 roll = 1, SUCCUBUS unlocked\n $20k: Alec Lanter picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 2, BONY DEVIL unlocked\n $21k: Harry Colquhoun picked Set #3, 1d4 roll = 2, GIANT SPIDERS unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set 4, 1d4 roll = 1,  FLAME SKULLS unlocked\n $22k: Josh Harrison picked Set #10, 1d4 roll = 3, GOLEMS unlocked\n $23k: Earl McCammon picked Set #9, 1d4 roll = 2, IMPS unlocked\n $24k: Matthew Smithers picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 2, AZER unlocked\n $25k: Silas Mortensen picked Set #11, 1d4 roll = 2, NIGHTMARE unlocked\n $26k: Quentin Christensen picked Set #7, 1d4 roll = 1, WOLF PACK unlocked\n $27k: Justin Wold picked Set #6 1d4 roll = 3, DEATH KNIGHT unlocked\n $28k: Jesse Bailed picked Set #3, 1d4 roll = 1, GIANT TOAD unlocked\n BONUS: 1d12+1 roll = Set #2, 1d4 roll = 2, MINOTAUR unlocked\n $29k: Nick Cook picked Set #5, 1d4 roll = 3, TROLLS unlocked.\n $30k: Adam Albert picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 4, Backer Vote - unlocked SLAADS\n $31k: Timothy Woods picked Set #1, 1d4 roll = 3, LICH unlocked.\n $32k: EAA00 picked set #7, 1d4 roll = 3, BULLYWUGS unlocked.\n $33k: Charlotte Lee picked set #11, 1d4 roll = 3, YOUNG DRAGON unlocked\n $34k: John Wyss picked Set #13, 1d4 roll = 1, BOAR unlocked.\n BONUS: unlisted stretch goal, GIANT CENTIPEDE unlocked\n $35k: Wilbur Massie picked set #11, final set = 4, Wilbur chose RUST MONSTER\n $36k: Sam Bowskill picked Set #13, 1d4 roll = 3, UNDEAD CROC unlocked\n $37k: Francois Demers picked Set #10, 1d4 roll = 1, INCUBUS unlocked\n $38k: Jon Larsen picked Set #2, 1d4 roll = 3, HILL GIANTS unlocked\n $39k: Brandy Walter picked Set #12, 1d4 roll = 3, CULTISTS unlocked\n $40k: Rick picked Set #2, 1d4 roll = 2, EVIL WIZARD unlocked\n $41k: Daniel Arlos Edwards - set choice pending\n $42k: Michael Francis - set choice pending\n $43k: Tommy Kehlet - set choice pending\n $44k: Ryan Leitch - set choice pending\n $45k: Battle Wear picked Set #8, 1d4 roll = 1, ANIMATED ARMOR unlocked\n*** [NOTE - once the campaign is ended I can no longer update the renders, stretch goal graphic, or text on this page, so please refer to KS updates to see additional renders and info on pending unlocks!] ***\nEverybody loves free stuff, right?! EC3D has many many awesome minis over the years, and we remastered some from past campaigns to include as bonus items for this campaign - all backers will also receive the minis listed below, and I might add more during the campaign:\nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 9th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design a  ton of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. Take a look at the quality of my free items on Thingiverse or my last campaigns Wilds of Wintertide,  Depths of Savage Atoll or Empire of Scorching Sands to get a feel for my design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\n\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\nJoshua Black (lead 3D character design),  Ulises Virgen (3D character design),  Sebastiano Di Grazia (3D character design), Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios, painting), Ruslan Ahmatnurov (concept art), and Jean Roux (art)\nAnd a SPECIAL thank you to my wonderful wife Ally who has been unbelievably helpful, and essential in preparing this campaign!\n\nAdd-Ons\n\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! There's tons of sets (including fantasy, sci-fi, and space-combat scale) with hundreds more miniatures and lots of terrain/scenery.\nTo get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes.\nTo add any STL stretch goals you must back the campaign at a level that includes STLs.\n\n Empire of Scorching Sands: My last sprawling campaign, featuring Arabian/Persian/Egyptian/desert terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Empire of Scorching Sands - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($20 add-on), Minis only ($20 add-on), or ALL IN ($30 add-on).\n Wilds of Wintertide: A chilly, northern project featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis.

Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n Depths of Savage Atoll: A sprawling campaign, featuring nautical, jungle, pirate, and undersea minis and environs - Depths of Save Atoll - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($35 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($65 add-on).\n Skyless Realms: The races and places below the surface, from my previous campaign Skyless Realms  - the add-ons are equivalent to what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain only ($40 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($55 add-on).\n Novus Landing - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of scifi goodness! The add-ons are is equivalent to what's included in all-in pledge level of Novus Landing, (including unlocked stretch goals): Minis, Terrain/Scatter, or Vehicles (1 set for $25) or ALL IN (all 3 sets for $50)\n The Terra Conflict - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of space-combat scale ships, creatures, terrain, and more for epic space battles and encounters. This add-on is equivalent to what's included in the '3D Printable STL Files' pledge level of The Terra Conflict, including unlocked stretch goals ($30 add-on for the base set, and $42 for the base set + both add-on fleets).\n The Ignis Quadrant: My first foray into scifi, featuring support-free minis, tons of vehicles and lots of scatter terrain for all your scifi RPG and wargaming needs!

Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files.\n\nAccountability\nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed - and the majority of files will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes (usually 2 weeks after the date the campaign ends). I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 90 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters. \n\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. All minis are designed for FDM or resin printing, and will fit on the print beds of 99% of commercially-available at-home printers.\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes. My number one goal is to make some awesome, unique designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few, if any, risks and challenges for this campaign.

Introducing: Fates End 2: Terra & Cosmos! 3D printable Dice Towers + MORE for tabletop gaming!   \nWhat you get for Loot-All+ Pledges:    \n The 15 core STL files will be released by August 2021 with all stretch goals being delivered afterwards. All files will be split for smaller printers and are support-free for easy 3D printing! Please Check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for release dates! \n_______________________________________________________________\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\n *Any unlocked Stretch Goals will be included the my NEXT campaign! \n\nThe Special Social Media Stretch Goal has been UNLOCKED! Say hello to The Heaven & Hell Dice Tower!     \n_______________________________________________________________\nAdd-Ons:\nPlease see Update #11 for details on how to add Add-ons to your pledge. If you're a new backer, you'll find the option to add Add-ons after you select your pledge level!\n\nHoliday Ornaments! These are really simple but they were a lot of fun to give away to my friends and neighbors last season! I printed mine in resin, about 2\" tall and spray painted them with gold or silver spray paint! It's hard to get a photo that does them justice!\nBANKS! I gave a way a few bonus banks in the previous campaign (just for fun) but I didn't have the time to get them as perfect as I wanted. Adding this as an Add-on will allow me to use part of my production schedule to develop an improved plug! Here's an example of the Tiamat Bank:\nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nFatesEnd has partnered with Mythos Games for a very special Stretch Goal Bonus! For every $10k raised in this campaign, we will donate one table top game to our local Children's Hospital! Thanks Mythos Games!  \n_______________________________________________________________\nDo you want to print test a file first? \nThat's cool, we get that, so we're giving away one Dice Tower for free. Click below to get a FREE Mayan Temple Dice Tower .STL file to print today!    \n_______________________________________________________________\n--------------> ALL files are Print Tested and Repaired before release! <---------------\n_______________________________________________________________\nConcept art of all Core Set items:\n5 Sci-Fi-Inspired Dice Towers\n5 Earth-Inspired Dice Towers\n4 Dice Jails/vaults\n& 1 GM Screen     \n_______________________________________________________________\nMore Details\nWhy Dice Towers? Dice towers help to prevent cheating - and allow Fate do her job! Dice Towers also add an extra level of character to your game! Each tower will include a dice tray to help protect fancy pants tables from heavy metal dice damage. Lastly (our favorite) these Dice Towers inspire envy in friend and foe alike! Enjoy that clackity-clack until fate has rendered her verdict.       \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat's a Dice Jail/Vault? Ah, good question! We didn't know either when we launched our previous campaign  but due to UNPRECEDENTED feedback (begging and pleading) from backers, we offered Dice Jails as stretch goals. Since then, the feedback (begging and pleading) has continued, so we were sure to provide LOTS of Dice Jails and Dice Vaults in this campaign. So, what are they? Dice Jails are intended to punish bad dice in style. Dice Vaults are for less naughty dice who need a place to stay for the night... or until their next adventure commences. \n_______________________________________________________________\nEASY TO PRINT! The files will be designed to be 3D Printed easily without supports! (Supports are the WORST!)   \nActual FDM print (60% at .15 mm layer height)\n_______________________________________________________________ \nDo you actually print your files? Yep, I do, then I print it again, and sometimes... again. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nAll files will be designed to print on smaller FDM Printers like the Prusa Mini. Files above 7\" (about 177mm) tall will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan I print it even smaller? These objects can be any size that your printer can support, so you can print them smaller (if you have a small printer) or larger (for large dice) if desired.  All Dice towers are designed to work with standard 20mm dice at 100% scale. (*Dice set/tower scales are determined by the size of the D20 in the set.) If you can't print the towers at 100%, then print them at 60% to work with tiny 12mm dice sets (can be found in local game stores or on Amazon.) Teeeny tiny printers such as the Photon and Mars are unlikely to print the majority of dice towers AND work with existing dice. However, Dice Jails and Vaults may work, depending on size and scale. \n (Photo of actual printed objects ^) \nActual Resin print\n_______________________________________________________________\nHave bigger dice? No problem! You can 3D print these files at any scale (*that your printer can support!). Use the dice scaler tab in the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE to determine scale. \n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat printers are supported? All files will be designed to fit within 7\" square print areas (Prusa Mini). Files will be split vertically to fit taller printers.      \nPrinted in Resin (60%)\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a physical product? Although we won\u2019t be selling physical prints through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 15 core products, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We had a plethora of Merchants with our previous campaign, and we expect (hope) we can duplicate the same success here! \n_______________________________________________________________\nWill you be including 6 tray types for towers in this campaign? Sadly, no. Instead of offering 6 simple trays, we wanted to focus on unique designs for each tray for this campaign.  All tower files will come with one removable tray. Our hope is to include spaces to hold dice, but all trays may not have a great spot for dice. Trays will be only one size, one type. In collecting feedback from the previous campaign, we found that the majority of backers were printing the same trays (large.) If we get enough feedback, we may consider an additional tray type (OpenLock perhaps?) but at this moment, one tray is what is being offered in this campaign.\nTrays that are too large for our 7\"x7\"x7\" print minimum will be split into parts using puzzle shapes for easy assembly. \n_______________________________________________________________\nCan you teach me how to 3D Print? We have a Fates End Print Support Group on Facebook for all backers with lots of volunteers who can help you get started. Many of our backers from the previous campaign were first time printers, and were able to get up and running with the help of our volunteers. \nWe will send the Facebook Link out to all backers after the campaign funds (usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________\n When will I get the files? \nEach object will take about 1 week to model, print test, repair and deliver. GM screen(s) will take two weeks. Please check the PRODUCTION SCHEDULE for Release dates.\nThose who back the FatesEnd #1 & #2 or Dual License tiers will receive their FatesEnd #1 files after this campaign funds (*usually two weeks after the campaign ends.)\n_______________________________________________________________ \n\nQuotes from backers of FatesEnd 1 (previous campaign):     \n_______________________________________________________________\nPrevious Campaign (FatesEnd 1)\nIf you're interested in adding files from the previous FatesEnd campaign (FatesEnd1), but you'd like to see them first, you can find renders, photos and details here. \nPLAY\n\n_______________________________________________________________\nImprovements\nWe'll be fulfilling orders from this campaign through Backerkit! We're hoping for a better/clearer process for file access this time around. \n\nSince this is our 2nd campaign, we learned a lot from the previous one. We believe this experience will help us communicate more effectively to help fulfillment run smoothly! \n_______________________________________________________________\n MERCHANTS \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>IMPORTANT NOTICE<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nNew Merchants: The Merchant license from this campaign does not apply to the previous campaign (FatesEnd1) If you want to sell FatesEnd1 assets, we offer the Dual License for new Merchants.\nMerchants from FatesEnd1: you do not need to purchase a Dual License since you already have a license to sell assets from FatesEnd1 (The first campaign). However, if you wish to sell assets from this campaign (FatesEnd2), you must back the Merchant License tier.\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>><<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<\nOur Merchant program in our previous campaign was a huge success! Many Merchants sold so many towers/dice jails from the previous campaign, they were able to expand their print space into a full fledged printer farm! Some Merchants were even able to convert their printing hobby into a full time job from selling FatesEnd merch! To be clear, we can't guarantee the success of every Merchant (that's honestly up to you), but it was fun to see the success of many of our Merchants, especially those who were actively engaged on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, etc.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: No one is permitted to sell prints form this campaign (FatesEnd2) unless they back the Merchant License tier, or the Dual License Tier from this campaign. Selling/giving away files is strictly prohibited. \n______________________________________________________________\nLicense duration: The license is good for a full 24 months from the date of the last released file. The more stretch goals we unlock, the longer you can sell! \n______________________________________________________________\nMerchant ID. To protect our Merchants and their investment, every Merchant receives a unique Merchant ID. This makes it easy to spot sellers who haven't acquired a Merchant License and put a stop to their piracy (Yarrrrr! Avast ye swabs!)   \n Special note for FatesEnd1 Merchants: for those of you who back the FE2 Merchant tier (this campaign) We'll make sure your IDs have the same number as your FE1 ones.\nRestrictions: You may use FateEnd watermarked renders in your listings, however please don\u2019t use Fates End photos to promote your sales. Please use your own photos when listing for sales (you may use concept art until 1 week after finalized files are delivered.  \nWatermarked Render Example\n ______________________________________________________________\nMerchant-Only FB Support Group\nWe have a Merchant-only Facebook support group where you can all share photos of your prints, ask questions and help support one another. \nIf you want to get a Merchant License, but you're still not sure which tier to back, please check this handy for further clarification:\nDual Licenses are only for new merchants who wish to sell prints from both campaigns.  \nFatesEnd 1 Merchants already have the right to sell files from FatesEnd1. Please do not back the Dual License tier if you already have a Merchant License from the previous campaign. Please back the Merchant License tier.\n\nMerchant Licenses and Dual Licenses from campaign 2 will not be issued until campaign 2 funds (two weeks after the end of the campaign.)\n\nThe new campaign does not limit the Merchant License duration from the previous campaign (FatesEnd 1) in any way.\n\n****SPECIAL FOR ALL Fates End 1 MERCHANTS**** If we get more than 20 Dual-License ($550)backers in this campaign, we will extend ALL MERCHANT LICENCE durations from the FIRST campaign to match the end date of FatesEnd 2 licenses!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second campaign. The first one blasted past all of my expectations. I've learned a lot from the process, and although we had a few hiccups in the beginning, I believe, in the end, that it was a successful campaign. We have an active community of backers who support one another, and to me, that's the biggest success I could have hoped for.\n\nI feel that there is very little risk this time around. I own all the software, hardware and a lot of learnings from the previous campaign. \n\nChallenge 1: Manufacturing/modeling easy to print items\nSolution - Experience! I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill. (Honestly, complex creations that require supports are the BANE of 3D printing! Many swarings have happened in this house due to the struggles of printing items that require complex supports.) I have owned 11+ printers (no kidding!) We currently have 3 Prusa MK3\u2019s, 3 Prusa Minis, an Elegoo Saturn and a Anycubic Mono X.\n\nChallenge 2: Time\nSolution - Self-employed! I have the time planned out to create the remaining files for this campaign. I have the software, hardware, skill and experience, all I need is time. I am self-employed so I have complete control over my time! All I have to do is schedule the time in, and boom - we\u2019re on track!\nBy funding this project, you make it possible for me to focus on this project instead of client work for a time.

This Kickstarter campaign offers two dramatically different works:\n Illuminated Manuscript. A collection of web, unpublished, and older articles pulled from the company's history. Starting at 24 pages, the zine expands in size as stretch goals are unlocked and we add more articles to the collection!\n 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Constructed from scans of Steve's typewritten and hand-illustrated Ogre playtest set, this saddle-stitched booklet gives you a look at Ogre in its pre-publication form. Have you always wanted to learn more about Steve's first game? This book pulls back the curtains and gives you a version of the game you've not seen before!\nRead on to learn more about both zines!\nAt project launch, Illuminated Manuscript includes a mix of web articles, the winning entry in our recent Ogre playmat scenario contest, and material from the pages of Where We're Going -- our retailer newsletter -- from 1987 and 1988.  \nDigital mockup. This article showcases the progress of GURPS Space in 1987/1988, as documented in the pages of the Where We're Going Newsletter. This hard-to-find newsletter for retailers and distributors includes info that wasn't shared with GURPS players at the time the book was being created. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\nProject stretch goals, if unlocked, add another twelve pages to the zine, expanding the total size to 36 pages. (See stretch goals, below, for more information.) These stretch goals include more web content and previously unreleased material. \n The articles at project launch include:\nDeluxe Illuminati: The Servants of Cthulhu Solitaire Challenge\nGURPS Space, The Albatross of 1987/1988*\n Halloween d6 Dice Set Rules by Steve Jackson \nEyes on the Prize, An Ogre Scenario**\n It\u2019s Munchkin Party Time! with Andrew Hackard \nDesigner\u2019s Notes: Cthulhu Dice\nThinking Outside of the Box**\n Army Men d6 Dice Set Rules \nMunchkin Dungeon Design: For Munchkins, By Munchkins\n * From Where We're Going and Roleplayer (1987/1988)\n** New to Illuminated Manuscript.\n\"This is a reproduction of an actual surviving Ogre playtest set from 1976. It consists of the rules (typed on typewriter \u2013 no word processors yet!), the map (hand-drawn by me, with the sophisticated graphics talent for which I am NOT famous), and the game counters (also hand-made by me).\" \n- Steve Jackson, from the introduction (written in 2021)\n\nDigital mockup of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\n\n\nWhat an incredible treat! Dated November 4, 1976, this is Steve's typewritten playtest set for the original Ogre game. We've scanned the pages and have presented them exactly as the marked copies appear. Have you wanted a look at Ogre in its pre-publication form? This is your chance to add an unusual collectible to your Ogre library!\nThe booklet comes in at 20 pages (which includes the cover, back cover, and inside covers). The center includes the map. We will release the PDF as a free title once this Kickstarter campaign has closed, so you won't have to cut your booklet if you want to build the set and play the game as it existed in 1976.\nDigital mockup of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. Final may vary slightly in appearance.\nNOTE: None of the project stretch goals impact the content of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet. This saddle-stitched zine is 100% maxed out in terms of page count and ready to go at project launch. One stretch goal upgrades the physical construction of the booklet. See below.\nIf unlocked, these stretch goals directly impact the Illuminated Manuscript zine.\n $2,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Ogre Sixth Edition vs Designer's Editon comparison and Cthulhu Dice spell effects for fantasy RPGs*) \n $3,500 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Spiral Summoning for The Fantasy Trip* and Zombie Dice Designer's Notes) \n $5,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Munchkins & Mazes Designer's Notes, Gelatinous Solitaire Rules, and One On One Munchkin Monster Melee*) \n* New to Illuminated Manuscript.\nIf this stretch goal is unlocked, we will add three copies of a new Munchkin bookmark to all print reward levels. (This bookmark will be released as a free promo later in 2021.)\n $7,500 - UNLOCKED! - Munchkin Bosses bookmark. What is Munchkin Bosses? A new mini-expansion scheduled for release later in 2021! NEW! \nIf this stretch goal is unlocked, we improve the physical construction of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet.\n $10,000 - UNLOCKED! - The cover of the 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet is upgraded to a heavier stock. \nIf unlocked, the next stretch goal adds another four pages to the Illuminated Manuscript zine!\n $13,000 - UNLOCKED! - +4 pages added to the Illuminated Manuscript. (Confessions of a Tree-Hugger, How it Got to be Z-Shot, and Dragons*. All by Steve Jackson! Dragons is an unpublished dice game using standard six-sided dice.) \n* New to Illuminated Manuscript.\nIf the next stretch goal is unlocked, all reward levels receive one copy each of the two coaster designs. These are the same size/style as the coasters currently available at Warehouse 23. \n $15,000 - UNLOCKED! - Two different coasters, one Ogre and one The Fantasy Trip, added to each reward level.\nAll stretch goals unlocked!\nDigital mockup.

If those limits are met, we will review the situation and open up more slots when possible.\n\n\n NOTE: Street addresses only.\nAfter the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager. There, you will tell us your Warehouse 23 email address, provide your physical address, and pay for shipping. You will also have the chance to add more items to your rewards package. See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for the delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company. \nNOTE: Taxes, where applicable, will be charged in BackerKit.\nBecause of the increased complexity and expense of international shipping, this project is limited to U.S. backers only. If the campaign succeeds we will offer both the Illuminated Manuscript and 1976 Ogre Playtest Booklet at our online store, Warehouse 23.

Apparently I like to design what my backers want so a queen piece for the dwarves will be available to purchase from Wargame Vault at the conclusion of this campaign. \nDwarven Queen\n\nThere has also been some demand for the magical tile designs from the 'Kings in Conflict' Kickstarter campaign, so that too will be available as an add on from Wargame Vault.  \nAll files were printed using fdm printers (an Up Box + and an Ender 3 Pro) and used rafts and supports. They were designed using 3ds Max and ZBrush and have been run through a repair tool.\n\nYou can try out a test sample of the dragon pawn here:\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4746584 \n\nSome examples of printed and painted models.\n\n The chess pieces can be printed as one piece or as two pieces - a top and a base which push fit together. There is also an optional base cap that can be printed but needs to be glued on.\n\nThe chess board is comprised of three designs -  the corner, the side and the centre pieces. The chess tiles are slotted in on top of that.\nPLAY\n\nFor extra rigidity I've glued my board down to a piece of wood.\n\n\nFulfillment of 'Dwarves vs Dragons' will be completed through WargameVault. Each backer will receive copies via their account. Fulfillment will begin as soon as possible. This should hopefully be within 2 weeks of the project funding. A survey will be sent out shortly after the project has funded to gather email addresses associated with WargameVault accounts. Please note, this is the only way to gain these files. You will then have the files in your library so you can access them as often as you would like.

Not fancy. It's all very DIY and all the work is done by me. I've been noodling on hacking up a d100 OGL system for a while, and I'd been tinkering with the ruleset during down hours. So I sat down and finished it, did some layout stuff on it, and built this Kickstarter page, all in six hours. \nShort of drawing all the art myself, it doesn't get more DIY than that. (I debated drawing the art myself, but I figured I'd spare you.)\nSo. Swordpoint is a d100 swashbuckling-themed zine using the Legend OGL (from Mongoose Publishing). The tone and theme is inspired by Musketeers, Captain Alatriste, and European Continent around the 1600s, as well as older games like En Garde, Flashing Blades, and more.\nThe rules are condensed to about 60 pages in a 5\"x8\" landscape format. I always wanted to try a landscape book, and I like how they read on tablets and phones, so I figured why not.\nI did all the layout myself, so it's not super fancy, but I tried to keep it simple and functional. \nWhat it has:\nThe rules you need to play. A hacked d100 system (it'll feel familiar if you know d100 RPGs.)\nNew rules for this iteration of the d100 RPG: Style points. Streamlined combat. A lightweight magic system. \nGenre rules for grudges, revenge, rank, duels, and some enemies (not many enemies though. Like 3.)\nA planned compatibility license.\n PDF bookmarks. I just learned how to do that this morning!\nCharacter sheet mock-up I made. We'll see.\nWhat it doesn't have:\nLots of rules.\nLots of art. Most of the art is from Shutterstock or public domain. There's only like 5-6 pieces in the book total, just to fill white space.\nFancy layout. Remember: DIY and I am not a layout artist. It should be pretty straightforward and easy to read though.\nStretch goals (at least right now.)\nThe writing is probably kinda dry. I wrote in very technical style, 'cause I was inspired by older RPGs (one of my proof-readers even commented on that, so I figure I'll warn you.)\nLayout Sample\n\nThe Plan\nOnce we close, I'll send the PDF out to backers to submit feedback. I think we got most of the errors, but I've learned not to count on that. I'll incorporate the feedback. Then we'll go to print and delivery. No muss, no fuss. \nShipping\nPhysical is shipping to the US only. Sorry. It sucks and I hate having to restrict it but it's too easy to lose money or get caught unawares by shipping changes (hey Brexit.) \nExtra will be available via the GKG webstore after the campaign though, so if you want, you can get it then and we'll try to give you the best rate possible. \nGKG has shipped thousands of packages, so it should be pretty straightforward.

NEW OPTION: HIGH ELVEN! VOTE NOW!\nVOTE NOW!\nThe system is pretty simple! Each month, you choose a theme and we create assets that are matching that theme for the Townbuilder, as well as a number of print-ready buildings that you can download immediately.\nIf you back this Kickstarter you will receive a code that will, once redeemed, automatically unlock the release for the current month and all following months for the duration you backed for.\nIf you are supporting any miniature sculptors on Patreon, you will already have an idea how such a system plays out. The only difference is, that you will get buildings and customization assets instead of miniatures, and they will be available on townsmith.de instead of google drive/MyAirBridge/Sync.\nAccess to the Townbuilder Software is not included in the subscription, but also not necessarily needed. Please read the section \"TB not included\" for more information.\n\nBasically, each release is a number of models (Walls, Floors, Doors, Windows, Roofs, etc...) that are fitting the theme of that month and are automatically unlocked for your account as soon as they are available.\nAdditionally, we will create a number of print-ready, support-free buildings, that you can download as a zip file that includes everything you need. You can also customize the buildings with any models of prior releases or our last Kickstarter in the Townbuilder.\nThere are a total of 6 releases planned in this Kickstarter, with more to come if the system is profitable. Depending on your pledge you receive a total of 3 or 6 such releases!\n\nSubscribing after these initial 6 months is optional and you will be asked if you want to stay subscribed when you enter your activation codes.\nWe would love for you to stay subscribed and allow us to expand the Townbuilder each month for a long time, but you can also use this Kickstarter without binding yourself to a subscription and just get the 6 months of assets and buildings.\n\nNow let's talk about our last Kickstarter, Townbuilder Unlimited, which was really successful and allowed us to make the Townbuilder much bigger than we ever anticipated! But as many of you know, that Kickstarter has not yet been completely fulfilled. But as you can see in the delivery dates, there is plenty of time for us to finish the last stretch goals before the first monthly release is due.\nWhat we have learned from our last Kickstarter and from running this company for more than a year now is that the most valuable things out there are information and time. If we know which and how many models and buildings we have to create 4 months before the first release rolls out, it will improve the product quality and lower our stress level significantly.\n\nHere we would like to show you the concept art for the already chosen themes, as well as the options for the later releases.\nPLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS JUST CONCEPT ART. HOW DETAILED AND VARIED THE 3D MODELS WILL BE DEPENDS ON THE UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS.\nCheck the \"Monthly Release\" section to see a daily update on how much has been unlocked. \nClick to see more details!\nClick to see more details!\nClick to vote!\nSeptember, October, November: Will be determined after August has been voted\n\nYou can choose in which month you'll start your 3-month subscription. If Draconic, Aztec, or the voted theme in august isn't your thing, you can skip these months and start your subscription with the September release.\n\nI assume that most people who stumble across this Kickstarter are either backers of our last campaign or bought the Townbuilder shortly after on MMF, BackerKit or in our store.\nBut for those of you who are new to Townsmith, here is a quick overview:\nPLAY\n\nWe really can't explain what the Townbuilder is any better than our info page can: Townbuilder Info Page\nTLDR: The Townbuilder is a web-based custom creator for 3D-printable buildings for tabletop games. You can combine small building blocks, such as walls, floors, roofs, and stairs, into complete buildings.\nAh, and of course, if you don't own the Townbuilder yet, you should head over to our store and have a look at it! There are already plenty of models that you can use to create buildings.\nIf you decide to get the Townbuilder, I HIGHLY recommend watching our User Guide Youtube Playlist, it helps a lot with getting started!\n\n\nAbout a year and a half has passed since Tom and I had the idea for the Townbuilder. Initially, it started as a side project next to our university studies.\nWell, we're certainly not at that point anymore. We had a very successful Kickstarter last year and since then the Townbuilder has gone from Open Beta to Early Access 0.1-0.4 and finally to Townbuilder v1.0.\nBut what exactly has improved and changed in the software since you last saw it on Kickstarter?\nImproved Performance\nIncreased Server capacities by a factor of 10\nImplemented under the hood services that allow us to better monitor the performance and problems of the Townbuilder\nImplemented OpenLOCK capabilities\nDeveloped our own peg and magnet system, allowing for 1-6mm magnets and pegs to be placed on almost any model\nCreated a peg placement mode that makes it much more convenient to place pegs\nEnabled scaling of the exported building to a variety of popular scales\nStarted a partner system to get models of other designers into the Townbuilder\nAdded Fillerblocks, a way to fill out empty space or use them as placeholders (cube, cylinder, prism, floor-like)\nAdded a grouping system that gives the user full control over which models are exported as one STL\nAdded a group linking system that expands the grouping functionality to allow for multiple floors to be linked together for export\nAdded Building Blocks, a way of saving and importing whole buildings into your workspace, enabling creative users to fully modularize their building process\nAdded animations to different elements\nReworked the entire GUI making it responsive on smaller and larger monitors.\nCreated the Signbuilder, a sub-application for the Townbuilder, with which you can create signs with custom text and logos that can be used in the Townbuilder\nFixed 500+ bugs\nHad the servers burn down 3 times\nWIP on (semi-)automatic mesh repair using Netfabb so models can be used in all slicers (Simplify3D users rejoice!)\nWIP on a link sharing system, that allows users to share their builds via unique URLs\nWIP on creative mode that allows users to build with all existing assets, save and share the building, but not export it as an STL\nWIP on on-click merchant integration that will allow users to send out print-commission request to our licensed merchants directly from the Townbuilder\n\nWe will also post this in the FAQ, but just to be clear:\nDoes the subscription include access to the software?\nNO, IT DOESN'T. THIS KICKSTARTER IS JUST ABOUT A MONTHLY EXPANSION OF MODELS AND PRINT-READY BUILDINGS!\n\nIf you backed our last Kickstarter, you already got a lifetime license to the Townbuilder.\nThis system will not change and will remain as it is for the foreseeable future. We do not charge you extra, nor do we give new people cheaper options to get the Townbuilder.\n\nYou can back this Kickstarter without owning the Townbuilder and you will still get all the STLs for the buildings. However, you will not be able to customize them unless you backed our last Kickstarter or you specifically backed one of the following reward tiers:\nTownbuilder Advanced + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder Pro + 6 Months Subscription\nTownbuilder All In\n\nWith this Kickstarter, our stretch goals will depend on the number of backers, NOT on the money raised. That is because this number gives us a rough estimate of how many subscribers we will have in any given month.\nSince you can back for just three or for six months, or for a pledge level that includes both the Townbuilder and a subscription, each individual backer will contribute different amounts of money. This means we use the backer number as a rough estimate of our monthly subscriber count, which in return allows us to determine the variety and detail level of a monthly release.\nBelow you can see the different detail levels that can be unlocked on some example buildings from the Draconic and Aztec theme. \nThe roadmap also includes print-ready, support free buildings of all previously created sets. These will be built once, not on a monthly basis, and will be made available to all backers in the same way as the ones from the monthly releases. If you have access to the sets these buildings were built with, you will be able to customize them in the Townbuilder, otherwise, you will only have access to the print-ready version.\n\n\nOur current Merchant License System is really really simple. You pay 35\u20ac per month and you can sell as many prints of Townbuilder buildings as you want.\nThis does include all the print-ready buildings that we will create with this Kickstarter.\nFor more information, check out our License Agreement.\nIf you want to become a Townbuilder Merchant, check out our store!\n\nAs you may know, we have opened the Townbuilder up to external content. This means that we implement models by other creators as well as our users into the Townbuilder.\nIf you want to know more about this, and want to suggest a creator to us, or get your models into the Townbuilder, send us a message via partners@townsmith.de.\n\nWe are Townsmith. This sentence meant a lot to us when we launched our very first Kickstarter over a year ago. And it only continued to grow in meaning when the Kickstarter exploded beyond all expectations on the second attempt. Since then, our team has grown, and so has the responsibility of all of us.\nWe are very happy to say that we still have the same spirit that originally brought us to this.\nWe are just a group of nerds who love DnD and 3D printing and creating cool tools for our hobby!\n\n\nIf you want to get in touch with us, the best way is via Discord. We have a very active server with over 1800 users. Feel free to join our community, we are always happy to help you out!\nWe also post regular updates on Instagram and Facebook.\nAnd then, of course, you should subscribe to our Youtube Channel if you want to get notified whenever we make more user guides.\nIf you have business-inquiries or want to talk about collaborations in general, please send us an email at business@townsmith.de\nIf you are interested in becoming a partner and getting your models in the Townbuilder, please contact us via partners@townsmith.de", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have now almost fulfilled one of the biggest digital Kickstarters in the 3D printing scene.\nWe have gone through the insane challenge of getting a company of 10 people up and running. And it has been running cleanly for about 4 months now (Our initial Kickstarter launched 7 months ago).\n\nWe have a team of 5 artists and 1 technician working on getting hundreds of models in the Townbuilder and Tom and I are always available to fix any technical issues that might come up.\nAnd we are ready to expand our team if we reach higher stretch goals and the funding is there. If this system makes 50k a month, rest assured that most of it will directly influence the amount and quality of the models we make, while the rest will go into research and development for the next builder. Wait did I just spoil that we are coding another custom builder? No one reads this section anyway, won't do any harm. For the few of you that do keep posted and look for some green in the wild of our website, you might find some hints soon ;)\n\nStill, there are some risks we simply cannot account for:\nA) Longevity. We survived the 'valley of death', that destroys so many start-ups. However, we still cannot guarantee how long the service will live. This Kickstarter is meant to provide us much more safe planning for the next 6 months, but who knows how much money we will make with this system afterward. And if it doesn't pay for the artists, we will not be able to continue the subscriptions.\n\nB) Times of uncertainty. We all know that 2020 just ended, and it taught us, that it can always get worse. So if the world collapses into an economic crisis, a war breaks out or half of our team dies, we will simply not be able to recover. Stuff like this will cause this project to fail since we just don't have millions on the side or 200 employees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable Distribution\nPure Digital Shipping", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac40 or more", "title": "3 Monthly Releases", "descp": "10% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 3-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nThis means you will get access to 3 monthly model releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "33% saved versus a monthly subscription after the Kickstarter\nWith this reward, you will get an activation code which will begin a free 6-month subscription for our Townbuilder SubSystem.\nYou can activate this code at any time, so feel free to skip the months that don't interest you!\nThis means you will get access to 6 monthly releases\n(check the campaign description to see what 1 release includes as this is expanded over the course of the campaign)\nINCLUDES:\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["188 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Advanced+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Advanced Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Advanced Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac100 or more", "title": "Townbuilder Pro+6 Monthly Releases", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND NEED A TOWNBUILDER EDITION, NOT JUST MODELS!!!\nFor more information on what the Pro Edition and the Medieval Set are, please check the campaign description!\nINCLUDES:\nTownbuilder Pro Edition\n6\u00d7 monthly releases\nMedieval Set\nVote for the themes starting in August", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2021"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac200 or more", "title": "Townbuilder All In", "descp": "ONLY BACK IF YOU DID NOT SUPPORT OUR LAST KICKSTARTER AND WANT EVERYTHING FROM THERE AS WELL!!!\nYou will get a total value of 291\u20ac at 31% off for only 200\u20ac.

This Kickstarter provides support-free minis, scatter terrain, space ships of all sizes, vehicles, and more for you to produce at home on your FDM or resin 3D printer. Rewards are for digital STL files to print the products shown and described in this campaign. Rewards are split into three categories: Scatter/Terrain,  Space Ships/Vehicles, and Minis - designed to be used together or independently, and all for normal tabletop gaming scale (28-32mm). All these models should work great for games like Starfinder, Star Wars Legion, Fifth Age (5e), Dark Matter (5e), and Cyberpunk games like Infinity (Note that each of those games listed  have all rights reserved, and this campaign is not affiliated or associated with those brands or trademarks).\n\n** PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **\n\n**NEW BACKERS** - This project is successfully funded, and ALL the 15 planned stretch goals have been unlocked! There's over 70 support-free minis,  12 larger vehicles/ships, and 175+ scatter STLs included!\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version. Photos are a mix of resin and FDM prints. Some content shown may be part of stretch goals --\nThis project includes a large collection of thematic minis including aliens, creatures, characters, NPCs, androids, drones, and more!\nHigh-quality miniatures, suitable for resin-level detail but also great quality on FDM printers\n NO supports are needed for any of these miniatures, in resin or FDM. This is accomplished by smart posing and design, and slicing/keying where needed.\nAll models have been test printed and ready to drop on print bed and go.\nAll minis are included in based versions (pictured below), and also unbased for you to base yourself, use in dioramas, etc. Where split/keyed versions are needed, complete versions are also offered for those that want them. Some are designed to use with flight bases, such as these free ones I have on Thingiverse or the great ones by LITKO . I also released all the mini bases from this project for free HERE. \nWHY SUPPORT-FREE? Support-free is not just for FDM printing, it works GREAT for resin too. Support-free designs have many benefits, including being generally harder to break during travel and play (thicker components, merged geometry), less prone to print failure, and less (if any) cleanup and post-processing. You can throw a bunch on your printer, walk away, and come back confident - and get more models on your table faster!\n\nThe minis range in size from small creatures, to HUGE alien beasts. Scale is roughly 32mm (similar in size to Reaper Bones). The below image shows renders of all the models included with the minis set, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked.\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click for high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nEvery space port needs some space ships! This project includes many space ships of various types and sizes - ranging from large, multi floor ships to small, sleek fighters. All ships are designed to print and assemble on FDM printers of most sizes, and designed to open for easy play and detailed interiors (many of the ships and vehicles will fit on resin printers as well). There's also many other interesting vehicles to help flesh out your space sport and scifi locations. They are all sized for play similar to the minis and terrain (28-32mm). Like everything in this Kickstarter, the vehicles print support-free, with the exception of a few odd-shaped pieces like window glass. Check em out:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n---------------------------------------\nThis project has all kinds of fun, modular terrain and scenery to build a wealth of different environments like cantinas,  warehouses, landing pads, gambling dens, outdoor markets, and more. It's far-future Scifi in theme, but much is styled to work great with near-future Cyberpunk as well. All items print support free, and are split/designed/optimized for easy printing, painting, and assembly (if needed). The below image shows renders of all the models in some sample configurations included with the scatter set & all-in pledge levels, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked:\n-- click to view high-res zoomable version --\n-- click to view zoomable high-res version --\n---------------------------------------\nI have all kinds of stretch goals planned - enough to nearly triple the core reward content! You can see what's unlocked in the graphic below. Unless otherwise noted, the models that are unlocked are in the previews above. Some stretch goals will be mini focused, some scatter, some a big vehicle, and others a mix - but I am attempting to balance the added stuff overall.\n[UPDATE: all stretch goals have been unlocked, nearly tripling the rewards content! ]\n---------------------------------------\nWho doesn't like free stuff? There's many free items released, and more coming, to sweeten the pot and give you something to print while the KS is in progress. \nI have released my second set of SCIFI DUNGEONSTICKS, which you can download and print right now. You can access all the other free releases in THIS THINGIVERSE COLLECTION. In addition, all the bases I have designed for this campaign are available for free HERE (which match my last free set of SCIFI BASES). The previous free/bonus models from my last scifi project, The Ignis Quadrant are also perfect test examples of the quality of what's in this project, available HERE.\n\nNOTE: Thingiverse has been flakey lately - if things aren't loading for you, you can download the free preview files and bases in Dropbox HERE. \n\nAlso I teamed up with Ben over at 2nd Dynasty to offer a sweet discount for his huge, epic starships! Click the banner below to visit his MMF store and use the code NovusLandingShips for 30% off, until Feb 28, 2021.\n--------------------------------------\nAs the universe of The Ignis Quadrant has continued to grow beyond my first two scifi STL kickstarters, I decided to create and Kickstart a professionally-drawn comic book series as well! The first 2 issues (Chapter #0 and Chapter #1) are released, with the next chapter coming soon. Many of the characters and environments in this project are reflected in the comic book. If you're a scifi fan (which we assume you are, since you're here!) we absolutely encourage you to check out the comic. You can read the free chapter #0 online for free RIGHT HERE, and buy the digital issue #1 RIGHT HERE\n--------------------------------------\nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer and tabletop game accessory creator with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 8th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design much of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. This is my third Scifi project but it's gonna be epic! You can take a look through my previous projects to get a feel for my team's design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\n\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\n\nJoshua Black, Sebastiano Di Grazia, Vitaliy Deaf, Ben Southall (Yasashii Kyojin Studio),  Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios), Povilas Selila, Alexander Buryak, Julia Kuznetsova (PolyGrimm), and Ulises Virgen.\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! My previous projects have all been fantasy, but I know plenty of gamers play both scifi and fantasy, so I decided to offer them regardless. To get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes.\n\nTo add any STL stretch goals you must back the campaign at a level that includes STLs. If you only wish to\n The Terra Conflict - My most recent 3D printable Kickstarter, full of space-combat scale ships, creatures, terrain, and more for epic space battles and encounters. This add-on is equivalent to what's included in the '3D Printable STL Files' pledge level of The Terra Conflict, including unlocked stretch goals ($30 add-on for the base set, and $42 for the base set + both add-on fleets).\n The Ignis Quadrant: My first foray into scifi, featuring support-free minis, tons of vehicles and lots of scatter terrain for all your scifi RPG and wargaming needs! The Ignis Quadrant - The add-ons are is equivalent to what's included in all-in pledge level, (including unlocked stretch goals): Minis, Terrain/Scatter, or Vehicles (1 set for $25) or ALL IN (all 3 sets for $50).\n Empire of Scorching Sands: My last sprawling campaign, featuring Arabian/Persian/Egyptian/desert terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Empire of Scorching Sands - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($20 add-on), Minis only ($20 add-on), or ALL IN ($30 add-on).\n Wilds of Wintertide: A chilly, northern project featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis. Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($10 add-on).\n Secret of the Crimson Troupe - Everything from the second volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - A wandering troupe with a dark secret! Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n The Holy Order of Ash - Everything from the third volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - A dark holy order! Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($15 add-on).\n Depths of Savage Atoll: A sprawling campaign, featuring nautical, jungle, pirate, and undersea minis and environs - Depths of Save Atoll - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($35 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($65 add-on).\n Skyless Realms: The races and places below the surface, from my previous campaign Skyless Realms  - the add-ons are equivalent to what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain only ($40 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($55 add-on).\n Forest of Oakenspire - Everything from the core reward and stretch goals from my first Kickstarter Forest of Oakenspire at a great discount ($40 add-on).\n All EC3D Premium Sets - The full collection of all 12 previously released premium sets - over $100 value, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($50 add-on)\n Individual EC3D Premium Sets - Chose any number of my EC3D scenery sets from my previously released premium set collection - substantial value over retail price, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($5 per-set add-on)\n** Please note ** - all the add-on items above can be purchased right now for a higher price on heroshoard.com or late pledge pages for those campaigns, but if you are willing to wait until this campaign closes to receive the files you can get a great discount AND help unlock more stuff for this current campaign.\n\nI have an official licensed printer program for my 3D sets, along with my partner at Hero's Hoard, which allows commercial physical resellers with a 10% commission on sales. Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files.\nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed - and the majority of files will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes (usually 2 weeks after the date the campaign ends). I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 90 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters. Please note, historically I wait until I have released everything from one project to launch another, but I have a fantasy STL project launching right after this one, which is smaller in scope and already completed, and I'm confident will not slow my planned release schedule for Novus Landing.\n\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\n\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. For terrain/scatter and FDM printer capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally <= .16mm), such as an Ender 3.  Parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing. All designs for terrain are cut and keyed to fit on a 200x200mm print bed.  For minis, a resin printer is ideal and all mini models are cut/keyed (only as needed) to fit on standard sized smaller resin print beds (such as an Anycubic Photon), with the exception of a few VERY large minis and some large spaceship parts. Minis will print on FDM printers as well - for a few of the more challenging models you might need to slow the print down a bit, but no supports will be needed.\n\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes.

It draws on aspects from another Schiller's work - the famous historical drama Wallenstein and the theme of the 30 Years' War.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\n Features:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed (Linen) Finish \n52 Cards + 2 Extra 17th-century Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible 16th-century Art Cards \nMetallic Ink On Box & Card Backs (Both Versions of Tucks and Card Backs inside) \nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series (Inking Vary by Tuck Version) \nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nAfter the success of the first blue 1805 and the second green 1806 Cotta's almanac decks, again we come with two versions of the third yellow 1807 Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\".\nAs campaigns before, we are limiting this 3rd \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered). Both versions will include the same gold metallic inked card back design inside of the tuck box. \nThere are many historical values in the series of decks...\nThat's why the entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand as a \"collection of historical books\" with their mysteries and secrets hidden inside up to your findings...\nSeries of decks will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck \"book\" spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born. \nPuzzle Spine Image \"Digital Demonstration\" to present Ink Combinations of Both Tuck Versions\nIf you are interested in more information about historical details with a profound and beautiful story behind Cotta's Almanac playing cards creation and idea, or about the famous and noble people connected to these unique transformation playing card decks, you can find reading after scrolling down this project page. \nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers' work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink.\nInking and Tuck Design Inspired by Old Books\nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\nMuch of historical happenings, influences, and activities would find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves... \n Third almanac deck: \"Wallenstein\" (Year 1807) \nAfter the first blue deck themed on Joan of Arc play by Schiller, and the second green deck themed on Jean Racine's plays, which were translated into the German language by Schiller, here in the third yellow deck, again the images on the court cards are the characters from another Schiller's work, the three parts historical drama play Wallenstein centered around the 30 Years' War (1618\u20131648). In Wallenstein were embodied the fateful forces of his time.\nThe central figure - Albrecht Wenzel Eusebius von Wallenstein, sometimes von Waldstein (24 September 1583 \u2013 25 February 1634), is depicted as the King of Hearts. \nHe was a prince of the German Empire and a Bohemian (westernmost region of Czech republic) military leader and statesman who fought on the Catholic side during the Thirty Years' War of which he was a major figure. \nHe belonged to the men of the Renaissance and the world of the Baroque, but also he stood above these categories as an exceptional individual. Raised bilingually, he went beyond Czech or German nationality, beyond Catholic or Protestant denominations.\nHis successful martial career made him one of the richest and most influential men in the Holy Roman Empire by the time of his death. Wallenstein became the supreme commander of the armies of the Habsburg Emperor Ferdinand II.\nFor his successes, Wallenstein became an Imperial count palatine and made himself ruler of the lands of the Duchy of Friedland in northern Bohemia.\n\"Wallensten Herzog zu Friedland\" (Lettered on King of Heart Court Card)\nIt's not all just about Schiller's famous works...\nAs the first blue and the second green deck before, also this third yellow deck was threaded by majestic and noble roots, nay of one more person... Besides the noble publisher of the deck, Johann Friedrich Cotta, there were two other persons involved in the graphical part of this deck creation. \nJohann Friedrich Cotta (April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832)\nFor the third time, again, cards were designed and stipple engraved by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824).\nProbably, she was creating illustrations for decks in Stuttgart (detected from letter communication addressed to her mother in Britain that contained writings about the Cotta's decks...), and so there in Stuttgart, she might put additional historical value into her playing cards creation by mutual cooperation due to her artistic passion & connections network - images on cards of this deck were mostly based on sketches and preliminary brush drawings by well-known Christian Wilhelm von Faber du Faur from Stuttgart. \nNot only from a noble baron family with French roots of ancestors, he was an army officer, soldier, and lieutenant in the 25th Division, which was the W\u00fcrttemberg unit during the Napoleonic Wars, and also a painter focused on the war theme. \nHis involvement is indicated by writing at the base of the 10 of Clubs, which says \"Christian Faber du Faur inv. et del.\" \nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs. \nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nAces\nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nSpades\nHearts\nClubs\nDiamonds\nIn contrast to previous Cotta's decks issues where the court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King, here on the court cards of this 3rd issue, Jack and Queen are not described, only King is described with Crown at upper Left.\nThe central figure of Albrecht von Wallenstein, the Duke of Friedland who served the Holy Roman Emperor in the Thirty Year's War, is represented as the King of Hearts. \nAlso depicted are his general Christian von Ilow (\"Illo\", King of Spades), and his lieutenant Octavio Piccolomini (King of Clubs). Instead of following his intelligence, Wallenstein foolishly followed his astrologer Baptista Seni (Jack of Hearts). By his many schemes involving multiple countries, Wallenstein eventually found himself in a position where nobody could trust him. Piccolomini was one of Wallenstein's assassins, along with the English captain Walter Devereux (Jack of Clubs). Other contemporaries of Wallenstein that are depicted include his wife, the Duchess of Friedland (Queen of Hearts).\n\nSome characters blur the line between fiction and reality. This includes Countess Terzky (Queen of Spades), who in real life was Wallenstein's wife's sister, but takes on fictional actions in Schiller's play. Wallenstein's secretary Newman (Jack of Spades) also makes an appearance, but in the deck becomes the fictional cavalry captain and assistant of Count Terzky. Max Piccolomini (King of Diamonds), the son of the killer Octavio Piccolomini, is also a fictitious character. The same is true of Wallenstein's princess and daughter Thekla (Queen of Diamonds), her servant von Rosenberg (Jack of Diamonds), and her lady-in-waiting Fraulein Neubrunn (Queen of Clubs). \nNeumann (Cavalry Captian, Terzky\u2019s adjutant) \nGraefin Terzky (Countess, Sister of the Duchess) \nIllo (Field Marshal, Wallenstein\u2019s Confidant)\nSeni (Baptista Seni, Astrologer)\nHerzogin zu Friedland (Duchess, Wallenstein\u2019s wife) \nWallenstein Herzog zu Friedland (Duke, Imperial General in the Thirty Years\u2019 War)\nDeveroux (Walter, Captain, Irish Assassin of Illo, Terzky and Albrecht von Wallenstein) \nFraeulein Neubrunn (Lady Companion to Theckla)\nOctavio Piccolomini (Lieutenant General) \nv. Rosenberg (Von Rosenberg, Equerry/Ostler to Theckla)\nTheckla (Princess Friedland, Daughter of Wallenstein's)  \nMax Piccolomini (Octavio's Son, Colonel of a Cuirassier Regiment) \nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created most of the Cotta's decks... \nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided) \nAdd-ons will be made available post campaign based on availability.

Each deck would focus on a different theme...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \n\nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks...\nThe color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller.

Over time, you did it less and less: first homework, then the stress of a new job, then...you just didn\u2019t. You were good at drawing once. Never great, but good\u2014and it brought you so much joy. Joy is hard for you to come by these days.\n\nSo begins your journey in below, a solo journaling game about getting lost in a strange, uncomfortable place. Over the course of 10 days, you'll explore a remote area you find yourself trapped in. In responding to the journaling prompts, players are encouraged to draw parts of their responses, even if you don't think that your drawing skills are good. This is a game for you about falling out of your comfort zone.\nIt's important that players understand that below addresses many topics that could be upsetting to players. The narrative of the game addresses depression through metaphor, and as such, for players who aren't in a good place mentally, it may not be the game for you right now.\nIn below, you play someone exploring an area they used to love but no longer feel connected to. At the end of the first day, you fall into a dark, unfamiliar region and cannot find a way out. Over the course of the ten days of the game, you'll keep a record of your explorations through words and images as you endure.\nContent Warnings: below addresses, through metaphor, depression and the disconnection that comes along with it. There are prompts that address falling, being lost, not having food or water, nearly drowning, and harm to an animal caused by predation and its resulting suffering.\n\nThe game will be emailed to you on December 21st, the darkest day of the year. (The rewards say January, but that's because Kickstarter doesn't allow the rewards to be promised for the same month as the campaign.)\nThe writing for the game is finished, and I'm currently doing final playtesting on it. It will be ready to go before the end of the campaign.\nIn terms of art, there's only the cover image for Fergus to do, and they've already taken care of that.\nFergus Ferguson (any pronouns) - Cover Art - is a student and artist, dual majoring in computer science and fine arts at Tufts University. When they are not studying or drawing, they like to play tabletop games, read sci-fi, and tell everyone how great their betta fish is. They can be found on Twitter (@fergusfergyferg).\nDoug Levandowski (he/him) - Design, Writing & Layout - is a teacher and game designer from New Jersey. He has worked on larger RPGs such as Kids on Bikes, Teens in Space, and Kids on Brooms as well as Kickstarter-delivered ones like The Wishing Sigil, Agents of Dice-Ception, and, most recently, Arcane Zoo.

After each player decides which Survivor Character they wish to be, the group selects a Survivor Chapter.\nEvery Survivor Chapter drives a unique story, prepares the board and outlines directives. Some chapters are solitary incidents, and some chapters are part of expansive story arcs that follow a survivor on their saga.\nGame play gets very hands on after this point.\nEach player will gather their first personal bit of biometry by measuring their hand span from thumb to little finger with the built-in ruler. This information is used by the ZOMBIE Framework which is expressed in greater detail further down the page in Ground Breaking Elements. The ZOMBIE Framework is the way this game connects YOU to the board and creates an intricate and dynamic gaming experience without troubling the player with complex calculations or classic pen and dice game mechanics.\nIn this game I decided to call the Zombie opposition 'Thumbies' as a tribute to this unique biometric system. Using the Survivor Chapter and everyone's hand spans the players will populate the board with some Thumbies that were hanging around before the players entered the scene.\nPlayers use a different Hand Span to determines how many items a player can carry in their inventory.\nDuring your quest to survive you will collect hundreds of useful and sometimes not so useful items. Players will need to determine what items they need to keep and which items they must discard or trade. Discovery and circumstances play an important role during every session \u2013 what might have been the game-winning resource management strategy for one session becomes the tragic miscalculation for another. This is one reason why chapters are so addictive and re-playable.\nThe game begins once players finish agreeing who gets which items from the load out deck.\nFound item cards are obtained from Thumbies.\nAnd Board Stock Cards are item cards obtained from specific storage locations situated around the game board.\nThese locations are often locked and require keys or codes to open.\nCards with expendable supply like guns, ammunition and first aid use a tally system situated on their edges instead of small resource tokens that always seem to go missing between game sessions.\nThe tally system on the cards interface with your player board. This is where a player stores their active items, player and survivor card and keeps track of their level and current health.\nAs players make kills the Thumbie tokens are placed in the Player board to count levels, unlocking Survivor Cards. Players draw their Survivor Card at random sometimes finding that a good trait has materialized or a disadvantageous trait has developed. Don't worry, at higher levels player's will have a chance to replace survivor cards as their character becomes more battle hardened.\nDuring game play players try and meet the victory conditions of their Survivor Chapter while pesky Thumbies pour into the game area using the ZOMBIE Framework.\nSometimes unanticipated events are drawn instead of items making hordes of Thumbies pour in or the dreaded All-thumbs Monster to amalgamate. Such examples of events can prove to be a tipping point for survival, and necessitate the groups consensuses to change strategy or perish in disorganized confusion.\nWhen a player gets hit they attribute the damage on their player board condition monitor moving the token on their handy player board.\nThumbies transcends the static game experience again by placing your personal biometrics on the line. The player board condition monitor corresponds to your characters ability to move and function in-game. The result is transmitting game damage into the allowable finger combinations a player is permitted to utilized for actions like, movement, rescuing and attacking.\nUsing the ZOMBIE Framework\u2122 Thumbies\u00ae has broken away from traditional Hex or grid based combat systems liberating the combat experience using an organic versatility. Even attacking is hand rationalized!\nTabletop beginners and veterans will enjoy the quick resolution and sublime game mechanics of Thumbies. And those who are truly paying attention for the high stakes pay-off can capitalize on such game changers with the Build Plan system facilitated by random draw and careful inventory management.\nThumb-mart is the first step on our ambitious journey to bring you more game sets in the Thumbies Series. This game set support hundreds of hours of gaming and exportation, character building and memorable close shaves. It is our goal to provide the most fun and creative gaming experience we can muster; and so Thumbies : Thumbmart was also designed to be integrated with future game sets. Each a stand-alone collection in their own right every set has the ability to link to other sets forming a veritable landscape of epic game play using the ZOMBIE Framework.\nTwo such game sets are already in the works and will be announced early next year. Linking is an option to uncover more story, unlock tiered difficulty chapters and experience the option of longer epic game-play using the special Aftermath Challenges.\n1 Player Solo up to 8 Players Team Game Play\nThumbies\u00ae is engineered to respond to any number of players from a single individual up to eight players using measuring elements obtained at the beginning of game play.\nInnovative Player Board\nThe player board is a cluster of ideas made possible by a tri-layer board developed to alleviate the need for counting chits, counters or pen and paper record keeping. Rationed or expended items use a notch based tally system built into the board keeping the item card in place so a visual representation of its stock can be tallied. Hollows keep a record of character level development with overlapping summaries to track advancement and save space. And the center hand print image with its hollows serve as a reminder to the player for which two fingers to biometrically use when modifying their movement span if and when their character is hurt.\nZOMBIE Framework Whitepaper\nThe integrated math and subsequent engineering model that governs the entire game is called the Z.O.M.B.I.E. Framework \u00ae a smart acronym representing the systems larger more technical name : the (Zone Operational Movement Biometrically Intrinsic Engine). This framework's chief founding purpose is to cloak complex statistics by providing an auto-calculated operation that can be interpolated into actionable game play mechanics like movement, combat, challenges, and other RPG derivatives like abilities. The effective cloaking provides the satisfaction of a statistically rich environment while lessening the computational aspect tabletop games often encounter when rationalizing elaborate game play. This effort, of course, was designed to elevate the gaming experience so players can focus on feelings and fun and let the Framework do the work.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 1 : Board Contour and Features\nThe geometry of the board is made using a series of underpinning theorems that relate to the playable area. Accounting for any number of players between 1 and 8, the individual variance in hand sizes, given trip-related journeys and coverage of selected game play mechanics; token size and weight, the coefficient of friction and zone based occupancy optimization. Mission instructions and card randomization complement these rules... and sometimes break them, thus making up a finely tuned and abstract difficulty tool.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 2 : Hand Biometrics\nTo increase the feel of player relatability to the environment, the ZOMBIE Framework took hand-measurements and turned them into operational character mechanics. The system could have used grid or hexed based models for movement and action resolution but that would have drastically reduced the work achieved in board design; especially considering the effort placed in accounting for the distribution of hand averages in contours and features. Furthermore it would have left out a delicious morsel of biopsychiatry that will be mentioned further in the paper.\nThus, hand biometrics are used to rationalize 100% of character statistics and activities making for an organic feel and a distinct and hitherto unimagined innovation in tabletop gaming. In Thumbies\u00ae digit length, distance between tips, segment lengths, grouping widths, span flexibility, closed and open palm sizes are all utilized biometrics. And due to the unique anatomy of the opposable thumb saddle-joint a special design was employed in this system that sets at the fulcrum of Thumbies\u00ae giving life to the game and its name-sake.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 3 : Board Based Assist\nThe ZOMBIE Framework does not require a game master or any user to move zombies one by one or do any ancillary accounting typically found in classical RPG and tabletop systems. Players can effectively move hundreds of tokens (zombies in this case) with one motion and the aforementioned contours makes them disperse in a meaningful way to create bottlenecking, pincer attacks and the type of movement we all might expect from a massive crowd of thronging creatures\nCulturally speaking the ZOMBIE Framework also acknowledges both the classic definition of zombie (Night of the Living Dead model) as slow shambling throngs but is versatile and robust enough to include other zombie types such as exploding, area effect, running attacking and gargantuation. These all appear in gameplay depending on the survivor chapter, and more continue to be invented as the next boards are designed and the script continues.\nZOMBIE FRAMEWORK ELEMENT 4 : Biopsychiatry\nThe ZOMBIE Framework gives the player an impression of survival because you can physically fight-it-out and make attempts to outmaneuver their foe. Players are connected to the game by the anatomy of their hand and associate their characters' limitations with themselves identifying with game play stronger than dice-deck-dial based systems.\nWe as humans are inextricably tied to learning with our hands and involving our hands when we think and do even when hands are not being employed. This cognitive fact has a biopsychiatry effect that only became realized during the alpha testing of the game. Simply put we felt more invested and tried to survive harder as if our life was on the line. The non-passivity of the game through the frequency of hand use was making us players emotionally chemically invested in the game and not just because we wanted to win but because we thought we could against any and all odds - a thing I realized falls off when you count the odds in traditional dice-deck-dial games. Making Thumbies\u00ae both a fun and fantastic gaming experience and a truly groundbreaking discovery.\nExact shipping will be calculated and charged after the campaign closes.

Project Astrala began as just a dream, I was tired of seeing overpriced off the shelf bluetooth speakers that catered toward looking fancy and cool instead of focusing on the sound quality. Early 2020 I was able to see my dream begin its steps to infancy as I was able to purchase my first 3d printer, mind you i had no idea at the time on how to effectively manage and use a 3d printer, let alone create a 3d file. So my information journey began. I spent weeks researching as much as i could on 3d printers until finally I felt comfortable enough to try to 3d print a file I had found on Thingiverse, now being the slight nerd that I am, my first 3d print was the Pokemon Lapras. After that successful 3d print I went on to finding more things I wanted to 3d print, but after a time I decided I wanted to try my hand at designing my own 3d files. That is is when I remembered about the off the shelf bluetooth speaker issue I had. So after tons of more research I jumped into designing my own bluetooth speaker, and being as I had already had a background in home and car audio I already had a leg up on where I wanted to go with my idea. So after several trial and errors and wasted filament I finally had what I had dreamed of, and Project Astrala was born. Now enough backstory lets get on to what you really came here for. Project Astrala is a 3d printed Hifi bluetooth speaker that utilizes a quarter wave transmission line enclosure for dual 2\" full range drivers being pushed by a 10w stereo Bluetooth BT 5.0 amp board powered by 3.7v lithium ion battery. Along with a few cosmetic options. But the primary focus is on the sound quality, Project Astrala produces crystal clear, clean audio and can reproduce some lower end bass frequencies that normally would not be heard in a 2\" full range driver, thanks to the enclosure style. Now after writing out a full blown essay, I would like to thank you for your future support and for the fact you took the time to read all of this.\nSincerly, Lantz Jones", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBudgeting and resource requisition may be the most difficult part, but i plan on buying in bulk as much as possible to avoid having to reorder and run the risk of out of stock items, and that will also assist in the budget since I can save by ordering bulk and making use of sales.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nI will be using PLA filament for the 3d printing process which is bio-degradable, made from renewable resources, is carbon neutral and can be mechanically recycled.", "creator_bio": "Lantz Jones\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am 26 years old and wanted to design create my own line of products.See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Project Recognition", "descp": "You will be recognized in the Thank You page, on my Store site, as a contributer toward Project Astrala.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "STL File", "descp": "You will receive the STL file to 3d print your own Project Astral Bluetooth speaker enclosure.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 55 or more", "title": "Base Model Project Astrala", "descp": "You will receive a Base Model Astrala Bluetooth speaker.

Thanks for your support in 2019, you helped us make our first project into ture, and it\u2019s in mass production and become one of most popular affordable resin 3d printers in market. With thousands of reviewing and feedback from uers in community, the next generation 3d printer is bringing out.\n\nThe majority of LCD 3D printers in market are built in 5.5\u201d 2K resolution of LCD screen, and the converntional pixel size of screen is 47.25um, is there any way to get a higher precision solution? If upgrade the 2K LCD screen to higher resolution for 4K, the pixel size will be driven down to 31.5um. Furthermore, if a pixel can be divided into 3 subpixels, the resolution in one direction will be as fine as 10.5um, which is a dramatic improvement over the 2K LCD screen.\nWith the algorithm embedded in Longerware, the UV exposure through each subpixel will be controlled accurately to deliver final 3D models with ultra-smooth surfaces and ultra-fine details.\nOrange 4K is born!\nOrange 4K is improved with one stand cover, built by metal body and dual liner guide, which is more stable and reliable. And it\u2019s integrated with 2.8\u201d touch screen, plastic resin vat with scale and simple levelling declined built plate.\nThe printed volume of Orange 4K is 118*66*190mm(4.64\u201d*2.6\u201d*7.48\u201d). Orange 4K is equipped with 5.5\u201d lcd screen, and there\u2019re color & mono screen in configuration, reaching at 4K resolution 812 PPI. When configurated with color screen, one pixel in XY direction is 31.5um; while update with mono screen, one pixel of X direction is 31.5um, but Y direction has driven down to 10.5um. Moreover, The LCD screen has been improved on manufacturing procedure, and coated with galss cover over the screen, which will be better on protection. \nOrange 4K will be compatible with LongerWare, Chitubox & Lychee slicer, and we will setup the default printing parameter for color screen and monochrome screen. It will be much easier for user to select and configurate the printing parameter. \nOrange 4K Color 3d printer is able to upgrade to mono screen as well, but need to update the firmware. When Orange 4K is configurated with mono screen, the printing speed is up to 2s per layer, which will be increasing by 300% to reach at 60mm/h. \nPLAY\n\nThanks 3DArtGuy designed of Archagnel with Diorama, this character miniature printed by Orange 4K Color was got an amazing quality. \nPLAY\n\n Please reach our update #1 to figure out 4K Color & 4K Mono Printer difference. \n Why Kickstarter? \nLonger has our own R&D team and has the design ability for hardware, firmware embedded, mechanical, and slicer development.  With months development and testing by our R&D team, the prototype of Orange 4K finally passed the test and printed with high qualified result. \n\nLaunching on Kickstarter is building the bridge between initial users and Longer, and we hope we will get more feedback from customers and even make more improvement before this printer push into market. The voices from initial users are important to us.\n Longer 3D was established in 2014 but started with 3d printing material and industrial 3d printers. With years development on R&D, we have accumulated our own hardware designed ability, software and slicing algorithm on 3d printers and got 50 patents on 3d printing. We launched consumer 3d printers in 2018 and built with our own factory, then marketing with LONGER brand since 2019. Now we have established 10+ foreign warehouses, two fixing centers in US and three fixing service in Euro to provide better support service for customers. We keep the ultimate pursuit with our value: With Longer, Make it Better, to provide better quality and more affordable 3d printers for customers.

With our mature supply chain and according with quality control policy of our own factory, we are confident that this new product will be delivered as planned; because we are not only for Kickstarter campaign, but for the market of resin 3d printers.\n\nHowever, we still need to face some challenges and unexpected exception occurred during this project. For sure we will resolve the problems finally and keep the promised we made because we have the ability of hardware design, decoding on programming and slice software development of our R&D department.

A little too late? Well, better luck next turn.\nThe game never stops surprising you, as every player plays it a bit different. So many strategies, so many variables, and a single choice that will decide if you get to win the treasure, or see it hauled away to a foe's ship.\nEach round, players fight each other for one of the many different magical treasures. During one's turn, the player has two choices: either play a card with a symbol of the treasure of the round, or skip the turn, waiting for better opportunities, or simply missing the necessary card to play. Players take turns clockwise, deciding on the best strategy to win the treasure. Once a player holds a treasure for an entire turn, he gets to take it back to his ship and gains its special effect. The game is over, once a player collects 4 different treasures.\nThe best part of the game is when you feel like a mastermind, like you've outsmarted all of your friends.  While everyone was fighting for the treasure, you were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Just when one of your friends was about to take the treasure back to his ship, you laugh at his face and curb his expectations, by taking the treasure into your own hands. You feel ecstatic, you are about to win the game. And just at the moment when you think that you had it in the bag...

You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter?

It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed.

It is a work of art divided into 54 unique and individual pieces that bring an entire universe to life. As in the master\u2019s works, all the corners of these cards hide carefully illustrated details for an impressive composition. Those who back the project will also receive an exclusive 55th card paying tribute to M.C. Escher where Bosch characters go up and down his impossible staircase, thus combining the style of both masters.\nClose to one and a half years in the making, this is the one deck that I am most proud of.  Whether you are a playing card collector or a  puzzle lover or an art collector, this 100% custom deck has got something for each one of you. These art playing cards are my passion, but they'll never become a reality without your support. Won't you join me while we explore the world of Hieronymus Bosch?\nBosch Puzzle Playing Cards- Collector's Edition\nFEATURES:\nA transformation* deck of Playing Cards - basically the \"Iron Man\" of custom playing card design\n54 piece Polyptych magical Puzzle \nEach card is a self-contained picture, but laying the cards out in a specific sequence transforms the entire deck into a single large artwork masterpiece. \nA Kickstarter exclusive 55th card that is the world's first masterpiece combining M.C. Escher's work with Hieronymus Bosch - Only available to backers of this project & this special card won't be available in the leftover decks, so you won't like to miss it. \nReaching the funding goal will ensure a print run of 1000 decks. \nPrinted by Legends Playing Card Company on Classic Finish with Performance Coating\nElegant tuckbox with strategic embossing  done on the artwork & matte soft touch stock\n Numbered seal on every deck. Check the update#8 for more. Handnumbering the tucks is also being considered as an option. \nPoker sized (3.5\" X 2.5\") & traditional cut\n Augmented Reality (AR) experience available (on Apple & Android devices)\nGet this Collector's Edition deck at a discounted rate when you pledge on Kickstarter\nShipping & Fulfillment by Gamblers Warehouse, Texas, USA who are the leaders in Kickstarter fulfillment\n *A transformation playing card (sometimes referred to as a transformation deck when assembled into a complete set) is a type of playing card where an artist incorporates the pips of the non-face cards into an artistic design. \n\n\n\nA pic from the Prototype deck\nThe unreality of living in a COVID-19 world, an unprecedented experience that contradicts the reality we have known, is like living in a Bosch painting ... Particularly relevant today, however, are the people encapsulated in bubbles, remindful that we now live lockdown indoors, and outdoors with faces masked.- David Lenefsky, law.com\nAugmented Reality \nThe cards offer an Augmented Reality (AR) feature that will transport you back to the 15th Century artwork of Hieronymus Bosch. App available on both Apple & Android devices. See the demo below to know more:\n\nThe Inspiration\nAll of Hieronymus Bosch's seminal works were closely studied and explored for hundreds of hours. Bosch Playing Cards is a 100% original work of art that combines a number of Bosch's works in an entirely original manner.  This makes it a unique and art masterpiece, which is now available to all Kickstarter backers.\nThe Garden of Earthly Delights\nThe Temptation of St. Anthony\nThe Last Judgment\nShip of Fools\n\nPuzzle & the Art\nThe polyptych puzzle playing cards is an ode to the legacy of Hieronymus Bosch.  Each card is an individual piece of art while placing the 54 cards together transforms these individual parts into a single larger masterpiece. \nThe cards combine the essence of a transformation deck, in which the suits interact in the scene as elements integrated into it, with the nature of a puzzle deck, in which the dynamism of the characters is accentuated by their connection with those depicted in the other cards they are connected to. The Bosch deck is not only a deck of fine art playing cards, but it is a magical puzzle too. When placed together in the right sequence, the entire deck of 54 cards transforms itself into a single bigger masterpiece. A perfect gift for family gatherings & parties, I've even used it as a challenge to solve while in isolation during these COVID days. \nAre you ready to solve it in record time?  Check the online demo of the puzzle @ tabletopia here:  https://tabletopia.com/games/bosch-puzzle\nPolyptych Puzzle incorporates 54 cards in a specific sequence to form a bigger masterpiece\nLet pictures do the talking now.\n\nThe 55th card is a Kickstarter exclusive, available only to backers of this project.  The illustration on this card is inspired by one of the most renowned works by MC Escher, the Escherian Stairwell, but adds Hieronymus Bosch's special touch to it, thus making it an ode to both masters. Just as Escher reproduced one of Bosch's works in 1935, so the completely original artwork on this extra 55th card is an attempt to reproduce one of Escher's prolific works, through the lens of Bosch. Only available as the 55th card to the backers of this Kickstarter project. \nKickstarter exclusive 55th Card - A tribute to M.C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch\nKickstarter exclusive 55th card (enlarged) - Inspired by M.C. Escher and Hieronymus Bosch\nCard back\nFine art tuckbox with matte finish and strategic placed embossed artwork\nTuckbox layout with embossed artwork in blue\n I spent hundreds of hours studying Bosch's paintings, and this helped me observe many small details in his work.  The following snapshots showcase some of those hidden details, which you will find reproduced in a completely original manner in this unique deck of cards.\nSmall details in Garden of Earthly Delights\n\nADD-ONS\n\nPlease check the following article on how to change your pledge amount to include add-ons.  https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005126814-How-can-I-change-my-pledge-amount  Still have questions? --> guruplayingcards@gmail.com\nBosch Mini deck\nMini deck sized 44mm X 63 mm (approx. half of poker sized deck)\n54 cards (52 + 2 jokers)\nLinen Finish & printed by WJPC\nTuckbox with matte finish.

These authentic limited editions uncut sheets of playing cards will be pulled straight off the factory press. They will arrive ready to be framed on your wall and will be safely shipped in a sturdy round tube. To add uncut sheets to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $44 (shipping included).\nWhen initial renderings of the Bosch deck were shared, a backer of one of my previous Kickstarter projects posted comments along these lines: \"This is the one painter that I would LOVE to own an original painting from!! Alas, so few known examples of his work exist, that I would have to have the money of a Russian oligarch IF one would ever come up for sale!  So instead I will have to settle for this great looking deck of cards!\"\nThe uncut sheet will have 54 cards (and not the Kickstarter exclusive 55th card) due to the special print layout required for the uncut sheet. \nMockup of the uncut sheet\nTo add uncut sheets to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $44 (shipping included).\nFine Art Archival Prints\nIntroducing the museum grade archival prints....A conversation starter....\nUsing Archival pigment ink system & museum grade paper (315 GSM acid free paper)\nAfter experimenting with glossy poster paper, linen canvas, poly-cotton canvas, and archival quality paper, I'm going with the archival quality museum-grade paper to produce one of the finest art prints available on Kickstarter. The minimum print run required at the printer is 10, and I will be taking the total number pledged on Kickstarter (and during the survey process) to keep the number limited. \nPlease message me once you've added either or both the art prints. First come first serve. Note that international shipping is high for shipping a large poster. I didn't notice that while putting the uncut sheet, but glad that GW called it out when I enquired about the updated shipping quote with them.  This is the reason for the price difference between International & US backers.\nBosch Archival Print\nBosch Archival Print\nPrinted on museum grade Archival quality paper\nSize: 61.4 cm X 57 cm\nThese will be shipped unframed in a  heavy-duty shipping tube via USPS\nTo add Bosch Archival Print to your pledge, increase your pledge by USD $90 (for US-based backers) & by USD $110 (for International backers)\nComes with a small GPCC logo and a digital signature\nBoEscherian Stairwell Archival Print\nA masterpiece that combines the works of two masters: Hieronymus Bosch and M.C.

(LPCC), and printed in Taiwan with their Classic Finish.  This is a softer and slicker paper, comparable in feel and handling to a Bicycle deck, but with a more durable card-stock.  USPCC is unable to print this deck with the given requirements, and LPCC is one of the few printers who can print this deck of the cards with the given layout for the uncut sheet layout, along with the full bleed artwork.\n\nSHIPPING\nEverything ships from the USA & I will be using the services of Gamblers Warehouse in Texas.  Shipping is automatically applied when you choose any reward tier and specify your country. You do not need to add anything extra. Avail discounted shipping prices when you pledge for any reward.  \nUSA backers - Free Shipping when you choose reward tiers of 6+ decks\nInternational backers - Only $10 USD when you choose a reward tier of 1-5 decks\nThis is cheaper than the actual postage fees, so I'll pay the rest out of my own pocket to help you get Bosch in your hands. \nGiven GW's expertise in fulfillment & shipping, I expect the fulfillment experience to be smooth similar to my past projects. The decks will be shipped from Legends factory in Taiwan to the USA and I am also absorbing some of those costs to get you an awesome deal when you back this deck on Kickstarter. That said, COVID has caused some disruption of shipping lines and I will be informing backers throughout the course of the project if any delay in shipping & fulfillment arises. \n\n WHY PURCHASE ON KICKSTARTER? \nFunding is really critical for all independent creators like me. Join me to help push the playing card world forward. Transformation and such art decks are a rarity these days. \nThe Collector's Edition has the Kickstarter exclusive 55th card that will be only available to the backers of this project and won't be there in the leftover decks. Once they're gone, they're gone! \nThe addition of a free micro deck is also unprecedented and available to the backers for free and only for the first 48 hours of this campaign. \n Unique discount, only for KS. Save money now by supporting the project. My previously produced decks are usually sold on Ebay at 5x-7x the price on Kickstarter. As an example, each card of A Motley Pack Transformation deck is sold for $24 each per card on Ebay. A few limited edition decks are not available anywhere. \nAll discounted Kickstarter prices will be increased in retail stores once the project is over, which means Kickstarter is the only place you can get them first and at this price. The leftover decks will only have 54 cards, so you won't get the Kickstarter Exclusive card from the world of Escher & Bosch elsewhere except on eBay where you might find this deck at a highly inflated price. \nHelp us spread the word via the \u201cShare this project\u201d button above.

Think of Kickstarter as a place where you can help support a project like this and in return you are offered a series of rewards depending on your pledge. Once you've chosen what type of reward you would like to receive, Kickstarter will ask you to register in order to record your pledge. They will safely set up your payment but you will ONLY be billed at the end of the campaign IF this project reaches its funding goal. Remember, if the project isn't fully funded during our Kickstarter campaign, you won't be charged a dime (and, unfortunately, the decks won't be published). You can always go back and change or cancel your reward level before the campaign ends. You can check more info about it here.\nWith the funding goal achieved, I will be able to take the idea to production and get this beautifully crafted deck across to all of you out there. Let's make this project become a reality, and turn this into a published deck! Thank you!\nABOUT GPCC\nThe vision we have at GPCC is to pay tribute to the great artistic works of the past.  \nMy name is Sunish Chabba, and along with my friend & illustrator Ishan Trivedi, I am proud to introduce you to  \"Bosch Playing Cards- Collector's Edition\".\nGuru Playing Card Company (aka GPCC) has already produced 7 successful kickstarter projects to date.  We have the unique accomplishment of having delivered premium quality products to backers across 25 countries, with the shortest lead time, all the while maintaining great communication with our backers at every phase of the Kickstarter campaign from to production to fulfillment.  I stand behind the production and delivery of the products shown above, and I am sure you will be delighted with the outcome. \nYou can read more about GPCC here: Brand Spotlight: Guru Playing Card Company \n In my life outside of GPCC, I work on digital projects.  But it means so much to have a tangible and crafted item in your hands to marvel at, and my goal in GPCC is to create exactly this kind of unique item for you.\nKEEP IN TOUCH\nGuru Playing Card Company on Instagram\nGuru Playing Card Company Website\nTHANKS\nHeartfelt thanks to United Cardists forum, BoardGameGeek reviewer EndersGame, Fes, Max Saiz, Colin Brady, Will Roya (playingcarddecks.com) & Lawrence Sullivan for their constant support & feedback. To Reetika without whose encouragement, this won't have been possible. To my previous Kickstarter backers who used to message me since 2019 on when will this be completed. \nSpecial thanks to Montenzi for his quick response to my questions. He is always willing and open to share both information & knowledge, a real asset to the design world. Thanks to Ben Jones from Elephant Playing Cards, because the Bosch deck started as an entirely different concept, but in the end became a polyptych puzzle. Ben had produced his Pipmen World deck a few years back, and as the Bosch deck is another polyptych puzzle-based deck of playing cards, a special thanks is due to him, since I took some inspiration from Ben's Pipmen World project for the mockups.\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've successfully produced & fulfilled 7 projects on Kickstarter. All of these were delivered to backers way earlier than the estimated date & I am proud to say that my projects on Kickstarter have got one of the shortest lead times in this as well as the whole Games category as such on Kickstarter. This coupled with frequent communication through updates ensure that you as backers are on the journey towards making the project a reality. I'm confident that this project will be able to meet and/or exceed the expectations from backers similar to my past projects.\n\nIf there are any speed bumps during production, I will do my very best to communicate with you about what is going on and how I plan to resolve any issues. Risk mitigation while maintaining constant communication with the backers will be my strategy for this project as well. COVID-19 is the biggest risk for the printing, shipping and delivery section of this process, and therefore I have put a much later delivery date than I actually anticipate.

This deck was also aimed to have well-known court cards, the interesting main character, and featured figures from classical antiquity, taken from sources such as Greek and Roman plays, as well as the Bible, which adds another historical value to its rarity.  \nOriginal illustrations were fiddling artworks - manually stipple engraved & etched on copper plates\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks! But if you are only interested in the deck details & images instead of history & backstory with additional description on the theme individually to each deck, then please skip about halfway down.\nCharming beginning of \"Karten Almanach\" series\nThe story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany. \nThe idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme, with the second set based on Racine's plays such as Andromache (1667), Britannicus (1669), Iphig\u00e9nie (1674), and Esther (1689), which featured figures from the history of classical antiquity, Greek and Roman mythology, Bible, ...\nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocketbooks for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with playing cards.\n The famous Cotta's publishing house... \nJohann Friedrich Cotta\nThe friendship that gave birth to the idea of Cotta's transformation playing card almanac decks... \nUnexplained stories, hidden mysteries, secrets...\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nIt is especially significant for the way it displays meaningful and inspirational happenings from the time; in this second deck, the theme may reflect something of the religious climate of the day, also with assumed depictions from the life of noble families, etc...\nJean-Baptiste Racine (*December 22, 1639 - April 21, 1699)\nSecond almanac deck: \"Andromache\" (Year 1806) \nThe images on the court cards are the \"Greek and Roman mythology\" characters mostly centered around the Trojan war and inspired by Jean Racine's plays such as Iphig\u00e9nie, Esther, Britannicus and the \"Andromaque\" (\"Andromache\") which was first time performed on 17 November 1667 before the court of Louis XIV in the Louvre in the private chambers of the Queen, Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, by the royal company of actors, called \"Les Grands Com\u00e9diens\", with Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Du Parc in the title role. Andromaque, as the third of Racine's plays, written at the age of 27, established its author's reputation as one of the great playwrights in France. \n*(We technically named this almanac deck the \"Andromache\" in its title for the main character \"Andromaque\" depicted as Queen of Spades, same as Joan of Arc was placed there on the Queen of Spades card in previous blue Cotta's deck themed on Joan.)\nAround the time of Cotta's playing cards being produced, lots of creative people have found inspiration in Racine's playwrights. The composer Andr\u00e9 Gr\u00e9try wrote a three-act opera, Andromaque, with a libretto based on the Racine play, which premiered in 1780. In addition, Rossini's two-act 1819 opera, Ermione, is based on Racine's play too.\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nThe central figure of Andromaque is depicted as the Queen of Spades, she is the wife of the Trojan military hero Hector, daughter of Eetion, and sister to Podes and six other brothers; her name Andromache represents \"courage\" and has a meaning of \"man fighter\". (And so she might be the most interesting \"main\" character of the second Cotta's almanac deck.)\nAndromache was taken from her father's household by Hector and they together fit the Greek ideal of a happy and productive marriage, which heightens the tragedy of their shared misfortune. Andromache portrayed the role of perfect wife and mother who, a full year after the destruction of Troy, fulfills the fate of conquered Trojan women in ancient warfare as a widow held in captivity with her young son by Pyrrhus in Epirus, and later a distressed mother who despairs at the murder of her son Astyanax... \nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed Finish\n52 Cards + 2 Extra Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible Cards\nMetallic Ink On Box & Backs\nCustom Seals - Numbered and Standard \nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series\nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\nProduced By Will Roya\nCotta's second deck was, as well as the first deck, designed by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single 'n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824). She was an illegitimate (twin) child who led a very colorful life and finally settled down somewhat after marrying Count Francis in 1797. (Probably, she was creating illustrations in Stuttgart.)\n2 Limited Editions\nAfter the success of the first blue Cotta's almanac deck, to meet your demand, now we come with two versions of second green Cotta's deck limited edition - the \"Numbered\" and the \"Standard\". As a campaign before, we are limiting this 2nd \"Numbered\" deck to only 1,000 copies of tuck which is the whole gold-inked with custom numbered seals. Additional \"Standard\" limited edition decks are created just with a slight difference on tuck designed with dark and gold ink combination and the same custom seals (non-numbered).\nThe design of both versions of Cotta's limited edition tuck boxes, the standard and the numbered, created by Azured Ox, have been inspired by the old books and published writers work using the gold ink on their covers as well as combined with the dark ink.\nWith the Elements of Heraldic Achievement...\nIncludes heraldry symbols connected with the family and past of the noble designer countess Jenison von Walworth who created the most of the Cotta's decks...\nThe entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand (as \"collection of historical books\") and will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck spine (left side of the box) to create together a nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born.\nSpine Puzzle Image of \"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck) *Puzzle Image of \"Standard\" Limited Edition is Dark-Inked\n *(These are just \"Digital Demonstrations\" to present ink combinations of both editions)\n*Puzzle Image of \"Standard\" Limited Edition Displayed (Combined Metallic Gold + Dark Inked Tuck)\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition Displayed (Whole Metallic Gold-Inked Tuck)\nSix Unique Different Card Back Patterns Designed, with Regard to Card Handling, Individually for Each of the Cotta's Deck Year Almanacs.\nClassic Style Borderless Full-Bleed Card Back Design with Luxury Feeling and Metallic Ink\nThe Same Gold Metallic Ink Card Back Design for Both Editions of the Cotta's Deck\nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nThe transformations on the number cards have no reference to each other or to the court cards (as well lots of them might be considered as an unexplained mystery).\nClassical, Historical, Mythological, Biblical...\nThe court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King.\nThere is evidence of T\u00fcbingen having a Jewish community in its past (e.g. the Middle Ages), but since catholic reforms were being enacted when this deck was being produced, this also may have been a motive for choosing illustrations that depicted classical and historical heroes and heroines mostly from Greek mythology, as well as the major roles from tragedies by French playwriter and dramatist Jean Racine, such as Andromaque, Iphig\u00e9nie, Esther, and Britannicus.\nAhasuerus (King of Spades) is the Biblical name for Xerxes, the King of Persia who died in 465 BC. Other Biblical characters include Esther (Queen of Clubs), Xerxes' wife and Jewish heroine who rescued her nation from the evil Haman; and her uncle Mordecai (Jack of Hearts). Agrippina the Younger (Queen of Diamonds) was Nero's mother, while Sextus Afranius Burrus (Jack of Spades) was a Praetorian prefect, whom Agrippina helped to his position under Claudius and Nero.\nMythical characters include Andromache (Queen of Spades), the wife of Hector of Troy, described in the famous Iliad; Ulysses (King of Hearts), the Greek leader and hero from the Odyssey; Agamemnon (King of Diamonds), leader of the Greeks in the Trojan War; Iphigenia (Queen of Hearts), Agamemnon and Clytemnestra's daughter; Orestes (Jack of Diamonds), their son who kills his mother and her lover for murdering his father; Pyrrhus (King of Clubs), son of Achilles, who is put to death by Orestes; and Arcas (Jack of Clubs), son of Jupiter and Kalisto, who was a servant to Agamemnon.\nBurrhus, tutor of Nero the Emperor, Agrippina was Nero's mother and she helped Burrhus on his position; \nAndromache, the wife of the Trojan military hero Hector, daughter of Eetion, and sister to Podes and six other brothers, she was held in captivity by Pyrrhus; \nAhasuerus, King of Persia\n Mordecai, Uncle to Esther\nIn Greek mythology, Iphigenia was a daughter of King Agamemnon and Queen Clytemnestra, (and so sister of Orestes), and thus a princess of Mycenae.\nOdysseus, Greek hero also known by the Latin variant Ulysses\nArcas, servant to Agamemnon\nEsther (Queen of Persia) is described in all versions of the biblical Book of Esther as the Jewish queen of a Persian king Ahasuerus. In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. \nNeoptolemus, also called Pyrrhus, was the son of the warrior Achilles and the princess Deidamia in Greek mythology, and also the mythical progenitor of the ruling dynasty of the Molossians of ancient Epirus.\nOrestes was the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, (and so the brother of Iphigenia). He is the subject of several Ancient Greek plays and of various myths connected with his madness and purification, which retain obscure threads of much older ones. \nAgrippina, widow of Domitius Enobarbus father of Nero, & from the second marriage, widow of Emperor Claudius\nIn Greek mythology, Agamemnon was a king of Mycenae, the son, or grandson, of King Atreus and Queen Aerope of Mycenae, the brother of Menelaus, the husband of Clytemnestra and the father of Iphigenia, Electra or Laodike, Orestes and Chrysothemis. Legends make him the king of Mycenae or Argos, thought to be different names for the same area. When Menelaus's wife, Helen, was taken to Troy by Paris, Agamemnon commanded the united Greek armed forces in the ensuing Trojan War.\nAt last, we came with an idea to reflect the opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso, we thought it could be interesting to put other illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as an exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\n An absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double-sided)\nWith help from you the backers we plan to produce the entire 6 deck series! The color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\n\"Numbered\" Limited Edition\n\"Standard\" Limited Edition (Non-Numbered)\nAdd-Ons will be based on availability and will be announced after the campaign.

Thank you very much for your interest in the project\nZOMBIE APOCALYPSE is my third Kickstarter, this project consists of a set of zombie-themed characters and terrains.\nFor only \u20ac 18 (65 for commercial license), you would have:\nPACK ALL IN + STREACH GOALS + SPECIAL STREACH GOALS\nAll of this means 45 miniatures (including terrain pieces) and a diorama.\n The city is infested with zombies and monsters, work to survive this pitched battle. Unfortunately, the number of zombies is much greater than the number of survivors.\nYou will receive the digital files. These models are ideal for resin printers, but also suitable for FDM printers.\nThese characters can be used in wargame games or to make your own made-up campaigns.\nAll the characters have been modeled with the 3D modeling program Zbrush, I have been a digital modeler for 2 years, I had previously made collectible figures, you can see my previous works in the artstation link below.\nhttps://www.artstation.com/ismaelpanaderogarcia\nThis kickstarter focuses on creating a world and characters inspired by the zombie theme, creative and memorable adventures that we can now produce in our fantasy role-playing games and board games.\nIf you love printing and collecting 3D printable figures and miniatures as much as I love sculpting them, this Kickstarter is definitely for you. With your support, we can unlock more and more figures and new stages.\nThe figures can be printed 1)complete with the base and 2)the base and the figure separated, for the more complex figures, it can also be printed in parts (you can see the example photo)\nWhat will you receive?\nEach figure has been exported as a high quality STL file. Also, you will have two options when printing each character, since the file will include a solid piece and other cut pieces, so you can print the whole character, or print it in pieces, the files are 100% scalable. The stl file of each character will be sent in two different sizes, 32mm, 54mm, as you can see in the photograph.\nProducts will be delivered 20 days after the end of the Kickstarter.\nTo show the expected level of detail, below is a sample gallery of prints made.\nHere are the elastic targets for this campaign.

The original campaign can be viewed here - https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/epicsnstuffs/the-dwarves\nEpics 'N' Stuffs is a DnD driven miniature patreon which creates a range of sculpts from varying parts of the lore with their own unique style.\nWe've had many requests for late pledges and merchant tiers, the original campaign also went beyond the final deliverables of 49 Models (including the base Dwarves and Stretch goals). This campaign will deliver those original assets committed plus additional variants/models as well as a Merchant tier facility. That's a lot of fully supported Dwarf models in 2 size variants.  ***This is a digital only Campaign***\nThe Assets in this bundle won't be offered again at this insane price so get it whilst you can!!!\n A BIG THANKS!!!\nWe'd also like to thank everyone in advance of their support, especially those who backed our original Dwarf campaign and our patrons over @ Epics 'N' Stuffs Patreon. Thanks to your support, and that of Kickstarter we've been able to offer the Dwarves from the original campaign PLUS MORE! to new people within the community. Thanks again, it means a lot.\nAny Questions?\nIf you have any questions please refer to the FAQs at the bottom of the campaign page or alternatively DM us directly or email us over at epicsnstuffs@gmail.com\nA couple of FREE .STL file's are available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. \n Toilet Paper Merchant - https://ln2.sync.com/dl/ab7ff7910/vy34g96p-fb7i98jv-93ahy2dk-hvpyp9z3\n Dwarven Rogue Variant 6 - https://ln2.sync.com/dl/73ebbe1b0/i3qirygq-5nvjfih7-ghj47jne-vmuj5sb2\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders for each Dwarf and some images of print results .\nBackers will receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\n Prints shown were made using an Elegoo Mars or Elegoo Mars Pro.\n\nAdditional variants for this campaign!\nPATREON X KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!\nIf you're a patreon backer over @ Epics 'N' Stuffs Patreon and happen to back either of the Dwarves Kickstarter campaigns you'll also get an additional model, the Dwarven Bannerman. All you need to do is either DM us or email us over at epicsnstuffs@gmail.com with your Kickstarter name and patron name/email. Once the campaign is over and everything has been processed/uploaded we'll send send you a direct link to the specific model. \nUpon a successful campaign/funding, Kickstarter takes 2 to 3 weeks to process pledges. Once that is done we will send everyone a direct message via kickstarter containing links/passwords to the library of assets for the campaign.\nFAQs\nQ, Why're you not offering physical tiers this time around?\nA. There are a few factors, time investment being the main one, printing, prepping, boxing, sending all the models personally was a large 'time-sink'. Also with Covid it introduced consumable shortages and delivery delays which both financially kicked us as well as ate further into the time we could have been using to make the models. It's not to say we won't do another campaign in future with physical assets, just not this time around.\nQ. Are the .STL's game size?\nA. They're provided on 25mm and 32mm bases (some on 40mm and 50mm like the King). These sizes are typically bigger then your normal tabletop, they're a good size to paint and play. You can always scale them in your slicer to your desired size. I typically use this .STL to help with that - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3649454\nQ. Can you not use 'insert service name here' instead of Sync?\nA. Sync, despite it's flaws, proves to be the most reliable in our experience. We have used Dropbox in the past and ran into a plethora of issues including long outages, and hard daily limits. Sync has no daily download limit and the files will be hosted for an extremely long time. We have delivered these files to over 1000 people with great results. Any issues please ask and we'll aim to help :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNone really,\nThe assets are all digital in this campaign and have already been delivered to a large number of people.

Secondly, I may have had an issue with your email address (both the one for Kickstarter and the one you supplied in the survey) - if I know about this then I have sent you a message through Kickstarter.

These should have come through to your emails so please check and if there\u2019s a problem let me know. The surveys are there to let me know which email address you would like the game sent to and if you would like the rules in all of the additional languages. When it comes to the email, you will receive you either 3 or 4 attachments : 1) Standard game sheets and rules (2 page pdf) 2) Advanced games sheets and rules (2 page pdf) 3) Kickstarter exclusive game sheets (1 page pdf) 4) Foreign language rules (still being formatted but probably a 2 page pdf) The foreign language rules will all be together so don\u2019t worry about letting me know which language you would like. I have had a couple of questions about the foreign rules so I hope this clears it up for everyone. If it doesn\u2019t or it triggers any more questions please message me so I can try and help!

Your souls have been shattered, and the only way to wake up is to collect Soul Fragments by traversing your nightmares. But watch out, because the Sandman will haunt you trying to consume your remaining Soul Fragments.\nTeam up against the Sandman or turn against each other. If the Sandman is killed, everyone wins. But if one of you wakes up first, they win, while the other players stay trapped in the nightmare forever, left as a feast for the Sandman.\nTry this game of cooperation, conflict, betrayal, and nightmares \nWHAT IS SPECIAL ABOUT SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a game with a unique atmosphere and fast and dynamic gameplay. We played a lot of board games, card games and tons of RPGs and wanted to create an easy to learn game that relies on a universal language (uses just symbols and icons for all actions - which are easy to learn). The game is also full of tactics and options and demands a mastering of the possibilities and choices as it can be a game of cooperation, individual play, or backstabbing while you play as the Sandman\u2019s undercover ally.\nEasy to learn and easy to dive in mechanics even for inexperienced players\n  Card use easy to learn and accessible symbols\n  A dynamic, fast, and intense system\n  The game is for 2-4 players\nHOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT\nSleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It\u2019s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?\nIn Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players\u2019 next move or even worse, the Sandman\u2019s!\n\n A video of the gameplay can be seen here: \nWHY KICKSTARTING A PRINT TO PLAY VERSION\nThis is a sort of a pre-campaign; we would like to polish the rules to their perfection and what better community to do that than the Kickstarter gaming army? Also, Kickstarter is a good way of spreading the word about the game.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber.

Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates.

Our stretch goal items (if any) are determined by us before the campaign begins, in the event all of them are achieved we will not add more as it puts our project timeline and cost at risk.\n3.

We can't promise to implement or act on every idea that comes our way, but we will certainly consider and listen to each one!\n4.

Any request for a refund after more than two weeks has passed, if accepted by us, will be subject to a 10-20% cancellation fee to account for KS fees and our administrative expenses. Please note that, anyone that does not complete the pledge manager by our required deadlines will not be eligible for a refund for any reason, including the assessment of additional shipping fees for expenses related to the delinquency of the backer completing their survey information.\n\nAbandoned Pledges\n\nWe require that our pledge manager and/or survey be completed in a timely manner so that we can process orders efficiently and on time. Completing your survey late at any point beyond the deadline we communicate AND/OR failure to pay shipping in a timely manner when the surveys are (re)opened, could result in significant delays in receiving your rewards, additional shipping expense, duties, taxes, or other fees to be paid by you, and you will not be eligible for a refund for any reason. We give plenty of time to complete the survey, so please do so in a timely manner to avoid any inconvenience or delay. Any survey that is not completed within 30 days from final fulfillment (defined as the last date of shipping of KS rewards for your region) will result in your pledge being considered abandoned and any amount pledged will be considered a gift in support of the project.\n\nBy pledging to this project you understand the risks, challenges, and pledge terms we have laid out here, and agree to be bound by them.

Each entry was written to spark the gamemaster's imagination and provide GMs with just enough to take the idea and make it their own! \n City Scenes. Pages 36 through 48 (plus the inside back cover of the printed book!) are packed with new day and night encounters. These encounters do not duplicate any found in the original Fantasy City Sites and Scenes book, meaning that this section greatly expands the gamemaster's number of choices when it comes time to randomly select a city encounter.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nOver 1,700 supporters came together to make the Fantasy City Sites and Scenes campaign a success! (Kickstarter page here.) Did you miss out on the original book project? Now's your chance to score both the original and the second volume at the same time! See the rewards, at right, for more information and to join in!\n\nThe Dungeon Crafter's Sketch Book is for the gamemaster who enjoys creating dungeons. (Kickstarter page here.) This 56-page book (60 including the cover, inside covers, and back cover) is filled with page after page of grids (hex or square, see the reward descriptions), space for you to draw your dungeon ideas. Scattered throughout the book are several random tables to inspire you as you create your newest dungeon. There are a limited number of print copies available; please see the reward listing for more information.\nDid you miss out on the Kickstarter campaign for A Dozen Sinister Rumors? Now's your chance to grab these 17 different PDFs and expand you collection of GM tools!\nIf you wish to buy single PDFs, and not all 17 of these titles, you can find each one at DrivethruRPG.\n***\nProbably the most common question that comes in every few weeks is: \"How can I get your books dedicated to the Star Wars newspaper ads of the seventies and eighties?\" The books are tough to find, so I am offering a handful of copies in this campaign for those who missed out on these books.\nSample pages from one of the three books. Each is 96 pages, 8.25\" square, and hardcover.\nI do not run an online store, so that means I rarely offer these books for sale. Still, there have been enough requests this month alone that I felt it was time to list these as a reward in this latest Kickstarter campaign. These are great gifts for fans of the Kenner Star Wars action figures of the seventies and eighties.\n\n\n***\nThe bulk of the artwork in this book is used under license from Shutterstock.com, created by Asanee Srikijvilaikul, Larry Jacobsen, koya979, NextMarsMedia, Oliver Denkar, Petrafler, Runa0410, Ryzhkov Sergey.

We have asked several  designers like you to propose us something, so whomever designs the best  one is hired!\"\nMinigolf Designer is a competitive free form puzzle board game for 1 to 5 players that plays in 60 to 90 minutes (around 20 minutes per players).\nAn example of Hole made out of tiles\nIn Minigolf Designer, players will compete to collect tiles representing sections of mini golf holes, and arrange them the way they want to form a 9 holes miniature golf course. However, in the end the players will gain more or less victory points depending on certain aspects of their mini golf course, and also depending on the number of people drawn on their mini golf layout.\nOne of the three Rulers used to present the tiles and hold the turn order\nTiles are proposed to the players ordered from the least to the most valuable tile (depending on the number of victory points that the tile provides), but this order becomes also the player's next turn order.\nThe game is simple and plays fast, as players do only one thing during their turn: pick a tile and place it on their mini golf design. After placing around 40 tiles, their mini golf course is complete and players can score them to declare the winner.\nExample of a complete mini golf course that a player can create during the game\nMinigolf Designer delivers a quite new player experience to board game lovers, mostly due to its free form aspect. The fact that you can create any design gives this feeling of freedom. You can actually play just by following your artistic creativity!\nBut it's not a purely artistic random placement of pieces either. The puzzle aspect comes from the challenge to assemble the tiles in a way that satisfies a bunch of preferences. However, there is no unique solution; with the 256 tiles present in the box, you can build millions of miniature golf courses!\nCompetitive players will also enjoy the game by trying to satisfy as much design constraints as they can, if not all (which is possible). There are 7 design aspects that could give you victory points, but none of them are mandatory. Therefore, both kids, casual players and competitive players can enjoy the game but in different ways.\n\"I personally like to play minigolf, and I always enjoy to discover the various obstacles every time I try a new minigolf. This was the triggering idea for this game. I thought the guys who design real miniature golf courses may have a lot of fun just to invent new obstacles and try to fit all the holes on the available space, in a logical manner. So I designed my game around this idea, and now we can all experience the same fun.\" - Alban Nanty (designer of this game)\nSince this is our first publication, we do not have a network of retailers to get Minigolf Designer to a wider audience, which means this may be your best chance to get the game!\nPlease note that the final appearance of the game components may differ from the images above.\nThe mini golf tiles are 4 cm (1.6 inches) wide. The cards are in poker format (around 6 x 9 cm i.e. 3.54 x 2.36 inches). The game box will be 29.7 x 29.7 x 9 cm (11.7 x 11.7 x 3.54 inches). The estimated weight of the box is 2.150 Kg (4.7 pounds) (with complete punch boards).\nHere is a video where Alban presents the game components (in their prototype version) while explaining the rules:\nAs you can see the turn is very fast. Players will need between 36 to 40 tiles to complete their design, which means the players will play around 40 turns before the end of the game.\nThe tiles are presented to the players on a ruler (with one more tile than the number of players), but they are sorted according to their number printed on the back. When a player pick a tile, she leaves her pawn at the same place. The order of the pawns on the ruler becomes the next turn order.\nTherefore, the more victory points the tile you pick has, the more likely you will play last in the next turn, leaving you with less choice in the next turn. On the contrary, if you pick a boring tile, or even if you pass in front of everyone, you will be the first player to choose a tile in the next turn.\nFamily Version\nThe above explanation is the basic mode, suitable for kids, family and casual players. This is probably the version you will play for the first time, to get familiarized with the game.\nAdvanced Version\nThe game also comes with extra wooden disks and cards, to play a more competitive version of the game. In this version, the players follow the exact same rules as the family version, but at the beginning of the game (and later during the game), players will have a chance to bet secretly on which aspect of their mini golf design they will more focus on. At the end of the game, the players can gain extra victory points, if they are actually better than the other players for the aspect(s) that they chose. However, this is risky, because if they are not the best, they will lose points.\nSolo mode\nThe rule book contains also some rule adaptations to play solo. In solo mode, the player don't need the Rulers, but still draw 2 tiles during each turn, for choosing one. They can pass, meaning not choosing one of the two tiles, but that makes them lose victory points.\nWatch a tutorial for a three players game, in advanced mode by JonGetsGames (in English):\nWatch a rule explanation while playing a two players game in family mode by Slickerdrips (in English):\nWatch a rule explanation while playing a two players game in advance mode by jPlay (in English):\nWatch a full game with three players (in English): \nWatch a full game with two players (in English): \nWatch a solo game (in Spanish):\nHere are the first impressions of  Slickerdrips (in English):\nOne Board Family has written a review of our game, you can click on the image below to read it:\n\nHere is a full game for 3 players played by JonGetsGames (in English):\nFor non English speaking videos, you can always click on the CC button to activate the subtitles, then click on the Gear icon and choose Subtitles/CC > Auto-translate > English, in order to get the subtitle in English (or any other language you like).\nHere is a quick rule explanation and opinion about the game done by The Boardgames Society (in French):\nHere is a review of the game prototype that we sent to the Youtuber Maurice Lapierre. In this video Maurice presents you all the game components and gives his first impression on the game mechanics:\nHere is a complete rule explanation, and game component presentation from the youtuber D\u00e1maso de Damasco y sus distracciones:\nUnlike many other board games whose illustration is made on computer, Minigolf Designer is really a game of art. Its original artwork was all paint by hand by our artist Gul. She painted 170 different tiles in 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches) format, even if we knew that tiles will be smaller in the game (4 x 4 cm or 1.6 x 1.6 inches).\nExample of the tiles painted by the artist\nWe decided to give away those pieces of art, already framed in a modern and sober frame. If you pledge at the \"The Game + One Original Art Work\" level, you will receive a unique painting already framed and ready to be displayed on your desk. The pieces of art will be randomly distributed to the backers of that pledge level, therefore it will be a surprise to see which tile you received. You can then try to find the tile in the game and maybe even notice some difference if the tile has been edited after scanning.\nAs we only have 170 painted tiles, we had to limit the quantity for this pledge level, so hurry up if you want your original art work!\nAn example of an original painted art work in its frame\nThe above picture is one of the possible tile that you may receive, but each available painting that we give away is different, so the image above is just here to give you an overview of the overall look. The tile that you will get will certainly be different. The frame itself should be the one displayed on the image.\nThe painting size is around 10 x 10 cm (3.9 x 3.9 inches), and the outside frame is a bit less than 15 x 15 cm (5.9 x 5.9 inches).\n\nOn top of the pledged amount, we will also count the likes that you can collectively give us on the social networks. We call these the social pledges. Each social pledge that you give us will be equivalent to HK$ 10. For now we will count those social pledges:\nBecome fan on the BGG page \nLike our Facebook page \nFollow our Twitter account\nShare the Kicktraq page of the project through the share button on this page\nThe counter of Social pledge on June the 18th 2020 is: HK$ 1640\nFor the Land cards Stretch Goal, we thought that it could be a great opportunity to let you leave your little imprint in the game. Even if the stretch goal is reached, you can still participate until the end of the campaign.\nFirstly, let me show you all the Land cards already designed and ready for the game:\nAll the land cards currently designed in the game\nNow, if you are interested, you can propose your own land cards!\nHere are the few constraints that you should follow:\nYou don't need to be an artist for your proposal, basically you just have to draw the grid\nThe land card should contain one, and only one quarter circle tile (whose side equals two tiles)\nThe number of squares/tiles should be between 34 to 38 (excluding river and lake tiles)\nYou don't need to assign victory points to your cards, we will do it according to the difficulty of the cards, and we will balance it with the other cards\nIf you decide to add a river, you should make at least two bridges in order for the player to be able to satisfy the circuit constraint\nAnd here are the rules for the participation:\nThe participation is only opened to backer (at minimum \"The Game\" level).\nYou need to submit your proposal in the form of an image. Post a comment to the project with the link to your image to do your submission.\nNo more than 3 submissions per backer.\nWe may ask you to adjust your submission, or decide to not use it, if the card has some gameplay issues, such as if the layout doesn't fit well on the cards, doesn't allow the player to complete his minigolf course, break the game in any way, etc...\nBy submitting a proposition you automatically authorize Thematic Games to use your proposal to be included and printed in the game.\nIf we have too many submissions, at the end of the campaign we will choose the one we prefer.\nYou can propose land cards until the end of the campaign. Once the campaign is finished, no more submission will be accepted.\nIf there's not enough submission at the end of the campaign, we will create the land cards ourselves. We don't know yet how many land cards we will add for this Stretch Goal, lets see the number of submission that we get first.\nHere are the suggestions we got so far:\nWe run this Kickstarter campaign through our company named Thematic Games. Alban has started up this company in 2015 for the purpose of creating immersive games and entertaining experiences.

The hook is, your powers come from your victims. When you eliminate an enemy, flip their card over to see what body part you have harvested from them. In competitive mode, each body part is also a victory point. In solo mode, you'll need them to survive. The body parts will also dictate the story's end.\nMake it personal: you have the option to name your apprentice using the printed PDF.

As we're all likely shut in and away from our gaming communities, this is a fun way to include a friend in your solo story.  \n\nIn this new story mode, you will also draft powerful cards from \"the Invert\". You play as Emily of Black Branch -- a powerful young witch who has learned how to manipulate portals of influence and ingenuity. \nThe print+play enemy board that comes with the new solo story mode has hit point columns.

The blue \"Joan of Arc\" deck is the first in a series of six famous decks we plan to release in 2020...  \nThe very first transformation deck issued by Cotta is from 1805. This deck is probably the most famous of all six, and is incredibly scarce. Original illustrations were fiddling artworks done by hand, on copper plates that were manually engraved with stipple and etching, and the cards were printed on linen period stock that was 97 mm x 69 mm in size, with blank card backs and squared corners at that time. Only the court cards were hand-colored, while the number cards used red stencils.\nCotta\u2019s transformation cards were very successful and became a role model for later transformation decks from other publishers. And since the card backs were blank, individual cards were sometimes used by the nobility as visit cards and for leaving messages, so these playing cards often became multi-purpose items.\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks! But if you are only interested in the deck details & images instead of history & backstory, then please skip about half way down.\n The story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal the most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany.\nThe atmosphere here is bursting with memories and experiences of the past. Visitors today can still enjoy the small stairs, narrow alleys, and pointed gables that shape the silhouette of old T\u00fcbingen on the way to its famous castle. T\u00fcbingen is home to one of Europe\u2019s oldest universities and even today combines the colorful bustle of an university town full of students with the flair of a restored medieval center and a touch of many ancient cultures. The Romans already left some traces of their presence here in AD 85, but the city itself dates from the 6th or 7th century. Little wonder that this city attracted many eminent notables and artists, who found it inspirational for their work. \n The idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme, with the first set based on Schiller's play Jeanne d'Arc, which was about the famous historical figure Joan of Arc. \nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocket books for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with a playing cards.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta (*April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832), publisher, industrial pioneer, and politician, the man at the helm of family publishing house J. G. Cotta (founded yet in late 17th century by his grandfather Johann Georg Cotta *1631 - 1692) from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, around 1804 went on to produce a series of six playing card almanacs in successive years from 1805-1811, with a new deck appearing in all but one of those years. \nIn addition to Johann Friedrich Cotta's high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity, he promoted even many reforms and supported talented individuals. It is also noticeable that in such period of his life he published numerous works of his own literature, political materials, and also yearbooks.\nCotta did have the goal of replacing the \"inelegant\" designs of contemporary German playing cards with a more artistic high-quality deck. But these playing cards were not intended for playing games with in the first place, but rather for stimulating discussion about the \"themed\" images on each of the cards. Each year the court cards were designed to represent another theme, while the number cards featured pictures that were largely independent drawings without a common topic, since they were especially intended as conversation pieces and depicted happenings.\nThe Cotta's famous house was the place, where among other brilliant German authors of the time, the works of Schiller and later of Goethe were published there in its journal pages, as well as journal's major contributor was Heinrich Heine, who with his early lyric poetry has inspired even composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert who set his works into music... \nSo the picture that emerges from this time in Cotta's life is that he was constantly engaged in thoughtful conversation with literary men, and enjoyed close friendships with leading figures of the day like Schiller, Huber, Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel, and others, many of whose works he published.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta's long term friendship with the famous German poet, dramatist, philosopher, and historian Friedrich Schiller was well known. In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the Horen, a periodical that became important for students of German literature. Schiller's goal was to use his work to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and \u201cto reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.\u201d It was as a result of this relationship that Goethe became part of a close circle of friends with Cotta and Schiller. Even today there is evidence at Cotta's house of Goethe having slept there. \nIt is probably this friendship that gave birth to the idea of creating a unique decks of transformation playing cards with the purposes of igniting discussion about the \"themed\" picture on each card. This was after all a time when people were open to such ideas, and producing a series of playing cards as almanacs for a continuous period of years was a natural development.\nWith help from you the backers we plan to produce the entire 6 deck series! The color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\nLimited Edition Decks\nStandard Edition Decks\nGoethe\u2019s spent years on his theory (built on wavelength theory of light broken into 7 colors demonstration after Newton), which became a personal obsession in his last years, and which he considered more important than his literary works.\nGoethe believed that colors arise from the interaction between light and darkness, light and dark edges along the spectrum; that colors are realities, phenomena of nature... His color theory was intended to be a paradigmatic model for natural science in general, and Goethe was concerned with the psychological effects of each color, as well.\nHe believed that colors symbolize different values and that colors have a clear effect on the mind and feelings. Goethe had little use for concepts of divinity or for systematic thinking. His theory formulated a psychological and philosophical account of the way we actually experience color as a phenomenon.\nMuch of historical happenings, influences and activities would later find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and of notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves. \nFor example, Schiller experienced a grave illness that led to his death, and this around as well as many more is even depicted in the playing cards from the Cotta decks. In short, there is significant evidence of such connections between the artistic pictures and the immediate context that produced them.\nIt is especially significant for the way it displays meaningful and inspirational happenings from the time; in this first deck, such as Schiller on his death-bed (Six of Clubs) or sadness of Goethe (probably depicted on Nine of Clubs), assumed depictions from life of noble families, etc...\n First almanac deck: Jeanne d'Arc (Year 1805) \nThe images on the court cards are characters inspired by Schiller's play \"Die Jungfrau von Orleans\" (\"Joan of Arc\"). \nThe central figure of Joan of Arc is depicted as the Queen of Spades, the Maid of Orleans who inspired the French army to victory, but was later burned at the stake.\nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed Finish\n52 Cards + 2 Extra Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible Cards\nMetallic Ink On Box & Backs\nCustom Numbered Seals\nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series\nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\n Produced By Will Roya \nCotta's first deck was designed by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single `n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824). She was an illegitimate (twin) child who led a very colorful life, and finally settled down somewhat after marrying Count Francis in 1797. (Probably, she was creating illustrations in Stuttgart.)\nWe are limiting this 1st deck to only 1,000 copies with numbered seals. We may print a small amount additional decks without seals to meet demand or for a special edition. \nThe entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand (as \"collection of historical books\") and will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck spine (left side of box) to create together nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born. \nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nThe transformations on the number cards have no reference to each other or to the court cards (as well lots of them might be considered as unexplained mystery).\nThe court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King.\nIn the first deck, beside Joan of Arc depicted as the Queen of Spades, other individuals closely associated with Joan include Etienne de Vignolles or La Hire (Jack of Hearts), who helped Joan to victory in the battle of Patay in 1429; and Raymond (Jack of Diamonds), a peasant who was Joan's page.\nKey political leaders who figured prominently in the events surrounding Joan's life are also represented, including King Charles VII (King of Hearts), the French monarch who relied on Joan's help to reach the Rhiems, the traditional place of coronation; Charles' mother Isabeau (Queen of Hearts), who was in league with Charles' enemy; Charles' mistress Agnes Sorel (Queen of Diamonds); Charles' opponent Philippe the Good (King of Diamonds), an ally of England; and the king of Naples, Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Clubs), who lost the kingdom after defeat in battle. General Talbot (King of Spades) was the English commander of the outpost of Orleans at Saint Loup, who was wounded in battle, captured, and was part of a prisoner exchange.\nBoth Joan's \"sister\" Louison (Queen of Clubs) and Montgomery (Jack of Clubs) are fictional creations of Schiller, while the fictional Lionel (Jack of Spades) is the character who holds up Joan's sword in a location revealed by the voices that she supposedly heard telling her to help.\n Clubs: Montgomery, Louison (Joan's fictional sister), Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Sicily) \nDiamonds: Raimond (villager), Agnes Sorel (Charles' mistress), Philippe de Bourgogne \nHearts: Etienne de Vignolles (La Hire), Isabeau de Baviere (Charles' mother), Charles VII (King of France) \nSpades: Lionel (knight), Joan of Arc, Talbot\nAt last we came with an idea to reflect opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso we thought it could be interesting to put another illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double sided)\n New Standard Deck Rewards\n Please note: Limited edition decks are no longer available for add-on. After the campaign, when I have a more accurate count, some may be available to add-on prior to fulfillment.\n The end of funding period for this first \"blue\" deck of the series is symbolically set to:\n Johann Friedrich Cotta's \n (256th) Birthday on April 27, 2020 \nAs of the launch of this campaign we have already submitted art to USPCC to prepare for print.  USPCC recently reported a 10 day shut down because of the COVID-19 outbreak but we are confident we can deliver this project by the end of July if they are not shut down for more then 30 days. If we do have a delay it will be  communicated with backers in a speedy and transparent manner.\n We have already put a significant amount of resources in making this deck possible. But if we can pass 20k in funding we will include something special for every backer or upgrade the deck in some way. \nMax Playing Cards\nWorshipful Company of Makers of Playing Cards\nWorld of Playing Cards\nUnited Cardists\nThe Magic Cafe\nKardify\nMagic Orthodoxy\nGentleman Wake\nEnder's Game Reviewer\nThe Card Club\nPlaying Card Collector's Club\nRepeat Super Backers\nFellow Creators & Social Media Friends\nMy Family & Staff\nFulfillment\nBy PlayingCardDecks.com with a safe delivery guarantee and emailed tracking.

Then you're looking for either the $1 (PDF) or $18 (print, U.S. only) reward levels. All of the other listed rewards are for those gamemasters who missed out on my earlier projects.\nDigital mockup.\nWhile working on writing the remaining PDFs to fulfill the A Dozen Troubling Rumors Kickstarter campaign (see the project page), I ran into a mental wall and spent a weekend staring at a blank page. No matter how hard I tried, my brain was locked and I found myself unable to write. The stresses of today's challenges had, obviously, dug deep into my mind and was blocking my ability to create.\nSample page spread.\nWhenever I have found myself suffering from writer's block before, I have discovered that shifting gears and working on something new is often the best way to get the creative muscles running again. So that is what I did, adjusting my focus to a collection of city sites that I thought would be both fun to create and a valuable addition to every gamemaster's toolkit.\nSample page spread, city sites.\nWithin a matter of hours, the outline for Fantasy City Sites and Scenes was locked down, and my fingers were jamming at the keyboard, quickly creating characters, places, and situations that were each designed to drop into a fantasy campaign. At times, I stitched together links between the newly-formed places and characters, doing all that I could to make the book a package that would instantly inspire gamemasters and add depth to any fantasy city.\nSample page spread, city sites.\nCity sites. Each of the sixteen locations detailed in the book is presented on a two-page spread (for a total of 32 pages worth of locations) and includes a few assorted details the gamemaster can use to add flavor to the site, as well as assorted other bits of info that vary from location to location to give the site a little personality. Hooks that may lead to adventure are sprinkled throughout this section of the book.\nSample page spread, city scenes.\nCity scenes. In addition to the city sites, the book also includes twelve pages of encounter ideas. Divided into two sections -- daytime scenes and nighttime scenes -- this section of the book is for those gamemasters who are looking to throw challenges at the party as they walk the city streets.\nDigital mockup.\nSo that we don't accidentally cause project delays, there will be no stretch goals for this campaign. I'd much rather deliver on schedule than risk running late with delivery of the rewards.\nI know that the lack of stretch goals will cause some of you to turn away, but I ask that you keep this in mind: The 52-page PDF reward is only a buck, making this a great deal for any gamemaster who enjoys running city encounters and adventures.\nFor those who missed out on the Dungeon Challenge Cards (details here), I am making those cards available as a part of this project. The Dungeon Challenge Cards final product is a 36-card deck, packed inside a custom tuck box. I am down to the last of the decks and currently do not have plans to reprint these cards. Maybe in the future, but not soon. \nThe Book of Unusual Potions is a 64-page saddle-stitched work that is 5.5\" (wide) by 8.5\" (tall) in size and includes potions, potion ingredients, and more. Presented in a systemless format, this book is for use with many fantasy roleplaying games and is as colorful in appearance as it is in the descriptions of the many potions described inside.\nPlease see the Kickstarter page for more information.\nAlso available in PDF at DrivethruRPG.\nOver the last few years, I have created four different decks of Outdoor Encounter Cards. Each deck includes 36 cards, and all of them share a common back so that gamemasters may shuffle the different decks together.

When someone is about to go home, and I say \"How about a game of X before you leave?\" They smile and sit down. They can't resist because they know:\nThe game is fast (like 10 minutes to play)\nIt's quick to teach (like get started in 30 seconds)\nThere will be tension and exciting moments\nIt ends the night on a satisfying note of getting in one more quality game\nThis game series exists because I want there to be more games like that. We've focused on easy to teach before, but these are SUPER easy to teach.\nBut there is enough strategy that after the game your mind will wander back to a couple of key turns, and you'll wonder if you should have played just a little bit differently.\nAnd they have those turns...\nThat turn in GPS where the spinner lands on the spot that helps you but not your opponents. \nThat turn in Sequoia where you have to decide if it is worth fighting for the best spot or better to grab multiple spots where there is less competition. \nThat turn in Mountain Goats when you bump the leader off the mountain right before they win. \nAnd Holy Toledo, these games are just $15 each. \nThese games were designed for adult gamers, but they are playable with the whole family, including kids as young as 5 with some coaching.  They're also great options when your non-gamer friends ask to play a game, and you want something that you can teach and start playing quickly.\nIn Mountain Goats you work to move your goats to the top of 6 different mountains where they can score points as long as they stay there. You can share spaces with other goats on the way up, but there is only room for one goat at the top of each mountain. If someone else's goat moves to the mountain top, they will kick you off and you'll have to start your trek over.\nIt's a game about timing. You need to not just get to the top of the mountain, but get there when no one else is in position to knock you off.\nIt's a game about keeping your eye on your opponents. Maximizing your score, but also making sure you don't let anyone else score too much.\nThere is the fun chance to knock each other off the mountain. But it doesn't feel too mean because you can only knock back goats that are in a scoring position, and it isn't a huge setback. It is just a normal part of the cycle of the game.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Mountain Goats. \n\n\nIn Sequoia you are trying to grow the tallest trees in 11 different forests. After your 10 turns, if you have the tallest tree, then you get the victory points from that forest. Second place gets a small consolation prize.\nEach turn, you get to grow two of your trees. Which trees you choose will determine if you win or lose. Do you keep fighting in a forest with competition, or start growing your tree somewhere else? You'll have to wrestle with the dice to grow the tree you want.\nSequoia is a game of choosing your battles.\nThe dice will always give you choices, but they will be hard choices.\nTies in each forest are decided by extra tie-breaker rounds that can lead to epic finishes.\nRead a draft version of the full rulebook for Sequoia.\n\nYou're launching GPS satellites into space. They need to orbit the earth in the correct order. But your launch windows are limited. You can only launch satellites where the spinner points each turn. It is your job to pick the best satellite for each launch to get your birds in order before your opponents.\nGPS is a game about how fun it is to spin that spinner. And it is a very satisfying spin.\nIt is a game about rooting for the rocket to land on your number.\nGPS is a game about putting yourself in a position where the spinner is most likely to help you.\n Read a draft version of the full rulebook for GPS.\nYou won't be paying for any extra air in your boxes. The games set up big, but they store small. There will always be room to shove one of these into your game bag.\nIt is a little bit shorter and a little bit wider than a box that holds two decks of cards side by side. It is also about twice as thick so the lid will stay in place much better.\n1. For the purpose of shipping, the 3 small games pack (GPS + Sequoia + Mountain Goats) will count as just one game.\n2. DO NOT manually increase your pledge amount to cover the shipping cost. It will make both our lives much more complicated when it is time to complete the pledge manager.\n3. If you want to pledge for additional games we publish, just manually increase the amount you are pledging. $15 for GPS, Mountain Goats, or Sequoia. $39 for the small games three pack. $34 for On Tour Europe and USA, QE, Bites, or Loot of Lima.\n4. Shipping prices will be the same during the pledge manager and you will be able to add more games then at the \"additional game\" shipping price.  \n5. The price of GPS, Mountain Goats, and Sequoia will probably be higher in the pledge manager. We want to offer Kickstarter backers the best possible price.\n6. Instead of offering a discount for buying a full case of games, we have steeply discounted the shipping rates for buying additional games. This way you can order the exact number of games your group needs.\n7. This campaign is Canadian, EU, UK, and USA, and Australian friendly.\n8. There are two main reasons the Canadian and European shipping costs more than US shipping. Since we ship fewer games to these fulfillment centers, it costs us more per game to get them there. And, we have to pay taxes when we bring the games into these regions so that you don't have to pay any taxes when they are delivered to you.\nEmail help@boardgametables.com if you want to carry one of these games in your Friendly Local Game Store, if you want to offer them through distribution, or if you would like to localize them for your country.\nChad is the owner of BoardGameTables.com and the designer of Sequoia.  Here are some games he loves that aren't getting talked about enough: Blockers, Capital Lux, Factory Funner, The King is Dead, Nations, Greed, Prospectus, Haggis, and Startups.\nKaty has to answer all your support emails and messages. So please be nice to her. With a wide range of gaming tastes she can be found playing Lisboa one night and a Harry Potter RPG the next. But it gets a little weird when she role-plays as a wizard during the game of Lisboa.\nAnca is the co-artist and graphic designer for On Tour, QE, Bites, and Loot of Lima. She has a poster featured in the Board Game Geek Artist series. Her husband and baby girl are always involved in the projects, from mandatory play testing and prototyping, to artistic suggestions. \nDaniel Profiri is the co-artist for this series. Whenever he's not illustrating board games, he's drawing photorealistic portraits and working on interior design projects. \nStefan Risthaus is the designer of Mountain Goats. He lives in Northern Germany and likes playing and developing games with history as a theme, but also quick fillers and family games. His wife also designs games and is the first and most important play testing person for his games.\nHartmut Kommerell is the designer of GPS. He has forgotten a lot of the math theory he once studied, but still uses the skills to design games and to puzzle around at work. With a 6-headed family, he can always test games with players of any age.\nEstimated delivery January 2021. Our normal math would project a November delivery. We added a couple of extra months because there is a lot of uncertainty right now, and shipping in November/December can add extra delays as everyone else is trying to get stuff in by Christmas.\nAs with all our Kickstarters, we will fully refund your pledge at any time before we ship the game to you. For any reason. No limits. No restrictions.\nRight now some people have some understandable concerns about the health of the economy and small businesses. It is our policy and will continue to be our policy to always keep enough cash on hand to fulfill (produce and ship) all outstanding Kickstarter commitments and preorders.\nThis is a short campaign, so don't delay.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEverything feels a little riskier than it did a month ago.

TFT is Steve Jackson's classic fantasy roleplaying game, revived thanks to the support of Kickstarter backers! Now, with your support, we will add two more books to the growing library of titles for The Fantasy Trip and open up new doors for gamemasters and solo adventurers! \nRead on to learn more about the two new books -- The Book of Unlife and Red Crypt -- and then select a reward level (detailed at right) to join the project.\nTo start playing The Fantasy Trip right now, please download the free Melee PDF from our online store: Warehouse 23. These rules will give you a taste of the much larger, deeper system that is found In the Labyrinth.\nThey are neither alive nor dead. They inhabit the world in between. But all too often the living are their prey.\nThe Book of Unlife includes 44 creatures for The Fantasy Trip (visit the official website), a guide to the general powers and vulnerabilities of the unliving, and a complete adventure setting, The Haunting of Holner House.\nUnlife is a broad term covering a wide variety of entities which are not \u201cliving beings\u201d in the traditional sense of the word. They may have once been alive, like Ghosts. They may be true \u201cundead,\u201d like Nosferatu. They may be animated forms, like Zombies and Golems. They may be entities of pure spiritual energy, like Poltergeists, or immortal beings from the unearthly realms, like Banshees. Whatever they are, they are not alive in the way life is usually understood.\nThe first part of this book, The Types of Unlife, is a guide to many of the known kinds of unlife. The second part, The Characteristics of Unlife, covers the unusual abilities that unlife beings may have, as well as techniques that can be used against hostile unlife creatures. The third part is an adventure setting that will bring the party up against several formidable unliving foes, as well as some living ones!\nThe Book of Unlife is a 64-page 8.5\" x 11\" book, written by Howard Kistler.\nYou study the face on the wanted poster. 30-ish, with ash-blond hair and a hook-shaped scar under his right eye. Jack Smoke.\nSmoke is a Redcap, part of a secret society plotting to overthrow the established order of wizards, priests, and guilds. Like many Redcaps, Smoke trusts gadgets or potions over magic. You heard he was once a priest who earned his nickname burning heretics. Then Smoke discovered his cult\u2019s \u201cmiracles\u201d were mere spells cast to delude the congregation. He lost his faith and turned against all wizardry as well, embracing the Redcap cause. What he didn\u2019t lose was his fanaticism.\nRecently, Smoke detonated a gas bomb at a town fair. It poisoned the wizard he targeted \u2013 and several children.\n\u201cUnfortunate collateral damage,\u201d said the Redcap communiqu\u00e9 that claimed credit for the assassination.\nYou intend to bring Jack Smoke to justice . . . and claim the 1,000 silvers the baron offers for his head!\nRed Crypt is a programmed adventure for a single character. It is designed for The Fantasy Trip: In The Labyrinth (available in both hardcover and print-on-demand softcover). If you instead have both Melee and Wizard, you can still play, with a few simplifications.\nThis adventure establishes locations, gives you decisions to make, and tells you the outcomes of those decisions. You will need six-sided dice, a straightedge, and scratch paper, along with counters and megahex tiles.\nSince Red Crypt uses only one player character, it can be played two ways:\n Solitaire: One lone player creates or selects an existing adventurer character. That character may acquire friends during the adventure, creating a party, but they are all run by the same person. When combat occurs, the book gives instructions regarding the foes in each location; the player sets up figures on a tactical map and plays out the battles, running both sides.\n Two-Player: One player creates a character (or uses an existing one) and plays through the scenario. When foes are encountered, the other player controls them and tries to defeat the adventurer. The second player can also act as Game Master (GM); they read the paragraphs and resolve rules disputes or actions not covered by these instructions.\nRed Crypt is a 24-page 8.5\" x 11\" book, written by David Pulver.\nPlease keep in mind that selecting add-ons will impact your total shipping costs. See the FAQ for more information. \n\nMore add-ons in BackerKit! In addition to the above items, we will offer several other games, supplements, and accessories during the BackerKit stage. We do not yet have the final add-ons list; we'll have all inventory counted and set limits on items in the BackerKit survey.\nInternational Note:  If you are outside of the United States and wish to order direct from Steve Jackson Games, please see our online store: www.warehouse23.com.\nNO REWARD NOTE: You must select a reward level to choose add-ons. As a policy, we do not make add-ons available to the No Reward pledges; in our experience, that leads to challenges and difficulties that cause troubles for all involved.\nNOTE: Street addresses only.\nAfter the Kickstarter project closes, and after all pledges are collected, we will open the BackerKit pledge manager. There, you will tell us your Warehouse 23 email address, provide your physical address, and pay for shipping (if you are receiving physical rewards). See the FAQ for estimated shipping costs.\nFailure to complete your BackerKit survey by the deadline (which will be announced in a Kickstarter update once the pledge manager opens) will result in a refund and removal from the project. We cannot allow projects to remain open forever; we must set firm deadlines so that we can properly close campaigns.\nIf you wish, you may choose to use a fulfillment service. This allows you to pledge for the project and then provide us with a U.S. address for delivery of your rewards. Forwarding from the fulfillment service, as well as any local fees, is your responsibility when using a fulfillment company.\nINTERNATIONAL DELIVERY NOTE: There are no physical rewards offer to international backers. If the project closes successfully, we will offer both titles through Amazon's print-on-demand service, which will make it cheaper for you to purchase the print books (shipping will cost a lot less). \nWe continue to search for reliable, economical solutions to international Kickstarter delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSteve Jackson Games is an established game publisher with a successful track record and we have enough Kickstarter experience to deal with issues should they arise.

Fourteen RPG Role-inspired Dice Towers! 3D printable, high-res, stl files, support-free for easy printing!   \nAll towers will be print-tested to ensure quality and ease of printing! \n_______________________________________________________________\nWhat you get for any ALL IN pledge (includes Loot All, Personalize and Merchant tiers.)  \n(Graphics are in USD $)\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> 22 UNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS! <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< \n_______________________________________________________________  \n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> BONUS: SOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOAL <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< \n______________________________________________________________\nNeed to test a file first?

The towers will be designed to be 3D Printed easily without supports! (Supports are the WORST!) Towers above 7\" (about 177mm) tall will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers.\n_______________________________________________________________\nThese towers will be design to print well on smaller FDM Printers! The towers will be designed to be between 177 - 228 mm (7-9 inches) high, the taller towers will be split into two models so they\u2019re printable on smaller printers. Being 3D models, they can be any size that your printer can support, so you can print them smaller (if you have a small printer) or larger (for large dice) if desired.\n_______________________________________________________________\nI don't have a 3D printer, how do I get a tower? I Although we won\u2019t be selling physical towers through this campaign, we will be offering a Merchant tier that allows the sale of physical prints of all 14 towers, plus ALL unlocked stretch goals. We\u2019ve been contacted by several makers who are excited about selling these towers, so we believe we will have a network of amazing makers who will offer printed products! We plan on listing all (opted in) Merchant info (location, url, contact info, etc.) on the campaign page (after funding) so everyone can find a maker to order printed towers.\n_______________________________________________________________\nWhy Dice Towers? Dice towers help to prevent cheating - and allow Fate do her job! Dice Towers also add an extra level of character to your game! Each tower will include a dice tray to help protect fancy pants tables from heavy metal dice damage. Lastly (our favorite) these Dice Towers inspire envy in friend and foe alike! \n_______________________________________________________________\nPERSONALIZE IT! For $75 you can add a one color logo or text to any Unlocked Tower! \n_______________________________________________________________\nActual REAL photos of the first 3 modeled towers: Wizard Tower, Fighter Tower and Rogue Tower:  (*All final towers will have dice trays.)     \n  (^ Creator of Fates End Dice towers: Kim from Kimbolt Creations ^)\n_______________________________________________________________ \nConcepts of all 14 towers: (*All final towers will have dice trays.)\n*Please Note: due to the unique design of The Weis & Hickman Tower, Dice Tray Stretch Goals do not apply to this tower.\n_______________________________________________________________\nTeam:\nKim Bourrie - Modeler, Graphic Designer, Motion Graphics, Creator (more info above).\nMatthew S.

I\u2019ve been 3D Printing since 2015 and modeling since 2013. In that time, I\u2019ve learned how to create models that don\u2019t require supports, rafts or high infill. (Honestly, complex creations that require supports are the BANE of 3D printing! Many swarings have happened in this house due to the struggles of printing items that require complex supports.) I have owned 11+ printers (no kidding!) We currently have 3 Prusa MK3\u2019s, a Moai, and a ShuffleXL. \n\nChallenge 2: Time\nSolution - Self-employed! Since the Fates End Dice Tower prototype has already been built (and hundreds have already been printed) I just need the time to create the remaining Dice Towers. I have the software, hardware, skill and experience, all I need is time. I am self-employed so I have complete control over my time!

So if you guys share the link on your social media, post it into groups and send it to people that might be interested in the project, everyone gets something out of it! So please help up reach more people by sharing the link above!\n\n\n\n\nWe heard your feedback and we went back to the drawing board. Townbuilder Unlimited is what we came up with.\nThe Townbuilder is a web application with which you can create custom 3D printable buildings for Tabletop Games. We provide detailed 3D models in the form of small building blocks that you can then use to create the perfect building for your table. All of our buildings can be printed support free and feature playable interior.\nYou can either start from scratch or modify one of our many prepared templates to fit your needs.\nPLAY\n\nWhen you back this campaign, you will get unlimited access to the Townbuilder, meaning you can build, download and print as many buildings as you want... forever. Depending on the reward tier you back at, you will gain access to different themes, which will be available to you in the Townbuilder.\n\nWe are working with  2nd Dynasty to bring SciFi into the Townbuilder! These tiles ARE NOT PART OF THE CAMPAIGN PLEDGES and will cost you 15\u20ac as an addon. For a lot more info check our update on this.\nWe have partnered up with the awesome folk from Arcane Minis who just ran the Skies of Sordane campaign.\nThrough this collab every backer that gets access to Premium Set II: Steampunk will get Steampunk themed airports added to their pledge for FREE. These will be modular as everything in the Townbuilder, allowing you to go for any width and lenght.\nBenny and his team at Arcane Minis will also create interchangeable stands that will allow the ships to dock to our buildings, raising and lowering them to fit with our 50mm height system!\nTheir Kickstarter special prices and exclusive Arcane Dragon Mini are only available until May 1st, so head on over and show them some love from us!\nCHECK OUT THE SKIES OF SORDANE LATE PLEDGES HERE\nThe usefulness of our tool relies upon a large selection of themes to choose from. There are only so many classical medieval buildings one can print before being fed up.\nThat is why our main focus for the future is expanding our themes. As a proof of concept that the Townbuilder has potential, we chose very classical themes. These are represented by our \"Basic Sets\", which are included in every pledge level and also in the free version of the Townbuilder.\nThe Basic Themes include Stone, Fachwerk, some Miscellaneous Items, and corresponding Medieval Roofs.\nCheck out our showcases below but note that they do not display all models individually as this would simply take up to much time and work.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Premium Sets will be the two choices of the community and will be modeled as soon as the Kickstarter closes. If you are a backer, you can find the link to the poll in their respective update posts or on the top of the Kickstarter campaign.\nWe don't have any 3D models to show so far since they will be modeled after... well we know what they will be.\nPremium Set I has officially been decided: It will be Sewers and Caves, for which we have some concept art below.\nPremium Set II has also been decided: It will be Steampunk, check it out below!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTownbuilder Basic\nThe Basic is free for everyone. As soon as you sign up for a free account after the Kickstarter you can try out the Townbuilder and even testprint some buildings. Obviously we want to encourage buying the Townbuilder, therefore the functionality of the Basic version is... well pretty basic.\nTownbuilder Unlimited\nThe Unlimited Version has everything you need to build hundreds of custom houses. Every functionality we think makes using the Townbuilder easier will be included here.\nTownbuilder Infinite\nThe Infinite Version adds nothing you need... but a lot of things you want. Want a 20 story high wizard tower? If your PC can handle it, knock yourself out. Want to create nice rendered pictures of your building while exploring them in first person perspective, seeing through the eyes of a miniature, here you go!  Want to create a custom sign for each guild of your world, with their custom logo and name... guess what? Townbuilder Infinite is for you.\n\n\n\n\nApprentice\nThe \"Apprentice Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition and all Basic sets. This tier allows you to create an endless number of buildings in the classical medieval fantasy style. Perfect for people that want to get started in the hobby or that just want to test out the tool for a low price.\nJourneyman\nThe \"Journeyman Townbuilder\" also includes the Townbuilder \"Unlimited\" Edition but a lot more models. Two additional sets are included here, which will be based on community decision so you can influence what you get. And then all Stretchgoals that will be unlocked are also included here. So if the Kickstarter takes off, you will get a lot of different models for your money, enabling you to build all kinds of different buildings.\nMaster\nThe \"Master Townbuilder\" includes the Townbuilder \"Infinite\". In this premium Townbuilder Version, you will find loads of cool features that let you enhance your gameplay. These range from a rendering studio that allows you to walk around in and outside your building and take screenshots of it, to a custom logo and text tool, which will allow you to upload your own custom logos and add them to banners and signs inside the Townbuilder. We have a lot of plans for these cool gadgety features and we already started working on some of them as the development of all basic features comes to a close.\nGuild Head\nThe \"Smith's guild head\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one additional feature: You get to decide two 100% custom models that we will sculpt for you and add to the Townbuilder. This can be anything you want, from a vegetable garden for your farm village to the symbol of your game's largest Kingdom as a banner to be affixed to your buildings. This allows for a whole new level of customization. Just an idea though, choose something that you want to use a lot, something that we don't feature yet and that will be a common feature for your buildings. \nSyndicate Leader\nThe \"Smith's syndicate leader\" includes everything listed above for the Master Townbuilder and one teeny tiny additional feature... You are playing a Steampunk game but the community didn't vote for the steampunk stretchgoal? Boy, do I have something for you.\nYOU GET TO COMMISSION A SET !!!!\nYes you can trust your eyes, this is an actual tier we offer. We will create a custom set for you and do our best to make it as close to your wishes as possible while still having it fit with our system.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we reach the 1000\u20ac that are necessary to keep the servers running for the coming years, the real fun begins. If you are unfamiliar with the way stretch goals work, here is a quick introduction: Whenever the campaign's funding reaches a certain threshold a stretch goal is unlocked. If we raise enough money to keep the office running for a full month, we can release an additional set at no cost, that's the basic idea.\nEach stretch goal unlocked means you get more bang for your buck and we get to do what we love as a job, win-win!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have partnered with the awesome folks of OTP Miniatures and Scenery to offer you guys the option to get your buildings printed!\nThough we don't offer printed Kickstarter tiers this time around, every backer of the Kickstarter will receive 10% off their first order for a building created in the Townbuilder at OTP's shop. This way you get your print at the same discount as if it was bought during the Kickstarter.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will also offer seller licenses.

I'm the guy, who brought 3D printing to Townsmith. I've been playing tabletop games, namely Dungeons and Dragons, for just about 4 years now. I found out very early that being the game master was perfect for me and I've GMd ever since.\nI soon developed a need for something more than just a piece of paper when designing my encounters. Equipped with a cheap Anet A8, I began to delve deep into 3D printing for tabletop games. From then on, my arsenal of both models and printers started growing until I got frustrated with the limited customization options for the terrain that is out there.\nFor Townsmith, I take on the role of the project manager, 3D programmer, and CEO. If anything weird happens in the Townbuilder, yeah that's most likely my fault.\"\nTom \"Zatho\" Zahlbach, CTO, Webdeveloper - Fullstack, DM, Player, Documentation Enthusiast\n\"Hey, I'm Tom. I'm the guy that had to read around 300 pages of Amazon Web Services documentation to get this project hosted for all of you. So yeah, I am somewhat of a masochist ... but, I also got to code a bunch which, if anything in this world, I adore. Everything website-related and invisible to you, as well as all the things behind the website, are written mostly by me. Additionally, I also take care of our AWS infrastructure. In my free time, I play D&D 5e with my friends both as a player and as a DM\nFor Townsmith I take on the role of CTO. Which... well, says not much since I get to help with everything that needs to be worked on.\"\nMonika \"Her Smolness\" Unruh - Lead 3D Artist, Dice Enthusiast, Player\n\"Hey I'm Monika, I'm a Scorpio and 1,62 m tall, whatever you want to do with that information. I've known Tom and Christopher since school and started playing DnD with them in 2017, which made me become a dice-hoarder. When the two of them came up with the idea of Townsmith I was really hyped about it. Half-jokingly I asked them if they needed someone to help with the 3D modeling since I'm somewhat of an artistic person and was interested in trying digital art and 3D modeling.\nTo my surprise, they said yes and so I came on board and am now a 3D modeler for Townsmith, but I'm still learning, so if the models start floating randomly that's probably on me.\"\nOliver \"Ore\" Inglen - Master of the positive aura\n\"Hello, my name is Oliver. I am new to the world of tabletops, dungeons and dragons, but have been working in 3D and modeling for many years. Actually, I was working in the field of architectural modeling and visualizations until a mutual friend brought me to Christopher. Since then I have been working on my sculpturing techniques for modeling your feature blocks and will also do some concept art! I am really happy to be able to support the Townsmith team while doing fun work. If you have any suggestions for details, get in touch with me. Can\u00b4t wait to model all this!\"\nLeevke \"Insomnyu\" Reher - Concept Artist, Supporting 3D Artist, Meme Enthusiast\n\"Ahoy! I'm Leev! My full name is Leevke Fee Thordis Reher but that's kinda overkill, so call me Leev. I've been playing lots of Pen&Paper in my early childhood but couldn't seem to find a fitting group when I got older. But in 2018, I was introduced to Christopher and his great dedication to Dungeons and Dragons. Since I'm currently studying InterMedia Design, the opportunity to do my internship at Townsmith presented itself.\nI joined shortly before the Kickstarter launched, so until now I did some of the concept art. Later I'll dive into some of the 3D Modeling and digital design for the community voted themes. So if there's anything wrong, blame the others, I'm innocent.\"\nIf you have any questions about us or what we do, feel free to join our Discord Server and get in touch with us!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs you can clearly see, we are a very young team.\nThis is our first project though not our first Kickstarter campaign. A few months ago we already launched a Kickstarter with a different business model. We have learned a lot since then and we also improved the Townbuilder.\n\nStill, we are inexperienced by industry standards (Printable Scenery, Heroforge, Fat Dragon Games, etc.). Though we do our best to be responsive and professional, but our lack of experience will be visible when it comes to some aspects.\nWill the site be up 100% of the time? I doubt it.\nWill we fix it as soon as it goes down? Yes, we will.\nWill the range of themes increase as fast as heroforge's does? Well, it depends. It took us about three months to get the current models going, but we have gotten a lot faster at it and we will have more time to invest into modeling since there will be less programming work to do.\n\nMost importantly: The Townbuilder is basically ready for release weeks before the launch of the Kickstarter and we only need to polish up a few things, including the UX. There is little risk that you will not be able to create and download buildings after the Kickstarter closes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe sell software which is about as resistant to wear and tear as it gets.\nReusability and recyclability\nPLA, which is the main material used in home 3D printing, is bio-degradable.

The base set of .STLs offer incredible value which will get greater with the more stretch goals achieved.\n A FREE .STL file is available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5lxbh345cuumtq2/AAC3DwE0uusEhBaVH4zSQLv8a?dl=0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders and original prints for each of the 25 base Dwarves. .STL files have versions with both an attached base or no base variations. \nPrinted physical models come attached to a black base as shown in the images and are printed in either Elegoo or Anycubic Grey resins. Models are on a 32mm base (apart from the Blacksmith who is on a 40mm, stretch goals might also vary).\nBackers of the digital tier will also receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\nDwarven Barkeep\nDwarven Barkeep Variant\nDwarven Travelling Merchant\nDwarven Brawler\nDwarven Brawler Variant\nDwarven Brawling Santa\nDwarven Santa\nDwarven Blacksmith\nDwarven Guardian\nDwarven Infantry\nDwarven Rogues\n Here are the stretch goals for this campaign. Work will start on these once the campaign has ended. Any new art will be featured here.\n\u00a32,000 - Undead Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a32,500 - Dwarven Wizard ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,000 - Dwarven Cleric ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,500 - Dwarven Ranger/Hunter ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,000 - Dwarven Barbarian ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,500 - Dwarven Paladin ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a35,000 - Dwarven Death Knight ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a36,000 - Dwarven King ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a37,000 - Female Dwarves x 3 (Artificer/Engineer, Herbalist and Sorceress) ---- UNLOCKED!!!! \n\u00a37,750 - Dwarven Gravedigger ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\u00a38,500 - Beach Holiday Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a311,000 - 3 Additional Female Dwarves (Warrior Tank, Paladin and Ranger/Hunter) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a312,000 - 3 Additional Variants, Logger (based on the Barkeep), Druid (Based on the Wizard) and Chef Warrior (Based on the Chef and Santa) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS :\n25/25 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Guardian Variant ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n 50/50 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Coal Miner ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n75/75 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Chef ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\n104/100 Shares/Retweets - Female Dwarven Barkeep ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\nWe utilise a combination of Pixologic Zbrush and Autodesk Maya to create our models, Marmoset Toolbag is used to bring you the model renders and Chitubox Slicer is the software for prepping our 3D printing files.\nOnce we have a 3D file ready for printing we transfer it via USB to one of our 3D Printers. Our farm consists of several Elegoo Mars' MSLA printers along with a Kelant S400 for larger/bulk prints. Prints take varying amounts of time, to maximise hardware consumable life, as well as printing time, we pack our printbeds with more models as long as it doesn't reduce quality or success rate. We have a range of spare consumables and a supply of resin upfront for incoming work.\nOnce printed we clean our models using a 2 stage isopropyl clean. Models are then given time to dry before going into an ultrasonic bath in warm water. Once done, we remove supports and then submerge them into water and cure via UV lamps to be sure all the resin is completely solid. Models are given a mild isopropyl rub after they have cured/dried, finally they're glued to a base.\nWith regards to packaging and delivery, we like to recycle as much as we can so will re-use as much packaging as possible whilst also keeping the models safe. We use a combination of boxes, sponge and padding(like bubble wrap) to ensure models are well protected.\nOnce the campaign has ended production will begin. .STL files will be sent out for the base models soon after campaign end to those that pledged for them. \nIf you have pledged to a physical tier we'll need to know which of the Dwarves you wish to get in your pledge, this can include stretch goal Dwarves that have been made at the time, although the manufacturer of these might delay your order slightly. Once the campaign is over and all the pledges tallied we'll send out a survey asking which models you would like, you can also email - EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com with any questions or queries.\nProduction on both the stretch goals and physical prints will happen simultaneously. If people would like to purchase additional physical prints of the stretch goals if reached then they will be able to at additional cost. You can add additional models by adding the value of them to your pledge (\u00a310 for 1, \u00a315 for 2, \u00a319 for 3 and \u00a322 for 4). If you do this please send us a message either via the above email or direct PM and we'll add a note to your pledge and reference it once all pledges have been processed.\nUPDATES - We'll publish updates to the Kickstarter as and when they're needed prior to the campaign ending as well as keeping people informed on progress once production has began. This campaign will have email: EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com dedicated to it, any communication should come to this email to get a fast reply. \nShipping costs added when you pledge, nothing else is added once the campaign ends. We have shipped plenty of these miniatures around the world, this is simply how much it costs and includes the packaging and postal charges. \nEstimated delivery for this project is June 2020/July 2020. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as postage delays or customs. We haven't currently experienced this in current store sales but there is always the risk of incidents outside of our control. We would endeavor to keep backers updated via the Kickstarter until all items are delivered.\n\"Please note the above estimate is based on a prediction we have done, if the KS becomes more successful than I thought this will cause the delivery date to shift.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe base set of digital files are complete and have been printed by myself, so with regards to the digital base element of the project there is no risk at all. Additional digital stretch goals along with their test printing is also low risk as we have a track record of producing such assets in a timely manner.\n\nWe have delivered over 50 physical miniatures via online stores since enabling this feature a little over a month ago and have received brilliant feedback. We have scaled up to accommodate targets outlined in the kickstarter in terms of hardware and consumables needed for printing.\n\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape the initial plan. As a consequence there is always the possibility of a delay in delivery although delivery estimates for physical items are currently very conservative. These delays are typically caused by last minute additions to the campaign, such as new Stretch Goals, or are a delay within the shipping process itself such as problems with customs releasing the goods, there is always the potential for 3D printer hardware issues however we have spares and the means to purchase additional hardware if required.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "This pledge grants you access to all the digital .STL files for the Dwarven miniatures so you can print them at yourself.\n.STL files will be delivered via a download link and will not have shipping costs.\nINCLUDES:\n.STL Files delivered via Dropbox or My Mini Factory\nAll Models Test Printed", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["1,005 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Physical x 1", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 1 x Dwarven miniature 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n1 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Physical x 2", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 2 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (11 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a319 or more", "title": "Physical x 3", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 3 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n3 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Limited (7 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a334 or more", "title": "Physical Rogues", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to the 8 x Dwarven Rogue variation miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n8 x Dwarven Rogues (1 of each variant)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a388 or more", "title": "Physical -

Click here to read the article.\nAbout us:\nWe are an upcoming company named Unchained Games. Some people may know us from Spiel'19 (Essen), where we presented the Alpha of our upcoming open-world tabletop RPG 'Hidden Galaxy'. We wanted to dip our toes in the water and introduce ourselves to the Kickstarter community with a rather smaller project before we went big with a huge (for a first-time creator) project. Since 3D printing and Roleplaying is in our DNA, we came up with the idea of 3D printable RPG components and named it Thre3Dee Tabletop!\nThe main goal of this project is to gain our first Kickstarter experience and to increase our budget for our upcoming project 'Hidden Galaxy'. Of course, we want to leave an astonishing first impression on our supporters!\nAbout the project:\nThe main goal of this project is to gain our first Kickstarter experience and to increase our budget for our upcoming project 'Hidden Galaxy'. Of course, we also want to leave an astonishing first impression on You! That's why we promise to do whatever we can to deliver the content and quality you deserve.\nWhy Kickstarter exclusive? Because we want to concentrate on our main project and not the future marketing and sales of these models. Since this is our first project, we also thought it would be fun to reward our first-ever backers with exclusive content.\nAbout the future of Thre3Dee Tabletop:\nDuring the making of this project, we've had several great ideas and would love to bring you more and even bigger series of Thre3Dee Tabletop in the future!\nWe strongly believe that together we can start something beautiful! We've already put our soul in these two projects and brought it to this level, putting the future of Unchained Games in your hands!\nTeam\nSpecial thanks to bensound.com for letting us use their royalty-free music.

Rewards are for digital STL files to print the products shown and described in this campaign. Rewards are split into two categories: Scatter, and Minis - designed to be used together or independently, and all for normal tabletop gaming scale (28-32mm). Even if you don't have plans/need for this specific theme, there's tons of relatively generic stuff in here you can use for all fantasy RPG settings - check it out!\n** NEW POTENTIAL BACKERS: Including unlocked stretch goals there are over 65 minis and more than double that in terrain/scenic pieces in this campaign currently. We just unlocked the 18th, and final stretch goal and all models included in the pledges are shown below!\nPLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods ** \nMany more pics will be added as the campaign progresses. To see additional pics, check out the full resolution gallery HERE!\n---------------------------------------\nNo 3D gaming table is complete without scatter terrain! This project includes a collection of terrain elements, buildings, and other pieces to fill out your Arabian/Egyptian/Persian cities, palaces, and desert adventure table.  The set ranges from small scatter items to huge multi-floor buildings. All items print support free, and are split/designed/optimized for easy printing, painting, and assembly. The below image shows renders of all the models in some sample configurations included with the scatter & all-in pledge levels, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked:\n--------------------------------------- \nThis project includes a large collection of thematic minis including monsters, beasts, characters, and more!\nHigh-quality miniatures, suitable for resin-level detail but also great quality on FDM printers!\n NO supports are needed for any of these miniatures. This is accomplished by smart posing and design, and slicing/keying where needed.\nAll models have been test printed and ready to drop on print bed and go.\nAll minis are included in based versions (pictured below), and also unbased for you to base yourself, use in dioramas, etc. Where split/keyed versions are needed, complete versions are also offered for those that want them.\nMinis range from in size from small creatures, to HUGE beasts like the elephant. Scale is roughly 30-32mm (similar in size to Reaper Bones). The below image shows renders of all the models included with the minis & all-in pledge levels, and will be updated as stretch goals are unlocked: \n As a reminder, ALL miniatures are designed to be 100% support-free on both FDM and resin, and are designed to be easy to print and paint! ZERO supports to setup, sand, cleanup, etc. And because of smart design and angle tolerances, these prints should all require very little, if any,  cleanup and post processing!  \n---------------------------------------\nWe've got LOTS of stretch goals for you! At this point in the campaign ALL 18 stretch goals have been unlocked, and you can see the included/added models in the renders above!\n--------------------------------------- \nOutside of the core minis/terrain STLs, I'm throwing in a few pieces of bonus content from previous campaigns that can fit with this theme, to sweeten the pot. After all, who doesn't like free stuff!? I'll also be releasing free props and DungeonSticks as the campaign progresses, which will be updated here and linked to in KS updates. \nYou can download the Sun Medallion prop now HERE , the Anubis Ring HERE, and the Magic Lamp HERE. You can also download the free set of mini bases that I created for this campaign HERE\n--------------------------------------- \nMy name is Evan Carothers, and I am a 3D designer with hundreds of designs released via Thingiverse (ecaroth) and through my premium design company (EC3D). This is my 6th Kickstarter, and any of my thousands of customers can tell you about my track record of easy-to-print models - delivered on time. My skill and love for design has grown out of my passion for tabletop gaming, technology, and 3D printing. I design a  ton of the content myself and work with many other great designers and artists to put these projects together. Take a look at the quality of my free items on Thingiverse or my last campaigns Wilds of Wintertide,  Depths of Savage Atoll or  The Skyless Realms to get a feel for my design aesthetic, or check out some customer reviews. I am a tabletop gamer at heart, and all models are  printed, and often painted, by myself before being released.\nParticipating Modelers, Artists, Painters, and Printers\nCredit to these awesome folks who helped this all come together!\nJoshua Black, Sebastiano Di Grazia, Sergio Tomo, Vitaliy Deaf, Crossed Lances, Ben Southall (Yasashii Kyojin Studio), Ryan Calhoun (Cephalopod Studios), David Greenfield (Lidless Eye Studios), & Osaka Zai.\nAnd a SPECIAL thank you to my wonderful girlfriend Ally who has been unbelievably helpful, and essential in preparing this campaign!\nAdd-ons allow you to get additional awesome stuff at a great discount, and help push even further to unlock stretch goals! To get add-ons, just increase your pledge level by the amount indicated for whichever add-ons you would like. Once the KS closes I will be using a pledge manager (BackerKit) to help you finalize you add-ons. You can increase you pledge on KS now to help fund stretch goals, or get these after the campaign closes. You must back the KS at any of the 3 levels to get add-ons, they are not available individually.\n Wilds of Wintertide: My last sprawling campaign, featuring icy, arctic tundra, terrain/scatter, monsters, and minis - Wilds of Wintertide - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($18 add-on), Minis only ($18 add-on), or ALL IN ($25 add-on).\n A Den of Alien Evil - Everything from the first volume of my \"Community (Treasure)Chest\" series - Mind Horror scenery, terrain, and minis. Check it out the content from the original campaign HERE ($10 add-on).\n Depths of Savage Atoll: A sprawling campaign, featuring nautical, jungle, pirate, and undersea minis and environs - Depths of Save Atoll - the add-ons are equivalent to the what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain/scatter only ($35 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($65 add-on).\n Skyless Realms: The races and places below the surface, from my previous campaign Skyless Realms  - the add-ons are equivalent to what's included in that campaign (including stretch goals): Terrain only ($40 add-on), Minis only ($35 add-on), or ALL IN ($55 add-on).\n Forest of Oakenspire - Everything from the core reward and stretch goals from my first Kickstarter Forest of Oakenspire at a great discount ($40 add-on).\n All EC3D Premium Sets - The full collection of all 12 previously released premium sets - over $100 value, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($50 add-on)\n Individual EC3D Premium Sets - Chose any number of my EC3D scenery sets from my previously released premium set collection - substantial value over retail price, as seen for sale on Hero's Hoard ($5 per-set add-on)\n** Please note ** - all the add-on items above can be purchased right now for a higher price on heroshoard.com or late pledge pages for those campaigns, but if you are willing to wait until this campaign closes to receive the files you can get a great discount AND help unlock more stuff for this current campaign. \nI have an official licensed printer program for my 3D sets, along with my partner at Hero's Hoard, which allows commercial physical resellers with a 10% commission on sales. Anybody can signup for that license, and sell the models from this campaign under that license, and I will not be doing specific merchant tiers for this campaign. So to sell these files (and other non-exclusive EC3D sets) you just need to signup for that resale program and back this campaign to receive the files. \nEverybody hates waiting, and many people have been burned by poorly designed files and broken delivery timelines in previous kickstarters from other vendors. This is not the case with my campaigns. All core models, and many stretch goals, area already finalized and test printed, and nearly ALL FILES will be ready for delivery the second the funds clear after the Kickstarter finishes. I will be finalizing and releasing the remaining items as fast as humanly possible, with a goal of 60 days *MAX* after this Kickstarter ends for delivery - which is something I have successfully done for all my previous Kickstarters.\nDisclaimer & Printing Requirements\nTo get the most out of the printable parts from this Kickstarter, you will need to have a well-tuned 3D printer. For terrain/scatter and FDM printer capable of printing at a minimum .2mm layer height (ideally <= .16mm), such as an Ender 3.  Parts are cut to small pieces to facilitate printing. All designs for terrain are cut and keyed to fit on a 200x200mm print bed.  For minis, a resin printer is ideal and all mini models are cut/keyed (only as needed) to fit on standard sized smaller resin print beds (such as an Anycubic Photon), with the exception of a few VERY large minis. Minis will print on FDM printers as well - for a few of the more challenging models you might need to slow the print down a bit, but no supports will be needed.\nEvery part is test printed by myself and repaired to be manifold and ready to drop on your slicer - however, In the event that any issues with the files get past my own QA testing and process, and my other test printers, I will make every effort to fix the file and remedy the situation as soon as possible. I use Dropbox for file delivery so I can push updates/fixes. My number one goal is to make some awesome, unique designs you can have a ton of fun with on your tabletop!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few, if any, risks and challenges for this campaign.

Sign-up for our newsletter\nAlderQuest is an innovative and modular game about animal guilds competing to become Preservers of the Realm through a series of seasonal contests. The first coincides with winter's arrival - a race to collect acorns. AlderQuest offers an unprecedented blend of familiar mechanics (area control, tile placement, bluffing, match-3) with an uncommon depth of strategy, in a charming head-to-head package.\n As a special thank you to backers, we have decided to unlock all stretch goals:\nWe've carefully planned stretch goals and other extra goodies to offer continual improvements to the final game, while avoiding \"feature creep\". Project delays are not our thing. \nFor this campaign we're bringing back our Honorary Producer tier.  This pledge will get you a prototype copy of the game to play shortly after the campaigns ends (FEB-MAR 2020) and months in advance of the final version.  More importantly, it will allow you to name one of the heroes that appear in the final game!\nWe have a pledge associated with each one of our main heroes from the game.  All you need to do is pick the hero that you are most interested in and come up with a name (or use your own).  You will receive a signed print of your named hero from the artist, Lawrence Burns, along with a signed copy of the prototype from the designer, Ryan Ward.\n*All hero names are subject to our approval just to be sure no lewd or inappropriate names are printed in the final version of the game*\nYour [actual] name will also go into the rulebook as an honorary producer and you will receive a final copy of the game and expansion with all unlocked stretch goals.  We look forward to working with our honorary producers as we put the final touches on the game!\nWhen our pledge manager is sent out via email, you will be asked to fill in your address and you will charged for shipping at that time.  You must fill out this pledge manager and pay for shipping in order to receive your reward.  We know that high shipping costs are the worst, so we are offering a discount off of our quoted shipping rates to all of our backers. Here are our estimated shipping costs for this project. Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2019 shipping rates and costs may change based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose:\n*Western Europe includes Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland\n**Southeast Asia includes Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam.\nWe're subsidizing everyone's actual shipping by $6. As long as you are a Kickstarter Backer (even $1 backers), you will receive this shipping subsidy .\nWe plan on using customs-friendly shipping and fulfillment companies for each region shown above.  As a result, you should not get hit with customs, brokerage, or import fees if you live in the USA, Canada, Australia or EU.  If you do get hit with any fees, send us an email with a copy of your receipt and we will refund you!\nGame published by Rock Manor Games, owned and operated by Mike Gnade.

Enter the Viking age and use the armies of four magnates and chieftains to brawl for the Herrlof: a sign of victory and praise gained in war. Through trick taking and special abilities, you will seek to win just the right amount of power to become the Viking king.\nThe game consists of rounds, with each round built up of five steps. Each of these steps are set out below. You can also find explanations video\u2019s in several preview videos. An English one here, a Dutch one here and a German one here. \nThe dealer deals 15 cards to both players, the remaining 12 cards form a facedown deck on the side of the game.\nThe dealer then turns the top card of the deck face up, the colour of this card is the trump colour for this round.\nBoth players take their dealt cards to form their hand and predict how many tricks they think they will win. They write this on their sheet and keep it concealed.\nThe players then battle for each trick. Tricks are won by players either by having the higher number (if both cards have the same colour), by having a trump coloured card, or by a card with a special power. The 1, 3, 6 and 9 have special powers, allowing you to steal a trick, draft a new card, steal a card or force the other player to start the next trick. It is also possible to destroy a trick altogether with a Valknut-rune card or lose a trick on purpose with the Hagalaz-rune card.\nWhen all dealt cards are played, each player reveals their prediction. You receive one point for each trick you won. If you won the exact number of tricks you predicted, you receive 10 bonus points. If you only won three or four tricks, you receive 5 bonus points (regardless if this was your prediction).\nNote that there is a limited-edition luxury edition with an engraved wooden box and gold gilded cards. The game remains the same, but the elements of the game are upgraded. \nNote that we have not included stretch goals that add new elements to the game, we believe the game is complete as it is and adding new elements could break the balance. There are more stretch goals in terms of material available later on.  \nNOTE: The shipping is effectively EU and US friendly. For the EU, the value of one or two copies falls below the threshold for taxes. For the US, the value also falls below the threshold and the game will be sent via air freight, thereby effectively reaching a 'friendly' status. \nThis project's logistics plan has passed a thorough 7-point review and Floship certifies that we have an efficient and reliable logistics plan to deliver this good from the factory to you, the customers.\nWe aim for delivery in June as production should finish by late April or early May. However as shipping towards certain destinations takes significant time, we have indicated July and August as delivery dates. During the shipping process you will be kept up to date via updates. \nLocal pick up: as we have reached 650 backers, free local pick up is possible in the Netherlands. To switch to this option, please change your pledge to the version with free local pick up (see FAQ for further explanation). The local pick up locations are listed below. If you select local pick up but fail to pick it up here, it will be possible to get your pledge sent to you but this will encure higher shipping charges as it will not be part of the bulk shipment.\nPick up locations:\n Wirwar Spellen en Puzzels, Groningen, during shop hours\n Roll The Dice, Veldhoven, at gaming events in their calendar\n Ducosim conventions, Flint Theater, Amersfoort, if all goes as planned pick up should be possible at the May 16th convention as well as October 10th \n SpellenSpektakel 2020, Utrecht\nShould production be completed as planned, it will be possible to pick up at Zuiderspel on 4 or 5 April 2020. However, this will only be confirmed two weeks before the convention (at which time it will no longer be possible to switch back to shipping). \nThere are six standard pledge options provided:\nA single copy of Herrlof \nA double copy of Herrlof \nA group pledge (six pack) with six copies of Herrlof \nA luxury limited edition Herrlof \nA Jolly Dutch bundle with Herrlof, Chartered: The Golden Age and Boogie Beasts \nA Jolly Dutch bundle with the Luxury version of Herrlof, and the normal copies of Chartered: The Golden Age and Boogie Beasts.\nThe luxury version of Herrlof comes in an engraved wooden box and gold gilded cards instead of the standard box and cards. If you would like to receive a normal copy as well, please add \u20ac9 to your pledge. \nHerrlof is the third game by Jolly Dutch,  the first being Chartered: The Golden Age and the second Boogie Beasts. We would of course like to offer you the option to pledge for a bundle of all three games combined. That way you save on the recommended retail price and on shipping for all three games. Note that this option is limited as the end of the first print run for both Chartered: The Golden Age and Boogie Beasts is in sight! \nIt is possible for retailers to pre-order Herrlof, simply pledge \u20ac 1 and send us an email on info@jollydutch.com. For European retailers a VAT number is required. Retailers that pre-order during the campaign will receive the game at the same time as backers. \nJolly Dutch Productions is a new small game publisher, set up by Alexander and Arnold in the Netherlands. We combine our love for (board) gaming and entrepreneurial spirit to develop new games, specifically looking to bring together families and friends for a jolly evening. We ran our first Kickstarter in October-November 2018: Chartered: The Golden Age, which has been fulfilled.\nInge is the co-author of Herrlof. She grew up disliking board games, having only played Monopoly and always ending the game in an argument. After she was introduced to 'real' board games by her husband, she quickly started to enjoy them and surpassed him in wanting to play. \nTristam has created all the artwork for Herrlof and the Kickstarter page. He is an independent board game artist and has worked on a number of Kickstarter games. \nThe main video was made by Treffend&Co. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have learnt a lot from our previous Kickstarters (succesful and cancelled) and have implemented those leassons in this campaign. \n\nThe artwork and all game elements are ready for production, allowing quick confirmation of the production order and ensuring a smooth start of the production timeline. Additionally, the selected producer has been involved in the process from the start, to ensure all production standards are followed.\n\nNote that refunds after the campaign ends are possible, but this will be minus the Kickstarter and payment fees. Note that for this campaign we will not work with a pledge manager. Note that any backers that fail to complete the information forms concerning shipping addresses ahead of the deadline communicated after the campaign, will be contacted via email twice to allow them to complete the forms. If they still fail to do so, their pledge will not be shipped with the bigger bulk and therefore result in additional shipping costs that will be charged to the backer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac9 or more", "title": "Herrlof -

After the success of our first two Air Deck and three Nanobag campaigns, and more than 37k backers later, we\u2019re now ready for our sixth campaign.  \nThe Air Deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do\n Created with feedback from the community, here are our seven new designs: \nOur 7 designs: Red Classic, Electric, Night Sky, Aqua Mandala, Geometric, Retro and Blue Classic\nCheck out some of the feedback we've received from our Air Deck 2.0 backers.\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nCompact travel friendly size\nLightweight\nDurable heavy-duty 'casino quality' 0.31mm PVC\nPremium printing\nSlightly textured on both sides for better handling\nSturdy 0.4mm waterproof synthetic paper tuck box\nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\n\nPS. When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose which designs you want in the backer survey we send out after the campaign is over.  \nOur mission is to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers\nThe Air Deck 3.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket\nAir Deck 3.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but there\u2019s a few new things:\nFive fresh new designs voted on by our community.\nThe boxes now have indents to make them easier to open.\nWe'll be planting even more mangrove trees to offset our emissions many times over. We believe being a climate positive company is important. 1 tree gets planted for every two decks sold.\n\nFive fresh new designs voted on by our community\nThe boxes now have an indent to make them easier to open\n\nThank you for helping us reach both our stretch goals!\nWith the Air Deck 3.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.    \nThe Air Deck 3.0 is meticulously cut\nThe Air Deck is made of a casino quality PVC\n The Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of. \nWhile regular paper playing cards tear, stain, and break easily, Air Deck 3.0 is extremely durable\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can use them in the pool, bathtub or even the beach.\nYou can also wash the cards.\n\nThe cards are slightly textured on both sides to provide cushioning and excellent handling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on both sides to provide cushioning and excellent handling. \nThe Air Deck 3.0 shuffles easily\n\nWe created the new designs for Air Deck 3.0 with the wonderful supportive feedback we\u2019ve received from our community. Despite their smaller width, the cards are as easy to read as standard sized decks. The full-sized length ensures that they also handle much like regular cards, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nThe narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands\nBlue Classic, Aqua Mandala, Night Sky and Red Classic comes with traditional looking face cards, while Retro, Geometric and Electric has a more minimalistic look: \nOur face card designs\n\nEach deck consists of 52 standard playing cards and 2 jokers\n\nWe love traveling this beautiful blue ball we call home, and we believe we should care for it as best we can. There\u2019s only one planet earth after all. We consider the Air Deck 3.0 to be an environmentally conscious product to begin with, as it contains half the materials of its competitors, and is made of durable materials which provides a long product life. However, with this campaign we\u2019ve upped our commitment to the planet by planting one mangrove tree for every two decks sold with our tree planting partner, Eden Reforestation Projects.\nMangrove trees are one of the most effective tools to bind CO2 to the soil, thus preventing it from escaping into the atmosphere. A mangrove tree can sequester up to a ton of carbon dioxide by the time it reaches 40 years old. As a bonus, they also help sustain coastal ecosystems, protect shorelines from damage by storms and acts as a filter to maintain water quality.\nWe will plant mangrove trees with Eden Reforestation Projects\n\nThe idea for the original Air Deck was conceived by fellow globetrotters Ursus Negenborn and Rune Kippervik while traveling South East Asia. We love playing cards, and we just couldn\u2019t find a deck that was perfect for carrying at all times. As we\u2019re big fans of optimization, we decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers ourselves.\nThe Air Deck founders\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 950+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $400M raised between them.\nPromoted by Palm Tree Digital, the marketing power behind some of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns of 2019.

Logistics has already been worked thoroughly out, and we will ship tracked to all customers, to ensure a reliable delivery.

Teachers trying to create challenging tutoring sessions for students constantly fail in getting them interested in math, using the old traditional way.\nMath cards are a promising project\nWe are dedicated in providing students with a great way to learn math and be introduced in the magic of numbers. In this project we have the ambition to create high-quality cards that depict all the numbers as well as the signs of the basic arithmetic exercises and the equations.\nAfter years of teaching math in a vast variety of schools, it has been shown that students are always bored of this lesson. The electronic calculators are putting barriers to the educational procedure since students cannot feel the touch of real numbers.\nThis project has been carefully planned to create a series of cards that will be given to you so that teaching math can become an easy and entertaining task. Given that children like to play cards, their vivid appearance will get them interested in knowing and touching each number combined with equation signs, square roots and arithmetic exercises signs.\nWe are ambitious enough to believe that this method will securely introduce young students to the basic principles of math and make them consider it like a game. Years of in class experience would be in your hands to use it while teaching math to your own children or students.\nFundraising Goal\nWe are eager to produce high quality cards for math tutoring. We also need your help to get this project done and diminish the number of the math illiterate kids around the world.\nEveryone who contributes $10 will get a digital deck of cards. With a $15 contribution you can get a single copy of math cards no matter where in the world you are located. More generous contributions include several packs of cards as well as a personal training seminar so that you get introduced to the best tutoring methods.\nFinally, for $2,500 which applies to bigger organizations or schools, you can have 100 copies of math cards alongside an in-person training seminar that can give all the answers to people that want to teach math in the most entertaining way.\nOther ways you can help\nYou can share our project through Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and other social networks of your choice and let your friends know about it.

So with the card shown below, we display a circus tent to show this is where the carnie rummages for additional supplies (ability card).\nThe card below shows that the road has been overrun letting you know that certain characters will have a tough time traversing it.\nA stop sign indicates that a certain type of character needs to stop.\nIf you are clever in the way you move your characters and use your ability cards you can minimize the impact of these negative movement modifiers and ensure your characters have a slightly longer life than the others.\nThe character also have different ability cards they can use to match their theme. The medic can prevent bad things from happening to your characters and the burglar can make things more difficult for your opponent.\nFinally, some cards affect the Zombies.

It consists of only 10 dice, 53 cards (split into 4 different decks), a reference sheet, 3 different tokens as well as a double deck wooden box with an engraved motive for those nights were you want a special treat, giving yourself a gift of some medieval story-telling and adventuring. \nA playthrough of the prototype: \nThe rulebook (Here's a pdf: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ToY5evc88sWj8qZA1xHKtVbtvpYDHsjI): \nHere's some additional drafts of the card-layout of the game (all 54 cards have drafts to be made into actual art once the project is funded) which will be manufactured in poker-sized cards of professional standard card stock with blue core (smooth finish):\n Three different 20 mm tokens (peddlers goods, rations & gold) to keep it simple:\nFor visual clarity we're including 10 single-sided 14 mm wooden die:\n(Project-image as well as this render made by Toni Marchev, found at: https://bai-marcko.artstation.com/)\nThis is the kind of wooden double-decked box we're having in mind (with a single engraved star on it): \n Northern Star - Solitaire rewards memorizing due to the low amount of cards, that instead varies greatly in their content. A focus have been given to only keep content that feels fun and essential to the game. A special feature is that you can save your character and progress after a game session, so as to be continued at a later time. For each game-session you will have an objective that will have permanent negative consequences if not resolved - your character may survive and improve but the world will grow darker until all objectives are resolved. \nLastly I see the project having potential for some great solitaire experiences since this have been developed and playtested the past four years, and is now subject for a board game contest on Boardgamegeek for blind playtesting.\nI have access to 3D-printers, laser-cutters, sketch-studios, 2 different organisations for game-testing and both contacts and an online group with extensive experience in regards to game design and business management.\nMy name is P\u00e4r, I'm a 28 year old product design student who have just graduated, currently living in the northern parts of Sweden. I have developed several games before (both digital and analog), but this is my first published game. Boardgames I have designed have mostly been in the cooperative categories where as I made one for my product design degree (with a lot of focus on story-telling, simple rules and deep immersion). I enjoy Sherlock Holmes: Consultive detective and Arkham horror, Tiny Epic Quest and Battlestar Galactica among others. I'm quite a creative person who've been playing games my entire life, studied business management, been in start-ups before through business incubators and also like creative arts such as drawing and playing music. \nKristian here, also living in the northern parts of Sweden.

The goal of SEK 317,500 can be quite a challenge to reach, requring +1700 backers which we will try to overcome through extensive marketing on different social media platforms and sending out additional promotional videos. If you find Northern Star intriguing, feel free to spread the word about it. \n\nIn regards to artwork I find artists can be quite expensive, but due to the simplistic yet beautiful motives this may reduce their cost. A potential risk is that the game may not find an illustrator that will make the game as beautiful as I intend making it, and also that the costs may surpass budget. However there are still margins in the funding goal if this would happen, so as to making the game a reality.\n\nThe game (and components) are truly simplistic and we have already got a qoute on manufacturing and shipping costs, so I see no real problems that can't be overcome. Especially with my past experience in regards to start-ups. However I see potential risks with distribution and perhaps not having illustrations as beautiful as intended.\n\nBoard game distribution and logistics: One of the biggest risks is that difficulty due to lacking experience in the board game distribution sector and creating a pipe-line for distribution will delay the shipping-process of the game, however I have good supplier contacts which handles both supply and shipping. I also have great contacts and friends within the University business developers sector who could give guidance if needed. \n\nSome mechanics may be flawed due to not enough game-testing, although the game being the result of almost 4 years of individual playtesting culminating into one simplistic concept.

A great card game for Halloween!\nPombies is a card game for two to four players. It is a simplified version of Japanese Mahjong, and is a family game for kids to join!\n(Pledge around \u20ac26/US$29=HK$230. Pledge goal around \u20ac3,400/US$3,800=HK$30,000)\nOverview\nPombies in a Hong Kong street\nIn a dark world of modern time, you are one of the Grim Reapers collecting poor souls while guiding them to the afterlife. You are not the only Grim Reaper seeking souls across this world. Rival Grim Reapers are always competing with you to get more souls, even if it means taking them from you!\nYou have the power to collect and order Pombies to work for your purpose. By assembling your Pombies, you devise a strategy to get the most souls and become the best Grim Reaper!\nEach player is given nine cards in the beginning. You need to keep drawing and discarding cards to form certain combinations according to the score sheet. The winner needs to be the first to collect three sets of three cards of the same type restricted by prewritten combinations.\nEach player plays against every player. There\u2019s only one winner in each game.\n\nWhere the project idea comes from...\nYou must have heard of Mahjong, a very popular and indulging tabletop game in most Asian countries. It\u2019s a classic game, a must-have furniture (Mahjong table) for families, and a popular community activity in festive time such as New Year and certainly everyday life.\nMahjong has become so popular over a millennium in its history. Having been around for a very long time, the game is very well-established and even considered as an addiction for some people.\nNot surprisingly, Japanese have developed their own ways of playing Mahjong. Based on the traditional Japanese Mahjong gameplay, Japanese re-invented a simplified variation of Japanese Mahjong called Pomjong, which is rather casual, fun, and has become a very popular family game widely circulated and played in Japan for decades. Our creator played it in Japan, and believed it should be introduced to the whole world. Pomjong has actually extended the idea of \u201cpom\u201d (\u30dd\u30f3), one of the major actions in both Japanese and Chinese Mahjong, and has made itself a family game simple and enjoyable enough for kids to join. Our game, Pombies, is inspired by the Japanese Pomjong and will make itself a very unique and fun game for your families and communities.\n\u307d\u3093\u3073\u30fc\u305a means Pombies.\nThe idea of controlling a team of zombie corps to work for your purpose is absolutely fun. Imagine if you can order hundreds of zombies to help in a battle, you shouldn\u2019t need any other weapon. The Pombies in this game have different physical features and special innate skills from their own species.\nYes, what we have here, are good Pombies. They are in four categories and take unique roles by their innate features. They are Catbies, Humbies, Dolbies, and Fairbies. They are what they are reflected in their names.\nGame Box Content\nHow the game is played...\nIn Mahjong, people use block tiles imprinted with patterned symbols. Mahjong game sets are normally bulky, heavy and noisy during the play. In Pombies, we use cards to make the game more accessible for playing in any location! Using cards instead of plastic block tiles is a handy solution to reduce noise, therefore no more complaints from your neighbors about loud noise made during game time anymore!\nThe gameplay of Pombies is very different from Mahjong. Here is how this game is played:\nHow the game starts...\nEach player plays against everyone else. Each player is given nine cards in hand to start with. The winner needs to be the first to collect three sets of three cards of the same type restricted by prewritten combinations. There\u2019s only one winner in each game.\nOnly you should see your cards during the game. You may guess what Pombies your rivals are after, and keep those from them, at the same time, assemble your Pombie combination to win the game based on the prewritten combinations on the score sheet you are targeting. What you should target should be based on the nine cards you draw in the beginning of the game.\nSouls\nWhile Mahjong usually involves money, Pombies involves souls.\nPombies is a point-based game. Points are represented in the form of soul tokens. There are 3 types of soul tokens. Each player starts with 1000 souls. The objective of the game is to obtain the highest amount of souls when the game ends.\nOne Executive/Parent player and Attendants/Children players\nNow everyone should have 1000 souls. Each player rolls two dice to decide who is the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d player. (It is called \u201cParent\u201d in Japanese Mahjong. Using it when playing with family members will increase fun level.)\nThe player with the highest dice roll becomes the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d, and the other three becomes \u201cAttendants/Children\u201d. (It is called \u201cChildren\u201d in Japanese Mahjong.)\nWhile being \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d, the player enjoys several benefits and earns more souls than usual. If you are the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d, try to keep the position as long as possible! If you are not, take down the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d by any means necessary!\nHow the rounds start...\nThe round starts from the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d player drawing the top card from the pile. After drawing the top card, the \u201cExecutive/Parent\u201d player must discard one of the cards and keep only eight cards in hand. Each discarded card should be placed in front of the player, from left to right, in order.\nThen, the next player in clockwise order performs the same action.\nPlayers continue to take turns until all cards are drawn or a player completes a combination.\nPombies on the attack!\nOne of the unique gameplay elements of Pombies is that players can use their own discarded cards to tip the game in their favor!\nDuring any moment of the round, the player can spend 3 cards of the same character from his/her discarded pile. This triggers a special action, which is unique for each Pombie species. For example, spending 3 Catbies cards will allow the player to steal the latest discarded card from another player. The player should shout \u201cCatbies!\u201d while doing so to declare the action!\nWinning\nWhen you are only missing one card to complete the combination, you may place the last discarded card sideways, and declare \u201cReach!\u201d.\nThe player who declares \u201cReach!\u201d must bet a 10-soul token in the middle as a \u201cReach!\u201d mark.\nAfter this, the player who has declared \u201cReach!\u201d cannot change his cards until the round is over. (Only cards taken from the center pile can be discarded.)\nThe player can complete the combination through drawing the last card from the center pile, or when another player discards the last card. When this happens the player can shout \u201cPombies!\u201d and becomes the winner.\nIf nobody wins the round, then all 10-soul tokens in the middle will be kept for the next round. Good luck!\n(Game rule details will be written in the Rulebook which is in development.)\nAbout Spherewalker\nWe are from Hong Kong, a highly multi-national city.

This tuck variety lends a more antiquated appearance, as well as being overall better suited to the aesthetic of the deck. We're still working out the final details on that design, but will certainly post images as soon as it comes together.  \nEarly Sketches of Tuck Design\nThe Most Recent Iteration of The Inverse\nHow Do You Play Carte Rouge? \nCarte Rouge is set in the real world and many of the puzzles will require you to research languages, history, science, geography, and other disciplines in order to solve them. No special knowledge is required whatsoever; however, you will want to have your wits, along with paper, a writing utensil, and an internet-connected device. These will prove invaluable as you research into various topics and threads you come across throughout the course of the game. \nWith well more than 24 distinct puzzles, Carte Rouge is recommended for 1-5 players (although larger groups are feasible) and has a total play time of 12-20 hours. \nCourt Cards from a Prototype Deck\nIf you'd like to get a taste of the style of puzzle you can expect in this (or any of our games) then check out our Facebook page. We post a new puzzle every Friday and often use these weekly puzzles to test out new styles and concepts we're playing with.  While the difficulty in Carte Rouge will be higher than our weekly puzzles, these will give you a good idea of the types and styles of challenges you can expect to encounter. \nA Beauteous Bridge Shuffle\nProduction and Timeline\nProduction: We will be printing with the Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC), which is part of the Conjuring Arts Research Center in New York City. They specialize in highly artistic decks of cards, with a focus on superb quality and exacting attention to detail. (To see some examples of their work, click here.) The Carte Rouge deck will include a variety of high-caliber design features including:\n Classic Finish card stock\n Pantone spot colors\n Pantone Metallics spot colors\n Sideways styled tuck box\n Hot foil detailing on the tuck box\n Internal printing on the tuck box\n And maybe more, stay tuned, there are still details being finalized!\nClick for a High-Resolution Version!\nTimeline: Unlike our previous games which we were able to produce concurrently with the Kickstarter campaign for a quick finish, Carte Rouge has a much larger scope that requires more time to complete. That said, even as we launch the campaign we are 99% prepared to send print-ready files off to EPCC to begin production. With a little extra time built in to account for TUBI (The Unforeseen But Inevitable) we are confident that we will be able to deliver on the following timeline:\n August 20-September 10: The campaign runs. And in the meantime, we finalize artwork, tuck box design and prepare files for EPCC. \n September 17: Kickstarter funds process. This takes a week as Kickstarter runs all the credit cards and takes their share. However, once this is finalized we will have a pretty good idea of our production needs.\n September 30: We place our order. There's a little TUBI time built in here, and we may well order early, but we've allowed two weeks specifically to deal with any issues that may arise with the files being sent to EPCC and giving us time to resolve them. \n October 1-21: Pledge Manager is open. Barring any unforeseen issues, we will be running our PM via Gamefound. (Note: All of our previous games will be available to add to your pledge in the PM to save on shipping.)\n  November - December : Production. With our order being placed at the end of September, about a month later we should have physical proofs in hand. Having run multiple test prints, we're feeling confident it should look quite lovely! Once we've approved the physical proofs, the final print run can begin.\n January 1, 2020: Product arrival. Getting over a thousand decks of cards shipped overseas takes some time and upon arrival there is customs processing. With all of that in consideration we anticipate receiving the cards around the turn of the year.\n  January 21, 2020: Fulfillment begins. Again, there's a bit of TUBI time here as well, but once we have the cards here in hand we can begin fulfillment! This should mean that everyone receives their rewards by sometime in February.\nAnd, as always, we reserve the right to do our best to get Carte Rouge shipped to you sooner than promised. We can't guarantee anything, but trust us, we're almost as excited to send you your decks as you are to receive them!\nSome Production Samples from EPCC\nShipping Info:\nLike our previous campaign, we intend to partner with Spiral Galaxy in the UK for our European fulfillment. That said, with the ever-looming specter of Brexit hanging over the entire industry, there is a possibility that they will no longer be an option for shipping by the time we reach fulfillment. If that occurs, we will be looking for a replacement but run the risk of delaying fulfillment to that part of the world or, alternately, fulfilling in a not-so-EU-friendly manner from our headquarters (i.e., living rooms) here in the United States. We'll be sure to keep you in the loop as that situation develops and we get closer to fulfillment.\nAssuming all goes according to plan, our shipping breaks down simply:\n United States: Free shipping.\n Rest of the World: $7 shipping for a single deck, $10 for two.\nWe sincerely wish we could offer free shipping to everyone, but unfortunately the logistics of international delivery simply don't allow for that, even for such a modestly-sized item. However, we want to do our best, so please know that even with these shipping charges we are subsidizing all international orders by at least 50% and often more depending on the destination. We always do our best to make it so you can get our games at a reasonable price, regardless of where you reside.\nAs always, additions to your order in Gamefound after the campaign ends will alter your shipping costs, but not by much. You can see a breakdown of some common order sizes below.\nSome Common Orders & Their Pricing\nReviews:\nA fantastic feature from Jack Eddy of The Cardboard Herald\n(He also did this interview with Khiara, the lead designer of Carte Rouge!)\nA stellar segment from Daniel Robison of Plumpy Thimble\nA lovely little tidbit from The Brawling Brothers\nA splendid special from Tom Heath of Slicker Drips\nStretch Goals..?\nSo, you may have noted that we haven't discussed stretch goals. The truth of the matter is, we don't have any this time around. From the get-go, we wanted Carte Rouge to be a luxurious artifact \u2014 something exceedingly satisfying to play with and display. Throughout the design process we repeatedly considered various aspects of the deck as stretch goals only to ultimately add them to the plans regardless. \nSimply Magical\nSince the deck has been designed with excellence in mind, we didn't want to make foil for the tuck or metallic finishing on the cards a separate goal--those and more are all part of the product regardless of whether we fund by 10 or 10,000 dollars over goal!\nJokers from a Prototype Deck\nWho is The Enigma Emporium?\nThe Enigma Emporium is just a couple of people with a love for board games, escape rooms, and puzzles of all sorts, along with a history of making them both for pleasure and profession. The Enigma Emporium was born of our desire to share that love and help make puzzling a stellar hobby for all involved!  \nKhiara & Logan - Summer 2019\nThe Enigma Emporium was the result of long conversations about puzzle games, subscription boxes, and our own likes and dislikes regarding what we'd played and, ultimately, what we would like to do differently.\nOur two primary goals are to provide as immersive and aesthetic an experience as possible and offer as low a financial barrier to entry as possible. Carte Rouge is a direct result of design with those goals in mind, and we hope that you'll enjoy playing it as much as we enjoyed making it!\nThanks for looking!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith artwork 90% complete and the rest of the edits well underway, the biggest challenges remaining are production and fulfillment. We are prepared to begin the printing process with EPCC as soon as we have funds in hand. That process is estimated to take 2-3 months from start to finish, including shipping the cards here to us in the US so we can ship them out to you. With funds reaching us around early October, that means that production should be wrapping up around the end of this year. Once cards get to us, we'll get them sent out to you!\n\nThat said, there are talks of increased tariffs on a variety of imported goods, including playing cards. This has been accounted for in our funding goal, however that situation may end up adversely affecting customs processing times.\n\nThe other potential concern, particularly for our European backers, is the Brexit situation. \nOur EU friendly fulfillment partner (Spiral Galaxy) is based in the UK, therefore if Brexit passes that may mean a slight change to shipping occurrences. Spiral Galaxy has contingency plans in place for a variety of situations, so we aren't overly concerned and will be sure to keep you all in the loop as that develops.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Curious Bystander", "descp": "Not ready to take the leap but want to follow along with the campaign?

During a game you engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It\u2019s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it\u2019d take to watch one.\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. \nSo what's in the box? \nThe new Fiasco retains all the features familiar to old friends, while being much more welcoming to new ones. \nWe\u2019ve tossed out all the dice and index cards and replaced them with playing cards. Setup elements? On cards. Tilt, Aftermath and positive and negative Outcomes? On cards. It speeds up play, adds intuitive, strong visual appeal, and just plain improves the play experience. \nAs an added bonus, it\u2019s now possible to \u201ctune\u201d playsets, combining elements from your favorite Fiasco settings old and new. Since playsets are now decks of cards, we\u2019re committed to rolling out old favorites and new surprises regularly, and we\u2019re looking into how we can share the tools you need to make you own. \nThe game has been playtested thoroughly and is ready to go. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make it beginner friendly - everything you need is in the box.\nThe start of any Fiasco is in the Setup. You and your friends (3-5 players) will choose one of the playset decks that sounds fun and put it on the table with the Engine deck. That's all you need to play the game, but we'll also include a game board and player aid cards to guide you and make sure everyone is on the same page. \nInside the box you'll get three playsets- Dragonslayers, Poppleton Mall, and Tales From Suburbia. These are some of the most popular and well-loved playsets for classic Fiasco and we think you'll have a great time with them! You can also back at reward tiers that include Expansion Packs- more info on those in the What's Included section below.\nThe prototype deck for the Poppleton Mall playset\nTo create the Setup, you'll shuffle the playset deck and hand out all the cards to the players. The players will then take turns choosing Relationships from their hand and placing them between any two players, establishing connections between characters. \nOnce you have the Relationships chosen, you'll add details to each relationship, including Needs, Locations, and Objects that will all help to drive your story. \nOnce these connections are in place, each player looks at the relationships on either side of them and determines what sort of person their character must be. The last step is putting together a name from the options on the back of each playset card. \nPoppleton Mall all set up and ready to play\nOnce the setup is done, you'll use the Engine Deck to begin playing Scenes in two Acts. Each player will take a turn framing a scene about their character, choosing the setting and determining what their character wants. Other players will join in, offering suggestions and playing their characters. After a minute or two, the other players at the table will decide whether the scene has a Positive or Negative Outcome and give you a card. \nThe Fiasco Engine Deck prototype\nEach player will get two spotlight scenes in the first act and two in the second. In between you do the Tilt, which uses elements on the Outcome cards to determine some crazy new twists in your story. At the end of the game, you'll use the Aftermath cards to determine how your characters' stories end up, before you describe your final epilogue.\n Praise\n\"Damn this Fiasco game is ingenious.\" \u2013 John Rogers, TV and film writer for Leverage and The Librarians\n\"Fiasco is unique among RPGs because it encourages us to actively reach for that moment we all dread in most games, that moment when something truly awful is going to happen, with possibly dire results for our characters.\" \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Actor and Writer\n\"I think, for me, there\u2019s a kind of non-Aristotelian catharsis in that active rehearsal of everything I fear and dread and also pine for; it\u2019s a chance to dance with Poe\u2019s Imp of the Perverse, to give in, to make the dangerous choice\u2014it\u2019s the same thing release I get from the act of writing. But writing is a solitary discipline for the most part and Fiasco\u2026 Fiasco is so gloriously communal.\" \u2013 Kelly Sue DeConnick, Writer of Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly, and Bitch Planet\n\"The joy of Fiasco comes when the line between game and story blurs and suddenly you\u2019re sitting around a table with the brilliant and wonderful souls you allow into your home and you all try to make the perfect Big Black Box. Impose logic, reason, design, over the chaotic horror of existence because in story-space, in a game-space, because here we CAN. We aren\u2019t just allowed but it\u2019s ENCOURAGED. Draw this map of hell, we tell ourselves. Later on we can find our way out.\" \u2013 Matt Fraction, Writer of Hawkeye and Sex Criminals\n\"Fiasco is roleplaying stripped down to sheer elegance, to virtually zero ramp-up time. The notion of playing ambitious crooks with poor impulse control \u2014 inspired by a host of movies like Fargo or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels \u2014 is both inspiring and immensely replayable. But the real genius of Fiasco... is that now you can enjoy it in almost any setting you like.\" \u2013 the 2011 Diana Jones Award Committee\nAwards and Honors\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, 2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, Best Support, 2009 Indie RPG Awards \nFiasco \u2013 Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award, 2009 ENnie Awards\nFiasco \u2013 Finalist, RPG of the Year, 2010 Indie RPG Awards Boardgamegeek.com \nActual Play Videos\nPodcasts\nCatastrophic - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophic-a-fiasco-podcast/id1063907406\nFandible - http://www.fandible.com/fiasco-with-great-power/\nGosh Darn Fiasco - https://goshdarnfiasco.simplecast.fm/ \nOne Shot - http://oneshotpodcast.com/tag/fiasco/ \nThe Tilt - http://thetilt.libsyn.com/podcast \n Please Note!

If you prefer to share it with the world, we will format the game for printing and release it so anyone in the world can get it. We hope you choose the latter option because it will invariably be a work of genius, but it's up to you.\nCaveats: We reserve the right to workshop your playset idea, or to reject it entirely.

Every backer will receive the digital files, and in addition we'll include a free copy of the blank expansion pack with every print reward of $90 (\"Street Racer\") or above.  \nExample of form fillable playset PDF\n Shipping boxed games can be expensive, and shipping and customs costs are always changing. We\u2019re cautious about the possibility of overcharging some of you, so rather than set flat rates by country, we\u2019ll be adding shipping costs when your package is ready, though BackerKit. This will get you the most accurate rate based on the time we send and your location.\nPrices do not include shipping or customs!\nPlease keep in mind that these are estimates, and with things as they  are in the UK/EU, these numbers could change. We're continuing to work  with our shipping partners and will adjust as needed as we get closer to  charging for shipping.\nAlso, while we say \"the rest of the world\" there are some  restrictions imposed by our partners- shipping to Russia, Brazil, China,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia may incur additional charges, due to increased  difficulties shipping to there. We'll continue to look for affordable  options.\nIf shipping charges turn out to be too expensive for you, you will be  able to request a refund of your pledge amount after the campaign  through BackerKit, either by sending us a Kickstarter message or email  to info@bullypulpitgames.com. \n This Kickstarter campaign is designed to be very lean and straightforward - our goal is to get the word out to as many people as we can, so that more people can find out how much fun the game is. If you back this Kickstarter at any level you\u2019ll get immediate access to the pre-release draft of the rules, and we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll love them. Please play, and tell your friends! \nThe primary reward for jumping on board now is the chance to help us explore this new direction for the game and to get access to the upcoming playsets before they're publicly released.\n Fiasco was created by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy. Together, we run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing award-winning games such as Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and the original Fiasco since 2006. This is our sixth Kickstarter campaign.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for Fiasco. Brennen is an essential part of the BPG team and has helped us create a number of great games including Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and The Skeletons. He also provided the editing and music for our video!\nJenn Martin is our Production Coordinator and the Project Manager for this edition of Fiasco, and is the one keeping this train on the rails. Jenn is a maker, editor, writer, and game designer. She's also the Larp Coordinator for Big Bad Con, one of our favorite conventions!\nOur eagle-eyed editor is Karen Twelves, who has worked with us on multiple projects, refining our voice and catching our slip-ups every time. \nSpecial thanks for this Kickstarter go to Alex Roberts for development and enthusiasm and Mike Graves for helping with the video and gamely volunteering to see if he could fit himself into our duffel bag. \nOne Mike in a duffel bag\n Thank you for checking out the project and for helping us bring this game to life.\nIf you can\u2019t back us right now, remember that telling a friend, or sharing on your social media channels, is a big help too!\nWe're very excited about this project and we hope that you are too.

This project is modeled on our previous successful Kickstarter projects, so we know how to manage the challenges of a campaign and deliver rewards on time.\n\nPRINTING\nWe learned a lot from printing Ghost Court and Star Crossed, and we\u2019re happy to say we\u2019ll be working with the same excellent printers this time. That said, while we don't expect any problems, shipping from overseas means that there is always a slight risk that a cargo ship will be late and things will be delayed by a month or so. We will keep you informed!\n\nFULFILLMENT\nWe'll be using the same local fulfillment service as we have for all of our previous campaigns to handle U.S. customers. We're also looking to expand our options for overseas fulfillment so that we can offer customs-free shipping to more international backers. Stay tuned for more on that. \nInevitably a few shipments will get lost or damaged\u2014particularly those going overseas\u2014but we'll be following those shipments closely and making sure backers get what they ordered!\n\nTRANSPARENCY\nFinally, we're committed to keeping you informed and being transparent about the process.

First, if you are ok waiting for fulfillment of the Adventures in Alchemy expansion (see below for more details) then it would help us out a lot to ship replacement boards with the expansion. There are a large number of replacements needed and the boards are quite heavy as a set so replacing them all together would be a huge cost to us (as our printer also refuses to ship the replacements to backers).

I would love for you to join me live for this last hour and celebrate what we have achieved!\nYou are citizens of Squall's End on a rescue mission to The Isle of Cats and must rescue as many cats as possible before the evil Lord Vesh arrives. Each cat is represented by a unique tile and belongs to a family, you must find a way to make them all fit on your boat while keeping families together.\nYou will need to manage resources as you draft cards to explore the island, rescue cats, find treasures, befriend Oshax and read ancient lessons. Each lesson you collect will give you another personal way of scoring points, in addition to filling your boat and keeping cat families together!\nTo expand the base game, we are offering a 5 & 6 player expansion adding more lesson cards, cats, treasures and 2 extra boats to the game. Not only does this expansion add support for 2 extra players, but it also adds more variety and options to the base game extending the replayability offered by the game. \n\nThe Isle of Cats is played over 5 days (rounds). On each day the cats will venture into the fields on the island and you have until nightfall to attempt to rescue them through 5 phases of play.\nEach player gains 20 fish.\nEach player is dealt 7 discovery cards, they choose and keep 2, passing the remaining cards to the player to their left. They repeat this process 4 times, but the last time they will only keep 1 card.\nYou will then look at your 7 cards to decide which to add to your hand. The cost is in the top left corner of every card, and if you wish to keep a card, it must be paid for in fish.\nYou can keep as many cards as you like!\nEvery lesson card you kept must be placed face down on the table. Lesson cards are personal objectives allowing you to score extra points at the end of the game.\nNow players take it in turns to rescue cats, each cat requires a basket and a number of fish. Keep going around the table until everyone has run out of baskets, fish, or passes.\nWhen you rescue a cat, you must immediately place it on your boat, the first cat can go anywhere, but after that every cat must touch at least 1 previously played tile.\nYou will need to find a balance between how many cards you keep in the explore stage, and how many cats you wish to rescue in the rescue phase.\nFinally, players will take it in turns to play Oshax and Treasure cards. Treasures offer smaller pieces to fill those tricky areas, and the Oshax are friendly cats that can act as any colour, they just want to have a friend!\nAfter 5 days, you will earn points for completed lesson cards, rare treasures and families of cats (groups of touching cats of the same colour) on your boat. \nHowever, you will lose points for each room on your boat which isn\u2019t filled and any rats which haven\u2019t been eaten!\n\nThe winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game!\nYou can download the rulebook here.\n\nThe Isle of Cats family mode provides a beginner friendly, gateway game which can be played by anyone new to the board game hobby, and children. It removes a lot of the complexity included within the standard game and simplifies the setup, learning curve, and decisions players have to make. \nIt also makes the perfect introductory game, as once you are comfortable with the family mode and are ready for something more challenging, you will already know some of the rules for the standard game. \n You can download the rulebook here.\n\n\n\nThe Isle of Cats solo mode has been designed to provide players with a similar experience to the multiplayer game. You won\u2019t be competing to get the best score possible, but instead you will be faced against your sister! Somehow, she managed to sneak aboard your boat and she is trying to claim credit for everything you have done, it\u2019s going to be a tough week!\nIn the solo mode you will be playing the game in the exact way you would play the multiplayer game, but through a few extra cards and minimal management, you will find yourself competing against a challenging opponent. The solo game includes multiple difficulties allowing you to progress as you get better and is a great way to learn the game before playing with other people.\nYou can download the rulebook here, the solo rules start on page 18.\nIf you would like to read a written preview of The Isle of Cats, then Zatu Games has you covered!\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nElla, Yanna, and Kuma are the inspiration behind The Isle of Cats and lead models.\nFrank West is the designer of The Isle of Cats, he is also the worldbuilder for The City of Kings, art director, and graphic designer.\nDragolisco is the lead artist for The Isle of Cats, creating nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst exploring The Isle of Cats.\nSara Jorge is the Assistant Producer of The Isle of Cats and has helped create prototypes, organise playtests, and assisted with design concepts.\nIan O'Reilly is the primary writer assisting Frank with writing the back stories for The Isle of Cats.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nAll shipping is EU, America, Canada, Australia, and Brazil friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations. We will also do everything we can to keep our UK shipping friendly whatever the outcome of Brexit.\n** Shipping to Brazil is sent as part of a bulk shipment to a warehouse, removing custom fees. However, this does add 2 months to the shipping period.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Russia. If this should change I will let you know.\n Additional copies of the game\nYou may add additional copies of the game and/or expansion to your pledge, and will receive a \u00a35 discount for every extra copy after your first. To do this, please manually increase your pledge to include the extra funds, and if you are outside of the US/UK please make sure you include shipping. You will also be able to do this in the Pledge Manager after the campaign should you wish, where the costs will be calculated for you.\nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world and would be happy to discuss our retail options with you. If you are a retailer and are interested in The Isle of Cats then please message us through the Kickstarter page or email Frank@tcokgame.com .\nRemember to include your company name and the country your business is based in so I can get back to you with the right information as quickly as possible.\nWe would love to hear from you and talk about The Isle of Cats, The City of Kings or just gaming in general!

My last Kickstarter, The City of Kings included multiple expansions, custom 3D accessories and was a very big boxed game. That Kickstarter delivered successfully on time and has seen tens of thousands of boxes shipped worldwide.\n\nWith The Isle of Cats the box size is much more standard, and I have limited the number of different boxes and accessories available during the campaign. I am extremely confident this project will be delivered on time, and to the standard The City of Kings fans have come to expect.\n\nDESIGN\nThe game requires no further work, it has been through countless blind and normal playtests and is ready to be printed.\n\nARTWORK\nAll of the artwork is done for the game, we have a few bits of graphic design to finish off for the rulebook and back of the box, but I don\u2019t see any potential delays being caused by these tasks.\n\nEDITING \nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now remaining is copy editing and proof reading of all the content, to make sure the team catches as many spelling mistakes as possible. I have allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nMANUFACTURING\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in printing The City of Kings, World Packs and Vadoran Gardens, I am extremely confident in their ability to manufacture this game.\n\nSHIPPING\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during our last project, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nAny refund request received within 14 days of this Kickstarter campaign ending will be refunded in full. This Kickstarter is being funded in GBP, so \u2018in full\u2019 refers to a full refund of the GBP value received.\n\nAfter 14 days have passed from the moment the Kickstarter has finished, we will only be able to refund 85% of the amount paid. This is due to Kickstarter, Pledge Manager, and other fees we incur and cannot reclaim.\n\nOnce we have started packing your pledge for shipment, we will no longer be able to provide refunds.\n\nFINAL WORDS\nMy previous campaigns for The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens will be experiences I will never forget, I continue to learn with every game I create and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Citizen of Squall's End", "descp": "Receive project updates, gain access to the Pledge Manager and join in with the adventure!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["1,082 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "The Isle of Cats", "descp": "1 full copy of The Isle of Cats and Kickstarter Pack, including all stretch goals.\nFree shipping to the US and UK, heavily discounted shipping everywhere else.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Isle of Cats game\nKickstarter pack\nAll stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,272 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "The Isle of Cats 5 & 6 Player Expansion", "descp": "1 full copy of The Isle of Cats with the 5 & 6 player expansion and Kickstarter Pack, including all stretch goals.\nThe 5 & 6 player expansion adds more lesson cards to the game for increased replayability, the Oshax player token, more cat tiles and support for 5 and 6 players with 2 new unique player boats.\nFree shipping to the US and UK, heavily discounted shipping everywhere else.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Isle of Cats game\nKickstarter pack\nAll stretch goals\n5 & 6 player expansion", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4,744 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "The end! or is it just the beginning?", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nThe time has come to say good bye, our Kickstarter adventure is over and this will be the last ever update on this campaign.\nThank you all so much for making the last 2 years the most incredible experience, Sara and I will remember it forever.

Since Rose joined us full time in 2018 as a developer, we've been steaming ahead turning these ideas into a tightly woven narrative puzzle experience. \nRose has done an incredible job of tieing together a fantastic, dramatic narrative threaded through over 50 carefully engineered puzzles inspired by dozens of escape games, escape rooms and puzzle books, as well as an unreasonably large pile of reference books.\nRecruiting the help of Oxford University Egyptology researcher Dr Edward Love who inspired us with loads of historical examples of Egyptian codes, ciphers and language quirks, we've attempted to make not only a satisfying game, but an informative and accurate one too! A great big thank you to Johanna and Roland, too - without whom the game wouldn't anywhere near as beautiful as it is!\nA massive thank you to all of our early playtesters, who've helped us make this the best it can be. Thanks to: \nAmy Nash, Andy Mackay, Becky Todd, Bernard, Britt Callebaut, Brooke B., Daniel Pitcock, Dave Wetherall, Donald Stanley, Eric Mazelis, Erik Cole, Frans Treur, Grant Miner, Ian Stronach, James Olson, Jens Grimmel, Jeremy Skrdla, Jing Lim, Jolien Bortier, Justin Bird, Justine, Ken Whitehurst, Kevin Beeckmans-Cop, Linda Canton, Liz Howald, Loriana Giuliani, Nic, Peter 'Pedro' Goins, Sally, Simon Westenra, Stephen Spikings, Theo Edwards, Aidan Reynolds, Benedicte Wulff, Alex Hopkins, Jiaqi Li .", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGAME DESIGN: \nWe first came up with this idea over a year ago, and since then have been tirelessly researching both the thematic and structural aspects of the project. While between us, we've played dozens of puzzle games, gone through dozens of puzzle books, and completed half of London's escape rooms, we knew that for a game this ambitious, we needed something more. We recruited over 100 playtesters from around the world and got their feedback over multiple rounds of testing to ensure that the puzzles work exactly as we designed them to. Even after that, we need to make sure it all ticks like clockwork - and will be doing additional rounds of testing after the campaign before we get to print. The challenge for us is if there are lots of small edits to make, and ensuring that we get through those properly in good time. As Rose has done a spectacular job so far in this regard, we're confident that this will not affect the overall timeline projection. \n\nILLUSTRATION & GRAPHIC DESIGN \nAnyone who's backed our projects before knows that we spend a huge amount of time working on our artwork and graphic design. Johanna has completed the artwork for 90% of the puzzles, the journal and all other assets needed to wrap up the project for print. You can see many of her illustrations throughout the campaign. That said, there's a few more to be done and there may be tweaks needed in the final proofing stage. We've put a formal timeline in place to account for this, and have allowed several 'check points' to ensure that the artwork is up to scratch and consistent with the puzzle refinements we might make. All the packaging and box design is already complete and print-ready.\n\nMASS MANUFACTURE \nA year ago, as part of the Sub Terra Documentary promised from our \u00a3300,000 stretch goal, we visited the factory in Shanghai. We inspected all the pieces of equipment and production lines, met with staff and talked through our production objectives with their team, to ensure that we know exactly how your games are made. This means we've already avoided many of the costly mistakes that can catch projects off guard, and optimised the product design to take into account the way the machines and team produce the games - meaning they'll produce them better, faster! Nevertheless, we're working closely with the manufacturer for this project, Longpack, to ensure that every tiny detail is produced according to our high standards, and so that it delivers the excellent experience you expect. We'll be keeping close communication with them until we've confirmed everything is 100% and has been checked in the fulfillment warehouses.\nAs an additional assurance, we're spending two weeks with the Longpack team in Shanghai and around China inspecting the factory and their suppliers in November this year.\n\nFREIGHT & FULLFILMENT \nShipping hundreds or even thousands of games around the world is a complex project, and we've learned an enormous amount from our previous four successful campaigns. We've already calculated the plans for shipping games to 4 regional warehouses and fulfilling locally from there, as well as factoring in a realistic amount of contingency time for the not uncommon delays associated with sea freight of the games from the factory in China to the warehouses around the world. Additionally, we've optimised the product design of the game to account for shipping charge thresholds on dimensions and weight - ultimately saving you money.\n\nUNFORESEEN EVENTS \nDelivering a complex tabletop game Kickstarter project successfully is a challenge in itself, with a huge number of variables in play at any given time, and a large variety of places where things can go wrong. Due to the nature of this process, some things may change, but we are dedicated to making sure everyone is fully informed of any planned changes to content, the timeline or any other relevant information. We're dedicated to proving to all our backers that we are committed to excellent service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Summer School", "descp": "We'll send you a postcard from our travels digging up graves around the world...\nINCLUDES:\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Undergraduate", "descp": "As well as a postcard from our travels digging up crypt x across the world, we'll also send you a copy of the professor's notebook.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["876 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "Postgraduate", "descp": "Every adventurer needs the right tools, in addition to the postcard and professor's notes, you'll get a supply kit of essential tools for your cryptic adventures.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nArchaeologist's Notebook\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["220 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a337 or more", "title": "Doctor of Archaeology", "descp": "The most accomplished academics use the best materials to discover their next breakthroughs.

As you and your fellow monsters toss around the village king, you attract a steady buffet of adventurers who try - poorly - to put up a fight!\nTake turns selecting which adventurers to consume, dropping various body parts into your stomach. Once you or another monster fills their stomach, the most satisfied monster wins!\nTasty Humans is all about putting together a great meal. Every great meal starts with the right ingredients, found in the Attacking Adventurers Grid. When you eat an adventurer, you'll get to place delicious tiles in your stomach. (More on that in Step 2).\nAdventurers give up when you decide to eat them. Their friends, don't, though. You can take damage from other adventurers.\nSwordsmen: For each swordsman adjacent to the adventurer, take a damage tile.\nArchers: For each archer two spaces away in a straight line to the adventurer, take a damage tile.\nOther adventurers can have all sorts of weird effects if you eat them.\nWizards: If you eat one, two adjacent tiles in your stomach - of your choice - swap places.\nCaptains: If you eat one, adventurers get real spooked and run away. If their banner shows a vertical arrow, adventurers in the same column of the grid run away. If their banner shows a horizontal arrow, adventurers in the same row run away.\nClerics: If you eat one, remove one damage tile. They're great when you have a stomachache.\nAfter choosing an adventurer, eat any damage you take. Then decide how to drop the adventurer into your stomach.\nEach card shows a shape consisting of two to four basic tile types (helmet, armor, boot, and hand). Choose how you want to rotate the shape and which columns the tiles will be dropped into.\nOnce dropped, tiles fall all the way to the bottom of your stomach, sometimes breaking the original shape apart!\nAdventurers never learn. When one is eaten, another one takes their place!\nOn the Attacking Adventurers Grid, slide cards downward as far as possible, and refill with a new adventurer from the top.\nHow do you know how satisfied you are with a meal? The answer is Leader Tiles. Leader Tiles are dropped into your gut after each round of play. Where other tiles are in relation to Leader Tiles plays a big role in your final score! The scoring rules for each Leader Tile differ based on the title. \nPLAY\n\nOnce you tally up the points received for Leader Tiles, subtract points for any sets of damage tiles which are touching in your stomach. Then add points for meeting the conditions of your Personal Craving, which is written in the top left of your board. \nPlease Note: shipping will be collected through a pledge manager after the conclusion of the campaign.\nThis helps us reduce costs for both you and us. \nWorried about customs fees? This campaign includes US, UK, EU, Australia, and Canada friendly shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are two things left to do after this campaign, and they're very simple: print the game and fulfill orders. That's it!\n\nThat said, printing and fulfillment are not without risks. We've vetted our prospective printing company thoroughly, ordering multiple samples to make sure the quality is excellent. We also have contacted their prior clients to ensure the experience has been a positive one.\n\nRegarding the cost of order fulfillment, there are three elements to this: freight, tariffs, and order processing. We're having the printing company handle freight under DDU terms and they are ensuring the inventory just in case something goes wrong. The only liability we have is the tax liability after the goods are imported. Pretty straightforward and cuts down on potential risks for Pangea Games.\n\nTariffs are a little more complicated. Board games may be facing tariffs as high as 25% after the conclusion of this campaign as a result of the US trade war with China. We assumed the worst when putting together this campaign, and we're raising enough money to handle those tariffs if they are applied to our inventory.\n\nOrder processing will be handled by Fulfillrite. I have a working relationship with the CEO and have seen their processes from the inside. Additionally, their reviews on TrustPilot and Shopify are nothing but five stars. They literally have no reviews below five stars. \n\nThe estimated reward fulfillment time of December gives us five months to print and ship the game, which is consistent with our estimates on manufacturing, freight shipping, and order fulfillment. There is even a little buffer time built in to account for the holiday rush.\n\nSeventy-one percent of the funds raised in this campaign will go directly to manufacturing and freight. Twenty percent of the funds raised in this campaign will be used to subsidize shipping and order processing costs. Nine percent of the funds raised in this campaign will go to Kickstarter and their payment partners.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Brave Villager", "descp": "Thank you for helping us keep the village safe.

The Few and Cursed is now stretched to perfection and went on to unlock all 18 stretch goals (with a few hours to spare).  These stretch goals include wooden artifact tokens, new bounties, a cooperative mode, The Fallen Immortals  mini expansion and a 5th and 6th playable character: Alistair and Ze Amado. These extra characters mean that with the Deluxe box you can play with up to 6 players! \nPlease take a look at the Whats in the Box? and Stretch Goals sections below for more details on all the amazing content in store for Kickstarter backers.\nThe Few and Cursed: The Board Game is a competitive or cooperative action adventure game designed by Mike Gnade, where 1 to 6 Curse Chasers must explore the desert of the Pacific Ocean and fight their way through gangs, capture the biggest bounties, defeat monsters, complete jobs, and discover supernatural artifacts on their path to fame or infamy. \nBased on The Few and Cursed comic book series by Felipe Cagno and Fabiano Neves, the board game expands on the lore of the comics and brings its characters and creatures to life with amazing miniatures!  \nCheck out their Kickstarter to fund issue #6, the last part in The Crows of Mana'Olana story arc, and grab the entire mini-series. \nAnd if you are looking to get a taste for the lore and tales of The Few and Cursed be sure to check out the complete first issue in digital format when you back the game and check out this Update for Backers Only clicking right here.\nA Rich World Full of Lore from the Comic Books\nThe Few and Cursed can best be described as a Buffy the Vampire Slayer meets the Old West comic book series about people trying to survive a world where most of the water evaporated overnight in a mysterious apocalyptic event back in 1840.\nEven though what was left of mankind found a way to adapt using water, the most valuable asset on the planet, as currency, survival turned the world into a wicked wasteland where it's either kill or be killed. And evil not only endured, it won. \nPeople turned to dark arts, old tales of mischief and curses to survive.  Death is everywhere. But for every darkness there is light - and among the few and cursed are those willing to fight to bring balance to the land: the Curse Chasers. \nAsymmetric Characters and Starting Decks\nEach player chooses a Curse Chaser with their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Characters have different starting decks, varying weapon proficiency, abilities,  stats, and unique curse transformations.\nInnovative Deckbuilding\nThe Few and Cursed is a deck builder without a market.  You don't ever spend resources to acquire cards.  Instead we've developed a streamlined way to build your deck;  Every turn players Improvise and draw cards from the Upgrade Deck and then choose one to immediately add to their hand.\nEach card is designed as a panel from a comic book. You will play these cards to generate resources and take actions on your turn. Red chooses to focus on attack this turn. Which path will you choose?\nEmergent Storytelling\nAs you journey throughout the desert of the Pacific Ocean, you will draw Encounter cards based on your location and be faced with choices that will immediately impact your turn. The order of these events is randomized every time you play and crafts a story revolving around the lore of the comic books.\nPushing your luck with Curse\nEvery Curse Chaser is affected by the supernatural.  Draw on the darkness too much and you will transform and become cursed... every cursed state has its own pros and cons but they all lead towards death. \nMaecenas calls on his trusty bodyguard when he is weakened by Curse\n*Kickstarter Exclusive* means that this content WILL NOT enter regular distribution.  It is offered as part of this Kickstarter and may be offered for sale on our website or at conventions after our  backers have received their rewards.

We always work at minimizing the cost of shipping as much as possible and will be providing a small shipping discount to ALL backers regardless of region.  As with our previous campaigns, we will be working with shipping partners within the EU, US, Canada, Australia and Asia to provide region-friendly shipping in each of these zones. If you live in these regions, you will not have to worry about paying additional taxes or duties. \nHere are our estimated shipping costs based on a standard game package (3-5 kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2019 shipping rates, and costs may change based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose:\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nWe will charge and finalize your actual shipping after the campaign ends through our pledge manager. By doing so, we can ensure you get charged the shipping you actually deserve. We don't want to stick anyone with a large shipping bill long after the campaign is over but feel this is the fairest way to handle it while remaining fiscally responsible.  \nWhat about BREXIT?\nThe shipping above is based on the information and prices we have right now.  No one can predict how shipping costs will be affected if/when Brexit comes to fruition.  If shipping charges drastically change after October 31st, we will let you know as soon as we hear from our shipping partners about final pricing.  If they do go up radically, we will also be happy to offer refunds to any UK backers who can no longer justify the price. \nGame published by Rock Manor Games, owned and operated by Mike Gnade.

King Richard the Lionheart was fighting his crusade in the holy land leaving his country and his people at the mercy of his brother, the corrupt and greedy Prince John. Under the Princes regime, the people of England suffered. Prince John taxed his people into poverty. Starving and cold, they turned to petty crime to survive, making ordinary men outlaws.\nPunishment was dealt swiftly and harshly. The cruel and sadistic Sheriff of Nottingham had no tolerance for outlaws. He would imprison men, women and children for minor crimes and publicly execute prisoners as a warning to others. Meanwhile, after years of fighting alongside King Richard in the Crusades, Robin of Loxely returns home to find his lands seized, his father murdered and his country in turmoil. On his fathers grave, he becomes an outlaw and vows to avenge his fathers death, defend the crown and free the people from the cruelty and suffering they endure.\nAs Robin Hood, you\u2019ll rob from the rich, and give to the poor; battle the Sheriff of Nottingham and his goons; and recruit your merry men. Increase your influence over the people to gain power and win the game, but be careful: the Sheriff has put a bounty on your head. If it gets too high, the people will turn you in for the reward. \n\nContents:\n90 Cards (Story 1, Story 2, Characters, Loot, King Richard and Sherwood Forest)\n\"Bounty tracker\" player mat\nWooden disc bounty token\nCheck out this unboxing Video by Board Game Inquisition\nThis quick video will take you through the set up and basic game play of Robin Hood: Hero of the People.\nYou can check out the current version of the rule book here. \n\n\n\nI really like that the game mechanic is simple and lets me get straight to playing but still leaves enough strategy aspect to engage my mind. Geek Mom\nRobin Hood is a solid game: fun, exciting and good-looking. The game makes good use of its theme and has an interesting set of mechanisms that feel like you really are recruiting/rescuing your band of merry men and doing battle with the Sheriff of Nottingham. The Indie Game Report\nOverall I say the game is really good. There\u2019s nobody else to mess with your plans, nor help them succeed. There\u2019s no AI or ghost player. Just you versus the game. Purple Phoenix Games\nOverall, the game is fun \u2013 and worth a couple of playthroughs. You\u2019ll find yourself challenging yourself by necessity after you\u2019ve beaten the game once or twice, and that\u2019s bound to inject a bit more intrigue into the game. Australian Tabletop Gaming Network\nThere simply aren\u2019t enough Robin Hood games out there. He remains one of my favorite characters and stories to visit, especially the original Middle English tales, and so any time I see Robin Hood as a theme I\u2019m going to be interested. It has some nice artwork that evokes the modern version of Robin Hood. Cardboard Clash\nRobin Hood: Hero of the People was designed for The Game Crafter Solo Design Contest. It came in 3rd place beating out nearly 40 other entries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter researching Kickstarter for the past year, there's a lot of pitfalls that have tripped up over creators. I've done my best to avoid the same pitfalls.\nI've already invested a fair amount of cash to get the artwork to the standard it is now. This is the final artwork so I won't have to spend more time and cash to get it ready. \nI've also decided to partner with The Game Crafter for production and fulfilment. The Game Crafter is a Print on Demand service based in the US. As I'm planning on a small print run of between 100- 200 copies a print on demand service will work well and their bulk ordering pricing makes each copy affordable.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days).

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live.

The celebrated hit card game Munchkin and its infamous characters come to life on your tabletop with amazing miniatures!\n Find out more about these Optional Buys in the following links: Munchkin Dungeon: Board Silly, Munchkin Dungeon: Cthulhu, Munchkin Dungeon: Cute as a Button, Epic Dungeon Board, Extra Dice Pack, Villain Dice Pack, Colored Dice Pack, Legendary Pack.\nCore box painted miniatures. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nSide Quest painted miniatures. PLEASE NOTE FIGURES COME UNPAINTED.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\n\n\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). Backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You can check out a basic quick start version of the rules right here!\nFor a taste of the world of Americana, and to get a feel for the kind of stories you can tell in this game, check out Tom's Dead, a short audio drama about a gang of kids investigating the death of their friend, juggling their responsibilities and trying to avoid getting grounded.\n This project will be using DriveThruRPG PoD Coupons to deliver the final product, please remember to factor in the print and postage costs of the final product when you pledge! We expect the printing costs of the hardcover to be around $15!\nYou play as something new and incredible in this world; a Teenager. Never before has the world been in a place that allowed for a long adolescence, and as the first of these strange creatures, you make a lot of people uncomfortable with your wild clothes, your loud music and your strange habits. Players choose from one of 6 teenage archetypes - Jock, Nerd, Artist, New Kid, Outsider, Royal - each with their own strengths and place within the high school ecosystem. You'll also pick from one of 9 fantasy species, each with their own unique backstory and history within the world.\nAs a teenager, your time is not entirely your own. You have obligations to your family, your job, school, maybe even your sports team. You'll have to manage those and the repercussions for ditching them with your investigation if you don't want to raise too much heat from the adults.\nAs players, you'll use our town creation system to build your very own small town, populate it with fantastical gangs of teenagers, give them some incredible locations to hang out in, and some dangerous activities they get up to. You'll also create the murder victim, Your Dead Friend, as a character just like your own, whose skills and relationships will help you directly, and whose history with you will be a core part of your game.\nInvestigation in Americana is all about ties. Ties represent relationships that people, places and things have with Your Dead Friend. Throughout the game you'll follow these ties, chasing down clues and recording the leads on the Your Dead Friend Sheet, creating a living record of your investigation, as well as Your Dead Friend's relationships with the various gangs, adults, places and leaders you and your table have created.\nOur system places a strong emphasis on relationships and building these ties through roleplay, from the flashback mechanics to the importance of assist rolls, Americana is all about getting to know the world you made, and the characters you're playing, as well as, most importantly, Your Dead Friend.\n Podcasts!\nThe RPG Academy Show and Tell - \"This hits a lot of things right on the nose, I've very excited to see how well this goes[...]You've got a backer\"\nBonus Experience - \"This is cool as hell [...] I'm already counting down in my head, who can I get to play this with me?\"\nTom's Dead is a short audio play produced by the Sandy Pug Games team to give you a feel for the world and the kinds of stories Americana is designed to tell.

This was taken from our second session in an ongoing playtest, so the town is already established. The sound is also a lil quiet here and there, sorry about that!\nAmericana's world is a beautiful place, and we're filling the book with stories and art to flesh out this fantastical world that never was, but at this level we can do something really special and flesh out the pilot episode of Tom's Dead, the audio drama we made, into a full 6 episode series following the adventures of Balthazar and the crew as they try to uncover the truth behind who killed Tom, win the big race and maybe even make it to prom without getting killed themselves!\nAt this level we can afford to unleash one of our coolest ideas on the world. It's Americana, but not as you know it.\nThese teens don't have a murder to solve, they're doing something much much more important - saving the world from wild and wacky monsters with their hidden powers and massive robots they pilot as a fearless team. Super Americana Magic Force GO is activated!\nThis will be a digital PDF detailing additional mechanics, new character sheets and everything else you need to have that 1950s, fantasy tokatsu adventure you never knew you needed until now!\nFor our final stretch goal, we're moving the timeline forward a little, and taking Americana to the shadows in our alternative setting; Americana: MIA\nDelve into a fantasy cold war that never existed, take your team of spies across enemy lines, secure top secret information and uncover the conspiracy behind it all. Use high tech gadgets, classified magical powers and make deals with unspeakable beings to claim a victory no one will ever see. The Magical Intelligence Agency needs you!\nThis will also be a digital PDF detailing a whole host of new rules and mechanics, shifting the game from a murder mystery to exploring a conspiracy.\nAmericana is being developed by Sandy Pug Games, a small indie RPG design collective. \nSandy Pug Games was founded by Liam Ginty, the designer behind Orc Stabr, The Boughs and Mirror.  Liam has been designing games for 4 years, and playing them for as long as he can remember.

We have all worked together to create some really incredible games in the past and have a fantastic collaborative working energy. We've proven ourselves capable of making great stuff, and delivering it.\n\nThat said, every project is at risk of complications. The main risks for this project include delays with layout or art production. Stretch Goals also represent a risk, and while we're absolutely certain of our ability to produce them, historically they have been risky for other kickstarters too.\n\nWhile we're very experienced at producing solid, professional quality content, SPG is still a small group, and we've only had limited experience delivering physical products. Orc Stabr was our first real project involving physical rewards, and while that went great, we still had some minor hiccups at the shipping phase. To avoid any problems with delivery, we'll be using DriveThruRPG PoD coupons. This has a number of benefits - firstly, it means the game is much cheaper, only $35 total for a hardcover book. It'll also get into your hands faster, and you can rest assured that one of the biggest delivery companies in the TTRPG world is fulfilling your order.

When we launched the Kickstarter, I anticipated the printing costs to be around $17, and we were working very hard to keep as close to that number as possible, but with these changes we were actually able to add about 10-20 pages to the book on top of what we already have without going over that $17 point.

At the beginning of the game, Player's will choose the creatures with which they'd like to play. Players will collectively choose to have all matching hands or play \"chaotically\" where every player builds their own unique hand of creatures. Either way, a player's hand must contain a single card of each number (0-8). With the addition of a new mortal card, the Expansion also invites you to customize your game play experience with a unique mortal deck every time you play the game. Every round, or Night, you'll also play to win location cards that give you added bonuses in future Nights.\n  WELCOME! Thanks for taking the time to check out our project. If you're looking to back Campy Creatures for the first time, the options above might be great choices for you. Campy Creatures 2nd Edition gives you everything you need to play the game for the first time. The Spooky Edition next to it is our Kickstarter Exclusive product. It's got a limited edition box and a limited edition pin, and it also includes everything you need to play the game for the first time, plus the creepy new monsters we're showing off in this campaign!\nYou've asked for more re-playability, so we've refined how the Mortal Deck gets built allowing for new deck variants, added an additional Mortal card, The Assistant, and added the Location mechanic. We also improved the game layout and redesigned the rulebook.  It will also feature a larger Clash-O-Meter, providing room for both the Clash Tokens and Location cards, all in a bigger box that will fit both the base game and future expansions.\n  We're providing every backer of The Expansion tier with a Conversion Kit that includes all the new and updated Mortals Cards, the new Location Cards, and the2nd Edition rulebook. This kit updates all the card components of a 1st Edition game to the design standards of 2nd Edition.\nAlternatively, if you want all of the new components in addition to the updated cards and rulebook, you can back at the Conversion Edition tier. The Conversion Edition includes Expansion I and the Conversion Box. The Conversion Box includes all of the new and updated 2nd Edition cars as well as the new box, updated Clash-O-Meter, Clash Markers, Monster Tokens, and rulebook.\nHere is a comparison of the Conversion Kit and the Conversion Box. \nNote, Conversion Kits and Conversion Editions will be available for purchase in BackerKit after the campaign, but we will not be selling Conversion Boxes individually. In the video below, Mattox talks through some key points to keep in mind with these kits and more!\nWith the addition of Expansion I creatures, players will get to choose between 2 creature options for Creature cards 2-6, just like players get to pick between the Demogorgon and Invisible Man today. A player's hand must contain 9 creatures, one of every number from 0 to 8. Standard setup involves players having identical hands of cards, but players can also decide to play \"chaotically\" where each player chooses their hand of Creature cards at the beginning of the game. Feeling extra mad (in a science-y way of course)? Choose different Creature hands every round!\nAlong with the original Mortal sets of Teenagers, Classics and Enginneers, two new Mortal sets are being added.\n2nd Edition contains The Assistant, a Mortal that, once captured, chooses to join your ghoulish team. Assistants persist across rounds earning an increasing number of points based the quantity you've captured. These points are collected at the end of every round!\nExpansion I contains The Angry Mob. These Mortals are always on the move! Capturing an Angry Mob will cause neighboring (players to the left or right) Angry Mobs to join your collection. Capture The Instigator and ALL Angry Mobs will move to you. Lots of negative points, but a great way to secure Location victory.\nLocations are new to both 2nd Edition and Expansion I. One location is revealed every round, which is won by the player who captures the most Mortals containing the relevant \"location icons.\" The winning player gains that location's reward. 2nd Edition includes 6 new Locations and Expansion I adds 3 more. \nStretch Goal Locations\nWe did it! Josh has been at Blizzcon (I'm not jealous, you're jealous), so he is still finalizing the illustrations. They likely won't be done by the end of the campaign, so if you are joining us late, hop over to one of our social media pages for finalized art/mechanics. Speaking of mechanics, Mattox has been testing ideas for these cards, so look for those reveals as well! \nWe hadn't planned on adding any cards via stretch goals, but felt like it was another area the community wanted and we could make happen. So thanks again for your patience and for sharing your feedback!\nMattox Shuler, designer of Campy Creatures\n2nd Edition is not only a reprinting of Campy Creatures, it is an opportunity to pull our community into the development process. When we thought about changing up the base game content, we looked directly at community and player feedback about their experiences. A couple of key features stood out to us as must haves in this new edition. First, we wanted each round to have a different feel and flavor\u2014culminating in the Final Act. This comes in the form of a new Mortal type (Assistants) that are kept round to round and Locations cards that change up each round. Second, the size of the board has increased to make scoring and maneuvering around the Clash-O-Meter a little easier. Lastly, because we want to make more things in the Campy-verse, we re-arranged the Mortal deck in a new way to make the game more expandable and give players more control over how it's setup. Thank you for all of your feedback and support!\nMario Radmilovic, co-designer of Campy Creatures Expansion I\nMy name is Mario and I am one of the designers for this expansion after being a playtester and somewhat of an idea man during the first Campy Creatures Kickstarter campaign back in early 2017. Working on this expansion and actually filling the role of a designer has been a completely new experience for me, but I'm really excited about where we arrived and can't wait for you to try it.\n *Note, only the Wooden Power Up/Venom tokens and three New Locations will be included in the Expansion ($13) tier.\nThe items below are things you can add to your order through Backerkit after the campaign is over.\nHow do I add these cool things?\nYou can look through the items below, select the ones you are interested in, see how much they all cost, and add that amount to your pledge right now if you want. This extra money will appear as a credit in Backerkit. You do NOT have to do this! Once the campaign is over, you will be sent a link to finalize your order. All the things will be there.\nAll shipping charges will be handled after the campaign via BackerKit. Although we haven\u2019t finalized the specifics, we do have estimates for pledge items (i.e. before add-ons) based on prior campaign data and fulfillment partner estimates. We are close to finalizing add-on shipping and will be providing a table in an update after the campaign, but we are looking at tiering by number of add-ons items and setting a flat rate for any number of Giclee prints. So the \"each additional game\" line above is slightly over estimating the cost of extra games/apparel/cards if you add multiple items, but it is slightly underestimating the cost of adding prints.\nShipping will be Customs Friendly (US, CA, UK, EU, AU, NZ)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are continuing our manufacturing partnership with Panda Game Manufacturing. Production and assembly is scheduled for January/February and is likely to be impacted by Chinese New Year. We have worked with several different fulfillment partners in prior campaigns, but have not made a final decision on this campaign. Each partner has strengths based on different funding/regional backer distribution scenarios. We will share decisions with our backers when made, but in the meantime, here is our decision criteria:\n\n1. High level of customer service regarding communication and issue resolution\n2. Accountability for timelines\n3. Quality of shipment (picking accuracy and package safety)\n4. Balance of speed/affordability\n5.

Our screenplay is based on the book, \u201cThe Adventures of Robin Hood\u201d by Howard Pyle. Pyle lived from 1853 to 1911, and in his life compiled all the old ballads of Robin Hood into a linear story that tells the tale of Robin Hood from his youth to his death, and fills in the gaps that the original ballads leave.\n\nThe story of Robin Hood in fact had little to do with robbing the rich and giving to the poor. Robin Hood embodied the meaning of the old Chinese proverb, \u201cGive a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.\u201d Robin Hood took money from those who acquired their wealth through extortion or unrighteous use of authority (the Bishop of Hereford, for example), and gave it to those who had fallen on hard times through no fault of their own. He was a symbol of honor, justice, and mercy.\n\nWe feel that Robin Hood is the hero that today's America needs. In a world where people are constantly fighting over what's right and wrong, a standard of values needs to have a prominent presence. Honesty to self and others is an essential principle to maintain society, something being against the law does not mean that it is wrong, and simply because something is not against the law does not mean that it is right. Robin Hood stands as an example that each person is accountable for their own fortune, and that each person has natural God-given rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. He expected people to work for their own support, and not rely on others for their wealth. The story of Robin Hood and all that it embodies must be told, and to as many people as possible.\n\nWhat's the Rush?\nWhile we are fully dedicated to this project, we need to have time to make plans in the event that we are not able to acquire the funding necessary to do the project. Also, the pre-production process can be long, and we intend to take the time necessary to find the best deals for every thing that we need to pay for.\nWho We Are\n\nCameron Porter, the screenplay writer, and Robert Kennard, the director, have been passionate about film-making since middle school. We are both 22 years old, married, and attending school full-time. We recognize the potential for good that the film-making industry has. We know that movies and music have a profound influence on the culture of society, and feel responsible for using that influence for good, and helping others make correct choices in their lives.\n\nWe both live in Salt Lake City, Utah, and love it here. We started our own production company last October, and have since opened up our own comedy show, battle of the bands, and commercial production team. But both of our passions lie with film-making, so here we are.\n\nThe Plan\n\nWe're planning a 10-week shoot for the Summer of 2013 (assuming the world doesn't end this December ;)). The pre-production process will begin as soon as the funds are raised for the project. Pre-production will include contract drafting for the main actors, auditions and searching for extras and secondary roles, and procuring the necessary equipment, props, and costumes. Filming will begin in early May and complete in mid-July. Post-production will begin at that time and the scheduled completion for the film is mid-November, with an approximate release date set as December 6th, 2013.\n\nWhy the Budget\n\nWe may not be good at very many things, but penny-pinching is one of them. We are 100% confident that we can create a professional film for under $90,000. Here is a link to our budget outline if you wish to see where the money is going:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkQBjVk6zRyVdE4xVFRxazhZSE9kMmN0dE9TbkVmdHc\nWe're hoping that we will be able to exceed our funding goal and be able to make the film that much more enjoyable, so every donation counts.\nCan we do it?\nThe clip above says it all. The soundtrack was composed by Cameron Porter using his guitar and some free software, it was edited using imovie, it was filmed with a home-use hand-held camera, and the actors were friends of ours that were willing to do it without getting paid. If we can create that video under those circumstances, you can be confident that we will be able to make an amazing film with a proper budget.\n\n\nFAQ\n\nWhen Do I Get My Reward?\n\nThat depends on the nature of the reward. The rewards will be sent out as soon as they are available to do so. For example, a t-shirt or jacket will likely be sent out within a couple weeks after we raise the money, while a prop used in the film will have to wait until post-production to be sent out.\n\nHow Do I Pledge Money?\n\nJust click on the \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top right of the page. You'll first be asked how much money you'd like to pledge, and which reward package you would like. You'll then be asked to create a kickstarter account; this is totally free, and you never have to use it again if you don't want to. Afterwards you'll be asked to provide a method of payment. Then you're done!\n\nHow do I contact you?\n\nRight above the video on this page is a link that says \u201csend message\u201d.

For my stretch goal, 100% of anything I make after my initial goal will go to help other projects as a part of the Kicking it Forward initiative. Now - I have had an inspiration to tell you the real story of why I wrote Grin, but first:\n\nFirst \u2013 this book is done, but still not finished. What you may read in the first chapter has been written, rewritten and edited by myself and a few others. It still has a ways to go before I am satisfied though. My funding goal is for editing first and foremost and publishing second. Please know that what you are reading is akin to a sculptor carving out a marble block and showing you something that you may or may not recognize. I recognize it because I wrote it, just as an artist has the finished product in their mind.\n\nIt is true that I have always considered myself a writer. I wrote Grin because of an event I had in the 7th grade. I went to Silverado Middle School where I was in Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s English class. She had us do a timed write on what we wanted to be when we grew up. I was reading The Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway which changed the way I read books at the time. My answer consisted of \u201cI want to be an author and write classic stories like Hemingway.\u201d When I got the paper back, under my essay was Ms. Pettigrew\u2019s response - \u201cI know you will and I will read every one of them.\u201d\n\nIn all honesty, if that sounds fake to you then that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s very real to me and I actually tear up a bit to know that what I wrote I did because I had a dream, inspiration, calling if you will, when I was in a 7th grade English class. My goal of changing this is not to get more support, everything I do is to get support, I wrote this because I want people to know the dream I had and that even kids with dreams can make them happen.\nPlease feel free to keep reading to hear the rest of my story!\nUpdate: Chapter 2 is available to read. If you are backer check the update tab. Thank you!\nI have always considered myself a writer.  In my childhood, I loved fiction and fantasy and often touted to my teachers that I would grow up to be a great writer someday.  Three years ago I found myself without a job and wondering at age 30 what it was I wanted to do in life. Someone asked me that very question during a job interview. I answered honestly, \"I would sit down and write.\" I did not get that job, but what I got was a clear-calling. My roommate at the time encouraged me to go for it, pointing out that it was November (National Novel Writing Month).   As I began to work, I chose a story that had long since been in the recesses of my mind -- dying to be poured into tangible prose \u2013 and Grin was first birthed.  Initially, the words came to me effortlessly; however, it wasn\u2019t long until I found being at home was a huge distraction.  So, I found a local cafe that was quiet -- and for the next six months \u2013 anyone could find me at that caf\u00e9 from 9:00am to 5:00pm furiously typing on my laptop and researching Lewis Carroll. \nSecond Street Cafe\nFinishing the novel became my job, and my passion.  Each night when I went home, my wife and roommate would sit on the edge of the bed and wait patiently for a nightly reading of my work. I put on a pretty good show with my talented range of voices and tantalizing narrative composition. After six months,  I had over 100,000 words and a novel. Sadly most people think that is the hard part, but what I found was I was just beginning on my journey.\nI entered my work into a new writers contest and made the first cut in the Young Adult Fiction, to the next round only to be eliminated in the third.  After re-reading my novel, it was clear that I simply had too many errors. My roommate offered to proof read for me, and with some grammar help from my wife, she went to work.  Even still, the task was cumbersome, and as I began to take my second look at the novel, I realized I needed professional help, but without money or resources I was stuck like most writers.\nAfter two years of an almost completed manuscript sitting lifelessly on my desktop, I found Kickstarter! This website is offering me a way to help get the money I need to make this book (in fact, this trilogy) a reality. While I need only a few thousand to get going, I would love to see my funding skyrocket to free  me up to write the next two books.\nThe funds I raise will go towards self-publishing, editing, and generally making this as polished as it can be. I want the readers to see and hear my words and my work as well as feel that they are reading something true to the voice of Lewis Carroll.\nGrin - the first book in the trilogy takes place before Alice ventures down the rabbit hole. It delves into answers to many questions, such as:  How do the March Hare and Mad Hatter arrive at the tea party? Why are they mad? Where did all the talking animals come from? These and many more questions will be answered, but more mysteries are revealed to be resolved in the second and third book.\nMost stories focus on Alice as a hero, but in reality she was just a girl who came through the rabbit hole at the right time. The supporting cast you will find are the ones with the real roles to play. Please help me make this happen and get this in the hands of fans of the original books. Help me make Grin a classic!\nNOTE: I have released the first and second chapter in order to give anyone wishing to back me a taste of the first chapter and those that have a taste of the continued story. You may find chapter one here and chapter two in the backer section:\nhttp://pixel-trash.com/Grin-ubcc.pdf\nI will release the third chapters if my goal is reached so that anyone wishing to do so may preview the first three chapters of the story. Either way my backers will get to read this book as soon as I can get it in their hands!\nHelp others get funded as well!\nhttp://kickingitforward.org\nThanks to Wayne Williamson - a backer for making this quick trailer!

From the opera houses of old Europe to America's silver screen, they were the quintessential showbiz family. Now the last surviving member of the Grimaldis is dead and the auction house of Sutter and Son is liquidating their estate.\n\nAs our show begins, we meet Walter Sutter, a friendly and somewhat awkward young man who is the block clerk for the auction house and the son in Sutter and Son. The auction business bores Walter and he dreams of a life in show business, a dream discouraged by his rather gruff and overly practical father Hirum Sutter.\n\nWhen the ghosts of the Grimaldis start to haunt the auction house with their dazzling performances, Walter not only learns what it really means to be in show biz, but he also uncovers dark secrets about his own destiny.\n\nThe Grimaldis may be dead, but the show must go on.\n\nThe Show\nThe Grimaldis is a new story written by Dane Ballard and Ady Abbot and directed by Christian Utzman. The script celebrates the triumphs and tragedies of a life in show business from the eerie perspective of a family of performing ghosts.\n\nFeaturing original songs by John Woods, The Grimaldis is a mix of cabaret, circus, improv and musical theatre. The experience is immersive with the audience finding performances happening all around them. With the absence of the fourth wall, the characters interact directly with the guests, mingling with the audience throughout the show. Even the food and drink is presented as part of the story, a sort of \u201ctheatre amuse bouche\u201d to pull the audience further into the experience.\n\nThe Goal \nWe need $19,600 to cover the cost of a TWO WEEK Off-Off-Broadway run of \"The Grimaldis\" (Oct 19, 2012 to Nov 3, 2012). This sum includes theater rental; rehearsal space; the services of our creative team of artistic and musical directors, fourteen actors, and a four-person live band; costumes; props; lighting; sound; and set design. \n\nThe show will be recorded and we will use it to show the viability of the concept. The DVD of the debut run of \"The Grimaldis\" will be used to prove the concept - just like a TV pilot - and to allow us to market the show to investors.\n\nProject History \nThe Grimaldis is the brainchild of Dane Ballard, who has been workshopping this concept since 2008. Born into a performance family, Dane has been involved in show business his whole life. Inspired by the colorful personalities in his life both onstage and off, Dane wrote this original story to bring all his favorite types of performance into one place and to explore what it means to choose a life in \"Show Biz\".  \nDane wanted original music for this period piece that was as funny as it was poignant, so he joined forces with longtime friend and songwriter John Woods to craft the show's unique narrative and variety of songs.\n\nOver the years, the story continued to evolve. In 2011, Dane met writer/performer Ady Abbot. Together Dane and Ady have rewritten the script into its new, full-scale musical production.\n\n\nThe Creative Team\nThe Grimaldis has come to represent not just four years of development, but several lifetimes worth of experience in show business brought together into one amazing project. \nDane Ballard - Writer, Producer\nAdy Abbot - Writer\nJohn Woods - Original Music and lyrics\nChristian Utzman - Director\nRandy Johnson - Music Director\nRachel Golden - Stage Manager\nKirsten E Gerding - Choreographer\nCory Couch - Set Designer\nElizabeth Jo Miller - Production Asstant\nBrooke Fried - Production Assistant\nLiz Courts - Illustrator\nChris Manners - Video Production\nOur Cast \nThe show requires an incredible collection of performers with a stunningly diverse mix of skills and talents.

I am here to try to get any and all Classic Movie Fans involved in some way, anyway, that you can help. \n\nWe are operating currently with a micro-budget for props, costumes, make-up purchases, and food for those who are working on set/locations under a deferred contract.\nThis film is going to have three of the biggest movie monsters of the early years at Universal in it, Frankenstein, the Wolfman, and last, but not least, Dracula!\n\nI am happy to announce that we have Ron Chamberlain working on it as our set makeup and special effects monster maker for the film. Ron studied under Dick Smith (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Smith_(make-up_artist)).He has various credits on \"Shark Week\" and has been the resident make up creator at \"Monster Bash\" for 12 years creating various tradition classic monsters and has several independent films under his belt.\n\nRon is bringing all his skills and talent to this production by creating new classic monster looks! You should see the new Frankenstein design! Superb!\n\nWe also have a set builder/designer/painter/all around amazing artist by the name of Bruce Greig. Bruce Greig worked on other film sets like \"10,000 B.C.\", Peter Jackson's \"King Kong\", \"Lord of the Rings\" Trilogy, and has recently finished up some of the work for the first half of \"The Hobbit\" and will be going back home for a bit in September to finish the second half of \"The Hobbit\".\n\nBut while he's here in Binghamton, he has agreed as of the 28th of June, 2012, that he will work on the set/film with us until he has to go back to his \"real job\", LOL! He is such a cool and generous/gracious man, and we will miss him when he leaves again for home. (On a side note, anyone got about $1,700.00 for a round trip ticket I could use to visit him on the set of the Hobbit?)\n\nOur Producer is Joe DeMuro, and he will also be directing most of the action on set/location(s), and when he is in costume for the shots, I will co-direct.\n\nI will also be creating the music/soundtrack for the film, capturing sound on set/location, foley, ADR, and all editing of the footage (with serious help from Joe and Ron).\n\nWe do have our work cut out for us, but we have another problem.\n\nWe have two characters we have written into the film which we would love to see them played by Donnie Dunagan and Janet Ann Gallow. We would like Donnie to reprise his role as the older version of Peter von Frankenstein. Having him play the mad scientist and have him re-create a better more terrible version of the Frankenstein monster than ever before!\n\nWe would like Janet Ann Gallow to play a part in the film as the Sweet wife of an Innkeeper, and if she could bring her own grand daughter in to play a little girl who gets some help from the monster, it would be a great \"full circle\" moment!\n\nImagine having two of the original kids from the Frankenstein movies not only in another one, but TOGETHER!\n\nSo here's the problem, we haven't yet been able to make contact with Mrs. Gallow, but we are in contact with Donnie Dunagan, but his fees for his appearance would take away most of our budget.\n\nWe want to ask the whole world community of Classic Horror Film fans if you would be willing to donate even a single dollar to the cause, so we could bring Donnie, and perhaps Janet, up to New York for the film?\n\nIf we could find 10,000 rabid fans who want to see this film come to life as a dream come true for all those immediately involved, and those who are out there in the Classic Horror communities, to donate one single dollar, we could bring them both on for the project!\n\nIf we happened to find 50,000 who were willing to donate a single dollar, imagine how much better the production could be.\n\nWe will begin filming on August 25th, 2012. If we can pull this together, and pull this off, we believe we have a wonderful story to tell, and it would be completely awesome if we could get one, if not both of these talented people, involved.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.

It was, in a manner of speaking, love at first sight. Here was a pitch-perfect story ripped from the headlines, almost too good to be true, with very distinct high society characters clashing against the propriety of the Gilded Age. When all your creative faculties and resources go into telling a story, if not attendant to every detail, threads begin to show and everything starts to unravel in the mind of the audience. So telling Evelyn's story in a compelling and efficient way became essential to the success of Palace of Mirrors. Little did I know it was blueprint for something much, much bigger...\nKong Costume Construction - April - June 2012\nPerhaps we have all visited Skull Island at one point or another. It's the threshold, a \"distant, difficult, and dangerous\" place, as King Kong's creator Mirian C. Cooper liked to put it, that we inevitably cross that separates our comfort zone from the wonders and terrors of the Unknown, things beyond our wildest imagination. It was for this reason amongst others that the prospect of adapting King Kong for the puppet theatre was such an alluring and irresistible challenge. As I read more about Cooper and the classic 1933 film, the more the story of Kong grew closer to my heart. For me, Kong is a modern-day fairy tale for dangerous dreamers who only have to use their imaginations to visit the uncharted and untamed places of the earth.\nOriginal King Kong Promotional Artwork -", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Kong: The Journey Continues", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Peek", "update_content": "KING KONG will have its world premiere at the TADA Theatre (701 P St, 2nd floor, above Ivana Cone), Sunday, October 14th, at 7:30 P.M.
