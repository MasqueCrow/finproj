[{"backer": "Allen Chang", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "https://buttonshygames.com/products/death-valley\n\nSunlight glaring through the windshield. Your favorite songs blasting through the speakers. Candy bar wrappers piled next to a warm drink in the cheap plastic cupholder. Your companion riding in the passenger seat, snapping pictures of landmarks as you settle into the hypnotic rhythm of the road. But be careful: this fun road trip could get dangerous as you drive through Death Valley.\n\nDeath Valley is a pocket-sized, push-your-luck, tableau building game for 1-2 players, with each traveler striving to assemble the best mix of cards in their Journey and Scrapbook in order to win the game.\nDeath Valley is 18 cards, packaged in a portable and durable wallet.\n\nEach turn, players will choose whether to assign a card to their Journey, or move cards from their Journey to their Scrapbook. Cards feature stars (points), special abilities (affect the value and position of cards), and some interesting facts about Death Valley.\n\nEach card also has a hazard (Heat, Terrain, Flood or Animals) listed. Having 3 of the same Hazard visible in their tableau will cause the player to bust and lose all the progress in their Journey.\nAll 4 hazards and their card distribution within the game.\nAt the end of the game the player with the most stars in their Journey, plus any additional points from card abilities, is the winner.\nTo set up the game, shuffle all 18 cards and place 1 face-up between the players. On a player\u2019s turn they have 3 choices: add the face-up or face-down card from the top of the deck to their own Journey, or Rest. When a player Rests, they move at least one card from their Journey to their Scrapbook (stacking them into a single pile if they select multiple cards) and shuffle as many of their remaining Journey cards into the deck as they choose.\nAfter the player takes their action for the turn, they check for Hazards among the visible cards in their Journey and Scrapbook. If they have 3 of the same Hazard type showing (3 Flood cards, for example) the player busts: 1 of the Hazard cards is removed from the game and the rest of the player\u2019s Journey cards get shuffled back into the deck.\nOnce there is only one card remaining in the center area, the game ends. Each player counts up the stars showing in their Journey row. Visible cards in the Journey and Scrapbook might have abilities that adjust that score. Once all effects have been applied, the player with the highest star count is the winner.\nBackseat Driver Variant\nIf you want to really press your luck and give up a little control, try out the Backseat Driver Variant. In this variant players may choose to play the face-up card on their opponent\u2019s journey as well as their own. At the end of each turn you will check to see if either player busts.\nSolo Mode - Designed by Kevin Ellenburg and Mike Mullins\nThe game will come with rules for solo play. Here you will face an AI explorer that thinks through its action each turn similarly to a player (playing the more intense Backseat Driver Variant). This explorer never rests in its pursuit of adventure.\nIf you would like to try the game yourself, the mostly black and white preview PNP is available at PNP Arcade now!\nhttps://www.pnparcade.com/products/death-valley-kickstarter-preview\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Since 2018, we've just given it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting bonus content if you pledge here. The free expansion for this campaign is Death Valley: Panamint City.\nThis expansion consists of 6 more cards, letting you customize the deck before playing Death Valley. Before play, organize all the base game and expansion cards by hazard type. Then select 3 Animal, 4 Flood, 5 Terrain, and 6 Heat cards to shuffle into the deck. Unselected cards will not be used. Includes Vultures, Panamint City, Red Cathedral, Ubehebe Crater, Zabriskie Point, and Panamint Dunes.\nHere are the rewards available during this campaign.\n\nTo add more games to your order, you can do one of a few things:\nUS Backers only - to order games that ship now - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321us\" to get 15% off  of your order. Your website order will ship now, as long as you don't  order any pre-order items, otherwise the entire order will ship as  soon as everything comes in. As always, if you reach $25.00, you will  also receive free shipping. (NOTE: We previously offered a US Backer  code to combine games to save on shipping, but in most cases this was a  much better deal of free shipping AND 15% off.)\nInternational Backers only - go to our website http://www.buttonshygames.com and place an order using the coupon code \"0321international\" (REPEAT: THIS IS FOR BACKERS ONLY) to get free shipping on your extra game(s). Note: The limit on this  offer is 3 wallet games (and up to 3 expansions) total, including  anything that you order at Kickstarter. Anything above 3 wallet games  (and 3  expansions)  will end up bumping into the next shipping tier,  which can be as much as  $10 on international orders. These games will  all ship together with your Kickstarter rewards.\nThere are many notable games and we'll be featuring those throughout the campaign.\nWhile the game includes lots of great little historical facts about Death Valley, here's a little history about the game itself.\nDeath Valley was originally Kevin Ellenburg's entry to the 18 Card Challenge: Design A Game About A Real Life Location, and we\u2019re happy to see it coming to life. It has a unique take on the familiar push-your-luck mechanic where players have to think about managing their hazards as well as the card abilities, making each choice matter beyond the immediate threat of busting. On top of that, the gorgeous art from Fachri Maulana perfectly captures the lonely beauty of Death Valley National Park.\nFirst up is Kevin's initial pitch video in it's entirety (note some changes were made to the gameplay and cards throughout development):\nAnd here is the 18 Card Challenge video where it was a finalist, along with two other games that we eventually published, Skulls of Sedlec and Horreos. All 3 of which are available here. \n\n\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames,   promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts ... every   month! Supporters also receive from $1 to $10 off EVERY WALLET GAME  that  we make. (Members back our Kickstarter projects at the $1 pledge  level  above.)\nOur 2021 $5+ packages include an episode of The Final Lightyear.\nGather your crew and gear and launch into a  fringe section of space where the law teeters over the edge and a good  captain can earn a living. There's no shortage of threats that endanger  the goodfolk of deep space, but luckily your torpedo bay is full and  lasers are hot.\nIn Lightyear you'll play solo or cooperative with a friend, as the  captain of a so-called starship, in hopes of earning some rewards and a  decent rep. Using tactical maneuvering and dice-based action selection,  you'll work through the sector's small, medium and large enemies trying  to gain rewards and ultimately live to see another day. Customizable  episodes will challenge you with variable enemies and threats while  offering powerful new gear and talented crew to help you in your  adventures.\nOur $10 packages include all of the above and something   extra. Generally it's a tiny game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion  / promo cards for our existing games.\nAnd our $20 package includes all of the above and a copy of   the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice).   The featured wallet games also come with any expansion material that  is given away in the Kickstarter campaigns (like the Panamint City expansion  here).\nIf that sounds cool to you, check out the Board Game of the Month Club on Patreon!\nhttp://www.patreon.com/buttonshy\nThank you for checking out Death Valley!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our method of publishing and using multiple manufacturers, there's always a chance that one part of the game could come in with an error, leading to delays. We've been able to minimize these errors in recent years, but they can happen from time to time. We've also upped our pre-press staff internally to make sure we can hit intended deadlines.\n\nWith COVID-19 some of our suppliers have been delayed, so we've been allowing additional time in our estimations and setting up backup suppliers as well. Our local staff is working while socially distancing, so we are allowing additional time for a smaller staff to assemble and ship games. \n\nOur unfulfilled projects are moving along according to schedule. Ugly Gryphon Inn is shipping now, two months ahead of schedule. Our Agropolis Campaign is scheduled to be fulfilled in March and backers are up to date with the progress.

Each player picks an element and the Town is formed from the combination of those elements.\nDraft rules for Town creation (Click for larger version).\nThen, two maps of the Town are drawn: the Town Then and the Town Now. These represent the Town  during different time periods, as the characters remember them.\nEach player creates a character, choosing to either be one who Returned or Remained. Each character provides a different lens to explore the Town and their own relationship to change.\n Returned characters left the Town Then and have just recently returned to the Town. They are slightly more focused on their own concerns and how the Town's changes reflect on their own feelings and growth.\n Remained characters have stayed in Town throughout that time. They are slightly more focused on community concerns and how their actions and experiences are reflected in the Town's changes.\nDraft rules for character creation (Click for larger version).\nPlayers then use prompts to expand the Town and fill it with locations, residents, traditions and events. Players can then explore the connections between their characters to the Town and to each other and how that has changed over time.\nDraft rules for play actions (Click for larger version).\nAs players explore the Town and the relationships between the characters, you will update the maps of the Town Then and the Town Now as you go. \nYou also create and update a Relationship Map between the characters and the different aspects of the Town, as well as write down your asked and answered questions on the map as part of the River. At the end of every game, your map will become an artifact of the game you just played.\nExample Town maps from playtests (Click to learn more about the playtest games).\nYou can also pick up a  demo of the game on itch.io here and by clicking the banner below:\nLink to the demo available on itch.io.\n\nWhy do I want to make this?\nI made a first draft of An Altogether Different River in June 2020 as part of my Game a Month 2020 project. However, it had its start way earlier back in 2019. \nI originally conceived of An Altogether Different River as a part of Homebound, an anthology zine that I produced in 2019 with the help of Vee Hendro and Cecile Richard. Homebound was a significant personal project that collected games about home and going away made in the context of my move back to Malaysia after 14 years living in Melbourne, Australia. I gave copies away as a farewell gift to some friends, and also made a version of it available online on itch.io.\nHomebound anthology zine.\nI didn't end up including An Altogether Different River in the zine as I couldn't finish designing the game before I had to move, but I've always considered it as a sort of coda or successor to Homebound. If Homebound was about grappling with my feelings about moving away from a home I had made, An Altogether Different River is about grappling with my uncertainties of returning to a home that I know would be much changed.\nI thought I would be able to finish the game quickly and it would be a poetic first game to complete after moving back. Things don't always go the way you think they will.\nAnyway, it's almost done now. I've been doing a bunch of playtests in the lead up to this campaign and I am happy with how the game is coming along. I am proud to have this game be my first foray into crowdfunding, because I think it's a pretty good representation of what I want to and can make. I hope it might bring you some enjoyment too.\n\nWhat can you get?\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River.\nAll tiers will get you access to the draft rules as they stand right now so you can get playing straight away. \nThe Digital Zine tier (AUD8/about USD6.20) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io. \nThe Physical Zine tier (AUD15/about USD11.60) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nI have also included the option to get digital PDFs of the Homebound zine at a discounted price. As mentioned above, Homebound is a zine I made in 2019 that collects three games on the theme of \"home\" and \"going away\":\n How to Say Goodbye - A microgame about collectively visiting important places and people to say farewell to them and leave pieces of your heart behind.\n Ithaca in the Cards - A blackjack-driven GM-less/GM-lite storytelling game about doomed travelers on a perilous journey home.\n Far From Home - A belonging outside belonging game about immigrants exploring what it means to live and thrive in a culture that is not fully your own.\nHomebound games.\nThe Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD16/about USD12.40) will get you the final PDF delivered via itch.io, plus the PDF of Homebound.\nThe Physical and Digital Homebound Combo tier (AUD23/about USD17.80) will get you an A5 staple-bound black and white booklet, plus the PDF of Homebound. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nReward tiers for An Altogether Different River and Homebound.\nUPDATE:\nYou can now also get physical versions of both zines and just pay the same shipping!\nThe Physical Zines Homebound Combo tier (AUD30/about USD23.70) will get you both An Altogether Different River and Homebound as A5 staple-bound black and white booklets, plus PDF versions of both. Shipping is free within Malaysia, AUD7/USD5.40 for the United States and Australia, and AUD9/USD7 elsewhere.\nNew pledge tier to get physical copies of both An Altogether Different River and Homebound zines.\nWhat's left to do?\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to pay for additional illustrations to fill out the zine and also to finalize the layout for digital and print.  The rules are close to final, but I will continue playtesting and refining the game at least until the end of March (backers are very welcome to come join me in playtests). I am also planning to flesh out the introduction, safety and expectations, play advice and some game seeds to get players started quickly. The expected page count for the final zine is about 24-32 pages.\nIllustrations in progress.\nThe digital PDF version will be in full-colour and grayscale. The layout is already being drafted and additional illustrations are underway. I am aiming for release of the final digital version at the end of May 2021:\nFebruary - March 2021: Playtesting and revisions/writing, illustrations underway\nApril 2021: Complete editing and finalise fully illustrated layout\nMay 2021: Review final document for digital release + Contingency\nOnce the digital files are completed, the physical zine will be printed in black and white in A5 staple-bound format. I've allowed for significant time to finalise the document for print and for international shipping.\nMay 2021: Review final document for print + Send to print \nJune 2021: Printing and proofing, commence shipping\nJuly - September 2021: Allow 3 months for shipping + Contingency\nTimeline to produce Kickstarter rewards.\nWho's involved?\nAaron Lim is a designer of tabletop games currently based in Petaling Jaya, Malaysia, and previously in Melbourne, Australia. His work ranges from board and card games to story games and tabletop RPGs. Most of his work is self-published at ehronlime.itch.io.\n\nVenessa Tang is an illustrator and concept artist based in Malaysia., creating visual developments and storyboard illustrations.

I've tried to build in sufficient time and cost contingencies, but this is the factor that is hardest for me to control. Depending on the scale of the project, I've bookmarked several options that might help to alleviate some of that risk (partnering with other zine stores etc for distribution) but it really depends on the final breakdown of project backers.\n\nMost of the layout and artwork is already underway, so I don't foresee significant delays there. I am continuing to playtest and refine the game, which may result in changes down the line. However I don't foresee any issues hitting the digital version deadline though it may impact the delivery of the physical zines.

The six legendary guilds of Winterforge compete for the favour of the royal family, a favour that brings with it a contract of unrivaled value, the Royal Centenary Contract, guaranteed work for 100 years. Only one thing stands in your way... everyone else.\nThroughout the game, you will compete against your fellow players to earn Reputation Points for your guild. You gain these points by completing contracts, hiring a full crew, improving your skills and being debt-free at the end of the game. Be the first player to finish their Royal Contract and a nice bonus will come your way. The player with the most Reputation Points at the end wins!\nBack now to secure your copy of Smiths of Winterforge and forge your destiny!\n  You control one of the six legendary blacksmith guilds of Winterforge: The Forgehammer Clan, Gilmead's Jewellers, The Gilded Oak, The Redcloaks, The Battleforgers and Ironbrow's Master Arms. Each guild comes with its own starting skills that you will increase over the course of the game by completing contracts and an agent meeple, that you move around the city of Winterforge.\nOn each turn, you may perform three actions. With these actions, you may move your agent to a connected precinct or perform a precinct action. Each Precinct has its own distinct actions that can only be performed when your agent is in that space.\nWhile your agent is in the Guildhall precinct, you may: \nAcquire more contracts for your guild\nif you have less than three coin, request funds from the guildhall\nWhile your agent is in the Bank precinct, you may: \nTake a loan for your guild\nPay back a loan that you already have\nWhile in the Tavern precinct, you may:\nhire a crewmember to improve or modify your guild\u2019s abilities\nWhile in the Market precinct, you may: \nPurchase components to add to your stockpile\nInitiate a trade with another player in the game\nAnd, while in the Forge precinct, you may:\nTrain a contract type skill on your guild board\nForge a contract \nTo forge a contract, attach components from your stockpile and roll the dice your components give you, adding any bonuses from your contract and your skills. If your forge action succeeds, you will be paid the coin value for the contract, and your guild\u2019s skill in the contract type will go up by one. This contract will then provide Reputation Points at the end of the game.\nThe game's ending is triggered when a player completes their royal contract, or when there are no more contracts in the contract deck. The game will end at the conclusion of the current round so that all players have taken the same number of turns. Players will then calculate their final score by adding together the Reputation Points earned from their completed contracts, plus adding any bonuses from having a full crew, completing a royal contract and upgrading guild skills, and applying any penalties from outstanding loans. The player with the most Reputation Points wins.\nTo see a great run through of gameplay, check out the video by the guys at BoardGamingAtHome.\n   What's in the box?\n\nGame Art \n   All art for Smiths of Winterforge has been created by the amazing Jamie Noble-Frier from the United Kingdom.

You search the little kitchen for cinnamon, avoiding the frantic activity of the other bakers. Your tips jingle in your pocket, and you smile, proud to work in the busiest little Doughnut Drive-Thru on the interstate!\n  Grail Games is pleased to present our planned 7th title in our famous Mike Line of small card games: Doughnut Drive-Thru!\nDD-T is a game about making doughnuts (and other sweet treats.) It utilises an interesting worker placement/action selection mechanism, that uses mini wooden doughnuts! The game takes less than half an hour to play and is great fun for 2-4 players.\nThe game was originally released in Japan as Let's Make Bread!! and is designed by Ikaga-ya. Grail Games, with the help of board game illustrator/graphic designer extraordinaire Heiko G\u00fcnther (Glory to Rome, Circus Flohcati, The Networks), have refreshed the design, and are looking for your support to produce this sweet game!\n  \u27bc Check out this video featuring Steve from Cardboard Insanity, in which he discusses and reviews the hole business:\n  In summary...\n1) Players begin the game with one of the starting doughnut cards. These treats must be Prepared and then Served. Doing so will earn you tips - most tips wins the game!\n2) On a player's turn, they must either place doughnut pieces on an action card (thereby taking an action), or take doughnuts back off an action card. Usually, using two doughnut pieces to take an action will give players a bonus! Keep in mind that placing doughnuts can block other players from using action spaces :)\n3) Once a recipe card has been Prepared and Served, it gives the baker Recognition! Flip the card over to show this.\n4) Now, completed recipes can add to your abilities by increasing the results of your die rolls (required to Prepare and Serve.)\n5) It's a race - once a player has Served 5 recipe cards, the game will end. Then, whoever has the highest amount of tips on their Served cards will win! The game also comes with a Baker card for each player which gives a special ability to you for the entire game.\n    Each copy of Doughnut Drive-Thru includes the following ingredients...\n ...and a rules booklet, all contained within a sturdy, two-piece box (110x110x50mm).\nAll cards will be 63x88mm in size.\nThe doughnut peices will be wooden and 15x15x6mm\nThe die will be 14mm\nShould we reach our stretch goal targets, the game will look and feel even better...!\nJoin us on our funding journey and with your support we can make this groovy little game even better!\n Woot! Thank you for your support - let's make some doughnuts!!\nOur priority is always to produce games that look and feel great. Increasing the quality of the card stock used to 310gsm Ivorycore will be sweet!\nIn DD-T, rolling a \"1\" is always a fail :( Changing the single pip on the die to a circle, or doughnut, will help you never forget. (Sample art TBC.)\nLinen finish cards, anyone? An expensive but exquisite touch to make the game pop on your table!\nHaving little wooden doughnut pieces in the game is already pretty cool, but reaching this stretch goal will allow us to decorate the doughnuts with some tiny, silk-screened sprinkles :D (Sample art TBC.)\nWe are pleased to offer the following three add-ons during this campaign...\nTo add these items to your pledge, you must manually increase your pledge by the amounts listed below. To do this, select your pledge level and add to the amount when asked, or click \"Manage your pledge\" to change it at a later date.\n1) ALL BACKERS may add extra copies of Doughnut Drive-Thru to any pledge level above TIP JAR. To do so, add $18AUD per extra copy to your pledge\n2) AMERICAN AND CANADIAN BACKERS may add a copy of our newest title, Jeju Island, to their pledge (any backer level) for $40AUD (sent to you in November.) Please note that this is approximately MSRP, but DOES include shipping costs!\n3) AUSTRALIAN & NEW ZEALAND BACKERS may add a copy of our civ-building card game, Guns & Steel, to their pledge (any backer level) for $25AUD (sent to you in November.) Add this on to the STEEL SWEETS pledge level to receive both G&S games!\nWell... yes and no. Worldwide shipping is certainly not free, however, we are happy to swallow this cost if it will mean getting this great little game into your hands! Your pledge includes shipment to you, no matter where you live. Unfortunately, in order to keep shipping costs low, we are not able to include lots of promo items, etc., with our Kickstarter campaigns.\nBackers who pledge at backer levels that include copies of our other titles will receive these sometime in November. DD-T is due to be sent to you in April, 2017.\nYes! Doughnut Drive-Thru will be sent to EU backers from within the EU! (UK backers should note that Circus Flohcati will NOT be sent to you from within the EU.)\nBy supporting Doughnut Drive-Thru on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game in the first place, but you are ensuring that:\nYou will receive your copy of DD-T at or below retail cost, considering worldwide shipping is included!\nYou will receive your copy of DD-T at least a few weeks prior to the game being made available at online and bricks & mortar game stores.\nYour support will make the game better! More stretch goals means more components and a better quality.\nNote: Grail Games runs \"no-frills\" Kickstarter campaigns without promotional extras that increase costs and time-frames. We intend to get a high-quality product to your door as quickly as possible. All our campaigns thus far have delivered on time or earlier.\nThank you for your tremendous support!\nHeiko did such a tremendous job giving our previous title Circus Flohcati a refreshing new look, so we just had to ask him back for more! We are so pleased with how DD-T has turned out and are more than happy to show you some of the cards from the game below! More art sneak peaks coming soon :)\nHeiko has ensured each card is eye-catching as well as functional and clear.\n  Each doughnut has its own personality and awesome name :D\n  Don't do doughnuts?

Coupling that with its approachable ruleset, Mint Works is a great tool for introducing new players to the genre of worker placement.\nCheck out the Mint Works rules to see more detail about what makes Mint Works tick.\nAll Cards contained within a copy of Mint Works are printed upon 300GSM blue core card stock. Tokens are made from 4mm thick wood. All printed components will have a linen finish.\nRahdo Runs Through\nRahdo and James Hudson's Final Thoughts\nEduardo Baraf Video Preview\nBoard Game Geek Comments\n\"A twenty minute Euro is hard to make, and even harder to make fun. This game delivers all that and more in a nifty little package.\"\n- MHGreenleaf\n\"Amazing little worker placement game. I've play-tested this multiple times and am anxiously awaiting the Kickstarter\"\n- nlwelch\nYou can download the rules here\nDuring the game each player will have a limited number of Mint Tokens, which represent their workers.\nPlayers will use these mint tokens to earn more tokens, take first player or buy and build plans.\nPlans are how players earn points. Some plans will only give points, others will give extra powers to the owner.\nOnce a player has at least 7 points, play continues until the end of the the round, at which point the game ends.\nWhoever has the most points provided by plans they have built wins! \nFive24 Labs on Social Media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nNewsletter\nMint Works was created in response to the 2015 Mint Tin Design Contest created by R4D6 on BGG. The list of constraints for the competition were as follows:\nThe game must fit within a mint tin.\nThat was it! Such a simple constraint, but it gave me the push I needed to come up with a fun idea.\nBecause a mint tin is so easily portable, and designed to be rugged enough to fit in a pocket, I considered making a game that would be good on the go. (Initial versions of the game actually used the mints that came in a tin as the tokens. This stopped shortly after my children ate them.)\nI thought, what would be a good game to carry around in your pocket that isn't typical for that form factor. Worker Placement would be neat, I thought and so I ran with it. The rules turned out to be fairly simple and so I realized I had a super portable gateway worker placement game.\nMint Works will be something you can carry with you on a day to day basis and use it to introduce new people into our amazing hobby of strategic gaming.\nThat wasn't enough though, the game shouldn't be boring after a few plays. I wanted something that would be re-playable. Something that, once you got the initial concepts down, you could start to really dig in with other players.\nReports from testers over the months have come in saying that they enjoy playing, and will sit down 1 v 1 and play several games in a row and discuss theories about optimum turn sequences, what plans are best picked up at which parts of the game or when the lotto might show up.\nThis blew my mind! I had managed to do it, make an easy to learn fun to continue to play type of game.\nThe wall of contributors is my way of giving people some recognition regardless of the amount of contribution they have provided. It's small currently, but as I continue to do more and more campaigns I hope it can grow large enough that I'll have to re-consider how it works.\nIf you are excited enough for Mint Works that you just can't wait for the fully produced copies to get here from the factory, I have provided a limited pledge level.\nThis level will entitle you to a copy of the fully factory produced version of Mint Works as all other backers, but it will also include a hand made advanced copy delivered shortly after the campaign ends.\nThe advanced copies will be entirely hand made by me in my workshop and numbered. (e.g. 03/50.)\nThe advance copies will be of similar quality to the prototypes that you  see in the review videos. See below for examples.\nBecause Mint Works is a small game in terms of physical size and weight, shipping costs are very reasonable. The manufacturing costs are low enough that VAT shouldn't be a concern.\nI wish that I could provide free shipping to the majority of places, however the low price point of the game means I have very little wiggle room for costs. That said, I will be providing free shipping within the US, and applying a discount to shipping elsewhere equal to the cost of shipping within the US.\nHere is a brief chart explaining the shipping costs:\n* The vast majority of countries falls in this region, including: Argentina (AR), Australia (AU), Austria (AT), Bahrain (BH), Belarus (BY), Belgium (BE), Belize (BZ), Bulgaria (BG), Brunei Darussalam (BN), Canada (CA), Cayman Islands (KY), Chile (CL), China (CN), Colombia (CO), Costa Rica (CR), Croatia (HR), Cyprus (CY), Czech Republic (CZ), Denmark (DK), Estonia (EE), Finland (FI), France (FR), Germany (DE), Greece (GR), Hong Kong (HK), Hungary (HU), Iceland (IS), India (IN), Indonesia (ID), Ireland (IE), Israel (IL), Italy (IT), Japan (JP), Korea, Republic of (KR), Latvia (LV), Lithuania (LT), Luxembourg (LU), Malaysia (MY), Malta (MT), Montenegro (ME), Netherlands (NL), New Zealand (NZ), Norway (NO), Peru (PE), Philippines (PH), Poland (PL), Portugal (PT), Qatar (QA), Romania (RO), Saudi Arabia (SA), Serbia (RS), Singapore (SG), Slovakia (SK), Slovenia (SI), South Africa (ZA), Spain (ES), Sweden (SE), Switzerland (CH), Taiwan (TW), Thailand (TH), Turkey (TR), Ukraine (UA), United Arab Emirates (AE), United Kingdom (GB)\n** Brazil, Mexico, Russia and any countries not previously listed fall into this category.\nI would like to support retailers who are interested in getting Mint Works before the game makes its way into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please send me a message here on Kickstarter, or email retail@five24labs.com during the campaign for pricing information. \nCurrently we are a small but potent team that consists of myself, my buddy Mel and my awesome testing group. I'd like to use this space to acknowledge and thank them.\nI have an amazing, excellent and dedicated group of players that tolerate my crazy ideas and endless iterations. They are up to the task of attempting to break things, and giving real feedback as we develop projects.\n I can't possibly thank them enough for all the work they do for the wages of snacks and fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis campaign is only my second campaign, and my first (Area 1851) didn't fund initially. This was the result of some poor choices I had made during setting up and ramping up into the campaign, that in turn resulted in its funding failure.\n\nFortunately enough, Game Salute was able to bring it back a while later and that project successfully funded and is in stores now. This has provided me with a little more insight into what goes on beyond the campaign.\n\nThis means that a lot of what will be going on post funding will be new to me. So I'll be doing a bit of learning on the job as this project progresses. That said, I'm always open to hearing advice and willing to take reasonable suggestions into consideration.\n\nSince my previous campaign, I've also backed a lot more projects, and I've seen a lot of good examples of what to do, and what not to do. I'm going to be taking all of those lessons to heart.\n\nAnother thing going for me with Mint Works is the size of the project. This will greatly reduce the risk of the entire endeavor.\n\nThe biggest risk I foresee at the moment is coordinating the production of the mint tins and the game. This is because the manufacturers I've talked with either can't get tins in the right size, or the cost of the ones they offer in the right size is far too high.\n\nThis means I have to have the tins produced in a second factory, then sent to the game manufacturer, where they will affix labels to the tins and pack them with the game components.\n\nHaving the tins meet the game components and getting all of that packaged up in a timely manner will be the toughest part I suspect.\n\nHowever, I'm committed to full transparency of the project and will do my best to ensure things go according to plan.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Contributor", "descp": "Option to have your name (or pseudonym) posted with a message up to 140 characters in length on our \"Wall of Contributors.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["5,346 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["723 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "The Triple", "descp": "Three (3) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["128 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["56 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Standard Supporter", "descp": "One (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "247 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Double Down", "descp": "Two (2) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "26 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Eager Enthusiast", "descp": "One (1) limited edition hand made and numbered advance copy of Mint Works to be delivered by October 31st 2016.\nOne (1) copy of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\nMint Works\nHand-Made Numbered Mint Works Advanced Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "50 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Gift Giver", "descp": "Five (5) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n5\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "25 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Glorious Gamer", "descp": "Ten (10) copies of Mint Works with standard components, plus all stretch goals, and the \"Contributor\" reward.\nINCLUDES:\n10\u00d7 Mint Works", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "4 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Mint Delivery - Coming to Kickstarter August 29th", "update_content": "Hey there!

Experience the rise & fall of nations in just an hour's time!\nGuns & Steel: Renaissance is designed by Jesse Li (designer of Guns & Steel and Ponzi Scheme.) All backers will receive a signed, deluxe postcard from the designer in every copy!\n  Fans of the original Guns & Steel will want to know: What's different about Renaissance? Here's a run-down on what Renaissance brings...\nA completely new set of cards, with all-new art, that can be played alone, or combined with the base game.\nA new way to win: Culture!\nA new way to claim Wonders: Glory!\nPlease read the Renaissance rule book (link below) for full details on how Culture and Glory works. In short: Culture increases tension in the game, as a new way to win is now in play; and, in order to claim some Wonders, players must place Glory cubes on them. But you can only place one cube per turn, and only if you qualify to do so. Will you get to build the Wonder before your opponents...?\n     The box\n  All that's inside the box (Japanese edition shown)\n  The cards... will be made with Japanese 310gsm card stock (as used by premium TCGs in Japan), and finished with a German, casino-grade coating for slick handling. The images are printed using a 250LPI offset printing resolution - higher than your average cards (175LPI).\nAll backers will also receive a deluxe (2mm thick) postcard, signed from by designer, in their copy of Renaissance (art TBC)!\nSome of the new cards seen in Renaissance!\n  One of the new Wonders - The Lighthouse of Alexandria!\nSTAY TUNED! More artwork to be revealed during the campaign!\nTo explore the contents and artwork of the original Guns & Steel, please visit our previous Kickstarter campaign, or visit G&S on BoardGameGeek.\n  Simply add $10AUD to your pledge to receive the following extra box with your shipment of Renaissance!\nHolds both games in one place!\nThe box \"sleeve\" is made from the same thick card as the game boxes and will neatly hold both editions of Guns & Steel together.\nPlease note that the reverse will sport the cover art of the original game, and the box will open from the top, not from the bottom as pictured.\n  Guns & Steel has already been played, enjoyed and reviewed. (Please note, these reviews were filmed with the original version of the game)...\n>> Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower:\n\"A very solid design - very intriguing. Dice Tower Judgement: Approved!\" - Tom Vasel \n>> Board Game Brawl:\n\"I love it when you can use a card for multiple things, and I know other games have done the same thing... but I gotta tell you: it seemed so cool to me... and even if other games have done it, I'm not sure they have done it with as much style as Guns & Steel does. ...The game itself is really, really solid and fun.\" - Nick Meenachan\n  Guns & Steel: Renaissance is a hand-building game. Each player starts with an identical hand of cards which can be played face-down (as a resource) or face-up (as a development) to perform an action. Extra cards can be \u201cbought\u201d from a display, which are then added to your tableau. Players will progress through the different ages of human history, inventing technologies, building wonders and warring with the neighbouring civilisations.\nEvery turn consists of:\n1) Resource Phase: You must play a card face-down as a resource card.\n2) Development Phase: You must play a card face-up as a development card. You may activate the special action this development gives you.\n3) Purchase Phase: You may buy one card from supply.\n4) End of Turn Phase: \u2013 If you have 0 or 1 cards in hand: Check if you can gain a wonder and retrieve cards to hand. \u2013 If you have 2 or more cards in hand: Do nothing. The cards played this turn remain in your tableau. \u2013 NEW! Glory Step: Check if you have satisfied the requirements of any Wonder cards. If you do, you may place a Glory token on one of them.\nThe game ends...\nOnce all the wonders have been built, Or, once every Space age card has been bought,\nOr, NEW! If a player has 15 or more Culture points.\nThen, the player with the most Victory Points has built the most successful civilisation and wins the game!\n     Grail Games has previously partnered with Moaideas to bring the fabulous Guns & Steel to a wider audience. We are running this Kickstarter campaign to fund the printing and shipment of an all-new English version of the stand-alone expansion - Guns & Steel: Renaissance!\n By supporting our campaign:\nYou will secure yourself a copy! (The game will not necessarily be widely available after this campaign, depending on demand.)\nYou will save money! (RRP will be $30, and we are offering free shipping to get KS backers a better deal.)\nYou will get the game quickly! (Games are being printed and assembled in Taiwan right now! Your pledge will stamp our logo on the box cover and secure it for your game table.)\nYou are helping to bring the game to a wider audience! (We can't afford to bring the games into Australia, etc., without your help - thank you!)\nYou will notice that only 140 copies are available via this Kickstarter campaign for those living outside of Oceania and SE Asia (plus those copies pledged for to be picked up at Essen in October.) This is because this is a campaign to fund the Grail Games edition of G&S:R.\nGrail Games only has the Guns & Steel publishing and sales rights for Oceania and SE Asia. Moaideas and their (soon-to-be-announced) worldwide publishing partners have given us permission to provide a small number of copies for fans of the game. We are grateful for their support. If you miss out, please stay tuned. The game(s) will be made widely available in other territories in the future.\n* The Moaideas/Grail version is a one time limited edition small print run, and it will be licensed to larger publishers for distribution in other regions in the future. Backers should be aware of the possible price difference and incompatibilities of the different editions in each region before pledging. If you want to ensure G&S:R matches your copy of G&S, this is the time to pledge.\nAll G&S:R backers have been offered the opportunity to pre-order Grail Game's upcoming Jeju Island at a massive discount! Please click here: https://grail-games.com/pre-order-jeju and read Campaign Update #3 for more details!\n    All pledge levels include all shipping costs! Please check this map to see which pledge level is for you:\nThose living in the orange area may pledge at the SOUTHERN RENAISSANCE or COMPLETE STEEL levels. Everyone else should back at the WORLDWIDE RENAISSANCE or WORLDWIDE COMPLETE STEEL levels, except those wishing to pick the game up at the Spiel fair in Essen (marked in green).\n* Worldwide copies of the game will ship from Taiwan.\n  We expect Guns & Steel to complete production and shipment to backers by the end of September, 2016. Thus far, Grail Games has, and is, on track to deliver all its past Kickstarter rewards early and we are confident we can deliver on time once again. We have production and fulfillment companies ready to make and deliver your game to your door!\nPlease note: because we will wish to ship your games soon after the completion of this campaign, backers will need to complete a backer survey within a day or two after the end of this campaign.\nPlease also note: Aus, NZ & SE Asian backers will be receiving copies of Guns & Steel in separate packages to Renaissance.\n  For those able to make the Spiel Fair in Essen this year, pick-up is available by pledging your support at the appropriate level. You will be sent an update detailing all relevant information closer to the event, but know that your game(s) will be available to collect at the Moaideas Game Design booth.\nPlease note: If you miss the fail for any reason, you will be asked to pay extra shipping costs in order to get your game(s) to you.\nThis \"pre-order\" could be the only way to secure a copy of the Moaideas version of G&S: R at this year's Essen as the European publishing rights are about to pass to another publishing partner.\n  Follow Grail Games on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.\nVisit the Grail Games and Moaideas Game Design website.\nVisit Guns & Steel: Renaissance on the web for videos, forums, photos and more!\n  Grail Games is a card and board game publishing studio located in Sydney, Australia. Founded two years ago, we have already run six successful Kickstarter campaigns, all of which delivered games to backers at least early. We have published seven games in total, with the much touted reprint of Reiner Knizia's Medici on the way!\n Grail Games\u2019 aim is to produce board and card games that are:\nFamily-friendly: We believe that games can strengthen friendships and families. All of our games can be enjoyed by players of a variety of ages.\nFast to teach: our games have clean, straight-forward rules sets to decrease the number of barriers to entry.\nDeep and replayable: Games blossom when they offer a variety of pathways to explore. All our games have a high Depth>Box Size ratio.\n THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGrail Games has already produced six games, all currently available in game stores around the world. Since our first Kickstarter campaign was received EARLY by backers in January 2015, we have continued to send high quality products to backers on time! We have our systems well in place and use top manufacturers to produce and ship quality games around the world. Grail Games is beginning to forge a track record of delivering fun games with quality components\u2026 on time!\n\nHowever, unforseen circumstances can hold up a project. This can happen at the point of manufacture or during shipment. Grail Games has given a time-frame for delivery of G&S:R that we believe is certainly achievable. If anything does affect the project, backers will be kept in the loop via regular backer updates at every step of the production and shipment process.\n\nNote that the currency conversions in the pledge level blurbs are a guide only. Currency values may fluctuate during the campaign.\n\nAlso note: Pledge levels do include all shipping costs, and backers will receive their games before retail stores, but Grail Games cannot guarantee that retailers will not sell G&S:R at a cheaper price than Kickstarter supporters will \u201cpay.\u201d\n\nFinally, Grail Games will happily send replacement copies of any game damaged in shipment to backers, etc., but if backers fail to inform Grail Games of a change in shipping address or similar, backers may be asked to pay extra costs for a replacement copy of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "SOUTHERN RENAISSANCE", "descp": "One copy of Guns & Steel: Renaissance delivered to your address in Australia, NZ or SE Asia.\nSHIPPING INCLUDED!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2016"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["108 backers", "Limited (267 left of 375)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 34 or more", "title": "ESSEN RENAISSANCE", "descp": "One copy of Guns & Steel: Renaissance pre-ordered and set aside for you to pick up at the Moaideas Booth at the 2016 Essen Spiel, Germany.\n($34AUD is approx $25US and \u20ac22.70)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2016"}], "stat": ["32 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 35 or more", "title": "WORLDWIDE RENAISSANCE", "descp": "One copy of Guns & Steel: Renaissance delivered to your address.

That's it! Cards can be played as treasure or as an action, with each item of treasure having a different ability. The first player to reach 21 doubloons is the winner!\nPlay and steal treasure, and add crew to guard your ship or sneak onto another player's to steal theirs! The game comes with four Jokers - unique cards based on famous historical or fictional pirates. Long John Silver tricks your opponents into swapping hands with you, Anne Bonny lets you draw more cards than anyone else, Henry Morgan lets you see what's coming up next, and Madame Ching allows you to use the ability of any treasure card in play!\nEveryone who gets the game through Kickstarter will also be sent six promo cards, including a new joker, Blue Beard the Pirate, who can give you a whole bunch of cards at once, and a new treasure, Jellybeans!

If you rely too heavily on crew, a single Kraken attack can take you out...but if you don't have any, then your treasure is up for grabs!\nBlack Jack has been cursed to forever crave gold...but whenever he gains too much, his entire fortune disappears! This expansion adds even more diabolical ways you can amass wealth, including a new treasure of each value, three new crew members you can recruit, a Pirate Ghost, and Black Jack himself!\nScuttle! is a complete game in itself, but the expansion adds a whole new way to play the game - as an action, you can flip the top card of the deck. If it's treasure, add it to your stash! If it's not, discard it! But if your new bounty takes you above 21 treasure, you lose it all...\nThe Curse of Black Jack expansion adds the fourth suit to the game, which means (when combined with Scuttle!) the game can be used as a standard deck of playing cards. \nScuttle! is the first game from Jellybean Games, and if you support us on kickstarter we'll send you Blue Beard the Pirate - an exclusive card which won't be available in retail copies.\nAs well as that, a number of other exclusive promos have been unlocked - more details in the Stretch Goals section, below.\nScuttle! is quick to set up, quick to pick up, and plays in under 10 minutes.\nScuttle! rules.\nThanks to the support of our backers, we've added a bunch of cool stuff to the game: more cards, more ways to play, more pirates - and more exclusives: cards which won't be available in the retail version of the game!\nScuttle! will also come with gold foil on the box, thanks to our backer stretch goal!\n$4k - UNLOCKED!

Starting a company is expensive, and so I've already put a lot of my own time and money into getting Scuttle! ready to bring to the world.\nDue to the success of the campaign, I've been able to get copies of the game into retail stores, and Jellybean Games is going to have a really solid foundation for future projects!\nThis project has been a collaboration between Peter C. Hayward and Kelly Jo for Jellybean Games.\nScuttle! is the first project from Jellybean Games. The company was formed to bring you awesome experiences for gamer kids (and their parents) which can also be enjoyed by the wider gaming community.\nOur aim is to make games for kids that grown-ups will love.\nThis is just the first of the light, gorgeous, and thematic games that we're planning on bringing you for years to come! All the money we raise will go towards making Scuttle! even better, and furthering development on all our future games.\nPeter C. Hayward is the founder of Jellybean Games and Blue Beard Entertainment, and has been playing card games (including Cuttle, the inspiration for this game) since he was a kid (pictured)!\nHe's a full-time author and game designer, and has been involved in the development of Sentinel Tactics, Story War, Traitor Mechanic: The Traitor Mechanic Game and many more upcoming games.\nKelly Jo is is a creative strategist, experience designer and illustrator. You can find her aggressively cute illustrations on idleafternoon.com\nIf you like the game, please support us (every dollar helps!) and tell your friends...especially if they have kids, know kids, love kids, or love great games and gorgeous art!

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to be working with designers Jake Tlapek and David Fulton and their unique game - Grifters.  Jake and Dave were demoing this game at GenCon last year, and everyone was really enjoying the new \"hand-building\" mechanics. \nA great game, that plays quickly, has real player interaction and features a truly unique & innovative mechanic?  This was a perfect game for Indie Boards and Cards.  I am very glad that Jake & Dave agreed and we are now able to offer this game for your support via kickstarter.\nGrifters is a hand-building game that has all the fun of deck-building games, without the deck. Players take on the role of powerful crime bosses, building their criminal organizations by carefully recruiting new operatives with specialized skills and directing their team\u2019s nefarious deeds. All of your specialists are either in play or in your hand, ready to be used as you command. This unique hand-building mechanic gives you total control of your strategy.\nGrifters is all about stealing as much money as you can - from the corrupt government, malicious corporations and your rival players. Each player starts the game with a hand of 6 Specialist cards, each with unique abilities. Your objective is to use this team of 6 Specialists to recruit more criminals, complete jobs, steal from the government coffers and swindle your opponents.\nEach specialist has a special ability and skill.  On your turn you can play a single specialist to perform their ability, or you can play a team of specialists to use their combined skills to complete a job.   This means every specialist is a valuable asset to your criminal enterprise - earning immediate benefit through abilities and valuable end-game bonuses by completing jobs against the same target. And because all the cards in your deck are always available, you decide how to maximize your play.\nGrifters uses a unique card \"cooldown\" system to control the use of your cards. On your turn, you play one or more specialist cards into the first \"Night\" of your hideout. If you already have a specialist card, or a team of specialist cards, in night one those cards advance to night two and push other cards through your hideout.\nWhen a card is pushed out of the third night of your hideout it enters the refresh area. Any cards in your refresh area will return to your hand at the end of your turn.\nThe game ends when the coffers run out of money, there are no more jobs left to complete, or if there are no more specialists cards left for recruiting. End game bonuses are calculated for completing multiple jobs against the same target.  The winner is the player with the most money.\nCLICK HERE TO READ THE COMPLETE RULES\nGrifters comes with everything you need to play - this is a completely stand alone game and does not directly interact with the other great games set in the Dystopian Universe.  The box is the same size as The Resistance, Avalon & One Night Revolution and includes:\n12 Ringleader Specialists cards\n48 Specialist cards\n20 Job cards\n75 Mega ISK tokens\n4 Player tableaus\nRule book\nAs a special reward for our early adopters, all the games sent as rewards to backers of this project will include promo items that won't be included in the retail release of the game.\nUpgraded player tableaus\nEach copy of Grifters backed on this project will feature upgraded player tableaus.  A thick chipboard tableau with linen finish will replace the cardstock tableaus found in the base game.  This is a nice extra touch to show everyone that you supported this great new game from the beginning.\nNew \"Ringleader\" cards\n\nEvery copy of Grifters received as a reward for backing this kickstarter will include a set of Informant cards.  Informants are a new ringleader (every player starts with one of each of the ringleaders) that add an element of bluff and deception to the game. \nWith Informants in play, you can play any card face down and take the Informant action.  Any other player may challenge the Informant. When challenged, the active player reveals the card that was played. If that card is the Informant, the challenger must give the active player 2M ISK. If that card is not the Informant, no payments are due from any player to the active player, the challenger steals 2M ISK from the active player and gets to take the action on the card that was played.\nInformants are a really fun addition to the game and totally fitting with the Dystopian Universe.\nYou are Awesome - Bonus #1: The Security Specialist promo\nYou are Awesome - Bonus #2: Crooked Warden promo\nYou are Awesome - Bonus #3: Veteran promo\nYou are Awesome - Bonus #4: Underboss promo\nYou are Awesome - Bonus #5: Negotiator promo\nEvery copy of Grifters received as a reward for backing this kickstarter will include a set of these promo specialist cards.\nWe want to give you more promo items that will make backing this project even more special!\nIf you participated in some of our more recent projects, you will be familiar with our \"You are Awesome Rewards\" and why we are changing away from more standard \"stretch goals\" linked directly to $ targets, to a system that truly rewards you for helping to promote our project. \"Liking\" the project on facebook or via kicktraq, giving us thumbs up on BGG, posting comments and articles on your blogs or in other gaming websites are all great ways to help this project get more visibility - and show that you are investing more into this game than a simple financial transaction.\nThe more that you are awesome, the more promos that I will add to the rewards!  And remember, promos are special and will not be included in the retail version of the game!\nAchieved! You are Awesome - Bonus #1: The Security Specialist promo\nAchieved! You are Awesome - Bonus #2: The Crooked Warden promo\nAchieved! You are Awesome - Bonus #3: The Veteran promo\nAchieved! You are Awesome - Bonus #4: The Underboss promo\nAchieved! You are Awesome - Bonus #3: The Negotiator promo\nAudacious Stretch\nWhen Jake & Dave launched their kickstarter project for You Dirty Rat (now know as Grifters), they had a popular $25 option to have the four player tableaus printed on mouse pad materials. We'd like to upgrade the already upgraded player tableaus included in this kickstarter, for everyone at no additional cost. But to do that we need to meet the manufacturer's minimum order quantity of 3,000 units.\nSo our super stretch goal - if this project gets pledges for 3000 (or more) copies then everyone will get these upgraded player tableaus included in their rewards package.\nThree reasons really. Firstly, I am very optimistic about Grifters and the unique new mechanic of hand-building and want to make a special first edition for those that share my enthusiasm.  But, I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and with the support of kickstarter backers we are able to reduce the amount of money sitting in inventory and make more games sooner as a result.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through - without kickstarter we could really only offer these promo items to the limited number of people that attend big events like GenCon and Essen.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it's ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs within the US & Canada, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Grifters. Note - we are no longer able to support Add-Ons outside of US & Canada.\nAfter this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in September).\nAll of the games that we offer in the add-on program are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Hidden Agenda (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Hostile Intent (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion)\nCoup Rebellion G54 (Stand Alone Game)\nOne Night Revolution\nMelee\nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nHaggis\nDragon Slayer\nRoar-a-Saurus\nOur plan is to have Grifters ready in time for GenCon and available at Essen. While our current production schedule looks like kickstarter rewards will ship out well before GenCon, it may be the case that we have games at GenCon before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to GenCon or Essen in time.  I wish we were able to absolutely guarantee results - but we simply know that we can't make such commitments when so many other parties are involved in the process.\nIf you want GenCon or Essen pickup - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our GenCon email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzSlX or sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pick up (note we cannot handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday).\nAll the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to GenCon/Essen - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nWe are very excited to be continuing our international partnerships with Snakes & Lattes and BoardGameGuru to offer Canadian & EU Friendly shipping options. And we have added Australian Friendly Shipping options as well!\nFor most of the rest of the world we will offer two levels of shipping services to give you options between cost, speed and success.  Unfortunately, international shipping is costly, takes time and is open to a number of potential issues and delays. While we try to use shipping services providers that are both effective and cost efficient, we are not in the shipping business and must rely upon outside providers and postal services to get games to you.  This year we offer either ECONOMY or PRIORITY shipping choices - please be sure that you read the significant restrictions that come with each option!\nWe also realize that for many international backers our best option will be to buy the retail edition of this game when it arrives in your local game store. It may be the case that everyone is happier and enjoys our great games without having endured the hassles of international shipping ;)\nECONOMY Shipping\nFor several years we have sent international packages by FEDEX International Mail Service (FIMS).  FIMS items are packed in the US, sent to Sweden on a space-available basis and then sent to the postal system in your destination country, again on a space-available basis.  This has been reasonably reliable, and an inexpensive service, oftentimes items arrive in as little as 2 weeks.\nHowever, delivery times and success rates can be highly variable.  In 2015 we had a much higher rate of delay and missing packages - though 90% of the packages still arrived within a reasonable time period and many of the items that were initially reported as lost were later delivered.  So while it is not perfect, it is cheaper than other options.\nIf you select this option you are agreeing to these conditions:\nThere are no tracking numbers, or individual shipping confirmation emails.  While I will notify you that your items have been sent, you are agreeing to my commitment that these items are sent as there is no verifiable confirmation of shipment.\nExpected delivery time is up to 6 months after shipment.  You are signing up to having a delivery address that is fixed for a long time frame.  You are also agreeing in advance to being extremely patient and acknowledging that it is very likely that the retail version of this game (without the promos) will be available in your local store before you receive your kickstarter rewards.\nThere is no guarantee of delivery.  If your items do not arrive within 3 months (which is the case 5-10% of the time) you can have items resent via USPS Priority Mail, paying the full shipping and handling fee for the item (about $60), to the same address you submitted in the kickstarter survey for this project.  That is the only option for items not received - there are no other options that will be available to you.\nIf these conditions are not legally binding in your country, then you are not eligible to select this level of service.\nI know that these restrictions are hard, that is why I am making them perfectly clear as I intend to uphold them.  If you don't agree to these shipping restrictions, please either 1) choose the PRIORITY shipping service offered, 2) use a parcel freight forwarder to have items sent to a US address and then to you or 3) wait for the retail edition of this game to make it to your local game store.\nPRIORITY Shipping\nThis is a higher cost service that offers shipping confirmation, tracking numbers and delivery confirmation via the US Postal Service's Priority International Mail.  Delivery can take as little as a week after shipment - but depends largely on the custom processing times in your country.\nWhile this shipment service offers many benefits over ECONOMY shipping, it does still have restrictions:\nExpected delivery time is up to 2 months after shipment. You are signing up to having a delivery address that is fixed for that period of time.\nYou provide your address to me and confirm that it is both a valid address and safe for packages to be left.  You are responsible for items that are sent to an old address, returned as undeliverable or unknown address, unclaimed items when required to be picked up at the post office, or items that are marked as delivered but not received.  In these cases these items will only be resent at your expense.\nIf you don't agree to these shipping restrictions, please either 1) use a parcel freight forwarder to have items sent to a US address and then to you or 2) wait for the retail edition of this game to make it to your local game store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. \n\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>> While I do read the comments, I will not answer questions nor post into the comments section. The comments section(s) may, in fact I can guarantee that it will, contain inaccurate information. It is very easy for you to ask me a question and get an email response, so please do.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra promo items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing, there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affect game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this game.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here. If you don't see that I have made a commitment to do something, then I haven't committed to do that - please don't assume that I have. You can always send a message and ask me.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - Things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you), I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and the costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline, but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art; however, while it is not expected, changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alterations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nProduction variability - While efforts are made to ensure that all versions of games are compatible with previous versions and expansions, there is no practical way to ensure that this happens. Variations in the production process can result in differences in colors, textures and materials between print editions and occasionally within a single print run. Some variation should be expected that may necessitate that measures such as using card sleeves be used to hide these minor production variations.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Grifters: Nexus - final hours on kickstarter!", "update_content": "Just a quick reminder that the kickstarter project for Grifters: Nexus is in it's final hours.

It shares similarities to card games like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, but in a simpler easy-to-pick-up-and-play way, akin to Love Letter. Anyone older than 10 who has a knack for card games should enjoy themselves.\nWhat is Control?\nWith mechanics inspired by Cuttle, Control is combat card game for 2\u20134 players where rounds last 5\u201315 minutes. Players are time travelers who\u2019ve been caught in a rupture in spacetime and displaced outside time. Each player must use Fuel Cells (the cards) to refuel their own time machine or stop other players from refueling theirs first.\nWhat\u2019s the Goal?\nTo escape the rupture, a player needs to reach a Fuel Cell Charge of 21 or more at the end of his or her turn. Whoever does so first closes the rupture, leaving all other travelers lost outside time.\nWhat's in the Box?\n54 Poker-Size Cards (13 different card types with a custom illustration for each type)\nThe Instruction Manual\nCounters (Upgradable through Stretch Goals)\nPlatform Insert (To hold cards)\nWhat are the Rules?\nThe deck is shuffled and each player is dealt five cards. Cards are either Silver or Bronze Fuel Cells with their Fuel Cell Charge in the top left ranging from 1-10.\nOn their turn, a player chooses ONE of the following:\nDraw a card. A player may not draw if they have seven cards in hand.\nInstall a Silver or Bronze Fuel Cell in their area of play. The Fuel Cell Charge on installed cards goes toward a player's goal of 21 or more to win. Abilities on Silver Fuel Cells are activated when installed. \nBurn a Bronze Fuel Cell to the discard pile to activate its ability.\nDefuse an opponent\u2019s fuel cells with a Fuel Cell of your own of equal or higher value.\nThat\u2019s it. With two to three players, it's every-man-for-himself. In a four-player game, teams of two must work together to make their escape.

By one of the world's most respected designers and with stunning artwork by award-winning illustrator Vincent Dutrait, Grail Games is pleased to present a new, 3rd English edition of this famous auction game.\n * Please note that all pledge amounts are in Australian dollars (AUD).\nYou are buyers for different merchant houses in the competitive, but profitable age of the infamous Medici family. Ships sail throughout the Mediterranean and beyond, in search of rare and valuable merchandise. Every day you go to the wholesale market where you must compete with other buyers for the merchandise available that day. There you expect to find lush furs, grain from the rich fields abroad, exotic spices, colourful dyes, the finest cloth, and, rarely, gold from mines far across the waters...\nA prototype version of the new edition being played\nMedici is an auction game that takes place over three days (rounds).\nPlayers take turns presenting goods to be auctioned. Successful bidders will then load these goods onto the decks of their ships.\nOnce all ships are full, or the deck of commodity cards is depleted, each day ends.\nPlayers then receive money for the value of the loads in their ships, and for how much of each commodity they have bought thus far. But be careful - the money you use to bid at auctions is also your end game points!\nAfter three days and three scorings, the player with the most money will win the game.\nMedici is quick to learn, smooth to play and full of player interaction.\nFor a more detailed description of how to play Medici, please click the link above to read the complete rulebook (pre-release version - subject to change) or watch the review videos below!\nPlease watch the following video reviews which include brief run-throughs on how to play Medici...\nAnd here are links to a couple of written reviews by Farmer Lenny of iSlaytheDragon and Giles Pritchard!\nTo find out more about the game, please visit Medici on Boardgamegeek for images, forums and reviews!\nEach copy of Medici will include:\n1 full-colour rulebook\n1 game board (406 x 406mm)\n36 commodity cards - 7 each depicting cloth, fur, grain, dye and spice & 1 gold card (44 x 67mm)\n6 large ship mats (250 x 100mm)\n2 smaller ship mats - to be used in the 2 player game (98 x 100mm)\n36 wooden playing counters (6 per player)\n5 commodity scoring counters\n2 day tracking counters\nAnd should we reach certain stretch goals...\n6 scoring aid cards\n1 start player card/wooden token\n...all contained within a sturdy two-piece box (305 x 223 x 43mm)\nFor 21 years, Medici has remained a tightly designed game. It is simple to learn, yet it provides a lot of player interaction and fun, tactical decision-making.\nSo what needed to change?\nWorking with the designer, Dr Reiner Knizia, from the beginning, we have intended for the new edition of Medici to be seen as the definitive edition of the game. No original rules have changed, but the game has been improved on in the following ways:\nNew 2-player rules!\nPreviously, Medici was only playable with groups of 3-6 players. Now the game can be played with just two, thanks to some extra rules designed by Dr Knizia. (Please see the rulebook for information on how the 2-player game runs.)\nAll-new artwork!\nMedici is a difficult game to illustrate. It is so colourful that artists have certainly found this game challenging to make both functional and pleasing to the eye. Vincent Dutrait has done a terrific job of achieving both. This edition of the game will definitely \"pop\" on your table!\nCard values can be seen from across the board, colours are clear, and the game looks gorgeous.\nNew components\nThis new edition will include markers to track the rounds of the game and the commodities that have been scored, as well as (should we meet the associated stretch goals) a start player card/token, and player aid cards to remind players how to score points.\nNone of these components are essential to gameplay, but they enhance the experience, making the game even easier to follow.\nNote: We acknowledge that the board and counters can be problematic for players with colour-blindness. We have done what we can to improve this (icons on cards, background images on the scoring tracks) and hopefully we will meet the stretch goal (see below) that will allow us to print designs on one side of all counters so pieces can immediately be distinguished besides from their colour. This will make the new edition of Medici the most accessible.\nWhat is not in this edition?\nExperienced Medici players will note that this edition uses cards, and not tiles (as in the 2nd edition). This decision was made to bring the game back to its form as originally intended by the designer, and to reduce set-up time.\nThis edition is also without the extra cards included in the previously published French edition of the game. These were not designed by Dr Knizia.\nWith your support, upon reaching the following stretch goals we will be able to afford to make each copy of Medici even better! More details on every addition will be revealed as we approach each over-funding target.\nAdding these cards to the game will allow players to remember how their ships and goods will fare against the other players' at the end of each day.\nThis start player card will help players remember who is the starting player for each auction as the round progresses.\nBeing able to print the cards on a linen finish card stock will make the game even more pleasurable to see and to play.\nPrinting an individual crest on each player's sets of counters will increase the visibility of each token on the board. These will be printed in black on one side of every counter so players may decide to ignore them or to use them as per their preference.\nAll player mats will already be printed on 1mm thick cardboard. Increasing this thickness to 2mm will improve the quality and longevity of these components.\nIf we hit this goal there will be no more reaching across the table to check the scoring aids - now every player will have one of their own!\nReaching this goal will replace the start player card with a large, wooden Medici family crest.\nThanks everyone for your tremendous support of the campaign! If we can reach this level of funding, We will be able to make the game shine even more - linen finish box and player mats!\nIt may be a stretch, but this height would be terrific to reach! Blackcore card stock is the best in the business - our manufacturer can push the quality no further! Cards will feel thicker, sturdier, better!\nWe hope to have the opportunity to announce more stretch goals as the campaign continues. Thank you for your support!\nSimply select the pledge level from the list on the top-right of this page to secure your reward as listed below. Please note that quoted prices may fluctuate, depending on currency values at the end of the campaign.\nBackers may add to their pledges to receive more games! To do so, simply select your pledge level and add the following amounts to your pledge in the editable text field. All add-ons have shipping included in the costs listed below.\nBy supporting Medici on Kickstarter, not only are you helping us to produce the game in the first place, but you are ensuring that:\nYou will receive your copy of Medici below retail cost and shipped to your door! (MSRP in US will be $39.95US and RRP in Australia will be $49.95AUD)\nYou will receive your copy of Medici at least a few weeks prior to the game being made available at online and bricks & mortar game stores.\nYour support will make the game better! More stretch goals means more components and a  better quality.\nNote that Grail Games runs no-frills Kickstarter campaigns without promotional extras that increase costs and time-frames. We intend to get a high-quality product to your door as quickly as possible. Thank you for your tremendous support!\nAll rewards at all levels include shipping costs to all available countries (USA, UK, Canada, Australia, NZ). No more shipping costs need be or will be added to your pledge totals!\nIf you live outside of these countries, unfortunately we cannot ship Medici to you at this time. We hope international publishing partners will be able to publish the game in other regions and languages soon.\nPlease note that Medici is UK-friendly! This means that UK backers will not have to pay extra fees to receive their games as they will be sent to your door from within the UK!\nVincent Dutrait is highly regarded in the board game community as an illustrator of the highest quality (Lewis & Clark, Broom Service, T.I.M.E Stories, Augustus, New York 1901, etc.) His work is bright, eye-catching and functional - who better to ask to illustrate this classic game!\nWe asked Vincent to produce illustrations that were beautiful, colourful, bright, and (in the case of the board and cards) extremely user-friendly. The artwork had to invoke the game\u2019s setting, while giving it the \"look\" that this classic game deserves.\nWe believe Vincent has outdone himself!\nThe attention to detail here is terrific. The board, for example, was influenced both by Franz Vohwinkel's 2006 board design, as well as by the Medici-built Chapel of the Princes' ceiling that you can visit in Florence:\nImage by: George Reader on flickr\nThe cards were designed to be highly visible, highly usable and highly beautiful:\nAnd the same goes for the player mats which help players to feel as if they are placing goods on their ships:\nThe yellow player's ship mat with the 2-player game additional board alongside.\nBeing influenced by what has come before, while looking modern and stunning in its own right, Medici will look stunning on your shelf and on your table!\nMatcha is a 2-player only card game released by Grail Games last August. In it, players attempt to collect the utensils required for a Japanese tea ceremony. It is a simple set-collection game with a surprising amount of depth for its small size. We are happy to provide the game at a big discount during this campaign.\nTom Vasel named Matcha his \"Best Card Game of 2015\" and \"Best Small Game of 2015.\" Here is his review (which also shows you how to play):\n And here is another review from the Game Boy Geek:\n* Backers of Medici who also pledge for a copy of Matcha will be sent their copies of Matcha in March.\nFor more information on the game, please visit our website or boardgamegeek.\nCircus Flohcati, like Medici, was designed by Reiner Knizia. Originally released in 1998, Grail Games is about to release an all-new edition of this fun, push-your-luck card game. Can you collect all the acts required to put on a stellar flea circus?\nWith art by Heiko Gunther (Glory to Rome), this new edition is due to be released in April.\n*Backers of Medici who also pledge for a copy of Flohcati will be sent their copies of Flohcati in March.\nFor more information on Circus Flohcati, please visit our previous Kickstarter campaign page, our website or boardgamegeek.\nGrail Games is a card and board game publishing studio located in Sydney, Australia. We have already run four successful Kickstarter campaigns, all of which delivered games to backers at least one month early.\nGrail Games\u2019 aim is to produce board and card games that are:\nFamily-friendly: We believe that games can strengthen friendships and families. All of our games can be enjoyed by players of a variety of ages.\nFast to teach: our games have clean, straight-forward rules sets to decrease the number of barriers to entry.\nDeep and replayable: Games blossom when they offer a variety of pathways to explore.

Since our first Kickstarter campaign was received EARLY by backers in January 2015, we have continued to send high quality products to backers on time! We have our systems well in place and use a top manufacturer to produce and ship quality games around the world. Grail Games is beginning to forge a track record of delivering fun games with quality components\u2026 on time!\n\nHowever, unforseen circumstances can hold up a project. This can happen at the point of manufacture or during shipment. Grail Games has given a time-frame for delivery of Medici that we believe is certainly achievable. If anything does affect the project, backers will be kept in the loop via regular backer updates at every step of the production and shipment process.\n\nNote that the currency conversions in the pledge level blurbs are a guide only. Currency values may fluctuate during the campaign.\n\nAlso note: Pledge levels do include all shipping costs, and backers will receive their games before retail stores, but Grail Games cannot guarantee that retailers will not sell Medici at a cheaper price than Kickstarter supporters will \u201cpay.\u201d\n\nFinally, Grail Games will happily send replacement copies of any game damaged in shipment to backers, etc., but if backers fail to inform Grail Games of a change in shipping address or similar, backers may be asked to pay extra costs for a replacement copy of the game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Winter is coming...

Each courtable character has at least three posed sprites, each with multiple facial expressions. In addition, all characters are partially voiced by professional Japanese voice actors.\nBoasting over 50+ hours of gameplay, you must navigate your way through over 30 different endings, including bad, good, and true endings for all courtable options. \nPlay as a Boy or a Girl\nAt least 6 Courtable Options (3 Male, 3 Female)\nCourtable Options Have Their Own Sexual Preferences\n50+ Hours of Gameplay\nOver 30 Different Endings (Including Good, Bad, and True)\nMultiple Sprite Poses and Expressions\n30+ Background Images\nPartial Japanese Voice Acting by Professional Voice Actors\nOriginal Music Soundtrack\nAvailable on Windows, Mac, and Linux. \nIn the year 2092, people no longer trusted the Earth to sustain their existence. The Earth stood as a husk of its past self. As part of a desperate last attempt to save the human race, the governments of the world joined forces in a secret military project to send the best and brightest of humanity to scout the galaxy for a new home. Welcome Aboard the Everett.\nThe year is now 2117. You are a second generation ship-born researcher studying inter-dimensional travel. Your choices change the fortunes of all aboard the Everett. Friendship and love lay waiting at your feet, but you should be wary. The road to the stars is full of hardship.\nA malprogrammed A.I. dedicated to preserving resources pulls you into a twisted, murderous game. When tensions are high, who knows what even the kindest crew member will do? How will you protect those you love? Will you betray friends to save yourself? Will you be slaughtered in cold, empty space? Will you slaughter?\nIt's time to ask yourself: what would you do to survive?\nMain Characters\nThe main crew of the Everett are second-generation, ship-born personnel. Each crew member was born and raised for a specific purpose to complete the mission. Unfortunately, due to an 'incident' involving the original crew, the number of second-generation crew members born was dramatically reduced. \nEach of the Main Characters are courtable.\nSupporting Characters\nProtagonist\nYou play as a second-generation, ship-born researcher. Following in your parents footsteps, you research inter-dimensional travel as a way to solve Earth's resource crisis. Due to an 'incident' involving the original crew, you were raised in a small self-contained shuttle, separated from the Everett. The events of Quantum Suicide begin when this shuttle is recovered by the Everett, and you settle into your new home. \nCharacter Art\nQuantum Suicide's lead artist is Ygor Lisboa aka Danzilla. We were drawn to him for his wonderful, expressive Japanese style and he is responsible for our character design, sprites, and CG art. \nEach main character has three poses, with three expressions per pose. Supporting characters currently only have one pose, with multiple expressions. \nIn addition to sprites, Ygor is also responsible for our full-screen Computer Graphics (CGs) that will appear at special moments in the story. The bulk of our art funding will be directed towards CG production, with roughly 60 CGs planned for the game, distributed with approximately 8 special CGs per character route.\nWhile Quantum Suicide does not contain any adult content, there will be a certain amount of 'ecchi' or suggestible content. Even with all the murder, and betrayal, it is a romantic visual novel, designed to set your heart aflutter. \nBackground Art\nAh, background art. You are hardly given the credit you deserve but as soon as you are lacking, it becomes apparent. The interior of the Everett was designed with a sparse, military practicality in mind, but we also wanted it to be atmospheric and vivid enough to be visually interesting for the player. To get the best art, you have to go to the best artist so we went to background extraordinaire, Owen Carson.  \nThe scenes capture the beauty of the ship, the wonder of space, and the eerieness of a closed circuit situation. With at least 20 variations for the background to date (with plans for a few extra for the few game), the Everett will come alive, even if you don't stay that way!\nThe Everett\nThe events of Quantum Suicide take place in deep space, light years away from any habitable planet. Our stalwart crew need a ship to traverse the galaxy, and that ship is the Everett.\nHow silly would it be if we talked about a spaceship all the time and never actually showed you what said spaceship looked like? We'd probably get accused of faking it like the moon landing. As much as everyone knows that Jet Fuel Can't Melt Steel Beams, the Dulce Base is where it's at, and Project MK-Ultra is still operating away, we don't want to be part of that saga.\nDesigned by Shoji Amasawa, the Everett is inspired by Discovery One, the HAL controlled vessel from Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. We have no doubt that AI and HAL would be excellent friends.\nOur Game User Interface (GUI) is designed to be intuitive, and add to the overall science fiction tone of the game. Further screens such as CG Gallery, Music Player, Mini-Games, Archive Files, and Bonus Content are to be added as the game is created. The Quantum Suicide Logo and the GUI was designed by the talented Luna Chai Li.\nWhat would intergenerational space travel be without a great soundtrack? Quiet. No one wants quiet. Quiet is scary, and cold, and sad. To ensure that your travels among the stars is not a quiet affair, we've had a soundtrack lovingly crafted by our talented musicians. \nNot only do we have a promotional video featuring \u5909\u7570\u500b\u4f53-\u0413\u0415N\u0415- by SEVERUS WAND in the works and a complete Original Soundtrack by Wojciech Wojnowski. Three tracks are exclusive to Kickstarter backers, and will never be made available by us again.\nQuantum Suicide uses a combination of English text and Japanese voice acting to convey its story. As an Original English Language Visual Novel, we do strive to make the novel as accessible as possible to the English speaking population. Nevertheless, we prefer Japanese voice actors so have decided that all voice actors will be native Japanese Voice Actors to give that crisp, natural feeling on the ear.\nUnder the funding goal, Quantum Suicide will have generic conversational responses and pivotal lines voiced within the game. A stretch goal for full voice acting has been set at $95,000.\nNOTE: The Voice Actor links are only accessible from a Japanese IP.\nAs Quantum Suicide is the first project of Cotton Candy Cyanide, a new game development company, it was necessary to seek alternate means of funding. Thus far, all art, music, voices, and, game assets have been personally funded out of our own pockets. \nWe chose Kickstarter, in particular, over other crowd-funding websites simply because of our familiarity with the format. Between us, we've backed around 12 separate projects and understand what is expected in regards to communication, accountability, and transparency. \nOf course, we did consider some other avenues in order to raise the funds required to make the game. A kidney goes for about $10k on the black market, and we hear witches pay pretty well for first-born children. \npiegraph\n The total funds are equal to $30,000 AUD. \n $9 ADD-ON: POSTER SET\nNeed more Quantum Suicide in your life? Stuff to put on your walls, or hang in your car? Well, we have got you covered with this poster add-on pack. For only $9 ($5 add-on + $4 postage) you can get an A3 poster, an exclusive double-sided A6 postcard that was made for Kickstarter promotion, and your very own double-sided Quantum Suicide Air Freshener. For when you need to cover up the smell of blood in your spaceship....I mean, you know, when you want to smell the stars.\n To get the add-on, simply add $9 to your pledge amount. There's no need to change your tier, we'll send out a Kickstarter survey at the end to confirm your order, and grab your shipping deets. \n$20 ADD-ON: MOLTENCHERRY DRAWING + POSTER SET\nMoltenCherry in her paint style of 'art' will draw you a picture of your choosing. It probably won't be a very good picture (have you even seen her fan art entry!) but it will be a picture nevertheless with all funds going to help the project. Your image might even make the art book!\n$40 ADD-ON: T-SHIRT\nAdd $40 ($35 shirt and $5 postage) to your tier to get your very own Quantum Suicide shirt! What shows more support than physically wearing a products name on your body? Well, I guess a tattoo would, but we're not suggesting that by any means! Shirts come off, shirts are washable and shirts don't make mothers cry so let's stick with that.  Sizes are available in Women's 8 - 20 (Australian Sizing - click here to figure out your size) and Men's S - XXXL (Universal Sizing). \nCotton Candy Cyanide (CCCN-) is made up of two people: Ashley Pearson (Nyx) and Tina Richards (MoltenCherry). We often go by our gamer tags.\nWe created CCCN- to create games that we, ourselves, wanted to play. Both of us greatly enjoy games such as Dangan Ronpa, Virtue's Last Reward, and Persona; games that challenge us, make us fall in love with characters, and then break our hearts. Unfortunately, we found these sorts of titles scarce in the Western gaming market. While Steam has been exploding with visual novels recently, we wanted to create something a little darker than a slice of life, romantic novel. We've got 'Cyanide' in our name for a reason.\nSincerely, we hope that Quantum Suicide is the first of many high quality Original English Language Visual Novels from Cotton Candy Cyanide.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuantum Suicide's greatest challenge is that it Cotton Candy Cyanide's first production. While we do not have any previous experience as game developers, we have a lifetime experience as gamers. We believe that we know what makes a good game, and hopefully the time and money that we've put into the demo is enough to convince you that we've also got the dedication to see this project through. Even though this is our first project we are consistently working on improving our skills and attacking any problems that come along.\n\nUnfortunately, game development is not our full-time job. We are both busy PhD students with articles to read, lives to live, and money to make so we can eat every week. We hope that our backers can understand that we are making this game on our own time, and that we will do our very best to overcome any setbacks thrown at us. Being PhD students, we've picked up good time management skills from our time at University.

It looks like this isn't going to get funded and maybe you should breath a sigh of relief at that because for a first project for a company this is a ridiculously huge undertaking. Going for a 50 hour Visual novel is akin to taking on a dragon after two months of training. There aren't many visual novels that reach that length and those that do tend to feel padded or spread out(Looking at you Majikoi) Average Visual novel length tends to be between the 20-30 hour area. The idea itself is alright though your inspirations are clear. I just hope you are doing your own thing rather than taking cues from the big boys. I plan to play the demo later and get a better idea of the story but I think you guys should have gone for something smaller. Like a kinetic novel like Narcissu or a below ten hour VN. There have been some pretty exceptional VNs that managed in that timeframe.

Relying on simple game mechanics and meaningful choices, and a pinch of take that, KEEP plays slightly differently, but always quickly, regardless of the number of players. At the end of a set number of rounds, the player with the most Coins in his Cloister wins the game. KEEP was designed by John Clowdus and beautifully illustrated by Oliver Howe.\nThis is a short, 10 day project featuring clear rewards, achievable and meaningful stretch goal content, with a modest funding goal. For $13, $18, or $23 (based on your region) you'll receive a complete copy of KEEP, at less than MSRP (projected domestic MSRP is $15.00), with free or reduced shipping and all unlocked stretch goal content.\nBackers have the option of backing for more than one copy of KEEP by increasing their pledge by the amount shown in their selected tier.\nThere is no add-on content for this project. The reward tiers are separated by region. Pledge amounts shown *include* shipping and handling. All backers pledging $5 or more will receive the full print and play files. For information regarding international shipping for KEEP and its Euro-Friendliness, please check the FAQs!\nKEEP's Cards are 310 GSM Blackcore with Linen Finish. Contents shown reflect unlocked Stretch Goals!\nKEEP is a quick game that is played over a series of rounds (based on the number of players). As the game is played, each player plays cards to add to their Cloister. The cards in a player\u2019s Cloister are potentially worth coins at the end of the game. Whatever card(s) the player doesn\u2019t keep, other players will have the chance to, as hands are passed each round. The player with the most coins in their Cloister at the end of the game wins!\nYou can view the full rules here.\nPlayers have three options each turn:\nPlay an Item card from their hand face up in their Cloister (play area - each player has a Cloister).  Item cards are worth a set number of Coins at the end of the game.\nPlay a Character card by discarding it from their hand to use its ability (helping the player, hurting other players, or possibly both).\nPlay a Character card from their hand face down in their Cloister as a Secret Character (Secret Characters are revealed at the end of the game and are worth Coins based on the other cards in the player's Cloister).\nAdditionally, once per game, each player may reveal one of their Secret Character cards to use its ability as a bonus action.\nWhen the game ends, each player reveals their Secret Character cards, and earn coins for the cards in their Cloister.  The player with the most coins wins!\nPLAY\n\nTwo to five players can enjoy KEEP. Game time is roughly 5 minutes per player. The number of rounds and starting hand size varies based on the number of players playing the game. With its simple mechanics and interesting card interactions, KEEP is a great fit for gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThank you for checking out this project!  Wanna show your support for this project?  Feel free to use these avatars anywhere you'd like to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLike all Small Box Games' games, KEEP will be domestically manufactured.\n\nI do my very best to mitigate any risks associated with manufacturing games. I've built solid relationships with several state-side manufacturing companies, and after 7 previous successful Kickstarter projects, I've come to know what to expect regarding quality and turnaround time.\n\nOf course, there's always the risk of something unforeseen happening during the production process. Kickstarter gives me the tools to keep in contact with backers, so I can keep them abreast of all aspects of production, each step of the way.\n\nEverything is already prepped and ready for KEEP. I'm already working with the manufacturers, so that when this project ends, all I'll have to do is tell them how many copies I need manufactured, helping to streamline the production process and hit the project's reward delivery deadline.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Neolithic: Advanced Cultures. 1-2 Player Card Game on Kickstarter (31 Hours Left!)", "update_content": "Hello!\nSmall Box Games is proud to present Neolithic: Advanced Cultures on Kickstarter.

Death-defying aerialists, mysterious magicians and jovial jugglers \u2013 Circus Flohcati has them all!\nCircus Flohcati, is an exciting, push-your-luck card game from famed designer, Reiner Knizia. During the game, players will attempt to collect all the acts required for a gala show that will be the toast of the town. But be careful! Risk too much and any ringmaster can go bust!\nWill you be cautious or cavalier? Will the audience flock, or will they flee?\nCircus Flohcati was first published in 1998 and has been released in various editions. Unfortunately, it has been out of print since 2006. Grail Games has worked hard to create a new version of this fun, fast game from Reiner Knizia (the designer of Samurai, Medici, Ra, etc.) for today\u2019s audience. With artwork by Heiko G\u00fcnther (Glory to Rome, Tesla vs Edison, The Dice Will Flow), we are asking for support to fund the production of this new, English language edition of the game for gamers and families to discover anew.\nPlease note that Grail Games only has the right to sell Circus Flohcati in certain English speaking countries. Therefore, only backers from the following countries may back the game: USA, UK, Canada, Australia & New Zealand.\nWhen you pledge your support for the game you will be receiving a classic Knizia design with the following improvements:\n\u27bc High quality cards and manufacture, \n\u27bc All new artwork (see below for more info),\n\u27bc Some small rule changes to bring the game in line with Dr Knizia\u2019s original vision. \nAs the game was re-printed by different publishers, some rule changes crept in over time. This edition will return the game to its originally designed rules set. The \u201cchanges\u201d include:\n\u27bc The \u201cRequest one attraction from an opponent\u201d card is no longer \u201crequest an attraction of a certain colour\u201d and instead, the attraction given is selected by the opponent who is giving up the card.\n\u27bc Ending the game with a \u201cGala Show\u201d will score that player a bonus 10 points.\n(To read the full rule book to the new edition, please see the \u201cHow to Play\u201d section, below.)\n\u27bc 80 Attraction cards, with the values 0 \u2013 7 in ten colours\n\u27bc 9 Action cards, 3 of each kind\n\u27bc A rules booklet\nAn example of each of the card types in the game!\n ...and here's a close-up of the Magician! Stay tuned to our upcoming campaign updates for more info and images of the splendiferous art!\nThe cards... will be 59mm x 91mm and 310gsm ivorycore card stock (unless we meet certain stretch goals \u2013 see below).\nThe box\u2026 will be 110 x 110 x 50mm and made with strong 1.5mm thick card.\nThe game is:\n\u27bc For 2-5 players\n\u27bc Ages 7 and up can play\n\u27bc About 15 minutes long\nShould we exceed our funding goal, the following improvements will be able to be made to the game. Thanks to your support, every copy of Circus Flohcati, now and in the future, will have the chance to include\u2026\nEach set of attraction cards will receive an extra depiction of the circus act being portrayed. This means each suit of eight cards will have two different illustrations on four cards each.\nEach set of attraction cards will receive an extra depiction of the circus act being portrayed. This means each suit of eight cards will have two different illustrations on three cards each, and another illustration on two cards.\nEach set of attraction cards will receive an extra depiction of the circus act being portrayed. This means each suit of eight cards will now have four different illustrations on two cards each. Nice!\nWant a beautiful, textured feel to your cards? Reaching this stretch goal allows us to print the games' cards on linen finish card stock.\nIvorycore card stock has a terrific thickness and \u201cspring,\u201d however, having the chance to print the game\u2019s cards on blackcore card stock would really give your circus a sense of class! This is the highest quality option our manufacturer provides.\n\u2026We hope to have the opportunity to announce more stretch goals as the campaign continues!\nIn Circus Flohcati, players try to complete sets of circus attraction cards before the game ends. A player begins her turn with several face-up cards to choose from. If she doesn't like them, she can draw another, but if she turns over a card that matches the suit/colour of one of the face-up cards, she loses her turn. She can continue drawing until she decides to take one, or if the drawn card makes a match.\nThere are two main ways to score points: During a player\u2019s turn she can combine three cards with the same number and lay them down in front of her. Such sets will be worth 10 points at the end of the game; additionally, the highest card from each suit left in her hand contributes its face value to her score.\nThe game ends, either, once the deck of circus acts is depleted, or when a player is able to perform a \u201cgala show,\u201d laying down one card of each suit to the table. These cards will score for her as above, but the player who ends the game in such a manner will also score a bonus 10 points.\n>> CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE COMPLETE RULEBOOK! <<\nOr, watch this How to Play video:\n (Please note this game was played using an older edition of the game.)\nThe earlier editions of Circus Flohcati have been enjoyed for many years. Here are what some reviewers have had to say about the game\u2026\n\u27bc Ender\u2019s Game says:\"Almost every day, my two youngest daughters beg me to play a game with them after supper. Probably the game that they request the most is: Circus Flohcati.\u201d\nRead the rest of this truly delightful review by Ender\u2019s (then) 6 & 4 year old daughters here. \n\u27bc Lincoln from \u201cGame Night!\u201d says:\"Fun and quick with a nice amount of tension in your decisions. One of my favorite fillers.\u201d\n\u27bc The Dice Tower's Zee Garcia says:\n\"A cute and ultra-simple card game of set collection and pushing your luck. Easy to play, easy to teach, and over in about 15-20 minutes. This is a great filler.\"\n\u27bc Stephen Glenn (designer of Balloon Cup, 1st and Goal, Rattlebones, etc.) says:\n\u201cRanks just below 6 Nimmt as the best, light multi-player card game. Great tension for such a minimal design.\u201d\n\u27bc Phil Walker-Harding (designer of Sushi Go!, Cacao, Archaeology, etc.) says:\"A classic little card game that combines push-your-luck with set collection. Quick, easy and fun. Clearly the inspiration for the recent popular mobile game Dead Man's Draw.\u201d\n\u27bc BGG admin Chaddyboy says:\n\u201cGreat, light filler, with push-your-luck being the main appeal. Essentially, this is a set collecting game where you can either take one of the face-up cards, or flip cards until you find what you want. However, if you flip a card of a color that is already on display, you lose your turn completely. Good tension between going for a better card or busting!\u201d\n\u27bc The Gamer Nerd says:\n\u201cThe two basic strategies are to suck up the low point cards and get sets of 3 for 10 points each, or focus on getting the high cards and ending the game. Of course a hybrid approach of these two strategies works as well. There is tension as you press on for a better card, which is fun. \u201c Read the rest of the review here. \n\u27bc BGG User jm100 says:\n\u201cI consider this game a complete success for what it tries to achieve \u2026 I was extremely impressed with how fun and engaging the gameplay turned out to be. For those who like light card games, it\u2019s probably an essential purchase.\u201d Read the rest of the review here. \n\u27bc BGG User maksum says:\n\u201cI would say that Circus Flohcati should be in any collection of casual or family gamers. Likewise any serious gamer that likes to have lighter fillers around should have a copy on hand. I am just amazed how the designer pulled off a game with such simple rules and gameplay that provides such fun elements as press-you-luck, great decision making, memory, and enough luck to keep it light and interesting.\u201d Read the rest of the review here. \nAll pledge levels include all shipping costs! Because we use a fulfilment company that is down the road from our manufacturer\u2019s warehouse, shipping costs are severely reduced.\n* Those backers who pledge for copies of our previously released games will receive these approximately a month after the campaign ends. Circus Flohcati will ship after its manufacture is complete in April, 2016.\nPlease note that Grail Games only has the right to sell Circus Flohcati in certain English speaking countries. Therefore, only backers from the following countries may back the game: USA, UK, Canada, Australia & New Zealand.\nIt is possible for backers to increase their pledge amount to receive more than one copy of Circus Flohcati. To do this, simply increase your pledge by $19 for each extra copy you would like. This cheaper cost comes from the reduction in shipping prices per copy when multiple games are shipped in one package.\nFor example, to receive two copies of the game at the ROLL UP! ROLL UP! pledge level, simply increase your pledge to $40. For three copies, pledge $59. (That's $19.66 each!)\nTo add-on extra copies of One Zero One, Too Many Cinderellas or Matcha, please message us to let us know. Our stocks of these games are very limited, and if we have any left we will quote you your new pledge total.\n* Those backers whose pledges include copies of our previously released games will receive these approximately a month after the campaign ends. Circus Flohcati will ship after its manufacture is complete in April, 2016.\nHeiko G\u00fcnther writes...\n\"Circus\" is a great theme to work with, or, to put it differently, provides a perfect base from which to leave for an interesting creative journey. On the way, you certainly expect to meet zany side show ladys, dodgy magicians testing how far they can push your gullibility, amazing acrobats working on the edge of certain death and a few other spectaculous characters, all in a fake-vintage (a.k.a. \"retro\") look. Hey. I'd like to work on a game with that theme.\nShortly after David approached me to do exactly that, a fellow designer told me how a collector from the Netherlands had given roughly 3 cubic meters of old wooden poster print letters into her care, to catalogue, sort, and use them as she pleases. Knowing my fondness of \"untidy\" typography, she asked if I would be interested in printing me off some of those. I was.\nAnd surely I had some fun there. With logo and general layout finished, we only had to find a solution for the \"fleas\" part of the theme. Luckily, putting flea heads onto all characters turned out a lot less creepy than anticipated (and indeed even more silly than I had hoped). Oy, long story short.\nI am having massive fun working on the new artwork for this game. David leaves me about any freedom a creative could wish for, all the while giving valuable feedback and input. Or maybe he is just incredibly smart in the ways he manipulates what I think I would like to do. Either way, the result is the same; It feels great working on this new edition and I am quite looking forward to the finished game. Even if you guys will not make the additional artwork stretch goals, I might finish them all the same, for David to decide what to do with them (Hehe...)\nThe Mike Line, published by Grail Games, is a collection of small-sized games that pack a punch. They offer depth and replayability for gamers and non-gamers alike, despite having few components.\nCircus Flohcati will be game number 5 in the line, which already includes One Zero One, Elevenses, Too Many Cinderellas and Matcha.\nMore information on the other Mike Line games can be found on www.grail-games.com or by watching review videos such as these\u2026\n\u27bc ONE ZERO ONE review by Bower's Game Corner:\n\u27bc ELEVENSES (currently SOLD OUT) review by Board Game Brawl:\n\u27bc TOO MANY CINDERELLAS review by The Dice Tower:\n\u27bc MATCHA review by The Dice Tower:\n\u27bc Follow Grail Games on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook!\n\u27bc Visit the Grail Games and Dr Reiner Knizia websites!\n\u27bc Visit Circus Flohcati on BGG for videos, forums, photos and more!\nGrail Games is a card and board game publishing studio located in Sydney, Australia.

Thank you all so much for coming on this wild journey with us; it's been crazy!\nCheck out all of the amazing things we managed to unlock together in the Stretch Goals section below!\nWho doesn't love extras?!\nAll unlocked physical stretch goals will be applied to every Kickstarter exclusive copy of Dreary Hamlet.\nConcept Cover Artwork\n Read more about this deluxe box in update 16!\n Read more about this awesome double-sided token in Update 18!\n \n60 Coins for $15 AUD - No Extra Shipping!\nYou asked for it, and we've listened! As well as those already included in the game, any backer at the Adventurer level or higher can now pledge an extra $15 AUD (approx: $10.70 USD, \u00a37, \u20ac9.65) for each additional set of 60 metal coins they'd like to purchase, with no extra cost for shipping.\nThat's 20 bronze coins, 20 silver coins, and 20 gold coins for $15; it's as simple as that!\nTo add an extra set (or three) of coins to your pledge click on the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button. On the new page change the green number in the \"Pledge Amount\" box (add $15 per coin set -- that's in Australian Dollars), click \"Continue to next step\", and then click \"Confirm\". That's it!\nHamlet is a miserable place; quiet and sullen in its obscurity. But within it lives a tale; it slithers between the houses, its eddies and swells bathing the crumbling walls in its silence. It is a poised creature, expectant; as if it awaits the day when it is to be captured between the lips and teeth of one brave enough to speak it, and spat out, screeching, into the world.\nIt is in that moment that our tale begins...\nThe aim of the game is simple; be the player with the most loot once every player is dead. The journey there is not such a simple one though.\nEach round of gameplay consists of a day and night phase. Creatures are drawn from a deck and placed in a grid at the centre of the table, where during the day players will choose which to face. Many things will affect the outcome of this combat, such as ammunition type equipped, creature health, defence, and number of attacks, and player health and items. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and if the player survives they may receive a loot reward. These rewards can be sold for gold, crafted into better items that will be worth more in the future, or eaten to stave off death.\nWhile players have control during the day, once the sun sets and night settles across the land, the creatures in play will follow them back to camp, setting upon the doomed adventurers. No loot can be won during the chaos of night, leaving survival the only reward to a successful defence.\nAt the same time, all players are competing to become the richest hero, so back-stabbing, betrayal, theft, and murder will be in abundance. The most important thing to remember is that death is inevitable, so take joy in your friend's suffering, and race to meet them on the other side!\nWant to learn more about how to play the game? Check out Update 4 for a summary of the rulebook, as well as some of the strategies behind different styles of play.\nHere's a quick video demonstrating some of the main elements of the game.\nPLAY\n\nFour Player Gameplay Video:\nTwo Player Gameplay Video:\n Before we get too bogged down in words, let's take a brief break to look at some of the artwork for Dreary Hamlet.\nThe Basilisk\n The Djinn\n The Dryad\n There are many more illustrations we'd love to show you, but for the sake of keeping the page clean we'll save them for future updates!\n Every copy of Dreary Hamlet will contain all of the following:\nWe hope to massively improve upon this formula with stretch goals in the future, so keep an eye on this section for updates!\nDetailed list of all current components:\n4 Player Cards\n66 Creature Cards\n138 Loot Cards\n32 Death Cards\n8 Silver Coins\n20 Bronze Coins\n22 Gold Coins\n4 Acrylic Domes\n6 10-Sided Dice\n25 Small Clear Acrylic Gems\n25 Large Red Acrylic Gems\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Deluxe Book-Shaped Box\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Ziplock Bags\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: 6 10-Sided Dice\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: 1 11.5gm Starting Player Token\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Competitive Co-op Rules\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Black Drawstring Coin Bag\n There are 240 cards in total in Dreary Hamlet, which are separated into three decks:\n\nThe Creature Deck\nThe Creature Deck houses the various beasts that litter the countryside of Hamlet. From pesky Piskies to monstrous Manticores, they're all here, waiting to hit the table and take a bite out of our beleaguered adventurers.\nThe Loot Deck\nTreasures both small and large are hidden within the towering stack of the Loot Deck. Bones, insects, spells, flesh, and even gold await those who find themselves fortunate enough to still own the fingers required to pick through the remains.\nThe Death Deck\n For all, death awaits. But for the lucky few, death is not the end of the tale. This dark deck holds the most malicious of cards, and the most benevolent. Be merciful, or be cruel, but only the dead may decide how to play the game of the living.\n Every copy of Dreary Hamlet will ship with a total of 50 metal coins in three different colours; bronze, silver, and gold. There are a lot of great things about these coins, but the most important ones to note are:\nThe coins are made with a zinc alloy that is free of toxic heavy metals.\nThanks to their design the coins are light-weight.\nThese coins cannot be bent easily by hand.\nNo stamped values or brand markings means that they can easily be used as replacement components for other tabletop games.\nWe have many exciting digital rewards planned for Dreary Hamlet, and we hope to add even more with future stretch goals. For now digital rewards include:\nExtensive video diary of the Kickstarter campaign.\nExtensive video diary of the development and design of the game.\nExclusive interviews with the designer and artist.\nAccess to high res images for use as wallpapers or profile pictures.\nConcept art, sketches, and planning documents.\nSTRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Bestiary and Item Compendium\n We have chosen to send Dreary Hamlet directly from China to our backers, as this method promises a drastically shorter wait time between completion of manufacturing, and receipt of the game. This method has also allowed us to charge a flat rate of $10 AUD (approx $7.20 USD, \u20ac6.55, \u00a34.70)  outside of Europe.\nIn order to save our European backers from expensive processing fees and VAT upon receipt of their game, we will be sending all copies destined for the EU from within the EU, and will be absorbing the larger part of these fees on our end.\nDue to the absorption of these fees we have passed on a slight increase in shipping cost for EU backer, making their total shipping cost $15 AUD (approx \u20ac9.70, \u00a37). We apologise for this increase in cost, but hope that our European backers can feel safe in the knowledge that they will not face further fees down the line.\nDouble Adventurer & Creator:\nThe Double Adventurer and Creator pledge levels are covered by the same $10 AUD ($15 AUD in the EU) shipping as mentioned above.\nQuintuple Adventurer & Decuple Adventurer:\nUnfortunately all of the many cards, dice, acrylic gems, and metal coins make Dreary Hamlet a fairly weighty game, and as such we have not been able to completely eliminate additional shipping costs for backers at these pledge levels.\nBecause of this backers at the Quintuple Adventurer level will pay shipping for 4 out of 5 of their games, and backers at the Decuple Adventurer level will pay shipping for 8 out of 10 of their games.\nIf you'd like to support Dreary Hamlet on Kickstarter or other media platforms, please feel free to post about the campaign, or replace your profile display picture with one of the images below.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFulfilment is always going to be a daunting task for a first time creator, however we are confident in the measures that we have put into place, and the research we have done on this process, and trust that the companies we are working with will help us to provide backers with the products they pledge for.\n\nThe Chinese New Year is of note for this project, as production will likely cease during this time, which can often cause delays to manufacturing and shipping. We have accounted for this time in our estimated delivery date, and will use it fully to work on any stretch goals that we reach.

But all hope is not lost, there are other clans out there in the winter wasteland, with food stores of their own, and you are a Viking. If you\u2019re going to die, it won\u2019t be huddled up in your hall, wasting away, it will be out there, with axe and shield, fighting for survival and glory.\nRagnaroll is a dice-driven game about surviving and thriving in the Norse apocalypse. The game combines dice combat and variable player powers with resource management. It's a big box thematic game in a slightly smaller box, but easier and quicker to play and learn, with lots of replay value. You\u2019ll control a mighty Viking hero and a band of hungry Viking warriors, fighting with axe and shield to be the last Viking standing or to just survive long enough to fight in the final battle or, if you are brave and daring enough, to accumulate enough glory to win the attentions of the gods.\nPlease note: our dice will be custom moulded compressed resin dice. Our 3D mockups look a bit flat but you can expect high quality dice with recessed faces, meaning they'll feel great and symbols won't rub off with wear and tear.\nApocalyptic. Ragnaroll is a game about the Norse apocalypse, and has players start off with a limited amount of food that they need to eat and can\u2019t get back. This gives the game a natural end state and forces hard decisions on the players. Do you feed all your Vikings to maintain a strong fighting force, or do you send some of them out in the snow, leaving more food for the future?\nDeath and glory. The Glory Victory module introduces a new victory condition, allowing players to win the game by accumulating glory. Players will manipulate battles not just to win and steal stores, but so they can get the most glory, often losing battles and warriors to gain the gods\u2019 favour.\nYour dog. You\u2019ll get a faithful canine companion as part of your clan. The dog is a player favourite, you don\u2019t have to feed him as he\u2019s happy with table scraps but, if you get super desperate, you can use him as an alternate food source.\nCustom dice combat. There\u2019s something very special about cool dice with unique symbols on them. In Ragnaroll, it makes combat quick, brutal and calculator-free. Our dice will be custom moulded with recessed faces, meaning they'll feel great and symbols won't rub off with wear and tear.\nVariable Vikings. Variable player powers and abilities will give Ragnaroll lots of replay value, and we\u2019ll be unlocking more heroes as the campaign continues.\nFickle Fate. The Fate deck influences the way each round is played, rewarding certain actions or adding elements, making players adapt to an evolving game state.\nHigh quality art. We\u2019re really happy with the art from the talented Ruk Trumata, which features a kick-ass cast of Vikings guys and gals of different shapes and sizes. (We like to see ladies in games, but think that you should leave a little up to the imagination!)\nTruly thematic. Some games have Viking themes and dry gameplay, but Ragnaroll is proud to be a game of cunning heroes, brutal battles and glorious death that makes players feel like legendary (and not at all historically accurate) Vikings.\nIn Ragnaroll, you will control a mighty Viking hero fighting to survive in the long winter before Ragnaroll, the final dice battle of the Norse apocalypse. At the start of each round, you will separate your warriors into raiders and defenders, then the boldest player will seize the initiative (often literally) to determine the raiding order for the rest of the round.\nOn your turn, you will choose a player to raid, rolling your raiders against his defenders. A true Viking knows that her fate is already sealed and trusts her luck in battle, but you will be able to manipulate the dice using your hero's battle abilities to tip the battle in your favour, but at the cost of glory. If you win the battle, you will be able to take your opponent\u2019s precious food stores or slay his warriors, but you may find that, depending on the whim of the gods, that you can find even more glory in death and defeat. Of course, you\u2019ll also have to fight off other players\u2019 roaming Vikings who are out for stores and glory, too.\nAt the end of the round, you will feed your Vikings and this is what all those battles come down to. If you\u2019ve still got stores left and nobody else does, you feed your Vikings and everyone else starves to death, earning you victory. But, survival isn\u2019t all that matters. If more than one player can survive until the end, the final battle of Ragnaroll will occur, and the gods will recognise the mightiest Viking in the battle as the final victor.\nRagnaroll offers plenty of replay value with different hero abilities, each unique and completely over-powered in their own way. Fate cards also alter play each round, rewarding certain actions, forcing players to make tough decisions. Do you defend strongly now to have enough food to feed in future rounds, or do you follow the gods\u2019 bidding and slay as many Vikings as you can for more glory?\nFor more detail how to play Ragnaroll, check out our draft rule book or the gameplay video below.\nWant to see what happens in a game of Ragnaroll? Check out the video below. We run through a full game, and show you how to play as we go.\nReview from Smarter Backer by Bane Williams. Bane really enjoyed the game but cautioned that it's not for players who don't like aggressive play. \"It\u2019s got strategy, it\u2019s got luck, it\u2019s got push your lack aspect, it\u2019s got a secret information and all of this melds together, for me personally, to create a really fun experience.\"\n\"It is pretty much is a game night hero.\" 10/10.\nReview from Undead Viking. Lance's final thoughts start at 18:45. He describes Ragnaroll as a dice game that really stands up and makes you have fun with it, providing the thematic immersion and strategic choice that many dice games lack.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlmaF18UL7E\nPreview from Board Game Brawl. Nick's final thoughts start at 16:48, he describes Ragnaroll as a unique, innovative, thematic game and with just enough strategic bite. He also does a really great explanation of the game mechanics, so just start at the beginning if you want to learn more about the game.\nPreview from ATGN by Lin Htat:\n\"The main appeal of this game for me is its theme. It doesn\u2019t just feel like a dice game with Viking fluff, it feels thematically Viking. This is a game of acceptable losses where it doesn\u2019t reward you for playing it safe.... It is a game that rewards risky gambits with long odds and it seems fitting for a game about vikings in the post-Ragnarok world.\nIf either the setting or the idea of a fun dice game with tight mechanics appeal to you, I recommend you don\u2019t let this pass by.\"\nPreview from Game-a-pa-looza\n\"The sheer thought that\u2019s gone into the game seems phenomenal, from the scaling up of complexity based on the experience of the player, to the compelling theme, \u201cRagnaroll\u201d is definitely one to put on your to check out list.\"\nFavourite quote of the session: \"Who sacrifices their dog, I mean really, you\u2019re a terrible person.\"\nIsaac Shalev, On Board Games: Crowd Funding Edition\n\"It\u2019s a beautiful game, and a well-featured game, easy to learn, easy to teach, easy to pickup. If I was facing the apocalypse. this is the one game I\u2019d take with me.\"\nAs an Australian gamer, I know what it's like to feel forgotten about when it comes to shipping costs, so I've done my best to deliver reasonably priced shipping prices by sourcing international partners in key areas. We'll be shipping out from 3-4 fulfilment centres from around the world to get the game to you. Our EU and US backers can be assured that the game will ship from within their trading zone, and they won't be hit with any surprising custom or duty charges. This costs more time and money to initially set up but we think it's worth it to spread Ragnaroll as far as possible.  \nFree for Hong Kong, Poland and Germany\n$2.50 USD for United States of America\n$7 (4.50 Euro) for Australia and Western EU\n$13 CAD for Canada\nBackers in Asia will be charged based on their region, ranging for $3 to $27 AUD\n$27 AUD The rest of the world! (I might be able to do a slightly better price depending on your region, feel free to message me and check)\nAll packages of Ragnaroll from Karl up will be tracked so we can hunt down any lost packages. Outlaw packages will be sent untracked (but we'll work out something if it gets lost).\nRagnaroll is a pretty large project and I'll need at least half of the funds received just to place an order with the manufacturer, there's a pretty large upfront cost with Ragnaroll as we need to make some sexy, but expensive, dice moulds. The rest of the costs will go towards getting the games around the world and to you.\nWhat's not on the graph? Art and design expenses. As designer and publisher, these are coming out of my pocket and my life (for graphic design). You'll also note, there's not a healthy slice for profit. In fact, all those slices should be a little bit bigger, as I'll be losing some money on making this game, but that's all part of the plan! We'll only make money once the game hits store shelves and starts selling through. \nWe\u2019re scheduling 9 and a bit months to complete the production of Ragnaroll and get it to your door, and we\u2019re confident we can make that happen. The art and design of Ragnaroll is finished as it can be at this stage, as a few things remain up in the air during the campaign. Once the campaign is over, we\u2019ll take a couple of months to finalise all additional art assets, graphic design and unlocked gameplay elements then head into production.\nOctober - November. Art and design finalising. We\u2019ll be finishing off extra art assets unlocked in the Kickstarter and starting on pre-production with the dice. We\u2019ll also be putting the game through it\u2019s final paces with playtesting with any additional content unlocked during the campaign.\nDecember - January. We\u2019ll finalise all assets and head into pre-production. This is mostly just sending off artwork and liasing with our manufacturer to ensure everything is working correctly.\nFebruary. A bad thing happens! This is our first mass manufacturing Kickstarter, and we\u2019ve done everything we can to prepare but sometimes delays happen. We\u2019ve added in an extra month for unforeseen obstacles. (It\u2019s also Chinese New Year so there\u2019s a big holiday in China which can mess with schedules).\nMarch - May. Mass-production. After pressing the big green button, we play the waiting game. Depending on our manufacturer\u2019s schedule, this can take as long as 3 months but if we\u2019re lucky it could be closer to 6 weeks.\nJune. It\u2019s on a boat! The game will head off to our key distribution centres on a big old boat.\nJuly. And finally off to you!\nThanks and Credits\nI\u2019d like to extend a special thank you to all our playtesters and those who have played the game in various forms over the past two years, this game couldn\u2019t have been made without you!\nColin Fong made our videos.

Previously released as a free Print & Play game, it is now available with high quality materials, in a small and beautiful package, which is bursting with the amazing art of Marie Cardouat.\n...and then we held hands. is a co-operative game about finding balance. To win, the two players must complete objectives and reach the center of the board.\nThe players take turns trying to fulfill the current common emotional objective by discarding emotion cards to move from node to node. They must do this without verbal communication, empathizing and always considering each other's situation when making a move.\nA player can use their own cards or their partner's, but if their move causes their partner to be unable to move, the players lose and the game ends. While moving from node to node, their balance shifts, and they are not able to refill their hand.\nThe game features a card-splaying mechanism in which players change their \"perspective\" to reveal a new set of options.\nThe players win by meeting in the center while in a balanced state and within one turn of each other - something quite difficult, and therefore very rewarding when achieved.\n...and then we held hands. features art by beloved French illustrator Marie Cardouat, known for the art found in beautiful games such as Dixit, Steam Park, and Marrakech.\nFor more detail on the components and the rules of \u2026and then, we held hands., download the rulebook here (300KB, right click and Save as\u2026). Please download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not display properly. This file is the low-resolution version of the rules document.\nChanges from the Golden-Geek-award-winning Print & Play edition:\nThe board has been further fine-tuned for balance, based on the feedback received from countless plays.\nA new, even more challenging way to play has been added, to keep up the difficulty for more advanced gamers.\nThe rules have been streamlined for ease of learning.\n26 unique card illustrations were added.\nYou want to try out the game now, but you hate all the printing and cutting? Or you just quickly want to see all the components in their full color glory? You may download the module here, and enjoy all the benefits of Print 'n' Play without any of the work. You can get the latest version of Vassal here.\nThis is the video that started it all - Rahdo's infectious enthusiasm is irresistible, and after he raved about how amazing and important this game is, we had no choice but to publish it! Note that the art shown is from the PnP version.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivnBUk1UCjo\nFor the main runthrough video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpkjVknnVh8\nFor the extended game play video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEVDuiqH5Os\nConnectMore runs through a very thorough and wonderfully thematic session, also playing with the Arguments variant:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDw2PbOUlzM\nFor the overview video, click here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfhgaHUAQ5U\nGiven the... special nature of this game, distributors have balked at picking it up, concerned that it won't sell as well as the usual zombies & mediterranean-trading games (which we love!). And, they are probably right. This is a special game, for a very discerning audience - it is a work of art.\nNOTE: CLICK HERE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENTS!\nSo, we are bringing it directly to you - especially those of you who can not make it to Spiel in Essen, Germany, where the game will make its debut next month.\nYou might be able to pick it up from individual retailers who will buy it from us there, but without distribution, we have to find other ways for paying for the game's development, art & graphic design, and production.\nFor more on availability, and why copies for November shipping are limited, please see backer update #2.\nWhile the physical game is being printed as we speak, there is another reason to bring it to Kickstarter. A few months ago Niccol\u00f2 Granieri, a very talented composer from Italy, started creating some very beautiful music for the game.\nHere's a sample of the work in progress. It might sound \"rough\" to musically trained ears, but it is being worked on:\nIf you can not play the embedded file, you may download it here.\nWhen it was proposed to us we agreed because this was done pro-bono. Given that this is a small game (therefore commanding a much lower price than bigger ones) that has a lot of high quality illustrations (which do not come cheap), it was simply not within the budget to be able to pay Niccol\u00f2 what his work is worth.\nSo, this campaign is an opportunity to support him! If you like his work, why not pledge for the $24 level, which includes a tip for Niccol\u00f2 - while it may not be much in the grand scheme of things, it means a lot to a creative individual who puts his heart into his art.\nNote: All backers will receive access to the full-length, high quality mastered audio, not just those who generously supported its creation.\nWe do not like to do add-ons. They complicate (and delay) fulfillment, and they distract both backers and creators from the creative process of publishing a game.\nHowever, we do like to give our backers the best deal possible, and we do that by way of a special offer to all backers. In the first, backers-only, campaign update you will find a code. You can use that to get a discount off of our other games, and can even combine it with our pre-order offers.\nNote that all web store orders and pre-orders will be shipped independently of the campaign, and thus will not delay it.\nFor more on availability, and why copies for November shipping are limited, please see backer update #2.\nWe expect to fulfill all the rewards ourselves, from Finland and/or Germany. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nWe are not able to offer multiple-game pledge levels because to be able to fulfill the campaign as promised, we must ship every game individually. Since we already subsidize the shipping costs, a bulk pledge would not even save any money. We wish KS would allow for the same backer backing for a reward multiple times. A solution that some backers have found is to back for an additional copy through a second KS account.\nShipments to non-EU backers will have 17 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 19 USD / 25 CAD / 27 AUD / 18 CHF / 2326 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries.\nTracking is not offered through this campaign. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over.\nPlease note that we can not take any responsibility for any lost or damaged copies to Brazil, Russia, or Hungary.\n Note that we are not able to offer Spiel pickup at Essen for this campaign, as we will have limited space to store copies at the booth, and past experience has shown the potential for a lot of confusion (backers not picking up their copy, forgetting that they already did, trying to switch from shipping to pickup, etc.) - if you would like to pick it up at Spiel, simply come to our booth and you can buy it for 20 EUR (22.65 USD), while supplies last. You might even get it signed by the designers and/or Marie!\nWhat You See Is What You Get - this is our doctrine, and we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that add-ons and/or stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We intend to print with the highest quality materials anyway and we will not cut any corners.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals to get excited about. Therefore, raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nFurthermore, because the games are made in Europe and because we do small print runs, we do not benefit by economies of scale by producing more copies of the game.\nWe do not offer add-ons (not even our other games), because we want to keep our operations simple, and deliver efficiently. We are in this for the long run, so it does not help us to squeeze a few more dollars from a few backers, if we disappoint *all* backers.\nFinally, we do not pay anyone to give an opinion on our games.\nThis was one of our more international projects, and included team members from Malta, France, USA, Finland, Italy, Hungary, and more!\nGame design: David Chircop and Yannick Massa\nIllustration: Marie Cardouat\nGraphic design: David Chircop, Todd Sanders, Sami Laakso\nVassal module: Mindy Getch\nMusic: Niccol\u00f2 Granieri\nSpecial thanks: David Turczi\nVery special thanks: Richard & Jenefer Ham, for bringing this game to our attention.\nEmotions: Nutella", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll previous campaigns except Town Center: Beaune/Turku and [redacted]: Garden Party have been fulfilled. We are working with a manufacturer we have worked with before, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the game and any additional materials. That said, unforeseen events may affect how quickly fulfillment is conducted, and the final graphics and components that you see presented here are subject to (however improbable) change. We will be exhibiting at Essen, and it is very likely that some backers or other people may have the game in hand before you do. Note that our goal is to ship the game on time, by the dates listed on the pledge levels. Shipping a package is different than delivering a package. We do not deliver your game, the shipping company does. Therefore, delivery times will vary according to your local postal services \u2013 once we ship, the shipment is the responsibility of the shipping company.

And once a strong foothold within the industry has been gained by players, the game will shift to what truly matters: Awards!

Within the box, you'll get...\nOver a hundred bridge-sized cards, separated into an Asset deck, Game deck, and 5 Player cards. Each of these cards have unique designs and are printed on 300gsm card stock with a protective aqueous coating. \nThree stacks of 45 plastic tokens in yellow, black and white -- these are used to represent the skill levels of a player\u2019s agency. \n50 mini-sized cards that represent cash. \nAn illustrated game manual.\nThe cards\nWorking together with the writers at Jove Pater Media, we\u2019ve taken special care to give each card its own unique flavour and purpose.\nPlayer Cards\nThese represent the five unique characters you can assume, each with their own specialties and skillsets. There is the Graphic Designer, Creative Director, Tech Whiz, Jack-of-All-Trades, and the Businessman-turned-Creative.\nWithin the Game deck, there are the Account, Event and Award cards.\nAccount Cards\nThese are the main sources of income that you\u2019ll be competing for. Once you\u2019ve won a client over, they\u2019ll remunerate your agency every week... as long as you\u2019re able to continue servicing them.

Check out the full list of our creatives here.\n Who are we?\nWe are Excaliburp, and we\u2019re made up of two multi-disciplinary designers hailing from Singapore. And to show that we're a serious company, we've opted to not smile in the photo above.  \nBetween the both of us, we\u2019ve embarked on numerous self-initiated projects \u2014 sometimes about making a statement, promoting social issues, and other times they\u2019re just for plain fun.\nAbove all else, we\u2019re most excited over projects that are a combination of at least two of those things\u2026 and that\u2019s what The Award Winning Game means to us. As fans of tabletop games who spent our fair share of time in advertising, we set out to create a game that's not only relatable and enjoyable by our peers, but also offers outsiders an honest (but slightly exaggerated) take on the industry.\nTo find out more about us, you can check out our site here, or our individual portfolios here (for Callison's) and here (for David's).\nWhy we need you.\nAt this stage, The Award Winning Game is already fully developed. All aspects of the game have been fully designed, play-tested, and all that\u2019s left now is manufacturing. To physically realize and bring the game into the world, we\u2019ll need your support \u2014 be it through pledges or sharing the word.\nJust about all the funds we receive will go into the manufacturing and fulfillment of the game. To keep our project target as low as we can, we've absorbed all the costs incurred during production. This includes the consultants we've hired to generate additional content, the play-tests we've organized and the countless hours we've personally poured into the project. In other words, you\u2019ll get what you pay for\u2026 and then some!\nIn return for your trust and support, we promise to be transparent, inclusive, and to do our very best to hit our estimated delivery dates. You'll receive constant updates at every step of the way, and we'll be upfront with any obstacles or delays that might happen over the course of bringing The Award Winning Game to you.\nThe Award Winning... Awards\nThe Award Winning Certificate\nWho doesn't love award certificates? Available for tiers \"Silver\" and up, this framed & signed certificate features any award from our game universe of your choice written out to yours or your agency\u2019s name. Other details such as the award category and title can also be customized to your liking. And if you're feeling modest, you can opt for a silver or bronze themed design instead of a gold one. (But seriously \u2014 why would you?) Check out our available award designs here.\nSpecial Thanks\nWe love our backers! Available for tiers \u201cSilver\u201d and up, you\u2019ll receive a special thanks credit on our website and other applicable marketing materials. Furthermore, if we do hit our \u201cCollector\u2019s Edition\u201d stretch goal (see \u201cStretch goals\u201c section for more details), your name will also be included in The Award Winning Bible illustrated booklet under credits.\nExclusive T-Shirt & Poster\nAvailable for tiers \u201cGold\u201d and up, this exclusive t-shirt and poster combo features a single award or brand logo from our game universe of your choice, or a set of them together. For t-shirts, our designs are digitally printed on 100% preshrunk cotton tees. As for our posters, we're using 220gsm Vivic poster paper with a protective matte lamination. Both these items come in two colours: Yellow or Black. Check out our available award & brand designs here.\nIn-Game Name Card Feature\nThis one\u2019s for the winner of winners! Available to the one and only backer who snags the \u201cBest of Show\u201d tier, you\u2019ll be immortalized as a creative with your very own name card within the game. We\u2019ll work with you to either create a design for you, or to edit your existing name card design to fit our game\u2019s art direction. And given that our name cards contains e-mails and phone numbers, you can also opt to have your actual contact details featured on your name card. You\u2019ll essentially be advertised for as long as The Award Winning Game exists!\n All prices shown are in Australian Dollars (AUD)\nShipping\nFor The Award Winning Game, shipping works a little differently from other Kickstarter projects. Instead of paying for shipping along with your pledge, you\u2019ll be asked to pay only after the project has been fully funded.\nThat\u2019s because we\u2019re aiming to offer you the best possible price. Given that overall shipping costs will depend on the final quantities produced and composition of destination countries, we\u2019ll be able to pass on the savings (if any) by structuring payments in this manner.\nBut that\u2019s not to say we've not done our numbers! Listed below are the maximum amounts you can expect to pay for shipping, based on your location. No matter what happens later in the process, we won\u2019t ask for a higher amount than the figures listed below.\nAll prices shown are in Australian Dollars (AUD)\nIMPORTANT: PLEASE DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING IN YOUR PLEDGE AMOUNTS, otherwise you\u2019ll need to pay again after the campaign is over!\nWe ship to most countries in the world. Click here to find the full list of countries that we do and don\u2019t ship to.\nStretch Goals\nAll prices shown are in Australian Dollars (AUD) \nCollector\u2019s Edition \u2014 $42,000\nUpon clearing our first stretch goal, all money tokens will be printed with gold foil instead of Pantone colours. Also, a copy of The Award Winning Bible, an illustrated booklet giving you an inside look at the game's universe and the process behind its creation, will be included in every box.\nThis special Collector's edition is available only to our first production run for Kickstarter backers, and will not be available for future retail versions.\nDeluxe Expansion \u2014 $48,000\nUpon clearing our second stretch goal, we'll expand the Game deck with five more unique cards and a new game mechanic involving controversial clients! This expansion includes two Awards, two Accounts and one Event card. \nGrand Prix Expansion \u2014 $54,000\nUpon clearing our final stretch goal, we\u2019ll expand the Asset Deck with six more additional unique cards and an extra Player card for added customization! The Asset Deck expansion includes two Scandal, Trump and Name cards. Along with the previous stretch goals, this final expansion increases the total number of playable cards from 100 to 112! These extra cards will also apply to the Print-and-play digital file, which you can receive for pledges with a minimum of $10.\nConnect with us!\nCheck us out on Twitter here. If you\u2019re a design nut yourself, head on over to our Behance project page for The Award Winning Game, where we go into more detail over the design aspect of the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a project that involves the manufacturing and fulfillment of a physical product, there's always a risk of things not going smoothly \u2014 be it through oversights, delays or shipments just not arriving when it's supposed to.\n\nHowever, to combat this, we've taken every precaution we've possibly can. For one, we\u2019ve ensured that the game has been developed, play-tested and designed to full before even bringing it to Kickstarter. Save for the creation of certain pledge rewards, art production will not factor into timelines from this point on. Because of this, we're able to jumpstart our manufacturing processes and get the ball rolling almost immediately after the campaign.\n\nAs graphic designers by trade, our extensive experience with printing and their associated entities has been incredibly useful so far, and we expect this to continue working to our advantage. An example of how our expertise has informed the design of the game is through the DFM (design for manufacturability) principles that we adhere to. This not only simplifies things with our printers, but also reduces the rate of defects in the manufacturing process.\n\nWe\u2019ve also chosen our partners carefully. Our selected manufacturer is Panda Games, a popular choice with independent developers due to their commitment to quality and reliability. Having been in touch with them for the last few months, we\u2019ve prepared everything we can to pave the way to making the game a reality.\n\nGiven that The Award Winning Game is our first Kickstarter project, we\u2019ve done our homework diligently, both in the way of research and surrounding ourselves with friends and experts who are experienced in different stages of the production and fulfilment process. With their help, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be able to overcome any hiccups as they happen and come out on top.\n\nAbove all else, we recognize the importance of being transparent and responsive to our backers. We promise to keep you updated at every step of the way, and be upfront with any issues or delays as they happen over the course of bringing The Award Winning Game to you. We\u2019ll pack every single game box by hand and send it out if we have to\u2026 that\u2019s our guarantee to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Excaliburp\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nWe are Excaliburp, and we\u2019re made up of two multi-disciplinary designers hailing from Singapore.

We have grown accustomed to the comforts of civilisation, but at the same time we are always creating bigger bloodier methods of destruction.\nGuns & Steel, a card-based civilisation building game, combines the variety of hand-building with a unique card flipping mechanism. It enables 2-4 players to compete throughout the ages, struggling to build the greatest empire of the world.\n\nWill you focus on civil developments to speed up production, or will you build powerful armies to lay waste to your enemies? Do you build wonders that leave a permanent heritage for mankind, or do you try to seize them from those who are not worthy?\n\nGuns & Steel is a tightly packed strategy game that will force you to make challenging decisions on every turn. Experience the rise & fall of nations in just an hour's time!\n\nGrail Games has partnered with Moaideas to bring the fabulous Guns & Steel to a wider audience. We are running this Kickstarter campaign to fund the printing and shipment of an all-new English version of the game to be sold in Oceania and South East Asia. To cater for worldwide backers, Moaideas will be working with us during the campaign, shipping copies of the game to the rest of the world, and providing an Essen Spiel pick-up option.\nHow does this new, First edition of the game, differ from the Early version of the game sold at the Tokyo Game Market early in April, 2015?\n          - All new, amazing artwork\n          - Double-sided Wonder cards\n          - Some small rule changes and clarifications\n(To read the full rule book, please see the \u201cHow to Play\u201d section, below.)\nGame components - 45 tech cards, 10 wonder cards, 5 player aid cards and 1 rulebook\nThe cards... will be made with Japanese 310gsm card stock (as used by premium TCGs in Japan), and finished with a German, casino-grade coating for slick handling. The images are printed using a 250LPI offset printing resolution - higher than your average cards (175LPI).\nThe early edition of Guns & Steel has already been played, enjoyed and reviewed\u2026\n>> Tom Vasel, The Dice Tower\n\"A very solid design - very intriguing. Dice Tower Judgement: Approved!\" - Tom Vasel\n>> Board Game Brawl\n\"I love it when you can use a card for multiple things, and I know other games have done the same thing... but I gotta tell you: it seemed so cool to me... and even if other games have done it, I'm not sure they have done it with as much style as Guns & Steel does. ...The game itself is really, really solid and fun.\" - Nick Meenachan\nGuns & Steel is a hand-building game. Each player starts with an identical hand of cards which can be played face-down (as a resource) or face-up (as a development) to perform an action. Extra cards can be \u201cbought\u201d from a display, which are then added to your tableau. Players will progress through the different ages of human history, inventing technologies, building wonders and warring with the neighbouring civilisations.\nEvery turn consists of:\n1) Resource Phase: You must play a card face-down as a resource card.\n2) Development Phase: You must play a card face-up as a development card.\n3) Purchase Phase: You may buy one card from supply.\n4) End of Turn Phase:\n    \u2013 If you have 0 or 1 cards in hand: Check if you can gain a wonder and retrieve cards to hand.\n    \u2013 If you have 2 or more cards in hand: Do nothing. The cards played this turn remain in your tableau. \nThe game ends once all the wonders have been built, or, once every Space age card has been bought. Then, the player with the most Victory Points on their cards has built the most successful civilisation and wins the game!\n>> CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE COMPLETE RULEBOOK! <<\nOr, watch this How to Play video:\n \"After I played it, I wanted to play it again.\" - Mandy Tong\nThe game set up and ready to play.\n Some of the cards from the game...\nExamples of the 4 different card types.\nOne of the Wonder cards (front and back).\nAll pledge levels include all shipping costs!

Everyone else should back at the WORLDWIDE WAR level, except those wishing to pick the game up at the Spiel fair in Essen (green).\nWe expect Guns & Steel to complete production and shipment to backers by the end of November, 2015. This is to align with it being sold at the Essen Spiel in Germany. Thus far, Grail Games has - and is on track to - deliver all its past Kickstarter rewards early and we are confident we can deliver on time once again. We have production and fulfilment companies ready to make and deliver your game to your door!\nPlease note, because we will wish to ship Guns & Steel soon after the completion of this campaign, backers will need to complete a backer survey within a day or two after the end of this campaign.\nFor those able to make the Spiel Fair in Essen this year, pick-up is available by pledging your support at the appropriate level. You will be sent an update detailing all relevant information closer to the event, but know that your game(s) will be available to collect at:\nTaiwan Boardgame Design (TBD) booth - Hall 7 B101 B102\nThose attending should check out this Geeklist on BGG listing all the TBD titles available to pre-order and collect at Essen! * Please note that if you miss the fail for any reason, you will be asked to pay extra shipping costs in order to get your game(s) to you.\nIt is possible for SOUTHERN STEEL backers to increase their pledge amount to receive more than one copy of Guns & Steel. To do this, simply increase your pledge by $30 for each extra copy you would like.\nFor example, to receive two copies of the game at the SOUTHERN STEEL pledge level, simply increase your pledge to $60.

We've decided to announce our two next stretch goals:\nWe've reached $8000! Thanks everyone! Every backer gets 10% off of our next project! This may be a CatTube Famous expansion, a spin off (some have suggested DogTube Famous) or an entirely different game (which being honest will probably have cats)\nNote: Due to the nature of this reward you'll have to back our next project with the same account. This will only be available for the first week of the project (we'll give you plenty of notice) and will be available for tiers up to and including how much you've backed here (if you backed $100 you'll be eligible for the 10% discount tier priced at $90 or below) \nIf we reach $20000: We'll add an additional 18 cards to CatTube Famous! It's a big jump but we can't work out any cheaper target. We'll be adding an additional trend, lots of additional video cards and one or two additional rule cards with variant modes or bonus rules!\nNote: We'll be adding additional slots to get your cat into the game if we reach this goal. The price of these cats will be more expensive than the current options so no one is upset after buying something exclusive!\nCheck us out on social media:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nWebsite\nBoardGameGeek\nEach copy of the game comes with:\n2 double-sided rules cards\n40 unique video cards\n2 of each of the 15 different trend cards: angry, brave, clever, cool, cute, fat, happy, lazy, lively, naughty, sad, serious, silly, skittish and thin.\nThere is also the Catstarter Special Edition, available only through the $100 and $110 tiers. This is a dark edition pack with a high gloss box. The cards may also provide a raised effect, depending on our opinion of the implementation. \nThe Catstarter Special Edition contains the same number of cards as the standard edition with each of the cards having a darker style as shown below. *Note: Rules cards not shown\nThis will only be available throughout the Kickstarter, so be sure to back yours today!\nWe've also got the option to get your cat in the game! There are 2 options, either as a video card or as a single trend card that gets printed twice. \nThere are 35 video cards total, 25 available with the standard edition and 10 available only with the Kickstarter exclusive dark edition. There are 13 trend cards available only with a double pack.\nTo do this you send to us: \nOne or more pictures of your cat\nA small selection of trends that you cat fits or doesn't fit\nKey characteristics of your cat, be it physical or attitudes\nThe eye color you'd like your cat to have\nThe name to put on the card (we recommend your cat's name but it may be anything family friendly)\nUsing this information we will select a video card to draw your cat onto, immortalizing your cat into our game! If you'd like multiple cards or multiple cats on your card then contact us on kickstarter@cattubefamous.com and we'll try to accommodate you!\nAll tiers include worldwide shipping to your door! \n\nAdditionally, every backer gets to suggest a comment that might be included onto one of our video cards!\n\nPAWESOME OF YOU ($1 AUD or more)\nIt's pawesome that you've backed us!  \n\nSINGLE PACK ($35 AUD / $26 USD / \u20ac24 Euro)\nA single copy of the game.\n\nSINGLE PACK 'N' CAT ($50 AUD / $37 USD / \u20ac34 Euro)\nA single copy of the game and your cat on a video card.

Liam is a freelance artist who has worked on many projects throughout the creative industries.\nWith some previous experience working together on game jams we've come up with a long list of interesting projects and we've decided that CatTube Famous was awesome enough to share it with the world!\n The price of CatTube Famous may increase after the completion of the Kickstarter so get in quick!\nAny listed prices do not include local taxes other than US and Australian taxes. Taxes may be applicable on delivery and vary by location.\nIf you're local to Victoria, Australia then we're planning to have launch parties in both Geelong and Melbourne. Current venues are Guf Geelong and Games Laboratory Melbourne. We'll ask you if you'd rather this or delivery at the end of the Kickstarter.\nKickstarter allows a lower risk production of CatTube Famous. We\u2019re really passionate about getting it out there so having a successful Kickstarter gets the product to you and gives us an easier time when trying to get it into retail outlets.\nCatTube Famous was inspired by Gentleman Cat Fanciers being mentioned on The Comedy Button podcast. This lead to an idea of making a game about cat watching and eventually about releasing cat videos!\nFirst development started at the Global Game Jam 2015. After a few ideas were thrown around Josh decided to develop something, it turned out to be pretty fun so we kept developing it in the hopes to one day spread it with the rest of the world!\nProject Budget\nAfter the Kickstarter is funded the continued development of CatTube Famous is entirely art and marketing related. We\u2019ll be releasing new art pieces every couple of days, ranging from sketches to final art pieces as we draw your cats onto our cards.\nFinancially our upcoming expenses are only the development costs, shipping expenses and Kickstarter fees. We\u2019ve already invested some money into the project and will be continuing marketing efforts in the future that may impart additional fees, any additional profit we\u2019re making off of the Kickstarter is put towards alleviating these costs.\nWhen we reach certain stretch goals we\u2019ll do our best to give you great rewards, both as an initial product and to ensure that we\u2019re able to keep bringing you great products into the future.

The game supports 2\u20134 players and playing time is around 20 to 30 minutes.\nWe thank each backer for making Dale of Merchants a reality! Sign up for the newsletter on our website to keep up with our upcoming releases. \nDo you give up a chance to use a splendid action in favor of getting even more astounding cards? Since every card can be used in multiple ways, Dale of Merchants requires some tough choices. You can't win the game without letting go of your cards.\nThe goal of the game is to finish up your merchant stall before anyone else. The first player to do so, is awarded with the access to the legendary Guild of Extraordinary Traders.\nWith 6 different decks, the replayability of the game is extremely high. You get fresh gameplay by mixing various decks from game to game.\nThe project's funding goal is set so that we can produce the game with extremely high quality components, including heavy card stock with linen finish.\nThe stretch goals are mostly about cosmetic improvements to the game - it is complete and full without any of them. We include everything necessary right off the bat without stripping anything just to be added back in as a stretch goal.\nThe game is ready and heavily playtested. The artwork and graphic design for the game is about 95% done and ready for print. We will finalize everything during and after this campaign taking backer feedback into account. This will allow us to minimize delays and deliver the game to all the backers as reliably and fast as possible.\nRetailers interested in the game should contact us directly by a private message or by email (boardgames@snowdaledesign.fi).\n Read Mikko's full review on his GameBlog or BoardGameGeek!\nNow on Kickstarter Dale of Merchants, Dice Tower News\n\"If you are a fan of deck builders, are looking for an interesting twist on the deck building genre, I encourage you to check out Dale of Merchants on Kickstarter.\"\nKickstarter Update - 7/3/2015, Board Everyday\n\"Next up we have first time designer Sami Laasko \u2013 he shows that he can both design a game and make it look great with Dale of Merchants.\"\nTop 8 Kickstarter Campaigns and the Viral Triangle, The Meeple Mechanic\n\"Dale of Merchants has probably my favorite game art this week.\"\nDale of Merchants Deck-Building Game on Kickstarter, Tabletop Gaming News\n\"Snowdale Design is running a Kickstarter campaign for Dale of Merchants.

See pledge levels for full production print & play pdfs in both English and German. A link to the files will also be included in all levels with an actual game once the final files are ready. You can find instructions on printing the the files below.\nPrint with page scaling disabled. The PDFs are not sized to a specific paper size so it will work equally well for both US Letter and UK A4. If you are planning on printing double-sided, allow your pdf reader to center the page. If you want to make card backs, simply print 13 copies of the card back PDF as the animal deck file is 10 pages and the junk deck is 3. They all use the same card back image.\nThere's also a public link to the Google Docs version of the rules. It's there for you to make comments and give feedback. It's extremely handy as you can add a comment to a specific part of the rules and I'm able to answer to your ideas.\n  The right shipping cost is added automatically to your pledge based on your country. It's $5 to almost everywhere in the world.\nWe expect to fulfill all the rewards ourselves, from Finland. EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to non-EU backers will have 20 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 20.2 USD / 27.7 CAD / 29.1 AUD / 20.9 CHF / 2791.9 JPY, and should be under the threshold that triggers customs duties in most countries.\nIf everything goes as planned, you will get the game this year. The estimated delivery of the physical game is set to January 2016 to take account all possible delays. We prefer to deliver either early or on time rather than overpromise and be late by reasons out of our control.\nBring Dale of Merchants to reality. The game will only be printed with your support.\nMake the game better for everyone. All stretch goals will enhance the quality of the game. The more we fund, more we can upgrade.\nGet it first. All backers are our topmost priority. We will only print the required games for all our backers and extras based on demand. This is your surest way of getting the game.\nWe listen. Make a difference and affect the final product by providing constructive feedback during and after the campaign.\nThe game design, illustrations and graphic design are made by Sami Laakso.

My first full game of Hocus was played with my immediate family... parents, sister, biker guy... and it was a HUGE hit. I would have never suggested we play poker, but Hocus is so new and refreshing, no one wanted to stop playing.\" - Chevee Dodd, designer of Scallywags, Pull!, and tester for Hocus\nHocus is a card game for 2-5 players that plays in 30 minutes. The origin of the idea was: \"what would poker be like with spells?\" Hocus is about using your unique spells, carefully managing the cards in your hands, and scoring big when your opponents aren't watching.\nHocus is deeply interactive, as you must observe and react to the play of opponents, judge the pace of the round, and make the most of your limited turns. The game is extensively tested and has been in constant development for 18 months. It has simple mechanisms, but requires thoughtful strategy. It is a highly replayable mix of skillful play and luck.\n\"You may be skeptical of a game that\u2019s based around making poker hands, but Hocus is a great new take.\" - Matthew Gravelyn\nWhat's in the Box!?\nGet a copy of Hocus for $15 plus the cost of shipping. Shipping is free for backers in the US and subsidized for other destinations.\nPrototype cards\nThe game's components include:\n101 high-quality, linen-finish cards \n1 Rule Sheet \n1 two-piece box\nThere are 60 beautifully illustrated playing cards, 24 unique and colorful Spell cards, 5 Reference cards, 2 Jokers, and 10 Score Tracking cards, all with a high quality linen finish. \nThe Score Cards\nIn addition to all of these, to thank backers for making Hocus so successful, we're also including a wooden first player token with every copy of the game purchased. \nWooden first player token\nHow to Play the Game\n\"Played Hocus over lunch. Thinkier than I would have thought. Very cool.\" - Jonathan Schindler\nThe video above features Grant explaining how to play the Classic version of Hocus. This is the simplest place to start. The video below features Josh explaining the full version of Hocus, including Advanced Spells and Owls.\n\u201cIt has kinda a pokery beginning, but you can tell it has wandered very far away from Texas Hold \u2018Em as an overall idea.\u201d - Jonathan Cox of JonGetsGames\nThe game is played in rounds until at least one player earns enough points. At the start of each round, every player is dealt a number of cards. Each card has a Suit, a Strength, and a Point value.\nThe Owl Wizard cards also have special abilities. \nPrototype cards\nOn your turn, you choose a single spell to use. Every player has three common Basic Spells. \nThe first lets you play cards to the Community. All players share the cards in the Community. \nFor the second, you play cards to the Community's Pot. The total Point value of the cards in the Pot are the prize for winning the Community. \nFinally, players can build a personal Pocket of up to 2 cards. The player who can form the best poker hand by combining the Community with their Pocket wins all points in the Pot.\nThere's a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can have multiple Pockets. What emerges is a unique experience where having the best hand isn't enough. The best players are those who see opportunities with their hand of cards, build a set that's just good enough to win, and stuff the Pot full of Points. \nA sampling of Spells\nThere are also 8 Spell Books, each with 3 unique Spells that provide a different way to play and gain the upper hand over your opponents. With all of this, you have a rich and fascinating game that fits in your backpack and is perfect for a picnic, a lunch game, or as the opener to game night.\nRules and Print and Play\nWe want you to try the game for yourself!

The gameplay is tight, compelling, and packed with interesting decisions.\" - Mike Mullins, tester and co-designer of Bottom of the 9th\n\"The advanced spells really make this game for me. Each set is unique and offers a different approach to gameplay. You have to balance pulling off your own combos while keeping an eye on your opponents. The theme, artwork and spells turn a familiar game into a great game.\" - Brian Suhre, tester and designer of Paradox\n\"My wife is very selective in her gaming and not what I would call a \"gamer\" in any sense of the word. But here we have a card game that most people will understand the fundamentals of right off the bat with the use of poker. The community building and spells add enough complexity to scratch my gaming itch while still being accessible for her. And the community building gives us a nice mechanic for competition and tension. All together, these make this game a great choice for any gaming couple, especially where the tastes vary widely.\" - Matthew Tate, tester and devilish Carcassonne player\n\"A really fun game that was easy to carry, teach to folks quickly & went over well with a wide range of ages (8-55). I loved the theme. It was fun & added some great twists to a classic game!\" - Dave Gordon, tester\nWe have written extensively about the development of Hocus (previously Hocus Poker). You can read our articles here. \nAdd Ons\nFor each Add On, simply increase your Pledge by the amount indicated and we'll obtain the details from you at the end of the campaign via the survey.\nAdditional Copies: US backers may add additional copies for $13 apiece. You do not pay additional shipping! The game will likely MSRP for $18 (plus shipping if purchased online), so we think this is a great deal!\nCustom Box and Tokens: We love the work of Daft Concepts and consulted to see if they had ideas for adding a hand-crafted touch to Hocus. We're offering a box that holds all 99 cards (sleeved), the rules, and 45 custom wooden tokens for keeping score.\nTokens are approximately the size of Quarters\nAdd $30 to your Pledge for the Custom Box and Tokens. This is available for US backers only.\nIf you have questions about any of the Add Ons, do not hesitate to Contact Me!\nWhy Back Now?\n\"Hocus combines all the strategy of Poker with a fantasy flair. The spells aspect really opens up an entirely new level of strategy. The artwork is awesome! I will definitely be backing Hocus.\" - Eric Batchelder, tester\nHocus has been tested hundreds of times locally and with over a dozen blind test groups in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It's been at multiple UnPubs/Protospiel events, BGG Con, and more.\nWe're positive this is a great game and a wonderful value for our backers. Here is why you should back now instead of waiting.\nGrant and Josh testing\nDiscount: We're giving Kickstarter backers a discount off MSRP. We know you're taking a risk with us. Therefore, we want to give you a great deal.\nMoney Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Hocus within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it and receive a full pledge refund, which includes shipping. Try the game at least twice to learn it and see the fun. If it's not for you, send it back.\nGet it First: Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of Hocus before others. \nYou're helping us get our start. We need to know if Hocus is viable. Furthermore, in order to prove ourselves and get into distribution and onto retail shelves, we need to demonstrate there is demand. You can be instrumental in that. \nWhat Things Cost\nPublishing a card game, even one as simple as Hocus, is expensive. Below is a chart that breaks down our costs, approximately, against the notion of just hitting our funding level.  \nGaining additional backers and selling additional copies helps us further offset our fixed costs, like manufacturing and art, and greatly increases our chances of getting into distribution. That is where we hope to earn additional revenue to make this entire project viable in the long run.\nAbout the Team\nJoshua Buergel is a 20 year veteran of software development based in Seattle, Washington.

To eliminate all delays within our control, all art, graphic design, and file preparation will be finished before the conclusion of this campaign. We're 90% there already! Hocus will be ready to go to the printer the day this campaign ends. \n\nManufacturing Partner: To ensure the highest quality product and to aid us in our efforts as new publishers, we're working with Panda Manufacturing. Panda is known for remarkable quality and project management. We have been preparing Hocus with them for a year now, and they have been phenomenal partners.\n\nReserve Funds: Unexpected costs can and will arise. We specifically chose Hocus as our first project because it is a small, low cost, low risk product that is fun! We have set aside more than ample funds to cover any unexpected costs.\n\nNo Stretch Goals: We've been watching and supporting Kickstarters for years. One common cause for many problems and delays are Stretch Goals. By skipping Stretch Goals, we can stabilize our costs, better manage delays, and maintain focus on making our initial offering the best offering. The cards have a high quality linen finish, we support 5 players, there are 8 different Spell Books, and a rule sheet. We could have made them Stretch Goals, but we decided to make them the default offering.\n\nShipping: To ensure the game arrives safely from China, we're sparing no expense to utilize the simplest method of shipping. Fewer hand offs means fewer opportunities for mistakes.\n\nFinally, we will act transparently and thoughtfully. If we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it as quickly as possible.

It might have just been the way I read it but it seemed like that wasn't the easiest way to describe to someone how to play.

We designed the items and monsters for both dungeons to play nice with each other - mix and match cards from the two to design your own dungeons!\nBack this campaign and receive a unique Kickstarter promo card per deck and save $1 off the retail price! Pledge for both decks and get another $1 off and save on shipping!\nSmall Footprint - Ever want to play a deck-builder but not have to lug around a giant box? 100 Swords is the same size as a traditional poker deck, both in terms of card count and box size. Those 54 cards include everything you need to play - 18 starter cards, 3 rentals, and 33 cards in the dungeon (including items, monsters, and its infamous boss).\nEasy to Learn - There are only 2 types of cards in 100 Swords; items and monsters. Learning the game only takes minutes, and once you know it, teaching it takes half as long. The rules of the game are a straight foward take on classic deck-builders with some interesting quirks thrown in that mix the genre up in new and interesting ways.\nTactical Gameplay - Each turn in 100 Swords is a puzzle where you do your best to use every card as optimally as possible. You'll have to use every bit of info you have to not waste any resources and play the best possible turn, every turn.\nHidden Information - When you first step into the dungeon, every card you'll be interacting with will be face-down. As the game progresses, cards will change from hidden to revealed and back again. As the dungeon shifts from players defeating monsters and acquiring items, you'll be wracking your brain to remember if that card you're moving to is that awesome sword, or a powerful monster.\n\"Having to literally explore the marketplace of cards....gives you a surprising amount to think about!.... Incredibly thematic.\"\nRichard Ham - Rhado Runs Through\n\"The art, humor, and game play in 100 Swords comes together to form a delightful dungeon delve. Elements like item rental and using your equipment as energy are clever and the deck building makes me feel like I'm improving my bag of tricks to tackle the dungeon. I recommend this for anyone looking for a light hearted deck builder that plays quickly.\"\nSuzanne - Dice Tower Contributor\n\"I think this would be an excellent game to teach somebody the ropes of how to play a deck building game.... A whole lot of puzzle solving greatness in one tiny box!.... The possibilities of expansions are literally limitless.\"\nUndead Viking\n\"....A great gateway game to deckbuilding. Very few deckbuilders have an ability to be simple, but offer challenging choices and situations and I think 100 Swords does that very well.... My 10 year old loved saying \"I'm using this crappy sword\" which was pretty funny.\" \nTox - Crits Happen\n\"100 Swords is a great balance between luck and light strategy. I love when a turn comes together and you get more equipment room after room. Of course, finding a big baddie and taking him down or sneaking by him and getting more stuff is fun too, as long as my opponent isn't able to get by the monster!\"\nKen - Geek-craft.com\nCheck out the full Across the Board Games preview here!\n\"100 Swords is a satisfying and fun romp through a dungeon without the tediousness of a classic dungeon crawl.\"\nAcross the Board Games\nCurious how the game works? Check out our video below! You can also download the rules here.\nEach turn, you'll be playing cards to move into, and interact with the dungeon. A lot can happen on a given turn, maybe you'll find some cool items? Or maybe you'll run into some tough monsters?\nWhen you play cards for movement, you can move up to that many rooms deeper into the dungeon. But when you play a card for movement, strength, or energy, any unspent points are zeroed out, so it's important to move, acquire and attack efficiently!\nYou'll also be using the cards in your hand to defeat those monsters, and acquire items. Acquired items will end up in your deck, which in turn will make you more powerful and more able to defeat stronger monsters! Many items also have effects that are important to consider.\nDeciding when and how to use the cards in your hand and which cards in the dungeon to acquire or defeat is the key to winning 100 Swords!\nWhen the dungeon deck has too few cards to refresh the dungeon, or when you defeat the boss, the game is over! And remember, it's all about the gold! At the end of the game the player whose cards are worth the most gold wins!\nCheck out this walkthrough to see the game in action:\nRichard Ham of Rhado Runs Through is awesome and put together this great gameplay runthrough below! Be sure to check it out!\nClick here for Rhado's extended play video.\nHave you translated the rules? Message us and let us know! \nCurious about a Spanish or Italian version?

They're only $6 each, and we designed our Dungeon Builder Sets to be used in two ways:\nThe first is easy, choose your favorite dungeon, slap on the Dungeon Builder Set's items and monsters, choose which boss you want to play with, and get to it! Now your dungeon is longer, and has new cards that change up gameplay. Adding a Dungeon Builder Set to a dungeon will lengthen playtime up to 10 minutes. If you have both decks and both sets, you have a lot of variants to play with!\nThe second way you can use a Dungeon Builder Set is to make your own dungeon from scratch! Take cards from the two dungeons and the two sets, construct your own dungeon dive, and compete with friends!\nIn this Kickstarter, we're giving you the Dungeon Builder Sets for two dollars off retail price, and we think they're a great value! Be sure to check out the Deck and Set Card Lists to see what each set comes with!\nWe\u2019ve got this awesome new premium playmat available as an add-on. We produced multiple playmats for our campaign for Shift, and we were super happy with their quality! They have a smooth polyester surface with a rubber base to prevent slippage. You do a lot of card sliding in this game, so we\u2019re pretty stoked for this one! : D It\u2019s $18 through this campaign ($20 post campaign). It\u2019s been added to the Pledge Calculator for all reward tiers. Both players use the same mat, so you'll only need one!\nIf you back at any tier that includes the game, you'll be receiving this awesome 100 Swords sticker for free! It's designed to fit on the standard and 100+ Ultra PRO deck boxes for all of your storage needs. If you want more than one sticker, add $1 to your pledge for each extra!\nThe Darkness Dungeon Builder Set has been unlocked! That\u2019s a brand new final 15 card set! With everything unlocked there a now 120 cards that can be used to build dungeons with. Pretty neat! : D We also unlocked the P&P for the Blue Mammoth's Dungeon! Click here to check it out!\nWe're estimating a November delivery. Why so quick? We've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for Shift, Province, and Shadow of the Elder Gods. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy-fast turnaround times! No waiting on slow trans-pacific cargo ships.\nWe're using Customs-Friendly Worldwide\u2122 by Ship Naked. This is the same method that Gamelyn Games used for their Tiny Epic series which has shipped thousands of copies of Tiny Epic Kingdoms and Tiny Epic Defenders to international backers without incident. This is the same method that White Wizard Games (the makers of Star Realms) is using for the Epic Card Game. As a result, you should not get hit with customs, brokerage, or import fees. Customs-Friendly Worldwide from Ship Naked is Worry-Free Shipping\u2122. That means that if you do have any issues or costs associated with customs, brokerage, or other fees of importing, you'll simply email Help@ShipNaked.com and they will coordinate reimbursement for you directly.\nWant multiple decks? How about add-ons?\nWe've made some tiers for those who want all the things:\nWant something different? It became clear pretty quickly that we needed a tool to help you figure out how much to pledge once we started including add-on\u2019s. Use this new handy-dandy Pledge Calculator to determine how much you should pledge based on what you'd like to receive.\nClick me to calculate your pledge with Magic Computer!\nFirst, select your tier, then choose how many of each add-on you\u2019d like to include.

Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle! It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted a microgame called Province, which has sold nearly 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nThe following Fall, we brought our micro ameritrash game, Shadow of the Elder Gods, to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things. Shadow of the Elder Gods is a big game in a small box, and it's now in stores thanks to backers like you!\nWith your help, we'll be bringing 100 Swords to you this fall!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our fourth time working with our manufacturing partner. If there are drastic manufacturing issues, there will be problems delivering the rewards. However, by choosing a printer in the US, we have the additional benefit of easier accountability if the product fails to meet our expectations. We've handled the manufacturing of over 14,000 games with our previous projects, and we've learned from that experience.\n\nEvery project introduces new challenges. If you look at our updates for Shadows of the Elder Gods, Province, and Shift, you will see that we try to balance update spam with important news.

You could put the door that needs the key in the high level deck and the key in the low level deck. It would be great if we could mix in 1 key per player, making it a rush to the keys. The door could be mixed into the first 10 cards to ensure it comes up quickly, but allow a gamble if someone wants to loot the early bits of that dungeon. When a key unlocks the door, it puts the door at the 0 spot reminding players that they need the key in hand to enter the dungeon. Maybe make it so once you draw your key, it stays out, but after collecting it you need to draw it once to use it. This would add enough content for 4 players with a nice layered goal system. You could even house rule so that the blue mammoth is in the first dungeon at the end and the red dragon (with extra HP and worth more) is at the end of the second dungeon.

These cards can be interchanged with other command sets or simply added to the base game for a larger experience.\n>>>> Click here to read the full rules of the new 101.1 cards. <<<<\nIn summary, these cards are:\nEND & CONT: (4 cards) Playing an END card disallows players from playing future cards to a program row! Playing CONT re-opens a locked row!\nGOSUB: (4 cards) A card alongside a GOSUB command can be moved to any row with at least three cards in it by the active player!\nGET: (2 cards) Playing your GET card allows you to take and flip a card from your opponent's hand, adding it to yours!\n60: (1x 60 card, 1x control card) Now you can extend the length of your program and put even more points up for grabs!\nThe expansion pack also includes:\n2x player aid cards\nWe expect 101.1 to complete production and shipment to backers by the end of December, 2015. We delivered our first Kickstarter campaign (One Zero One) one month early to backers and we are confident we can deliver on time once again.\nPlease take note, however, that backers who select a pledge level that includes games other than 101.1 will be receiving those extra games earlier...\nOne Zero One and Too Many Cinderellas will be shipped within a week of the end of this campaign.\nMatcha will be shipped once it has completed production (by the end of July).\nThis means backers will need to complete a backer survey within a day or two of the end of this campaign.\nEveryone will be shipped 101.1 at the same time once it completes production \u2013 whether you pledged for other games as well or not.\nShould we reach this level of funding we will be able to add two more cards to 101.1!\nNEXT: After playing a NEXT card, your opponent must play their next card to the program display alongside the card you just played!\nReaching this level of support will enable us to add one extra card to 101.1... The Computer!\nThis card serves to run the CPU of the game. That's right! This stretch goal will allow players to play One Zero One solo! (See update #4 for more details.)\n... More stretch goals may be announced as the campaign progresses!\n>>>> For an extra $4 per copy, backers may add any number of extra copies of 101.1 to any pledge level.\n>>>> For an extra $15 per copy, backers may add any number of extra copies of the base game One Zero One to any pledge level.\nTo do this, simply increase your pledge level by the desired amount. Don\u2019t worry that your pledge does not detail the number of copies of 101.1 or One Zero One that you have pledged for, we will organise the specifics via the backer survey at the end of the campaign.\nOne Zero One is a fast-playing but highly tactical card game for two players, set in the world of 1980s computing.\nWith identical 16-card decks, each player (as either 0 or 1) plays cards to the program display, endeavouring to gain control of lines of program code. Each line is worth a set number of points. As soon as the program runs, points are tallied and the winner is determined!\nIn One Zero One, players will choose to represent either 0 or 1. Each player will then receive identical 16-card decks. Six of their cards simply denote 0 and 1 on either side. Ten cards display a command to follow that will change the current game state.\nEach turn, players will play one card from their hand to the program display. When a player's digit is the most common in a row, they are said to be in control of that line. Each line of the program is worth a set number of points. When the program display is filled, the game will end and these points will be awarded. The player with the highest points total wins.\nIn the world of computer programming there can only be one winner - either 0s or 1s!\nNumber of players: 2\nPlay time: 10 minutes\nSuggested player age: 8 and up\nDesigner: David Harding (designer of Elevenses & Elevenses for One)\n>>>> Click here to download the full rules of One Zero One. <<<<\n>>>> Rahdo runs through...

This can happen at the point of manufacture or during shipment. Grail Games has given a six-month time-frame for delivery of 101.1 which we feel is substantial for a production of this size.

But we want to cram even more mythic fun and monstrous mayhem into the box free for our backers. With your help we will are bringing a completely play tested mini expansion for Monstrous to life.\nThe Legendary Monstrous expansion introduces a special location, Tartarus, played as the central location when you want a power game with more mayhem and chaos that lasts a little longer. If you know your Greek mythology, you know Tartarus is where the most fearsome foes were imprisoned by Zeus after their defeat.\nThe expansion comes with 8 legendary monsters that you draw into when you hit Tartarus. These are unruly neutral monsters of great power. You only exert temporary control over them as you hurl them down to wreak havoc on the mortals and monsters. Included are;  \nCerberus  \nTyphon  \nthe Minotaur  \nMedusa  \nChimera  \nErinyes  \nChiron  \nThe Kraken\nThe Kraken is as you would expect, a special event of colossal gaming proportions. It comes with 10 board clearing tentacles that all players throw first to wipe out most of the monsters on the table before the Kraken itself is thrown.\nHere's a taste of the power of the Kraken:\n\"When you have the Kraken, everybody gets 2 tentacles and they shout \u201cRELEASE THE KRAKEN!\u201d and then you throw all of them and whatever you hit gets discarded. THAT\u2019S INSANITY and I just love it.\"\nTom - Forensic Gameology\nWatch the reviews below or in the updates to find out just how much epic fun Legendary Monstrous adds.\nKickstarter exclusive expansion UNLOCKED!  \nYou have unlocked the Legendary Monstrous Expansion done in Greek Dark Ages mode.

It also includes the full 9 card Kraken (see below).\nWe will fill these legendary monsters in as we complete pieces and get closer to funding, so check back here often to watch these incredible pieces escape Tartarus onto your game table. \nPlease help us complete this stunning art to make Monstrous an unforgettable gaming experience.\nIt also features an incredible 9 card Kraken that when combined makes a truly colossal spectacle.  \nOne side will feature Kraken and tentacle powers.

We need your help to make it real. Spread the word!\nMONSTROUS is designed for broad appeal and a low barrier to entry. And to be a quick fun dexterity game that offers interesting tactical choices about what to throw where.   \nKids and casual gamers love the mythic art and theme, how quick the game is to learn and play, and the hit and miss mechanics. Seasoned gamers love all that and the many cunning tactical combinations to be explored as the game unfolds. And they can happily play together!\nMonstrous has been rigorously play tested and honed for over a year, and we have plans for making it even more monstrous with your help.\nMore features: \nEasy to learn and teach  \nEvery game is different - maraud across any 5 out of 11 locations with a different subset of your monsters every game.  \nUse easy, medium and complex location scenarios or make up your own.  \nTeam play mode for 4, 6 or 8 players.  \nYoung gods mode.  \nCampaign mode for an epic play through.\n    'It's just flat out fun.

It's tried and tested and we've combined other shipping goodness to make a monstrous shipping bundle that gets Monstrous to you fast, wherever you are:\n1. Free Global Shipping - one low shipping price bundled into the base pledge for every mortal on earth.\n2. Lightning fast delivery - Monstrous will arrive via airmail within 6 weeks of final production - 1 month earlier than typical kickstarter fulfillment and 2 months earlier than it will hit stores via regular distribution.\n3. MONSTROUS: FIRST WAVE SHIPPING for the first 750 backers - back MONSTROUS early, and we'll send you MONSTROUS a few days early.\n4. VAT Free* - MONSTROUS'  value is under EU \u20ac22 / GBP \u00a315 / CAD $20 so it is exempt from VAT / HST in most countries.  \n* Backers in France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Romania have low or no VAT free thresholds do please select the EU friendly shipping reward tier.\n5. EU FRIENDLY MONSTROUS option - Backers in France, Sweden, Denmark, Greece and Romania, should choose the EU FRIENDLY MONSTROUS pledge tier. This is because there is no VAT threshold or it's too low for Monstrous in those countries. So we will ship the game to you from our fulfillment warehouse in Germany. Monstrous will be under the VAT threshold of other countries (see above) so is still generally exempt from VAT - you can safely use the MONSTROUS: FIRST WAVE SHIPPING or MONSTROUS reward tiers. However anyone that fears being charged VAT + handling in their country can choose this EU friendly reward instead to remove any chance of being charged VAT or handling.\nNote: This method involves additional sea shipping costs, and slightly higher postage charges, and us paying VAT charges. It is a little more expensive and takes longer to ship EU Friendly. \nSee FAQs below for full shipping detail.\nBecause art.\nWe want MONSTROUS to pick you up and drop you into a mythic and evocative game experience. To make you feel like wrathful gods with terrifying monsters at your command, bursting from cards in hand, ready to hurl down at those mortals in their cities seen through spectacular god\u2019s eye vistas, and brawl with rival gods' monsters along the way.\nA successful Kickstarter enables us to afford top-tier, mythic art and graphic design that brings this incredible mythology to life, while still keeping the price low enough to get MONSTROUS into as many hands as possible. Our artists shared the vision and we are blown away by their astonishing and evocative work in bringing this mythology to life. \nAnd you backers are literally enabling this vision of mythic Greece. Thank you! \nOur Kickstarter approach \nWe want to keep things simple and focused on providing the best quality game in the core. You get a deluxe game experience, even if we only just fund. \nWe promise:\nquality games\nquality production\nlow risk yet epic stretch goals\nlevel global prices as far as possible\nfast production and delivery (4 months)\nGood Games is Australia's largest chain of game stores, and Australia's largest hobby game distributor.

We started small and built up - but always with a focus on a quality experience. We are approaching game publishing the same way.\n\nWe have designed the Monstrous project to minimize the logistical risks that affect so many projects.\n\nPRODUCTION\nWe printed 60 production quality preview copies of MONSTROUS to send to reviewers and sort out many of the issues you normally experience during full production. We tested proof prints, ironed out print issues, tested the extra thick 350gsm card stock with linen finish worked well when thrown, had dies made to cut components, and sorted out quality control issues. \n\nUnlike many game manufacturers, our printers are able to complete this print run within about 6 weeks of getting started. Some printers can take 5 or 6 months to print, adding to delays and your frustration.\n\nWe have added on 1 month to our production schedule for slippages or delays.\n\nWe have a printer with competitive rates at high volumes as a backup just in case.\n\nART\n100% of the core game art is complete. Half of the legendary monster art is too. The final art will be completed as the kickstarter campaign concludes.\n\nRULES\nDraft Lightning Start rules are available now under the gameplay section.\n\nFull draft rules have been made available there too for your feedback during the campaign. These will be prepared for production at the tail end of the campaign.\n\nSHIPPING\nWe are airmailing our games worldwide from a well established discount fulfillment service in China. They have capacity to handle hundreds of pack and pick orders per day. Along with other game developers that have used them with great success, we have tested them with our preview sends and are happy with their service. \n\nYour games will take between 1 and 4 weeks to arrive averaging around 2. This is 4 - 8 weeks faster than sending them by boat then post.\n\nWe will not have complex logistics to worry about. We are keeping project Monstrous as simple as possible to get it onto your table as fast as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Wrap up, shipping, Gencon demoers & swag, Unfair Kickstarter, Big news and Release the Kraken!", "update_content": "It\u2019s a wrap!

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nWe are very excited to once again be working with Rikki Tahta of La Mame Games on our next new game, Melee.  Melee was released at Essen 2014 in a very limited print run with very basic art work - we are exciting to be teaming with Ferti and the very talented illustrator Na\u00efade to make this game as beautiful to look at as it is fun to play!\nTHE TIME OF THE CONQUEST HAS COME!\nThe King has died childless and the land has had its last days of peace and prosperity. Now the power hungry nobles each see their opportunity to seize the throne and launch a war without mercy to assert their own rights. Only force of arms, and the gold to pay for it, matters. Who shall succeed to grab the throne in the chaos that ensues?\nWhat is Melee?\nWatch this short video that features game designer Rikki Tahta introducing this great game.  Note this video features both the new and first edition art, please see the images on this page to see how we've made this game look as good as it plays!\nMelee is a 20 minute \"war game\" for 2-4 players that is nasty, brutish and short!  You want to be the first person to capture an opposing castle (at which point the game ends immediately) or to have the most land and gold at the end of the year.\nMoney is tight, and gold is used in the game both to build new units and to attack. The more gold you have and spend on your troops, the more motivated they will be and the higher your probability of success.  Each player starts the game with a Castle, one unit of foot soldiers, and 15 gold coins. The game begins with a drafting session in which you purchase units (soldiers, knights, camps and catapults) and bid on special abilities that will enhance your income, attack, or other options in the game.\nThe game is then played over four turns (seasons), and in each turn players simultaneously choose one of three potential actions: (a) tax, (b) build new units, or (c) move and attack. Each turn ends with players collecting income.\nTo attack, you move your unit into an occupied area, then secretly decide how much gold you will spend to motivate your troops. The defender then has to guess how much you have spent. If the defender guesses wrong, the attack succeeds; if the defender is correct, the attack fails and you lose your unit. Regardless of success you have spent your gold, so the tight trade-off that players have to assess is whether to be cheap with your men so that you can conserve gold for future builds and attacks, or be generous to increase your chances now but limit future options.\nThe different abilities available in each game make for varied strategies and strong replayability as no two games are alike. After the initial strategic planning stage, Melee is fast and highly interactive. Beware as the game can end suddenly with a bold attack on an inadequately defended castle, making for a game that can be very nasty, brutish and short.\nThe rules to the first edition can be found by CLICKING HERE.  The revised rules will be posted shortly.\nIs it a great game?\nYes, yes it is!  Once again Rikki has made a fast playing, streamlined masterpiece.  If you like the \"dudes on a map\" genre of games, like variable player powers and direct conflict wrapped into a tight, 20 minute package - then you will love Melee.  But don't take our word for it, here are reviews posted from those that got the 1st edition at Essen last year:\nKarl Fast's written review - Melee: a war of all against all\nUndead Viking video review (Noisy background, sorry)\nBoard Game Brawl video review (we are totally redoing the art!)\nJosh Brodie's written review - Melee: or how I only bought 1 game at Essen\nA very special price for ONR & G54 Backers!\nMelee is a great game, but maybe you want to wait for more reviews. We want as many people as we can find to play this great game, and get their friends to like (and buy their own copy!) So if you are getting a reward from our recent One Night Resistance and/or Coup: Rebellion project(s), then we can add Melee to your rewards at a very special price.   A great game at a fantastic price is good deal for everyone.\nDidn\u2019t back ONR or G54? Melee is still a great game at the $25 (and above) reward leves, and you can add extra copies at the same low discounted price as other backers.   You also may be able to add ONR & G54 to your rewards for this project - see below for details.\nPromos & Stretch Rewards?\nYes & No.  We are including a special promo pack of extra \"Special Action Cards\" for backers (yes, in every copy you pledge for!) - these will increase the number of options that are available to players in each game and think you'll really like them!\nBut there won't be any additional rewards added - time is short and all the print files have already been submitted to the printers!  We want to get your rewards to you as soon as possible and are giving you a great price - so that means we can't/won't/aren't going to add anything else ;)  You'll get a great game, and we hope that is enough to get your support for this project.\nThank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table and get you all the promo items that you want!\nTravis\nIndie Boards and Cards\nADD- ONS\nThere will be a limited number of copies of One Night Revolution Kickstarter Edition and Coup:Rebellion G54 Kickstarter Edition available via the backer manager for those that missed those projects.  Those will be available at the single copy price to Melee backers at the $25 (and above) reward levels.  Note: adding the ONR & G54 kickstarter editions this way will end up being more expensive in total than it would have been if you pledged to those projects - backers of those projects are not paying more!!!!\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Melee. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via a backer manager. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in September).\nPLEASE READ THE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTES BELOW IF YOUR ADDRESS IS OUTSIDE THE US & CANADA.\nAll of the games that we offer in the add-on program are available right now at your local game store:\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion)\nThe Resistance (New Edition)\nThe Resistance: Hidden Agenda (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Hostile Intent (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\n Snowdonia\nHaggis\nDragon Slayer\nRoar-a-Saurus\nGENCON/ESSEN\nIt is unlikely that Melee will be available at GenCon, but it may happen.  We do plan to have Melee ready in time for Essen. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. If you want GenCon or Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our GenCon email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzSlX or sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pick up (note we can not handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). All the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to GenCon/Essen - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nUnfortunately international shipping is costly, takes time and is open to a number of potential issues and delays. While we try to use shipping service providers that are both effective and cost efficient, we are not in the shipping business and must rely upon outside providers and postal services to get games to you. After several years of using a more complex series of international shipping locations, we have had to make some hard decisions that affect international shipping - especially to the EU. As always we plan to have this game at Essen (see above for details, so that might be a better option for those in the EU.\nInternational shipping will be made from the US, Canada and/or the UK - we will post the declared value of the games less shipping, handling and administration fees in an attempt to reduce or remove any fees, tariffs or other costs, but take no responsibility for any taxes, tariffs, fees or other charges that are made by your governments, postal service or other agencies.\nEU Friendly shipping to the UK is included in the international shipping pledges.  EU Friendly shipping is available to EU backers outside of the UK for an additional, one-time charge of $7. For example if you backed the ONR, G54 and this project, you will only pay $7 once and all items will be sent from the UK (EU Friendly) in one package.\nThe international shipping service we use does not have tracking information - if you want to have end to end tracking information, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder. They will be able to provide end to end tracking, but be warned such a shipping service is very expensive ($150+).\nWhile average shipping times are 2-3 weeks for most international destinations - you must plan for up to 6 months for items to arrive. That means you'll need an address that remains valid for an extended period of time to ensure that items arrive. If you desire faster shipping method or aren't confident that you will have a stable shipping address, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder that offers a faster (and significantly more expensive service) or ability to hold packages and send when you request.\nCombined vs Individual Shipping\nNote: Now that we added EU Friendly options, this is not relevant for those that opt in for EU friendly shipping.\nIf you selected combined shipping level for ONR and/or G54, then you may take advantage of the $21 \"add-on\" reward level.  All your rewards for those projects will be sent in one package.\nIf you selected individual shipping for ONR and/or G54, and you want Melee to be sent individually - then you should pledge at the $35 level.  You may, if you wish, take advantage of the $21 \"add-on\" reward level - but doing so will make it so all your rewards for those projects will be sent in one package (that is OK if opt for EU friendly shipping or get for no cost to the UK).  Backers in countries with low import threshold outside of the EU (Norway for example) may still want to have items sent individually.\nInternational Shipping Service\nWhile we have found these services to be suitable for 99% of our past backers, but for customer service reasons there are a number of countries that we are no longer shipping rewards.\nCountries that we will ship to are: Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cayman Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Reunion, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\nPlease ensure that your shipping location is on our list of countries that we provide service to, those countries that are excluded from this offer have the ability to use one of many parcel freight forwarders that will take delivery in the US and send to you via the shipping method that works best for your final destination. Specific Countries that we have had significant customer service issues with, and will no longer be able to provide service directly include: Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay. Please understand that I have no negative feelings to people that live in these countries, however I am unable to provide you directly with the quality service that you deserve at a reasonable price. As an alternative you can always use the services of a parcel freight forwarder that will provide you with a US address and work with you to bring rewards into your country.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nFirst \u2013 while I am very optimistic about Melee and want to do a special batch of promo items for this game - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\n What are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games (The Resistance, Haggis and Triumvirate), all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In the following years we have released many more games and expansions to our best selling Resistance, Coup and Flash Point series. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards recently completed kickstarter projects for One Night Resistance and Coup:Rebellion G54. Those projects are scheduled to be delivered in September of 2015. We have a track record of delivering multiple projects in a timely manner and do not foresee any issues with doing so again.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra promo items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nProduction variability - While efforts are made to ensure that all versions of games are compatible with previous versions and expansions, there is no practical way to ensure that this happens. Variations in the production process can result in differences in colors, textures and materials between print editions and occasionally within a single print run. Some variation should be expected that may necessitate that measures such as using card sleeves be used to hide these minor production variations.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "International Shipping", "update_content": "This message is for backers outside of US/UK/Canada, and also does not apply for those in EU that elected EU friendly shipping.

It packs deep gameplay with all the things you would expect from a Carl Chudyk game into a small package. Our goal was to create a very satisfying and short game. Something you can play dozens of times, with different results and experiences on every occasion! \nEach player is a worker in a Buddhist temple, creating works to display and sell to the visitors and tourists who come by. These works are made of materials of varying value -- determining both the difficulty to complete the work and its worth to you. Completed works can be displayed in your Gallery to train your helpers, or in your Gift Shop to allow you to make sales. In the end, the winner will be the player with the most valuable completed works, sales, and backorders. \nThe gameplay is similar to Glory to Rome, but has new innovations. For a more detailed overview of the game, we will be running livestream demos with open chats on YouTube. \n[May 20 (Rules Explanation + Demo)]\n[May 28, 4:30 PM EST (Sample games + Strategy)]\nYou can also read the rulebook: [PDF]\nAnd if you want, you can download a free print + play version of the game and try it out yourself! [PDF]\nSome folks have made tutorials of their own for Mottainai, from the beta. A couple of the names for things have changed, but the game is 99% the same:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGkrzV9w4w by 3Cubed.\nThere are two versions of Mottainai available. Mottainai Mini, which contains everything you need for a 2-3 player game, or Mottainai Deluxe, which comes in a larger box with a second deck allowing you to play with 4-5 (or two side by side) 2-3 player games. \nYou'll notice that we've provided a free PDF download of the entire game, and many of you have participated in the open beta test that's been going on for the past couple months. We think Mottainai is an awesome game, and that the best way to make it the best game it can be is to have it be played a lot, both ourselves and in the wild. Feedback from everyone has helped us fine tune the cards, and we're really happy with the process. Open beta testing of tabletop games is something we're committed to, we think it's a good concept.\nGen Con 2015\nThis year at Gen Con we will again be running our event room, the Department of Fun. We're running lots of Mottainai demos, and other fun events, and you can check them out on our Department of Fun page. We're looking for more volunteers to help out, and we do have downtown hotel rooms...\nIf you'd like to pick up your game at Gen Con, pledge $20 per Deluxe, and $12 per mini and select the $1 GenCon pickup pledge level.\nAdd-ons and Additional Games\nIf you'd like to add on extra games, either Mottainai or other Asmadi Games products (and save on combined shipping!) we'll be offering that option in July when it's time to deliver. When your shipping survey comes out, there'll be a link to a special version of our web store where you can purchase games with reduced shipping as add-ons. This way you can get whatever you want, and we don't need to make 100 different custom backer levels :)\nPlease note: it will take us an extra week or two to get through processing all of the add-on orders. We do the simple ones first, because they're easy to put on an assembly line that way.\nJinro: The Next Wind Master\nDo you like free games? I think you do! We made a fun little iOS arcade style game, and you can get it for free on the app store:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jinro-the-next-wind-master/id919720300?mt=8\nThe Tapestry card in Mottainai depicts Jinro in all his legendary glory.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, we have the risk of issues during production, and delays due to trucks driving west instead of east, or any other number of weird unforeseen things!\n\nTo minimize these risks, we are printing Mottainai within the USA, with Delano/EPI in Michigan. They're awesome, and we're confident that they can make the game without much trouble.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nClick to read important announcement regarding EU shipping.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited about our collaboration with Rikki Tahta and La Mame Games as we announce the first game set in The Dystopian Universe - Coup: Rebellion G54!\nG54 is the exciting sequel to Rikki's award winning game, Coup. G54 is completely stand alone - Coup is not required to play nor do the two games work together.  To celebrate the successes that Coup has had and the bright future we anticipate for G54, we are very excited to launch a special, Kickstarter edition of G54 with many promo items and planned \"You are Awesome awards\" that won't be found in the retail version.\nG54 uses the same lightning fast rules found in Coup - claim, counter, challenge and bluff - and then adds an exciting strategic layer via character selection.  Before each game starts, five character roles are chosen randomly from 25 different cards. Each of the five characters has a unique ability - the combination of abilities and interplay between them makes each game unique.  There are over 5,000 different ways to play!\nFor more details on game play, please see this video of Rikki explaining the La Mame Edition at Essen Spiel 2014.  Note - this is the older art and box/storage, not what you will get by backing this kickstarter.\nThese written reviews are also available on reddit & boardgamegeek:\nThe most comprehensive review yet!\nA Big Fat Juicy Review for a Big Fat Juice Game\nCoup 2.0\nSpeaking of storage - we've put a lot of thought into how to best handle the randomized set-up of G54.  We are designing the game box to have tray that is customizable and works with both \"natural\" and sleeved cards.  We have also included dividers to make organization easy - reducing set up and clean up between rounds.  Each of the 25 roles has 3 playing cards, a randomizer/rule card and a divider sized to fit in the uniquely designed insert:\nPromos\nAs a special reward for our early adopters, all the games sent as rewards to backers of this project will be the Kickstarter edition and include promo items that won't be included in the retail version of G54.\nFoil coins - these have been a very popular promo item in the past, and we are very excited to include both silver (value 1) and gold (value 3) foil coins in the Kickstarter Edition of G54.  We hope you like these coins and the new design for the currency of our dark, dystopian future.\nA full set (25) of extra player cards - enough to play up to 8 players, or spares in case you ever damage one.  While we don't always recommend Coup with more players, it can be fun some times to indulge in a massive game of treachery and deceit!\nTo thank you for helping spread the word about this project and your support in the past, I excited to announce that our first \"You are Awesome Reward\" is an Alternative Art/Role promo for Coup. The Jester can be used as a substitute for the Ambassador and has the \"Disorder\" ability of taking a card from the Court Deck and a card from another player, then returning a card to the Court Deck and a card to the other player. It is a very fun card, and works great in Coup.  Every copy of G54 Kickstarter Edition will include this promo item for Coup.\nWe made a change to the Crime Boss art, and will include two sets of dividers, 4 of each role card, and rule cards with both art for the Crime Boss and let you make the decision on which set to use. \nWe are also including corrected player Aids for Coup: Reformation.\nAnd we have added an additional Coup promo - the Bureaucrat. The Bureaucrat replaces the Duke, and has the Cooperation ability of the Farmer in G54. Cooperation lets you take 3 coins from the Treasury, but you must give one of those coins to another player. A great example of the many interesting twists on the Coup mechanics that G54 contains, and with this promo you can play Coup in a subtly different way.\n\n STRETCH GOALS - Are you Awesome?\nIf you participated in some of our more recent projects, you will be familiar with our extra promos that we add during the project called \"You are Awesome Rewards\".  If you aren't you can read all about them and why we are changing away from more standard \"stretch goals\" by CLICKING HERE. \"Sharing\" the project on facebook or via kicktraq, giving us thumbs up on BGG, posting threads & positive comments on reddit's r/boardgames and articles on your blogs or in other gaming websites are all great ways to help this project get more visibility - and show that you are investing more into this game than a simple financial transaction. The more that you are awesome, the more promos that I will add to the rewards!\nEach copy that you pledge for on this project will come with these promo items and all the \"You are Awesome Rewards\" added during the project period.\nThank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table and get you all the promo items that you want!\nTravis\nIndie Boards and Cards\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose a rebellion, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of the rebels have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nCoup is a lightning fast game of bluff and manipulation for 2-6 players - the game play of Coup is used for Coup: Rebellion G54 with the added strategic layer of variable card set up - making every game a unique challenge.  But G54 doesn't replace Coup!  I suspect that many people will want to have both - Coup for fast, fun times and G54 as a \"gamers\" game.  If you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer:\nADD - ONS\nAdd-ons: As a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Coup Rebellion G54 Kickstarter Edition. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in September).\nPLEASE READ THE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTES BELOW IF YOUR ADDRESS IS OUTSIDE THE US & CANADA.\nAll of the games that we offer in the add-on program are available right now at your local game store:\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion) \nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Hidden Agenda (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Hostile Intent (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nSnowdonia\nHaggis\nDragon Slayer\nRoar-a-Saurus\nGENCON/ESSEN\nOur plan is to have Coup Rebellion G54 Kickstarter edition ready in time for GenCon and available at Essen. It may be the case that we have games at GenCon several weeks before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to GenCon or Essen in time. If you want GenCon or Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our GenCon email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzSlX or sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pick up (note we can not handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). All the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to GenCon/Essen - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nUnfortunately international shipping is costly, takes time and is open to a number of potential issues and delays. While we try to use shipping service providers that are both effective and cost efficient, we are not in the shipping business and must rely upon outside providers and postal services to get games to you. After several years of using a more complex series of international shipping locations, we have had to make some hard decisions that affect international shipping - especially to the EU. As always we plan to have this game at Essen (see above for details, so that might be a better option for those in the EU.\nInternational shipping will be made from the US or Canada - we will post the declared value of the games less shipping, handling and administration fees in an attempt to reduce or remove any fees, tariffs or other costs, but take no responsibility for any taxes, tariffs, fees or other charges that are made by your governments, postal service or other agencies.\nThe international shipping service we use does not have tracking information - if you want to have end to end tracking information, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder. They will be able to provide end to end tracking, but be warned such a shipping service is very expensive ($150+).\nWhile average shipping times are 2-3 weeks for most international destinations - you must plan for up to 6 months for items to arrive. That means you'll need an address that remains valid for an extended period of time to ensure that items arrive. If you desire faster shipping method or aren't confident that you will have a stable shipping address, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder that offers a faster (and significantly more expensive service) or ability to hold packages and send when you request.\nCombined vs Individual Shipping\nIf you select combined shipping level, then all your rewards for this project and several planned projects with Sept 2015 shipping dates will be sent in one package. This lets you save money by reducing rates on multiple games in one package and you can take advantage of special add-on rates for past games from Indie Boards and Cards and perhaps an add-on rate for a future project. But if you select \"combined\" shipping and then want to change, there will be a $25 special handling fee to switch to individual shipment - so please choose wisely before the project ends.\nI know that some countries have hefty surcharges for items above a certain threshold - for those that want items sent in individual packages we offer a second level of shipping to help avoid those surcharges. If you select the individual shipping level, each game sent to you in it's own box. Unfortunately this precludes you from taking advantage of add-ons, or from getting special add-on rate for future projects planned for later this year.\nInternational Shipping Service\nWhile we have found these services to be suitable for 99% of our past backers, but for customer service reasons there are a number of countries that we are no longer shipping rewards.\nCountries that we will ship to are: Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cayman Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Reunion, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\nPlease ensure that your shipping location is on our list of countries that we provide service to, those countries that are excluded from this offer have the ability to use one of many parcel freight forwarders that will take delivery in the US and send to you via the shipping method that works best for your final destination. Specific Countries that we have had significant customer service issues with, and will no longer be able to provide service directly include: Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay. Please understand that I have no negative feelings to people that live in these countries, however I am unable to provide you directly with the quality service that you deserve at a reasonable price. As an alternative you can always use the services of a parcel freight forwarder that will provide you with a US address and work with you to bring rewards into your country.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while I am very optimistic about this special edition of Coup Rebellion G54 - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games (The Resistance, Haggis and Triumvirate), all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike.  In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In the following years we have released many more games and expansions to our best selling Resistance, Coup and Flash Point series. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards recently completed a kickstarter project for ONR, that project is scheduled to be delivered in September of 2015. We have a track record of delivering multiple projects in a timely manner and do not foresee any issues with doing so again.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra promo items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nProduction variability - While efforts are made to ensure that all versions of games are compatible with previous versions and expansions, there is no practical way to ensure that this happens. Variations in the production process can result in differences in colors, textures and materials between print editions and occasionally within a single print run. Some variation should be expected that may necessitate that measures such as using card sleeves be used to hide these minor production variations.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "G54 Anarchy", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for G54 Anarchy, an expansion for Coup Rebellion G54, is up (and in it's final hours).

We classify it as mid-Atlantic.\nOne Hit Kill is easy to learn and fast-moving: no hit points, no mana, no need to consult the rulebook. Its simple rules allow for surprisingly complex strategy. We\u2019ve playtested it with ages 8 to 78. Everyone quickly gets it, experienced gamers and newbies alike. \nThe game was created by John August and the team that brought you Writer Emergency Pack, with illustrations by amazing artists who\u2019ve worked on top fantasy games. \nTo get the game first. We'll be shipping One Hit Kill to Kickstarter backers in September. This may be your only chance to get the game in 2015.\nTo shape the future of OHK. From Magic to Munchkin, great games evolve based on their early players. With expansion packs, forums and Maker's Kits, we want you to help chart the course for One Hit Kill.\nTo support Kickstarter projects that ship. We're the same team that created Writer Emergency Pack, which shipped months early to the delight of backers. Here's a selection of what they wrote:\nWe think One Hit Kill might become your new favorite game, so please help us make it a reality.\nThanks!\nA game of One Hit Kill usually takes about 10 minutes, so you can squeeze in a few rounds at lunch \u2014 but it\u2019s also perfect for game nights with friends.\nWe recruited 30 players of all levels to try out an early build. Here\u2019s what they wrote afterwards:\nWe had an amazing experience launching Writer Emergency Pack on Kickstarter last year. For a few months, it was the most-backed card project in Kickstarter history. That momentum let us scale up in ways that would have been impossible otherwise. This year Writer Emergency Pack will be in 2,000 classrooms, 50 countries and several major retailers, including Amazon. \nOne Hit Kill is a very different project, larger in scope in several ways. \nFor starters, we\u2019re bringing in amazing artists to illustrate 82 cards. We also have a vision for the future. In addition to the core game, we\u2019d love to release expansion packs on a regular schedule so the game can continue to grow and evolve. \nSome of our first expansion packs may include Pirates & Zombies, Lovecraft & Austen, and Apocalyptacular! Each one changes the game in exciting ways, opening new strategies and keeping the game fresh. \nIn order to offer expansions, we need a sizable base of players from the start. That's why our future goals are based on backers, not dollars:\n                     And something brand new:\nYou can make these goals happen by hitting achievements. Some couldn't be easier.\nOur Facebook page loves Likes: facebook.com/onehitkillgame\nOur Twitter feed will reward your following: @onehitkillgame\nFor Vine videos, you can use #onehitkill and #portaltonowhere hashtags to mark them. Also link to them in the comments or on Facebook. \nFor SoundCloud songs, you can use #onehitkill and #anthem hashtags to mark them. And again, link to them in the comments or on Facebook.\nJohn August came up with the game and the rules. (His daughter came up with the name.) He\u2019s written seven movies including Big Fish, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Frankenweenie. He\u2019s the co-host of the Scriptnotes podcast, creator of Writer Emergency Pack, and surprisingly good at Labyrinthspiel. \nDustin Bocks illustrated all of the Component cards, and created the class icons. He knows an astonishing amount about the Harry Potter universe. \nNoah Bradley is well-known for his illustrations for Magic: The Gathering and many other fantasy games. You can find information about his upcoming project The Sin of Man on his website, along with articles and videos for aspiring artists.\nMatthew Chilelli composed the amazing music for our video. He has punched fewer than two grizzly bears.\nSimon Estrada is an illustrator and character designer who has worked on projects for Hasbro, Saban and The Jim Henson company. For us, he designed the Scriptnotes tour shirt and a yet-to-be-released animated short. You can find his portfolio at his site.\nStuart Friedel is a master playtester and shipping ninja. His father, Lee, is a dentist. \nChristina Hess works as an illustrator and designer in the publishing industry. Her successful Kickstarter project \u201cAnimals from History\u201d is a collection of stories that spin over twenty historically-charged fictional tales. You can see more of her artwork on her site.\nRyan Nelson designed Writer Emergency Pack and the Weapon cards for OHK. He helped create our Highland and Weekend Read apps, and develops videogames on his own. He is a cool breeze in July.\nNima Yousefi makes apps, including the OHK apps. He loves genre TV shows and cute animal videos. \nThanks!\nPlease follow us on Facebook and Twitter or we\u2019ll have to play this card:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game works. We\u2019ve printed sample decks and playtested it with a bunch of strangers of all backgrounds and experience levels. We know it\u2019s fun. \n\nWe have our artists on board. They\u2019re amazing, and we have a schedule for getting stuff done. \n\nWe also know how to print things. We\u2019ve made and shipped 18,000 Writer Emergency Packs, using printers both in the U.S. and China. \n\nDespite our best planning, problems may still arise: printing delays, Kaiju monsters, gamma ray bursts that knock civilization back to the Stone Age. But short of global catastrophe, we should be okay. We've built in contingencies for budget and schedule that should get us through. \n\nThere's a chance we won't reach our funding goal. That would be a bummer. We would reevaluate and figure out how to do this better. \n\nThere's the chance the response could be so large that we are overwhelmed with orders. We\u2019ve been talking a lot with our friends at Exploding Kittens about their experience, and will benefit from everything they\u2019ve learned. \n\nBottom line: If stuff comes up, we'll fix it, and we will tell you.

Another thing that isn't exactly specified (even though you guys were very specific in the rules on what the discard pile is for), do the remaining players get a final chance to build their weapon on the game ending turn? Short answer, hack it. And I see below some people are going after all the weapons cards to try to make a match with whatever they already have in their hand starving other players of available weapons cards. Hack it, instead set a limit. Say 2-player no more than 10 weapons cards allowed per player, 3-player max 7 weapons, and 4-player max 5 weapons. In a 4-player game if you draw 5 weapons, at that point you got to build one of them.

Petty III. In Xenon Profiteer, you take the role of entrepreneuring engineer striving to specialize and optimize your Air Separation Facility in order to emerge as a titan of the emerging market for Xenon. Others are racing to achieve similar prestige however, and only the best among you will be victorious.\nXenon Profiteer  plays 2-4 players in under 60 minutes (we promises, that's not just box hype!)\nIn a decidedly different take on the classic deck-building format, Xenon Profiteer not only actively encourages players to remove cards from their decks, it is a core mechanic in your goal of isolating Xenon. Each turn begins by strategically removing cards from your hand (and deck) through Distilling based on the real-world hierarchy of elements. The goal: only have Xenon remaining in your hand. The problem is, of course, the only way to gain more Xenon, is to bring in more AIR. And AIR is composed of all kinds of other pesky elements that make isolating Xenon difficult.\nContract Cards\nTo be successful, the entrepreneur must purchase upgrades that accelerate the distilling process. From upgrades that accelerate the rate at which elements are introduced into the player's system, to upgrades that give advantages when bidding on new upgrades and contracts, nearly every aspect of the basic distilling operation can be improved upon. The purchased upgrades can be put into a player's deck for a minimal cost, or else installed as permanent cards in front of the player for a larger cost, but with enduring effects.\nUpgrade Cards\nAll of this tweaking and upgrading is for one ultimate goal: streamline the Xenon distillation process to fulfill contracts that give the player who claims them a combination of money and victory points. Once a player has completed five contracts or installed five permanent upgrades, the game is over and the player with the most victory points is the winner.\nCOMPONENTS\nXenon Profiteer Components List\n216 Poker Sized Playing Cards\n25 Bid Tokens in 5 player colors\n28 Coins of multiple denominations\n1 Xenon Privilege Token\n Xenon Profiteer will be the 17th game in the acclaimed Gryphon Bookshelf Series.\n Xenon Profiteer is the 2014 winner of the ION Game Designer Award!\nRULES\n For a look at the full rules please click here!\nFor an in-depth look at how to play Xenon Profiteer, watch the video below.\nT.C Petty III: Designer\n\"T. C. Petty III is the ION Award winning designer of Xenon Profiteer. He resides in central Pennsylvania in a mostly suburban area and is a professional croupier at a local, rural casino. \nAn English major and starving artist, he surrounds himself with games, both electronic, carnival, and analog to study human beings and their insane concept of what constitutes entertainment. He also puts more effort into creating games than any reasonable person should. Luckily, he generally loves almost every second of it. He can be seen most days carrying around a large journal and flipping back his page-boy hair; hair that now has a soft tint of gray in the eaves. The journal is filled with various splatters of ink that form a mad collage containing hundreds of game design ideas. Sometimes these scribblings emerge into the real world as prototypes and his perfectionist tendencies begin an arduous process of play testing that spans years. \nWhen not sipping coffee or jotting notes in his journal, he likes to actually play games with friends and family. Xenon Profiteer is the third game created, Kickstarted, and released onto the market by T. C. Petty III. He is the designer of several acclaimed board games including VivaJava: The Coffee Game, VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game, and the upcoming release Don't Get Eated in late 2015.\nTC's games tend to lean heavily on traditional Euro elements mixed with American themes and sensibilities. He has championed the concept of positive player interaction and tries to encourage new forms of interaction in tabletop gaming whenever possible.\"\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED - Air Seperation in the Future We'll add three new special contract cards that introduce some science-fiction to the game and provide new types of bonuses\nFor those that may see the game as something almost science fiction, it's important and surprising to note that Xenon Profiteer is set in present day. While the systems being represented are ambitiously modern, touch-screen interfaces, the technology referenced is currently being used by larger air separation facilities. Only the biggest and best are equipped to separate Xenon. It's pretty cool.  \n But these three new Contracts are currently fictional and represent possible future applications for the use of Xenon within the next several years. Since developing technologies in refinement, economic delivery and recycling of xenon will be a crucial step towards investigating these potential applications, I'm excited to include them in the game.\nThese Contracts are also special because upon completion, a player immediately receives the Action listed at the bottom. With proper planning, it will allow players to create unique and interesting combinations on their turn.\nSo while the neuroprotective attributes of Xenon may or may not aid those with neural injuries, and the idea of erasing bad memories through Xenon therapy may be more awesome-sounding than the eventual result, the idea of being on the ground floor, pushing these ideas forward is something totally worth exploring.  \nAnd someone is going to make an Energy Drink with Xenon in it at some point. I guarantee it.\n- TC Petty III\n$15,000 - Profiteers and Business Tactics\nThe Profiteer cards give each player a special starting power. The player chooses one of five Profiteers, each with a choice between getting a one-time bonus at the start of the game or an ability that lasts throughout the whole game.\nProfiteers and Business Tactics\nThe Business Tactics cards are also dealt out one to each player, and give the player the option of either using the once-per-game ability on the card, or saving the card until the end of the game for an extra scoring bonus.\nAt $15,000 in pledges, we will include these ten cards in the base game.\nXenon Profiteer will be joining 16 other great titles as the newest Eagle-Gryphon Bookshelf Series Game.\nAs part of this campaign you can add on any of the in-stock Gryphon Bookshelf Series titles (or any of the other titles shown and listed below) for $20 plus shipping (see the shipping section for details).

It\u2019s all about trying outwit your opponent with the timing and positioning of your attacks and defences.\nThe game was designed to be super-portable: it's just 21 cards so it'll fit in any pocket, and you play it entirely in your hand, so it doesn't require a table or other playing surface. Take it anywhere, play it anywhere!\nReviewers love Dragon Punch! Check out these (p)reviews.\nEdo's Game Reviews video preview:\n\"Truly perfect as an out of pocket five minute game\" - Timothy Mattes,Sorry Man I Farted\n\"If you want a game that is a whole lot of fun and can be played anywhere, it would be a shame if you passed up Dragon Punch.\" - Rob Cramer, Giant From The North\n\"The game itself is awesome ... [a] bundle of fun\" 9/10 - Adam Atkinson, A Roll Of The Dice\n\"Dragon Punch takes me back to a simpler time in gaming in the best way possible. Outwit your opponent in a super intense high stakes fighting game that you can play anywhere!\" - Rick Perez, Let's Level Up\n \"The game mechanisms are truly exceptional ... the fun it provides is outstanding.\" - Arek Lewandowski, Kostkarnia u Kostka (Polish)\n\"A great game for confined times and confined spaces\" - Brian Everett, Cloak & Meeple\n Note: I like my reviews independent, so no money (or any other kind of fee) has changed hands for any of these reviews. I did provide all the reviewers with a review copy of the game.\nWant to learn how Dragon Punch works? The easiest way is to view this awesome video by JonGetsGames. It explains everything, with examples, in just over six minutes!\nIf you only have three minutes, here's my own (far less engaging) gameplay overview. I talk through the game's core concepts, and then ramble on a bit about why I think it's so great.\nPLAY\n\nIn Dragon Punch, both players have a hand of 6 basic fighting cards, plus one unique character card. Each card contains 2 moves. Each turn, both players simultaneously choose and reveal a move to play. The moves are compared to determine which, if any, are successful.\nNo single move is the best: a Block might prevent an Attack, a quick Attack would interrupt a slow one, but a slow throw can't be Blocked. It's all about timing and reading your opponent. There are also Evades and different attack locations, and gaining the Initiative can make all your attacks super-fast for one turn.\nIf you get hit, you must upgrade some of your basic moves. Your basic moves are your health, and losing health unlocks your choice of more furious moves. At the end of every turn you also flip your played card to the back of your hand, making it temporarily unavailable. This upgrading and flipping of moves keeps the match-up between you and your opponent in constant flux, making every turn unique.\nWin the round by making your opponent lose all their health. The first to win two rounds is the winner!\nWant to play before you pledge? Or just read through the rules? No problem, just download this free Print & Play file:\nDownload the PnP file (US Letter size)\nDownload the PnP file (A4 size)\nThese PnP files contain the complete game and rules, but not all art is full-colour. The \u00a31 pledge level (or above) will get you an improved PnP file with all final art included.\nNote: The imagery of the game's cards and packaging is pretty much final, but there might still be small tweaks to the graphic design.\nNote 2: Both the wallet and the tin will accommodate sleeved cards. The cards are bridge sized (3.5\"x2.25\").\nHaving an additional copy of the game allows you to play the game's \"Custom Character\" variant, where both players can customize their basic move set. \nOr maybe you simply want an extra copy for a friend, or one to keep in the glove compartment? No problem. If you're a Tinned/Limited level pledger, you can even get extra tinned sets or empty wallets.\nTo add an add-on, just increase your pledge with the appropriate amount(s). After the campaign finishes, you'll be able confirm that you want an add-on in the backer survey.\nFor example:\nA backer from the USA wanting a Tinned Edition would normally pledge \u00a316: The \u00a315 base pledge + \u00a31 shipping.\nIf that backer wanted to add one standard copy of the game, they'd simply increase their pledge to \u00a322: The \u00a315 base pledge + \u00a31 shipping + \u00a36 for the add-on.\nAs you can see, shipping is included for most pledge levels and countries! Add-ons have their shipping cost included in their amount as well.\nAll games will be shipped from the UK. To my knowledge, the game's price point is lower than any customs charge / VAT threshold anywhere.\nWant to help make Dragon Punch a success? Awesome!

That project funded over 1500%, and I still managed to deliver all rewards within a month of the estimated dates.\n\nOf course, things never go exactly as planned. To minimize the probability of production delays, all my manufacturers are either UK-based or ones that I've used before. All the card artwork is complete so there's no risk of delays there either. The games are tiny, which makes storage and transport (relatively) easy. And my first Kickstarter has made me fluent in the Royal Mail's international shipping options and costs.\n\nAs I'm handling fulfillment myself, there's always the possibility of everything slowing to a crawl if I get sick or something. But I've tried to account for such a setback or two in the estimated delivery date. (I expect to start shipping in September, but I've learned to expect the unexpected too -- hence November).\n\nAnother risk is this project unexpectedly getting thousands of backers (yay!). Such a windfall could make the project too big to be hand-fulfilled on time. In that case, the enormous amount of backers should give me enough revenue to hire some external help.\n\nI'm well prepared for this project, and I'm confident I'll be able to battle my way through any unexpected issues that arise. If you\u2019ve got any questions, please don\u2019t hesitate to get in touch!

It features fast-paced, highly interactive gameplay, gorgeous art and simple rules that make it fun and easy to pick up. Five asymmetric trees of upgradeable powers plus special attack and combo cards give you loads of strategic options. In the end, only one player's saga will stand the test of time!\nA whole lot of cards, each with unique artwork! Plus some tokens and things. All in one portable package:\nKickstarter backers will also be receiving the Backer Pack, containing 16 additional hero cards with new artwork featuring the LEGEND and MYTH backers, plus a bonus promo card!\n(Backer Pack card art will be completed after the campaign ends.)\nWant to try the game right now? There's a free Print & Play version available!\nAt the start of the game, each player is dealt a random saga card and takes 6 inheritance markers to match the traits shown on their saga. The hero cards are shuffled into a communal draw pile.\nDuring the game, each player will be attempting to build a family tree which contains their saga's required traits. On their turn, a player will:\n1. Draw until they have 4 cards.\n2. Use an embellishment they are eligible for, if they wish.\n3. Play a hero card onto their family tree.\nAs you add heroes to your family tree, you inherit their traits by moving your inheritance markers onto them. Each hero has a dominant trait which it can always contribute, and a recessive trait which is contributed only when matched with another recessive trait of the same color.\nYou can rearrange your inheritance markers whenever you like, and you win as soon as all 6 are on your family tree. The catch is that two paired heroes cannot both contribute their dominant traits at the same time. Since heroes can't be moved after they're played, that means carefully planning ahead to leave room for recessive pairings.\nA story with no twists wouldn't be worth telling, so to keep your audience engaged you can use powerful embellishments. The color of the heroes on your family tree determines what type of embellishments you can get away with; each color has its own tree with 3 unique abilities:\nFor example, if you're (currently) a crafty green hero with a green parent, no one will doubt that your story involved Plundering or becoming a Turncoat (1st or 2nd generation green embellishments). By next turn you could be several generations deep into some other color and using completely different powers, if you change your story just right.\nThere are also two special types of heroes: fearsome ghosts which can be played anywhere, allowing you to disrupt other players' stories as well as allowing access to the powerful, but risky, black embellishment tree; and poetic skalds, whose eloquence lets you use an embellishment when they are played, leading to complex combos.\nWant even more detail? You can go download the rulebook right now in English or French! Want to try building your own family tree? There's an interactive online demo that you can play with here:\nYou can also watch the 3-minute tutorial video which covers all the rules:\nStill want more videos? Watch an entire playthrough of the game!\nWe're keeping it simple and only offering one version of Norsaga during this campaign; that means every single copy will contain the best possible game, including all stretch goals we unlock. You can pledge for additional copies by adding to your base pledge amount. Or, get featured in the game at the Legend, Myth, and Eternal levels!\nThis project is V.A.T. Friendly: all copies are expected to ship below the threshold for V.A.T. and duty in most countries. This means most international backers will avoid paying those fees.\n(Have an idea for a pledge level you'd like to see? Let us know in the comments.) \nYou can help ensure we fund and start unlocking these goals by telling your friends, family, gaming groups, local game stores, and everyone else about this campaign, in person and via Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, and Reddit!\nNorsaga was publicly demoed at Gen Con 2014 to overwhelmingly positive feedback. We've also sent a number of prototype copies to reviewers, professional and enthusiast alike. See what they thought of the game through the links below!\n\nNorsaga has been fully illustrated by Matthew Bishop. The game contains 108 unique pieces of card art; even functionally identical cards have their own artwork, because more Viking ancestors are always better! You can see much of the artwork in the gallery, and we'll be showing the rest of it at regular funding intervals during the campaign.\nThere are 40 saga cards featuring 20 unique mythological encounters. Each saga occurs in two variations which feature complementary traits. If you want to ensure every game starts with an even playing field, deal out paired sagas so that opposing players are matching against an equal mix of traits.\nCheck out the Norsaga blog for tons of detail on what went into the design of the gameplay, the art, and lots of other cool stories.\nThis game has been a labor of love for all involved, and we want to make it available to players everywhere. Without Kickstarter to fund the initial print run, the game won't be produced. So don't wait to find it online or in stores later!\nTo thank you for backing us now, we're offering a tidy 20% discount on the game (expected MSRP of $24.99 for base game) and low-cost global shipping. As an additional bonus, the Backer Pack and any unlocked stretch goals will be included for free with your Kickstarter copy; after the campaign these items will be available separately in limited quantities.\nThe initial funding goal we've chosen for the campaign is based on the minimum print run required by the manufacturer, plus the cost of shipping those games to backers. Even with the art being completed entirely in-house, we're not planning to make a profit off this Kickstarter. You can see a complete breakdown of what we're doing with the $15,000 below:\nYou can also show your support for Norsaga with some of these great avatars; use them on Kickstarter, facebook, twitter, and elsewhere to spread the word!\nKevin and Matthew Bishop are twin brothers from Annapolis, Maryland. Kevin created Norsaga out of a cool idea he had, coupled with a healthy love of Norse mythology. Then he bugged his brother until Matthew drew some art. Then Matthew bugged Kevin until he agreed to go to Gen Con with the whole thing.\nBy day they get paid to do other stuff, like Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering.\nYou can check out Meeple Mechanic's interview with Kevin on the design process of Norsaga here.\n \u00a92015 Meromorph Games, LLC.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first game and our first Kickstarter, so there will be a good deal of learning ahead. We've budgeted some additional cost and schedule leeway for this, and we're being realistic with our funding goals rather than shooting for a huge print run or complicated pledge levels.\n\nThe artwork for the game is 100% complete, the game has been rigorously playtested, and the physical components are simple. We will be working with Panda GM to manufacture the game and SFC for fast, low-cost global fulfilment.

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter at www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to be informed of our next project.\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited about our collaboration with Bezier Games as we announce the next game set in The Resistance Universe - One Night Resistance!\nCLICK HERE for Ted Alspach's Designer Diary\nCLICK HERE for One Night Resistance review on GeekDad.com\nWant more than one copy?  CLICK HERE for detailed instructions\nOne Night Resistance is a super fast game of secret identities for 3 to 10 players that combines all the deductive and chaotically fun elements of the One Night Ultimate Werewolf series with structured game play of The Resistance.  The result is a very addictive game that is easy to learn and will be played over and over again.\nEvery player starts with a specialist role and an ID (either spy or resistance).  At night the spies reveal to each other (if there are any, as at all player counts there are between 0 and 3 spies in play), and then all players complete their specialist action in a clockwise order (removing the need for a rigid script/app and reducing the potential to accidentally reveal your role).  Specialist actions include information gathering and role switching, helping players in their attempt to identify the spy before the the day is over.  If a majority of players identify the spy, the resistance wins - but if the spies remain hidden, they win!  CLICK HERE for the full game rules.\nPROMOS\nAs a special reward for our early adopters, all the games sent as rewards to backers of this project will be the Kickstarter edition and include promo items that won't be included in the retail version of One Night Resistance.  In addition to the 8 different specialists that are included in the retail version of One Night Resistance, the Kickstarter Edition will include 3 additional promo specialists that you can add into your games:\nDefector: If you start the game as a resistance defector, you will make yourself a spy during the night action.  A very difficult role to claim!\n\nRogue: A spy rogue switches another spy's ID with a resistance ID during the night.  Adding an element of chaotic fun into the mix.\nBlind Spy: A blind spy doesn't know the other spies!\nThese promo items are a great way to extend your enjoyment of One Night Resistance - a must have for fans of The Resistance or One Night Ultimate Werewolf series!\nSTRETCH GOALS - Are you Awesome?\nIf you participated in some of our more recent projects, you will be familiar with our \"You are Awesome Rewards\", if you aren't you can read all about them and why we are changing away from more standard \"stretch goals\" by CLICKING HERE.  \"Liking\" the project on facebook or via kicktraq, giving us thumbs up on BGG, posting comments and articles on your blogs or in other gaming websites are all great ways to help this project get more visibility - and show that you are investing more into this game than a simple financial transaction.  The more that you are awesome, the more promos that I will add to the rewards!\nOur first \"You are Awesome\" award is to include a ONR app in the upcoming app for The Resistance, which of course will be available free of charge.  The Resistance app is being developed by Berkeley based UnBoard - and you can see the extremely high standards of application development in the kickstarter for Epic Everything. \nthe second \"You are Awesome reward\" is to upgrade the HQ tableau in the Kickstarter Edition to thick chipboard with a linen finish. \nThe third \"You are Awesome reward\" is a promo for Coup. Every copy of One Night Resistance Kickstarter Edition will include the Speculator that can be used as a substitute for the Duke.  This promo includes 5 Speculator cards, and a full set of 6 playing cards for Coup as well as a rules/reference card. The Speculator is one of the 25 cards coming later this year in Indie Boards and Cards release of Rikki Tahta's Coup sequel.  Details to follow.\nOur fourth \"You are Awesome Reward\" is meant to be fun - every copy of One Night Resistance Kickstarter Edition will include a new micro game: Win, Lose, Resistance!\nWin, Lose, Resistance is based upon Asmadi Games' Win, Lose, Banana - which might possibly be the fastest hidden identities game available anywhere, great fun when you have a minute in line or between games. WLR features new artwork that will be part of the upcoming revision to The Resistance, that will start to show up on store shelves in June.\nThank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table and get you all the promo items that you want!\nTravis\nIndie Boards and Cards\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nADD - ONS\nAdd-ons: As a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for One Night Resistance Kickstarter Edition. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in September).\nPLEASE READ THE INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING NOTES BELOW IF YOUR ADDRESS IS OUTSIDE THE US & CANADA.\nAll of the games that we offer in the add-on program are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Hidden Agenda (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Hostile Intent (Resistance Expansion)\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion)\nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nSnowdonia\nHaggis\nDragon Slayer\nRoar-a-Saurus\nCLICK HERE for more details about add-ons.\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while I am very optimistic about this special edition of One Night Resistance - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In the following years we have released many more games and expansions to our best selling Resistance, Coup and Flash Point series. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!\nGENCON/ESSEN\nOur plan is to have One Night Resistance Kickstarter edition ready in time for GenCon and available at Essen. It may be the case that we have games at GenCon several weeks before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to GenCon or Essen in time. If you want GenCon or Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our GenCon email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzSlX or sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address here: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before each event, we will ask you what you would like to reserve for Thursday pick up (note we can not handle prepaid reservations or hold items past Thursday). All the specials & promo items will be available in the games we bring to GenCon/Essen - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING\nUnfortunately international shipping is costly, takes time and is open to a number of potential issues and delays. While we try to use shipping service providers that are both effective and cost efficient, we are not in the shipping business and must rely upon outside providers and postal services to get games to you.  After several years of using a more complex series of international shipping locations, we have had to make some hard decisions that affect international shipping - especially to the EU.  As always we plan to have this game at Essen (see above for details, so that might be a better option for those in the EU.\nInternational shipping will be made from the US or Canada - we will post the declared value of the games less shipping, handling and administration fees in an attempt to reduce or remove any fees, tariffs or other costs, but take no responsibility for any taxes, tariffs, fees or other charges that are made by your governments, postal service or other agencies.\nThe international shipping service we use does not have tracking information - if you want to have end to end tracking information, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder.  They will be able to provide end to end tracking, but be warned such a shipping service is very expensive ($150+).  \nWhile average shipping times are 2-3 weeks for most international destinations - you must plan for up to 6 months for items to arrive.  That means you'll need an address that remains valid for an extended period of time to ensure that items arrive.  If you desire faster shipping method or aren't confident that you will have a stable shipping address, please have your rewards sent to a US address and use a parcel freight forwarder that offers a faster (and significantly more expensive service) or ability to hold packages and send when you request.\nCombined vs Individual Shipping\nIf you select combined shipping level, then all your rewards for this project and several planned projects with Sept 2015 shipping dates will be sent in one package.  This lets you save money by reducing rates on multiple games in one package and you can take advantage of special add-on rates for past games from Indie Boards and Cards and perhaps an add-on rate for a future project.  But if you select \"combined\" shipping and then want to change, there will be a $25 special handling fee to switch to individual shipment - so please choose wisely before the project ends.\nI know that some countries have hefty surcharges for items above a certain threshold - for those that want items sent in individual packages we offer a second level of shipping to help avoid those surcharges.  If you select the individual shipping level, each game sent to you in it's own box.  Unfortunately this precludes you from taking advantage of add-ons, or from getting special add-on rate for future projects planned for later this year.\nInternational Shipping Service\nWhile we have found these services to be suitable for 99% of our past backers, but for customer service reasons there are a number of countries that we are no longer shipping rewards.\nCountries that we will ship to are: Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Cayman Islands, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Korea (Republic of), Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Malaysia, Montenegro, Netherlands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Reunion, Romania, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom.\nPlease ensure that your shipping location is on our list of countries that we provide service to, those countries that are excluded from this offer have the ability to use one of many parcel freight forwarders that will take delivery in the US and send to you via the shipping method that works best for your final destination. Specific Countries that we have had significant customer service issues with, and will no longer be able to provide service directly include: Argentina, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, United Arab Emirates, and Uruguay. Please understand that I have no negative feelings to people that live in these countries, however I am unable to provide you directly with the quality service that you deserve at a reasonable price.  As an alternative you can always use the services of a parcel freight forwarder that will provide you with a US address and work with you to bring rewards into your country.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra promo items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nProduction variability - While efforts are made to ensure that all versions of games are compatible with previous versions and expansions, there is no practical way to ensure that this happens. Variations in the production process can result in differences in colors, textures and materials between print editions and occasionally within a single print run. Some variation should be expected that may necessitate that measures such as using card sleeves be used to hide these minor production variations.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Will you join our Quest?", "update_content": "Our latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon is ending soon on Kickstarter!

Be the first to return your ankhs to their rightful place to gain access to the pharaoh's treasures! Obtain the treasures before your rivals, and you win!\nSince our first campaign for EJiPT, we've worked on the game to tighten-up the rules, lower manufacturing costs, and maximize the size of the components for the price! We're returning to Kickstarter with a bigger and better game.\nEJiPT is easy to learn and plays fast. Players begin with three ankh tokens which are used to unlock the treasure room. On your turn, you'll roll a four sided die, you can then move up to as many spaces as the die roll. Seems easy enough, but the pharaoh's tomb is filled with traps! Each space of the tomb causes the halls to shift and spin and will either move you one step closer to untold riches or towards defeat. Once you\u2019ve returned your ankhs to their rightful places, you can claim the treasure within... if your opponents don't get there first!\nEJiPT has no in game language dependence! If you've translated the rules into another language, let us know! We'll post it here.\nCurious what someone else thinks? Check out this preview of EJiPT by the DreadedGeek!\nEverything you need to play! Check it out...\n4x Character Tokens with Stands \n4x Backpack Boards\n1x 4-sided \"Pyramid\" Die\n4x Tomb Tiles\n12x Ankh Tokens\n4x Treasure Tiles\n1x Rulebook\nThis digital reward will teach you more about how the game evolved into the final product you're about to receive. EJiPT has a long history, and the commentary pack video will provide you with a look at it's creation.\nWe'll show you one of the earliest versions of the game, share the history of the project and its evolution as we play through the game, and discuss the problems we ran into during development and how we went about solving them.\nWe're estimating a September delivery. Why so quick? Firstly, the game is done! The game has long been ready for your tabletops, so it's just a matter of getting it ready for manufacturing. The other key reason we can provide a quick turn around?\nWe've chosen to do our manufacturing in the US for Shift, Province, and Shadows of Arkham. We've been very happy with the communication, quick manufacturing timelines, and production quality, and so we're continuing in that tradition. While it can be slightly more expensive, at the end of the day you're getting high-quality, ethically produced games with crazy-fast turnaround times! No waiting on slow trans-pacific cargo ships.\nWant more? Message us!\nFinishing, editing, and preparing files for print should take 2 weeks. \nProofing should take 2-4 weeks. \nManufacturing should take 6-8 weeks. \nThere should be an additional 1-2 weeks for freight and processing for shipping.\nGames staying within the US should take 3-5 business days to arrive. Games heading to Canada should take 5-7 business days. Games heading to the EU should take 5-10 business days depending on the destination. Games heading down to Australia and other international destinations should take 2-4 weeks.\nWe've discussed our options with our shipping partner, and they've assured us that we're offering the best shipping for our European backers. For the weight and size and price, shipping from within the US will actually be less expensive for backers than importing the game to Europe.\nNormally we wait to share stretch goals, but we're excited about these! Once we hit certain backer totals, we can added more stuff to the game:\n700 Backers - Start and End Tiles - We will add tiles to mark the beginning and end of the track.\n850 Backers - 5th Treasure Token and \"Big Die\" Add-on Available - A 5th treasure will come standard with the game, and the \"Big Die\" will be available as an add-on. These dice feel great, but they make the game too expensive if they're included in every copy. Also, they don't fit in the box before the components are punched out. That makes these dice a great candidate for an add-on!\n1,000 Backers - The Mummy - We will add a Mummy Token and Stand and as well as optional 'mummy' rules in the manual that add another strategic layer to the game. We especially love these rules for the two-player game!\nIn 2013 we designed, developed, and published our very first microgame with the help of backers like you! Shift is a dueling card game that boils down Japanese-style CCG's into a single card. All you need is a friend, two cards, and some coins to throw-down in an epic anime inspired battle! It was even published in Brazil by our friends at Funbox Jogos!\nIn Spring 2014, we Kickstarted a microgame called Province, which has sold nearly 10,000 copies to date. It was also our first game to reach stores. Province tackled the challenge of making a competitive two-player micro eurogame. We think it's pretty swell. Other people seem to agree!\nSo when considering what to do next it occurred to us: why not do micro-ameritrash? The following Fall, we brought Shadows of the Elder Gods to Kickstarter. In it, 1-4 players work together to stop a deck of eldritch threats from bringing about the end of all things. Shadow of the Elder Gods is a big game in a small box, and it's now in stores thanks to backers like you!\n2015 is here, and we've got even more games coming! Help us start things off with a success by backing EJiPT today!\nIf you've missed any of our previous games, check out the combination tiers above and save on shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be our third game to be manufactured in this format, and our fourth time working with our manufacturing partner. If there are drastic manufacturing issues, there will be problems delivering the rewards. However, by choosing a printer in the US, we have the additional benefit of easier accountability if the product fails to meet our expectations. We've handled the manufacturing of over 14,000 games with our previous projects, and we've learned from that experience.\n\nEvery project introduces new challenges. If you look at our updates for Shadows of the Elder Gods, Province, and Shift, you will see that we try to balancing update spam with important news.

The Good Cat wants the Bad Cat out because he\u2019s annoying. The Bad Cat wants the Good Cat out because he wants all of the credit. The Wildcat just wants to get out.\nDeal out the 3 cards randomly and follow the rules on the cards. Do whatever! Interrogate your opponents. Grill them (not literally). Maybe you'll make bold statements that coincide with your role? There is so much room for exploration, but remember to follow the rules on your card and don't look at your opponents' cards. \nAs the Good Cat, you need to suss out the Bad Cat and get the Wildcat to also vote for the Bad Cat. If you're the Bad Cat you want the opposite. But if you are the Wildcat, you need to get someone to vote for you, and figure out exactly who it is to create the three way tie. \nWhen you are ready to vote, count to 3 and point at the player that you want out.

It takes all the diversity and character of the traditional collectible card game (CCG) and meshes it with all the depth and strategy of a real time strategy game (RTS) to create a truly unique experience.\nWe're committed to creating a beautiful, impactful game that'll wow avid PC gamers while still maintaining accessibility on all platforms. We\u2019ve designed it from the ground up to look and feel great on any device, whether that's your phone, your tablet, or your desktop computer.\nEpic Everything will be available on OS X, Windows, Android, and iOS, on all screen sizes.\nEpic Everything is free to play and easy to pick up; the core mechanics are designed to be simple, while still retaining the depth you'd expect from a traditional strategy game!\nWe\u2019ve always dreamed of making a game with as much potential as Epic Everything. The game is beautiful, deep, and packed full of adventure! We've taken it as far as we can on our own and we need your help to give it the final push it needs!\nEpic Everything revolves around two core mechanics: real-time and positioning. Together, these two mechanics lead to diverse and deep gameplay, adding interesting and never before seen elements to the CCG genre. There\u2019s plenty of opportunity for displays of skill, strategy, and big plays!\nReal-time action:\nBecause of real-time gameplay, there's constant action!\nIn Epic Everything, players play cards simultaneously. This means that you not only decide which cards to play, but also when to play them. Since both players are making decisions at the same time, there\u2019s an extra element of reacting and responding to your opponent. You are constantly faced with multiple options, such as \u201cShould I wait and react to my opponent\u2019s play, or should I make the first move and seize the initiative?\u201d\nEach creature has its own associated attack speed, or cooldown. This allows players ample time to prepare an appropriate response. In addition, real-time mechanics prevent your opponent from taking 10 minutes to play a single turn, which keeps the game moving at a reasonable pace.\nPositioning matters:\nUse ranged attacks to outmaneuver your opponent.\nThe second core mechanic in Epic Everything is positioning. The game board consists of ten spaces -- five for each player. Normally, creatures can only attack the spaces adjacent to themselves. However, some creatures may have additional effects that enable them to make better use of their position. For example, if a creature has \u201crange\u201d, then it can attack any space on the board. The inclusion of positioning leads to strategies like keeping your \u201cglass-cannon\u201d creatures safe on a side space, or \u201cwalling off\u201d an enemy creature with two creatures of your own.\nHow does this change things?\nTiming and positioning play a big part in many creature effects and spells.\nReal time and positioning mechanics allow for more diverse gameplay than the traditional CCG. The constant choices that players are faced with generate countless outcomes each game. Should they prioritize initiative over positioning? or vice versa? Even if two players were to play the exact same cards in a game, the result could be entirely different depending on their individual playstyles and priorities.\nEpic Everything\u2019s mechanics reward fast reactions, quick decisions, thoughtful planning, and proper strategy. This means there are plenty of ways for great players to differentiate themselves from good players and that no two players make the same plays.\nThere are 4 main card types: Red, Blue, Green, and Neutral.\nDeck-building has an extra dynamic to it as well, as players can adjust their decks to suit their personal preferences. The first set will include nearly 200 unique cards from which players can craft decks that complement their playstyle.\nThe Warhounds are a militant race that conquers their enemies with unbridled aggression.\nThe Fishfolk utilize forbidden magic and trickery to confuse and manipulate their foes.\nThe Spirits empower one another with unique auras and buffs to form an overwhelming force.\nThe Robots use their technological advancement to perform complex spell sequences.\nWould you rather overrun your opponent with the reckless Warhounds, or harness the Fishfolk's tribal magic to slow things down? Would you rather unite the Spirits to gradually build up a massive creature, or piece together intricate spell combos with the Robots? With an ever-expanding set of races and cards, the possibilities are endless.\nWe tried to make Epic Everything everything you could want in a CCG! Here\u2019s a list of the features we\u2019ve included:\nCountless strategies - There are no classes. You build your deck from four main card types: Red, Green, Blue, and Neutral cards, with plenty of options for any playstyle and nearly 200 unique cards in the first set! \nSkillful, not stressful - There are a ton of ways to outplay or outmaneuver your opponent. At the same time, the game is paced to be enjoyable and light-hearted, rather than overwhelming. \nEasy to learn, difficult to master - The core game can be learned in under 5 minutes, but behind that simplicity is depth and an unexpectedly high skill curve. \nPlay anytime, anywhere - Epic Everything feels natural not only on PC, but also on mobile platforms. Play on iOS, Android, Windows, and OS X!\nFree to play, not pay to win - While you can pay for card packs in Epic Everything, all features of the game can also be unlocked with in-game currency. Furthermore, you can build a competitive deck with even the most basic cards. \nDesigned for digital - An advanced AI, new mechanics, and other digital-only features provide the ultimate experience. \nBeautiful graphics - Each card has detailed art and unique animations, brought to life by artists from all over the world. \nCompelling Storyline - Behind the fast-paced action is an immersive background story with plenty of intertwining lore for fantasy fans! \nExpanded World - With planned companion comics, and additional game content for future expansions. \nOnline Play - A custom-built networking engine for seamless play with friends or anyone else online.\nEpic Everything is a storybook world with creatures of all shapes and sizes, ranging from heroic adventurers to misguided robots to mischievous spirits! There\u2019s a diverse cast of inspired creatures and characters waiting to be discovered.\nThe Fishfolk are a nomadic race of sea-dwellers.\nLeaflings are some of the more bright and cheerful Spirits.\nTinkerbombs are Robots that always go out with a bang!\nThe different locales and landmarks of the Epic Everything world appear as interactable environments on the game board. Each plays an important role in the backstory of Epic Everything, whether it's a magnificent city or an unexplored forest.\nBut beneath its peaceful exterior, the world of Epic Everything is locked in a brutal war! With Epic Everything, we want to include a full-fledged, single-player campaign. We want to incorporate our rich cast of heroes and villains, each with their own motivations and goals, in an adventure filled with fun and engaging missions. Players will be able to unlock additional rewards and bonuses with section of the world they explore!\nFor every one of the stretch goals we hit below, we'll include an extra card or set of cards to all tiers above Adventurer! These cards will be designed around interesting mechanics and effects that will definitely spice up your gameplay! We're starting off by displaying the first stretch goal at $60,000 raised:\nAn Unboard developer meeting earlier this year.\nUnboard is a game studio based in Berkeley, California that develops original and licensed games, including the official, mobile adaptation of The Resistance. The team at Unboard consists of gamers, artists, designers, and developers that come from a variety of backgrounds: from independent game studios to top tech companies like Apple and Google. We\u2019ve compiled a talented team of like-minded go-getters that want to make Epic Everything the perfect game for you, the player!\nWe've taken Epic Everything as far as we can on our small budget. We\u2019ve poured our heart and soul into making it the best it can be, but we believe it can be so much more! That\u2019s why we need your help.\nWe understand that investing in Epic Everything is a risk. That\u2019s why all of our reward tiers are huge values. We want to show that we appreciate the faith you\u2019re placing in Epic Everything by providing you with special edition cards, discounted packs, and Kickstarter exclusive rewards. We value you and want you to feel like you\u2019ve made an investment that\u2019s worth it.\nThere\u2019s so much more we want to add to the game: an immersive campaign, multiple expansions, and additional modes of play. We need to fund continued art, music, and development, while putting our core team on the project full time to give players the best experience possible; but we can\u2019t do it without your help! Your donations and interest in Epic Everything enable us to successfully create a fully-featured and truly genre-defining game.\nBe one of the pioneers who bring Epic Everything to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe want to introduce an entirely new element into a genre that\u2019s had relatively little innovation in the past. Adding in real-time gameplay and tweaking it in terms of pace, depth, and balance until it\u2019s just right will be a long process, so we can\u2019t say for sure how long the game will be in beta for. Every reward tier already includes closed beta access, but it will take some time to go from a beta to a polished game ready for an official launch.\n\nWe could run out of funding, lose key team members, or face many other mishaps on the long journey to launch, but we ensure you, we are equipped to face these challenges. We have a detailed and well-thought-out development schedule from now until alpha and closed beta release, and a plan from going from closed beta to launch, and have prepared for many circumstances as part of that. \n\nHopefully, our attention to detail and dedication to quality is apparent from what you\u2019ve seen above. We believe in testing everything we can, questioning any and all assumptions, and just making Epic Everything the best it can be. We're incredibly devoted to making a game that will be worthy of your support and time.\n\nWe plan to fully utilize our alpha and beta testing periods to fine-tune the game and iron out any bugs we may find. So while it may take a while, we promise the game will be made, and it will be absolutely\u2026 \n\nEPIC!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Unboard Games\nFirst created \u00b7 28 backed\nHi!

The last 30 days have been incredible, and we couldn't have done it without you!\nDr. Reed is the foremost pioneer in connecting the human mind to digital systems. It was his intention to see if people could work together while dreaming, but what he discovered was an untapped source of creativity that brings dreams to life. It doesn\u2019t matter what age, gender, or race a person is--they have the potential for unimaginable ingenuity. Now you too can live your dreams by participating in Project Dreamscape.\nYour turn starts by choosing whether or not to take a facedown card, called a Z card--these Z cards are currency in the game, but also count against you when it comes time to tally up the scores. Z cards are used to purchase cards from the Dreamscape, which are then placed in your REM stack. You must choose one of the two abilities on a card to activate when you collect it, but the real fun of the game comes from chaining these abilities together.\nAny one of the eight dream abilities in Project Dreamscape, by itself, produces only a minor effect--take a card, flip a card, rearrange some cards, and so on. But with some clever card play, one dream ability can lead to another until you've collected several cards or even cleared the entire Dreamscape. This continues until there are not enough cards to fully refill the Dreamscape after a player\u2019s turn. At that point, the game is over and it's time to score.\nScoring is simple. Just lay out your faceup cards in the order they were stacked, and then find matching abilities that appear on adjacent cards (the orientation of the cards does not affect scoring, but you may wish to rotate the cards to find these chains). Wherever two or more copies of an ability are next to one another, you score points as shown on the score chart. After scoring all of your chains, subtract points equal to the amount of Z cards you have, and that\u2019s your final score.\nFor some examples of Project Dreamscape's chaining mechanics, check out Richard Ham's wonderful run-through:\nCheck out the full rules for more information, and the free print-and-play files on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Rules\nProject Dreamscape: Print-and-Play files\nProject Dreamscape also has a single player variant, although it's currently only available digitally; however, we hope to include the rules in the box over the span of the campaign! You can find the rules for Virtual Dreaming on BoardGameGeek:\nProject Dreamscape: Virtual Dreaming\nInside Project Dreamscape, you'll find a sleep deck of 52 cards, two reference cards, five Z shield tokens, a full-color rulebook, a special active player marker, and an expansion deck consisting of 54 cards (three alternate dream types!). The game will come packaged in a sturdy two-piece box that measures approximately 3.5x5.5\"--about twice the width of a deck of cards, and still very pocket-sized!\n\"Small, portable, and challenging, Project Dreamscape engaged each of our players and kept them hooked. Each game provided new insight on new ways to manipulate and organize the Dream cards, mess with opponents, and create killer combos. Project Dreamscape is a game you can learn how to play in 5 minutes and take all afternoon to work out the many different ways to win. Now that\u2019s a good game.\"\nCyrus Kirby, Father Geek (full preview)\n  \"It took a couple turns to understand some of the combos and nuances, and then we were off and running! Terrific, clever game!\"\nChris Leder, Game Designer, Roll for It!\n  \"The peaceful artistic style of Project Dreamscape guides you through a quick, combo-making dream you'll want to have over and over again.\"\nBrian Henk, Overworld Games, Designer of Good Cop Bad Cop\n  \"It's a fun game that I think will only get better with more plays.\"\nJason Glover, Greygnome Games\n  \"Deceptively cute, PD is a light, yet deeply strategic card game that keeps you on your toes until the very end.\"\nChris Chu, play-tester\n  \"A nice challenge in a small package. I like that I can plan a couple of turns ahead and that my plans are never totally wiped out, but I have to continually respond to changes in the available cards.\"\nKell Brigan, play-tester\n \n\"Project Dreamscape might put on a cute, simple facade, but there is deep strategy to be found in this dream world. The ability to rearrange the dreamscape and play powers off of other players' cards is a fresh and ever-changing way to formulate your strategy. Just don't plan too far in advance, because other players' sinister arrangements can plunge your perfect plan into deep sleep!\"\nJohn Shulters, play-tester\n  Richard Ham, Rahdo Runs Through:\n Nick Meenachan, Board Game Brawl:\n  Dave Taylor, To The Table: Full disclosure: David Taylor is a guy that I believe in and I enjoy his reviews, so I really wanted him to try out Project Dreamscape; however, I do support him on Patreon, so please keep that in mind.\nJeff King, All Us Geeks: Full disclosure: Jeff King is also a good friend of ours, but as he explains in this video, that didn't even need to be considered:\nAll pledge levels from $16 and up will also include the premium Print-and-Play files, which feature the final files (including the cards, backs, box, and rules) sent to the manufacturer!\nThis very limited pledge level will get you a copy of the special edition (See the Dreamer pledge), as well as one of the original water color art pieces from Project Dreamscape\u2019s eight dream types--not a print, but the original painting. These beautiful pieces of art measure 4x6\" and will be handled by Julie herself in a stylish frame of her choice.\n\nEach of these paintings are first-backed, first served. If you back at this level, please send me a private message letting me know which painting you\u2019d like to have.\nWant to see some larger versions of the artwork? Check out our gallery on BoardGameGeek!\n If you would like to add one or more of the items below to your pledge, simply increase the dollar amount of your pledge by the price listed under each add-on. After the campaign is over, but long before shipping begins, I will send out a survey to ask you what add-ons you included in your pledge.\n$15 - Roll-Up Game Mat\nPainted by Julie Okahara, this completely optional (but totally awesome) roll-up mat depicts a field of dreamers with the cards placed over them representing their dreams. Directly below them are the Z shields from the back of the deck which depict the Z card cost for the card in that space. Above, their collective dream features the sun (the draw pile), and the moon (the discard pile). This mat measures 10x15\" and has an 1/8\" rubber backing.\n $15 - Extra Copy\nGrab additional copies of Project Dreamscape for only $15 each. A great way to save on shipping!\nAll backer rewards will ship from the US.\nProject Dreamscape will cost about $5 to ship domestically, and this is built into the cost of the game. For international shipments, there is a small extra charge to help with shipping costs:\nBase game: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and the game mat: +$4 for international shipping\nBase game and Tower: +$8 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition: +$10 for international shipping\nCollector's Edition and artwork: +$20 for international shipping\nThese premiums are only applied once. For example, if you order two copies of Project Dreamscape, you will still only pay the $4 one time; however, while Project Dreamscape is naturally import-friendly thanks to its small size and low price point, anything more than the base game may be subject to extra fees.  \nWe will be holding a local pick up event when the games arrive, at a location in the Sacramento, CA area. The option to attend will be available when surveys go out.\nA word from Ben Haskett...\nSarah and Will organize a game designers meeting each month, where local designers can get together and play test each other's games. I was first invited to attend the meet-up about two years ago (where we became good friends), and it was at one of these meetings that I first played Project Dreamscape.\nI remember the first couple of turns very well, as I struggled a little bit to find my footing. I understood the basics; you use facedown cards to buy faceup cards, you play one of the two options on each card, you chain them together... but on my third or fourth turn, the game just clicked for me. I realized that these eight dream types, while perhaps a bit mild when played alone, could be combined for a very satisfying \"never-ending turn\" effect found in games like Dominion. By the end of the first game, I knew we had to take Project Dreamscape to the next level.\nWill and Sarah Reed\nThe two of them already had an artist in mind, Julie Okahara, who created some beautiful watercolor art for the game.  Playful and dreamy, with just a hint of uneasiness, her paintings were a perfect fit for the game's tone.  Her work typically utilizes mixed media, which is in full effect here--if you look closely at the card art, you can see that sections are cut out to reveal all sorts of glittered and textured papers.\nThe design goal with Project Dreamscape was to create a big experience in a small package--not a micro game, mind you, but simply a small game that packed a lot of compelling decisions into a 30-minutes experience.  The mechanics came first, and the theme was later integrated as Will lay awake at night tying to pair something with the game; when you're asking yourself, \"What do people want the most?\" late at night, I suppose it's easy to understand why Will settled on sleep as an appropriate theme.\nFor more insight into Sarah and Will's design process, check out their designer blog posts on Project Dreamscape:\nHow I Designed Project Dreamscape\nMechanics First\nSetting Design Goals\nIncorporating Play Styles\nUnexpected Group Think\nTiming & Number of Players\nExpanding Meaningful Choices\nModifying for Production\nIncorporating Play-Tester Feedback\nItems for the Future\nUnconventional Player Interaction\nThe Finished Look\nAll of Project Dreamscape's artwork was hand-painted by the talented Julie Okahara.

While my first campaign was very successful, there was still a lot to learn from the experience that I will be able to apply directly to Project Dreamscape. There may be unforeseen circumstances (my first campaign is a testament to them!), but I pride myself on being open and honest about every step of the process; even if it\u2019s bad news, I\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re aware.\n\nI have two personal goals with this campaign, and the first is to deliver on time. Having been through the process now, I feel like I have a better understanding of where delays might occur, and I've taken measures to solve those issues beforehand. Further, Project Dreamscape has the benefit of being a small card game. This will greatly reduce the amount of time required by the manufacturer to produce a proof copy, and mitigate the chance for issues--in other words, Project Dreamscape will be able to begin production very soon after the close of the campaign.\n\nMy second goal is to make shipping easier for international backers--there was some behind-the-scenes confusion in my first campaign concerning how EU shipments were to be handled. Project Dreamscape will ship out to backers from the US, but to touch on the game's size once more, it's small enough that one copy of the game will easily ship from the US in a small package and almost certainly not get held for additional customs/broker fees.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Oaxaca: Crafts of a Culture is Now Live!", "update_content": " "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Undine in 2017 \u2013 Audio Books and Board Games", "update_content": "Hello, dreamers!

The mega companies involved in the process are fiercely competitive. When a new mining location is discovered, each company sends out a fully robotic mining base. Before mining begins, the companies attack each others bases. When only one base is left standing, the victor gets exclusive rights to reap the benefits.\nPlayers play as one of the companies and try to build their own base while eliminating the competition. The last player with a base still standing wins. The base game mechanic involves laying cards in a grid to form a \"base\". Each card or \"Module\" acts differently. The 5 base cards are, the solar panel, the turret, the repair bot, the ray shield and the processor.\n\"The Space Base Race is just addicting and fast enough to keep everyone coming back. The game is simple, yet it\u2019s surprisingly compelling.\"\n-- Cameron McFarland, writer for We The Nerdy\n\n\"The Space Base Race is a fun combat style game that plays fairly quick. If you enjoy games where there is lots of backstabbing, attacking, and building up an efficient engine, this will be a game for you.\"\n-- Board Game Duel\n\n\"It is definitely one of those 'simple enough for anyone, but also interesting enough for everyone,' games.\"\n-- James Flemming, writer for Board Games with Flartner\n\n\nI currently have several other reviewers writing a review for the game, and when they are done I will post them here as well.\nI would love some more reviews for The Space Base Race. If you would like to write a review, please let me know. I would be happy to send you a review copy.\nAttached is a video explaining the rules of The Space Base Race:\nIf for some reason you can't watch the video here is a link to a printable PDF of the rules. Rule Book\nAn example base with the final cards.\nWhen you back this project at any level, you will get a print and play copy of the game right away. This means you can start playing the game today!\nFor $25 you can get the printed version of the game compete with some really cool power crystals for power tokens, and a handy storage bag.\nThe game is complete including artwork. So, if it is successfully funded, I can get the cards printed quickly and get them shipped out to you ASAP. \nSome examples of the final cards\nThe higher backer rewards include getting your name printed on a card or even getting to name an asteroid mining company!\nThis is the first card game I made that I am releasing to the public. Kickstarter is a good way to gauge the demand for a game like this.\nI ran a campaign for this game in November 2014 and, due to several key mistakes on my part, only raised $1300. So now I'm relaunching this improved project.\nThe game is in its final version, the only changes will be to add the names of the backers of that respective tier and rename the mining companies if anyone chooses that reward. The printer for the cards has already been chosen, and I have selected vendors for the power tokens and the storage bags. So this isn't a half finished game or some loose concept.\nThe major design stages\nI figure I should talk numbers now.\nI am using Printer Studio to print the cards, it is a \"Print on Demand\" printer so I can order a smaller numbers of decks then I could with a traditional printer. The cost to print the cards gets a lot cheaper if I order at least 72 decks of 126 cards though. That was the main factor in deciding my funding goal.\nThe total cost is going to come out to around $20 dollars per printed game plus Kickstarter fees, Credit Card fees and taxes.\nThe prices for each component are as follows\n126 Poker sized cards from Printer Studio = $10.50\n75 \"Acrylic Ice Rocks\" from Party Spin = $2.47 (Half a package of the \"Apple Green\" color)\n1 5\" by 7\" Drawstring bag from State Line Bag Co. = ~$0.40 (Depends on how many I need, you order in quantities of 100)\n1 Priority Mail Flat Rate Box = $5.95\nTotal = ~$19.32 Per copy\nThe remaining funds are for the unexpected expenses that I know will show up, along with all the fees and taxes.\nHere is a nice pie chart showing how the funds will be spent:\n So, in conclusion, to produce 72 copies of The Space Base Race, at $25 per copy would be $1800. Adding 10% for Kickstarter and Credit Card fees comes to $1980. Round up to the nearest hundred and you get my funding goal of $2000.\nMy name is Alex Hicks. Because I'm 16, my mom made an account for me. I am also homeschooled, so my mom is letting this be a school project. My mom is awesome!\nI really enjoy playing any kind of game including, video games, board games, and sports. I also love creating games and designing art for them. An example of my previous work is this app. It was mostly an experiment with an art style I ended up using for this project.\nI have no specific plan for the future of The Space Base Race after this Kickstarter. This may well be your only chance to pick it up.\nI do plan to release more games in the future, and maybe even Kickstart them.\nIf you are a distributor or a publisher or someone like that, and you are interested in this game, please let me know! I would be happy to work something out with you.\nStretch goals\nI'm going to wait to see how well this project does before adding any stretch goals.

Each turn players will play 1 card to the 7 columns and then redraw to 3 cards at the end of their turn.\nWhen one of the 7 columns is full of 7 cards the game ends and the player holding the most points wins.\nThrough thoughtful card play wielding the powers of 7, players vie to strengthen their hands while diminishing the hands of their opponents. Perhaps 7's and 6's are reduced to no value through the Ages of Man; or, all Indigo cards are now valued at 7 because of the Colors of the Rainbow power.

He is a birding fanatic who considers the whole western US to be his backyard.\nSlim Mittens is a graphic designer and life long gamer. He did the graphic design for Birds of a Feather, making sure everything looks great and is easy to use. While he is not yet a birder, Teale is stubbornly working on him.\nTrevor and Teale, looking at a duck.\nNothing Sacred Games is a small design studio based in Berkeley, California that focuses on playful, accessible tabletop games that make you think about the world a little differently.

When everyone has placed their cards, you shout \"DRAW\" and reveal them.\nPhase Three  - The Aftermath: There is a unique order resolution system to determine who's spell resolves first, which ones fail, or which ones go head to head into a \"face-off\" mini-game. \nDownload the Rules: http://tinyurl.com/ps5xp2y\nOr watch this series of short video tutorials explaining the game:\nEach player has the same 6 elements spells, each of which have their own unique abilities, strengths and weaknesses.\nThere are six element spells: Fire, Earth, Water, Ice, Wind, Lightning.\nElements are weak or strong to one another. For instance, Ice is weak to Fire, but it is also strong to Wind. When a spell is \"weak\" to the opposing spell, it will be cancelled out. \nA blackjack like mini-game occurs when element spells are played and do not have a weak/strong relationship. This mini-game is called a \"Face-off\".\nThere are only 10 cards in the number deck, making it easy to count cards and judge your odds.\nIn a face-off, players will take turns drawing cards, trying to strong arm their opponent's spell. The winner's spell goes through, and the losers is cancelled out.\nThere are 30 unique signature spells which players use to customize their hand.\nSignature spells provide a multitude of ways to play mind games on your foes, or strategize with friends.\nYour signature spells are unique to you, and you may only have 3.

It isn't complicated to pick up and play but once you get into the thick of it, it can be a mind battle between you and your opponent.

He is fascinated with the CCG genre and owns the original artwork for MtG card \"Giant Tortoise\" painted by Kaja Foglio.\nDarren Atherton\nAlthough no longer involved with the development of Grimslingers, Darren was extremely instrumental in developing the game in the early days and providing months of playtesting.\nALL OF YOU! \nGrimslingers would be no where without the many dedicated fans offering feedback and support.

This should pose no problem for you and your party, who are known throughout the lands as the best goblin hunters around. To make things interesting it\u2019s time to settle a little bet and see who is the best Goblin Hunter overall by being the first to capture 20 goblins.  \nAdventurer Cards - Please note while art is final font and layout design is still to be finalized\nGoblin Hunters is our second game, following on the heels of our first successful Kickstarter Alchemist Academy. Goblin Hunters is a fast paced push-your-luck style card game combined with set collection and a betting mechanic for 2 to 4 players and is played within 10 to 15 minutes. The Goblin Hunters base game comes with 4 different character cards to choose from, and more will be added as stretch goals are reached. Each character comes with their own special ability which can be used once per turn when they go hunting to give you an added advantage.\n\u2022 Goblin search deck\n\u2022 Individual character cards for each adventurer\n\u2022 Character score piece for each adventurer\n\u2022 Character betting token for each adventurer\n\u2022 Map Score Board and Betting board\n\u2022 Rulebook\nSearch Cards - Please note while art is final font and layout design is still to be finalized\nThe Search deck contains 3 types of cards: Goblin Cards, Wound Cards and Goblin/Wound Cards. The aim of the game is to collect as many goblins as possible without taking too many wounds, while also trying to collect sets of goblins to gain extra bonuses.\n\nThis is not the only way to score bonus points, you can also bet on the results of the other adventurers, risking your hard earned goblin points for more bonus goblin points. It's a high risk with high rewards. So the next time you're in the tavern healing from your wounds and mouthing off about who is best Goblin Hunter, make sure you can put your money where your mouth is and bet on your fellow adventurers.\n\nThis is the perfect game to play while having a few laughs with some friends, between other games or while waiting for the rest of your party of adventurers to arrive for a big night of gaming.\nPlayer Board\nShipping should be added automatically during the pledging process depending on your location, however below is a breakdown of shipping costs for the core game (Hunter level) unless specified differently on the pledge level.\nUSA / Canadian backers, Kickstarter should ask for $6 AUD shipping = ($5 USD)\n\nAustralian Backers, Kickstarter should ask for $8 AUD\nRest of the world, Kickstarter should ask for $10 AUD  shipping = ($8.00 USD)\nPlease note there is a special Australians only reward level to which includes free shipping for this level only for all other levels Australian shipping will be added as normal.\nGoblin Hunters has been in development for a little over a year. We have already invested in the design, layout and artwork which has been produced by F\u00e1bio Fontes. Now we need your help to get the first print run off the ground. We hope that with your help we will be able to produce this game with top quality components. Every dollar this project can raise will go towards increasing the print run and production quality of the game through stretch goals, while keeping the price of each game as low as possible. With your help we will be able to share this game, not just with backers, but with everyone.\n\nPreviews/ Reviews and Interviews\nSharkbone Podcast -  Here is an interview I did with Devon from the Sharkbone podcast http://sharkbonepodcast.com/2015/03/chum-30-goblin-hunters/\nThe Meeple Mechanic - A nice little written interview  over at the Meeple Mechanic http://meeplemechanic.com/foxhole-fiver/ray-williams-on-designing-goblin-hunters/\nThe Action Points Podcast - Here is interview I did with Adam and Aaron, two of he host of the Action Points podcast where we talk about Goblin Hunters, Board game design and Kickstarter in general and loads more.  \nhttp://theactionpointspodcast.com/2015/03/17/the-action-points-podcast-episode-79-goblin-hunting-with-ray-williams/\nAustralian Tabletop Gaming Network - Here is a great review of Goblin Hunters written by Bodhi over at ATGN.\nhttp://atgn.com.au/goblin-hunters-kickstarter-interview-game-preview/\nWant to see the rules first and see how simple and easy it is to learn Goblin Hunters?

If you discover the game after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (it\u2019s the same version you see here with all stretch goals) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of Viticulture and Euphoria bring you Between Two Cities, a partnership-driven, tile-drafting, competitive city-building game that 1-7 players can play in 20-25 minutes.\nDesigned by Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley and developed by Jamey Stegmaier, Between Two Cities caught the attention of Stonemaier Games thanks to the unique intersection between cooperative play (build cities with 2 partners) and competitive play (only 1 winner).\nYou can experience the way Between Two Cities blends the gameplay of 7 Wonders, Carcassonne, Alhambra, and Among the Stars by checking out the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe 6 tile types in the game: Shop, Park, House, Office, Tavern, and Factory.\nBetween Two Cities is a complete game with a full set of linen-embossed tiles and custom wooden tokens, but we have some stretch goals to help make the game experience even better!\nAll stretch goals are fully playtested (see photos of some of our amazing playtesters below) and will be included in every copy of Between Two Cities (Kickstarter and retail).\nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files. Between Two Cities has been playtested by over 250 people and is almost production-ready.\nFind all media mentions and reviews of Between Two Cities on our website and join the discussion about the game on BoardGameGeek.\nBoard Game Quest preview\nGeekDad review\nTheology of Games review\nBoard Gamers Anonymous review (podcast and written review)\nFather Geek review\nE&E's Spellenmolen (Dutch review)\nNVS Gameplays\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Between Two Cities within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it for a full pledge refund. We'll even pay for shipping.\nLimited Availability: We don't do Kickstarter exclusive items, but we'll only print a limited number of the special edition as based on the final pledge totals.\nMake It Better for Everyone: The more stretch goals we reach, the more enhanced and beautiful the game will be! \nWe Listen: We treat backers as collaborators--we truly value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game, and we promptly address all questions and ideas.\nLocalized Shipping: Our shipping fees for Kickstarted games are so low because we send games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world. This is your chance to lock in the lowest possible shipping rate.\nBackers Come First: You'll get your copy of Between Two Cities well before it enters traditional distribution channels. Remember that retailers can be backers too!\nWe Need You: We've covered the cost of graphic design, art, and development for Between Two Cities, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nA few of the 250+ playtesters who helped us along the way.\nWe ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to eliminate customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low (this method is explained here; country codes are here).\nBackers are limited to 3 total copies per pledge, as that's the number that can fit inside a shipping carton with proper packaging. For additional copies, you can pledge under a different Kickstarter account.\nBetween Two Cities is played in three rounds. In each round, you'll start with a fresh hand of tiles. Select two of those tiles, passing the rest to the player on your left or right (depends on the round). Place one of those tiles in the city on your left and one in the city on your right, then pick up the hand that was passed to you and repeat the process.\nThe middle round actually involves drawing 3 rectangular \"duplex\" tiles (two building tiles side by side in a vertical or horizontal configuration) and selecting 2 of them--there is no drafting in this round.\nAfter all three rounds, you will have built a 4x4 city on your left and a 4x4 city on your right. Add up the scores for all cities, but only compare your lowest scoring city to each other player's lowest-scoring city to determine the winner.\nEach of the tiles (art shown below) scores in the following way. The final tiles have scoring reminders below the art:\nShop (yellow): The more shops you have in a row or column, the higher the score.\nPark (green): Each group of adjacent parks score an ascending amount of points based on the number park tiles in the group.\nHouse (brown): Each house scores a point for each other tile type in the city (they want variety).\nOffice (blue): The more offices, the better. If they're next to at least 1 Tavern, they score a bonus point.\nTavern (red): There are 4 types of taverns (different icons)--you want to get as many sets of different tavern types as possible.\nFactory (gray): The cities with the most factories score more points per factory than other cities.\nThe game includes a head-to-head 2-player variant that removes the partnership mechanism but increases the impact of the tiles you choose to pass (or not pass) to your opponent. \nClick here for the rules and the free playtest version of the print-and-play files.\nThe special edition of Between Two Cities features a limited-run version of the game. The game itself is the same, but the box will be embossed in gold foil highlights and will be stamped with a number unique to your copy of the game (e.g., \"1287 / 4000\"). The special edition also includes rules in French and German (in addition to English rules).\nThe special edition will also include 7 additional pairs of city tokens. When we were designing the city tokens, we designed 14 of them and had e-newsletter subscribers vote on their favorites. The top 7 were selected for the retail game, but we liked the other 7 so much that we decided to include them in the special edition for extra flavor. They do not expand the game past 7 players or impact the gameplay in any way.\nIn addition to the standard city tokens, the special edition also includes the Arc de Triomphe, US Capitol, Brandenburg Gate, St. Basil's, Big Ben, the White House, and the Forbidden City. Each token in the final version will be a unique color.\nOne of the exciting aspects of designing a complete core game is you generate a lot of ideas for expansions. We look forward to discussing these possibilities with backers during and after the Kickstarter campaign to see the types of expansions they're the most excited about. These are the two styles of expansions we're considering:\nVertical: These would expand upon the base game, allowing players to develop their cities through the ages by adding more rounds and new tile types.\nHorizontal: These would take the core mechanisms of the game and translate them to other themes, like Between Two Castles, Planets, Dystopias, etc.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of our game to retailers during the campaign. If you're a retailer, please contact Jamey directly at stonemaiergames@gmail.com for pricing information and manually make your pledge in full through Kickstarter during the campaign.\nBen Rosset is the designer of Mars Needs Mechanics, Brew Crafters, and Brew Crafters: The Travel Card Game.

Shipping cannot be consolidated with other products.\nIf you don't see our games at your local game store, you can ask a manager to restock them. Thanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Two Cities is a first for us in that it's the first game published by Stonemaier Games that wasn't designed by Jamey Stegmaier--rather, it's from designers Ben Rosset and Matthew O'Malley. Jamey served as the game's developer, honing it, balancing it, and trying to make sure that every decision is fun and interesting. This process was made easy by the designers' willingness to hear and test new ideas.\n\nDuring the evolution of Stonemaier Games, we've learned the importance of blind playtesting (having people learn the game from the rulebook and test the game away from the designers). We've been fortunate to have hundreds of Stonemaier Ambassadors and their friends volunteer to playtest our games so as to make them as good as possible for the first print run. We've also learned the value of having checks and balances at every step in the production process, but when we do mess up, we go above and beyond to remedy the error.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisers to point us in the right direction. We also work with Panda Game Manufacturing to produce the game, a company with a wealth of knowledge and experience.\n\nStonemaier Games has delivered all of our Kickstarter rewards from 4 projects within a few months of the estimated delivery date, sometimes even early. However, we seek to continue to improve that process to keep shipping rates low, deliver quickly, and ensure that the games arrive in perfect condition. We've learned that shipments sent from China to Australia need fumigation certificates for wooden components and that products shipped anywhere need \"Made in China\" clearly listed on the exterior of every product for them to clear customs. In short, we've made mistakes, and not only have we learned from them, we've shared them transparently with backers and on our blog to help other creators.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our Kickstarter experiences and research, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 100+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Between Two Cities: Capitals Release Day!", "update_content": "Today is a special day.

That time is long past. On what was once a partially terraformed outpost world, the descendants of the long-dead colony struggle to eke out an existence on a planet that is growing ever more inhospitable.\nYou are Princess Tahira of Avestan, a small kingdom to the west of humanity\u2019s last great city, Babylon. The death of your brother has left you as the sole, unwilling heir to the Throne. After your anxiety over this burden sparked an argument with your father, you left Avestan to explore the lands that lie to the south.\nA year later, a message arrives warning of a vast army intent on returning to the stars, crushing all who stand in its way, and begging you to return home.\nIt is here that your real journey begins.\nIn Tahira the story and combat are intrinsically tied together. Every battle you fight has different objectives, which are informed by the story. In one, you fight desperately to hold a town long enough for its citizens to flee. In another you ambush an enemy squadron, trying to rout them before they can make use of their superior numbers.\nWhen you\u2019re not fighting you\u2019ll have the chance to walk around your surrounds, engage with your travelling companions, and learn more about the different cultures you\u2019ll encounter as you travel on the road.\nWe're writing Tahira's story episodically, and this campaign will cover the remaining costs of the first episode. We\u2019ve chosen this format so we can execute the scope of what we feel Tahira should be.\nEpisode One will feature a dense and thrilling plot with fleshed out characters who develop over the course of the game. Taking cues from studios like Bioware and Telltale Games, decisions and progression you make in Episode One will continue to influence your journey through later episodes. We estimate Episode One will run for 4-5 hours and are designing it to have the density of an episodic Telltale game.\nTrekking through the Himalayas and exploring the Middle East were the dual inspirations for Tahira. Beyond anything else, we want to transport you to another world and to take you on a journey that will stay with you well after you have finished playing.\nA character-driven story centred upon Tahira, an unwilling princess forced into a leadership role she never expected.\nA rich cast of colourful characters, from a bitter, drunk merchant to a swaggering mercenary power-couple.\nPainstakingly rotoscoped animations, with the frame-by-frame technique creating a realistic, hand-drawn appearance.\nA journey across hand-painted environments, which showcase the bittersweet beauty of a dying world.\nChallenging strategic combat, which demands that the player both plan ahead and adapt to a changing battlefield.\nA modern twist on classic turn-based tactics where units tire and grow more vulnerable throughout the fight, and your units can skip the turn queue and act instantly.\nA wide range of scenarios, ranging from scrappy fights between a couple of soldiers to epic sieges where the player must manage multiple fronts.\nUpgrade your forces, choosing from a range of improvements to suit a variety of play-styles.\nLearn the history of both the current denizens of a former frontier world, and the ancient space-faring people who first explored it.\nAn atmospheric soundtrack composed by Max LL that incorporates the sounds and textures of Central Asia and the Middle East.\nTahira's combat is inspired by childhoods spent secretly playing Gameboy games such as Fire Emblem, Advance Wars and Final Fantasy Tactics under the covers. As well as more modern titles like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and The Banner Saga.\nActing through Tahira, the player leads their forces into battle by taking control of several groups of units, each with their own distinct stats and abilities. Leveraging the unique skills of your diverse team is the key to victory.\nAny leader needs allies, and Tahira is no exception. She is joined in combat by several great warriors, each leading a cadre of troops who share their leader's strengths. As the game progresses, you'll unlock opportunities to upgrade each of these heroes. When you do so, you upgrade their personal stats, skills and abilities as well as those of their followers. The system takes inspiration from XCOM and Starcraft 2: these aren\u2019t just little skill point buffs, they\u2019re distinct choices that will change the way you play the game.\nThe combat system in Tahira is designed to simulate the flow of a real battle. Rather than relying on the traditional \"we all move, then you all move\" system, turn order is assigned dynamically, based on the speed of each of the fighters.The game's heroes can skip this queue and act immediately - at a cost - creating opportunities for skilled tacticians to turn the tide of a losing fight, or punish an enemy in a weak position before it has a chance to rally. Additionally, as fights progress, your troops grow fatigued. Each attack suffered by a unit reduces its defence, meaning that your force becomes exponentially more vulnerable as the battle wears on.\nTo further create a sense of realism in combat, no two combat scenarios are alike. Battles in Episode One will range from scrappy skirmishes between a handful of soldiers, to epic sieges involving dozens of units and multiple fronts. In these larger fights, players will need to act on a solid strategy, distributing their forces between two or three areas, and prioritizing certain objectives at the expense of others.\nIn Tahira you\u2019ll encounter dozens of characters, ranging from a depressed alcoholic wine merchant, to a swaggering mercenary power couple. Some will ask for your help, others will travel with you and a special few will fight alongside you.\nConversation is an important part of Tahira. You\u2019ll be given opportunities to talk to your travelling companions as you progress through Episode One and your interactions with them will have consequences within the story and the battles you fight.\nThe sounds you\u2019ll hear in Tahira are an integral part of the experience we are building. We want to transport you to another world, a world that is familiar enough to feel real but alien enough to excite your imagination.\nWe\u2019ve partnered with the talented Max LL to score Tahira\u2019s soundtrack. Max has just returned from many months spent traveling through Central Asia, capturing the sounds and textures of the region.\nHere's an alternative version of the music he wrote for the trailer:\nFrom the moment we heard his music, we knew we wanted to work with him. We can't wait to hear him bring the emotion and cultures of Tahira's world to life.\nThe other integral part of the audio is the sound design. Each of our environments will have its own detailed soundscape. We want you to feel as if you\u2019re really journeying across the world as you play. We\u2019re working with Sound Designer Brendan Holyland to achieve this. \nHere's a little sneak peek of some of his early work for The Southern Waypoint.\nLaunch \u2013 Tahira will launch on PC, Mac and Linux. We hope to release on Steam (see our Greenlight campaign) and we will also release a DRM-free copy of the game.\nBeta \u2013 We will be running a beta later in the year. If our Greenlight Campaign is successful we will conduct it using Steam. All backers who pledge $35 or above will receive Beta Access.\nWe\u2019re a three person team and we don\u2019t want to promise new features that will delay the game by months, or worse be dropped when we realise we can\u2019t execute them.\nInstead we\u2019ve picked two goals that we think would make very positive additions to the experience of playing Tahira, and budgeted them to exactly what we need to make them a reality.\nBackers at this tier will get exclusive, Kickstarter-only access to an alternative version of Episode One: Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! This version of the game will be a loving parody of the decade which gave us some of gaming's most iconic characters, and will be embellished with all things '80s:\nOver-the-top neon colours.\nGarish visual effects.\nIncredibly questionable style decisions.\nIt will also have a talking horse.\nWhile Super Fresh Ultimate Tahira X! will be fundamentally the same game as Echoes of the Astral Empire, it will amount to a completely different playing experience. All of the game's art will be lovingly (heinously) re-coloured  and Tahira will get a stylin' new pair of shades. Further, the script will be partially re-written, as Tahira's equine companion Iba has mystically gained the power of speech.\nThese mugs have frames from the most action-y parts of our favourite character animations printed on them.\nChoose from one of the following designs:\nThe Hammer's earth-shattering strike\nA Footsoldier's attacking lunge\nThe Claw's vicious swing\nTahira channelling her staff's energy\nWe'll ask for your preference when we send out the backer surveys.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" (A1) high quality glossy stock.\nThe image we've uploaded of this really doesn't do it justice. It's a gorgeous, incredibly detailed piece of art. For example, you can clearly see both The Hammer and The Claw among the people walking through the valley.\nCommissioned from Italian artist Simone D\u2019armini, the T-shirt features Tahira in action across the chest and the Tahira logo on the back of the neck.\nThe T-Shirt will be printed on a 100% cotton white tee. It will be available in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s styles. We will ask for your size and gender preference when we send out the backer surveys.\n(Artist's impression of what it'll look like. We haven't made the book yet.)\nThe Art of Tahira will be equal parts art book and development journal. It'll contain heaps of otherwise-unreleased concept art, stories from Tahira\u2019s development, and details about our creative process. The book will have approximately 80 full-colour pages printed on high quality glossy paper. It will be a soft cover book, with the cover printed onto 320 GSM.\nPlease note that we won't be finalising the book until we've shipped the game as we want to include all the finished art work from Episode One.\nWant to be a part of the game? We've got you covered. Pledge to this tier, and we'll transform your likeness into one of the game's characters.\nWe'll ask you to take photographs of yourself and then the transformation will begin! You'll likely have a few different portraits done, with different expressions and emotions.\nThis pledge tier is limited to three people, as we've only got so many persistent roles in the game, and we want to guarantee that those who pledge to this tier don't see themselves become nameless henchmen who get mown down after speaking a single line.\nAvestan wasn\u2019t always the city it is now. Hundreds of years ago, before the people of Babylon spread west across the mountains, the people of Avestan were tribal villagers whose belief system was rooted in a shamanic reverence of the earth and sky.\nSome still follow the old ways.\nTahira will meet one of these mystics on the road and - through him - will learn of her nation's ancestral roots.\nThe backer of this tier will work one-on-one with our writer, Peter Castle, to help create a folk tale for the mystic to tell Tahira. If you're the kind of person who enjoys mythology, fairy tales, or teaching through elaborate metaphors, this may be the reward for you.\nWe have a real treat for art lovers with this limited edition run of ten framed fine art prints of the poster design.\nCommissioned from Iranian born Disney Artist, Merhdad Isvandi, this beautiful piece will be printed on 23.4\" x 33.1\" fine art watercolour paper:\nMuseum quality,\nAcid free\nArchival with guarantee for 75 years.\nWe've framed these beautiful prints in a 30.43\" x 39.84\" rusted gold frame. We've already got one on our office wall. Believe us when we say the pictures don't do this piece justice.\nIn a word, independence. So far, we've been working to create the game we want to make, without having to compromise with anyone. The price we've paid for this is that we don't have investors or a publisher. We've survived financially by all working part-time jobs, but this can't be sustained.\nOur artist Peter S, gets up each morning at 3am and spends five hours baking muffins before he comes into the office. He then draws for a solid 8 hours before going home, going to bed, and starting all over again. With your support we can remove the distraction and stress of having a second job, and focus entirely on making Tahira as good as it can be.\nThough it is mainly a means of restoring our team's sanity, Kickstarter also lets us add features that we otherwise couldn't afford. One of those features is contracting the immensely talented Max LL, who created the music for our trailer, to write the whole soundtrack for Episode One\nWe've been working on Episode One of Tahira for 18 months. In that time we\u2019ve built functioning versions of all the gameplay systems, created half of the game\u2019s art, written a comprehensive draft of Episode One\u2019s story and developed a world with a history that stretches back hundreds of years.\nStill-to-do remains the other half of the art and a ton of iteration and polish on the gameplay. The bulk of the remaining art work that still needs to be done are the animations. The frame-by-frame, hand-drawn style we've chosen meaning that each character takes roughly a month and a half to animate from start-to-finish. \nRelease\nWe expect to have the full game playable by July 2015 and to have it ready for release by January 2016. We\u2019ve given ourselves those six months between July and January to polish the game and to conduct a Beta Test as it\u2019s very important to us that we take the time we need to do the game justice. \nWhen we sat down and imagined what Tahira could be, we knew we wanted to show players a vast world with a rich history. We wanted our characters to develop and grow realistically and we wanted to design epic battles in which you defend fortresses and cities. In short, we wanted Tahira to have the scope of an epic fantasy series. Then we remembered we\u2019re only three people.\nTo create a game with the visual fidelity and scope that we\u2019re aiming for would take the three of us a very long time. We talked to some of our peers and they suggested we could make the game episodic. The more we thought about it, the more we liked the idea.\nMaking Tahira episodically allows us to design each episode with a beginning, middle and climactic end. It gives us the means to do justice to our vision. As we move through the series, each game will add new playable characters, which we simply couldn\u2019t spend the time making if we were trying to create all of Tahira in one go. You\u2019ll see so much more of the world in this format and have many more opportunities to talk to your travel companions. It also lets us take feedback on board from you, the players, and gives us the opportunity to iterate on all of our systems. We think it will be a better experience for you and for us, win-win.\nHow many episodes?\nWe envision two seasons of Tahira games. Season One of Tahira will have two episodes. At this stage we have written a draft for the entire series, but other than that, all of our work over the last 18 months has gone into Episode One. This is how we will continue to work. We will work on Episode One until we are happy it\u2019s met the quality bar we\u2019ve set ourselves and then we\u2019ll move onto Episode Two. \nHow long?\nWe're shooting for 4-5 hours for Episode One. We're not adding any filler, it'll just be you playing through the best story we can write, fighting battles in unique scenarios and having lots of conversations with your traveling companions. We're making Episode One as dense as we can without adding fluff for the sake of padding it out.\nWhale Hammer Games is a three person independent developer based out of Canberra, Australia. We're a team brought together by a mutual desire to use games as a medium to tell compelling stories.\nPeter Castle (Writer + Producer)\nPeter is a published travel writer and award winning creative writer. He loves to write, draw and to travel to remote places. He wants to create games that capture the exhilaration, sense of discovery and retrospection that he experiences when he travels.\nTom Cox (Programming + Design)\nTom graduated with a Bachelor of Software Development from the Australian National University in 2012. He is an avid gamer who believes in the ability of games to challenge people and influence their broader perspective on life. He wants to make games that have this effect on people, and help them explore real-world issues in a meaningful way.\nPeter Simpson (Artist)\nPeter worked as a Photoshop Artist and Illustrator for ten years before writing his book Practical Anatomy for Artists, which was published in 2010. He relishes the challenge of bringing a new world to life in a striking visual style.\nFIND TAHIRA ON\nFacebook\nTwitter\nOur Mailing List\nTahiragame.com\nWhalehammergames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough each member of the team is well-versed in his own field, the fact remains that none of us has published a game before. We have done a great deal to minimize this risk by building a functioning prototype prior to going to Kickstarter, and by going through the asset-creation process for everything we'll need, at least once.\n\nThere will always be unforeseen issues along the way. We've already encountered plenty, but we're committed to finishing the game and making it as good as it can be. You have our word on that.\n \nThe funding goal we\u2019ve set will give us the resources we need to finish the game.
