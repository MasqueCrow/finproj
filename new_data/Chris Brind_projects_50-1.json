[{"backer": "Chris Brind", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "They say the pen is mightier than the sword, and WOWSTICK miniature pen-shaped hand drill is probably a designer\u2019s great friend, helping them to drill and put their imagination into shining works. It is the world's first one-piece miniature electric hand drill for creative DIY, and it features super lightweight, ultra-quietness and great portability.\nFinish your DIY projects with the right tool kit is important. WOWSTICK hand drill helps drill small holes of various things: resin, plastic, wood cardboard, paper cardboard, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil, etc. Aiming at its practicality and simplicity, WOWSTICK is the cordless lithium-ion battery powered drill which is crated just like a pen, an ideal tool for DIY-ers as well as general people.\nNo more clunky gadgets, wires, and plug-points. WOWSTICK one-piece miniature hand drill with its dispatchable head lets you accomplish your creation by gripping up, aiming at the point, and pressing one single button.  \nThe WOWSTICK drill is small and light, just 1.6oz (46g) which fits right in your hand and literally easy to carry anywhere, so you can take it to distant workplaces. Sized at 6.8\u201d*0.6\u201d (172*13.8mm), you can grip it like a pen for ultimate control and precision as well as for comfort.\nIt is not only a great tool for DIY projects, but also a hassle-free decoration to put in your pocket or on any desktop.\nEvery bit of WOWSTICK from outside to inside (Except the button and the charging port) is all metal CNC machined to ensure the seamless curves and consistent product quality. Greatly standing out from the conventional drills in the market, this manner is more precisely made to achieve more stable product performance. Our drilling spindle run-out is far exceeding the industry standard to be less than 0.1mm, resulting in high-precision drilling at the right position every time.\nThe WOWSTICK kit has 8 drill bits made of harden steel: 0.8mm, 1.0mm, 1.2mm, 1.4mm, 1.6mm, 1.8mm, 2.0mm, 2.2mm and it allows drilling at 420r/min \u00b1 10%, so you can use it in many projects and get accurate results.\nThe handheld device is practically designed to cater for different needs, letting you plug in and off bits based on your projects, and the fact that the bits are fully compatible with 2.35 mm diameter bits accessible in the market, you may drill, decorate and attach your crafts freely.\nThe bits can be used on a variety of materials: resin, plastic, wood, clay, bead, crafts, model making, aluminum / copper sheet and foil and more, very practical items in daily life.\nThe WOWSTICK hand drill is ideal DIY workers like in the drilling industry and general people. It will be a good addition to your artisan inventory. It particularly suits those who perform intricate decorations. You can use the mini drill for making holes, for crafts and more applications.\nUse Tips:\nIt is suggested to take in and out alternatively when drilling, so that the residue can be brought out without getting stuck.\nYou may test it on the spare material before use. When there is no issue, you may start drilling holes in your crafts.\nOn harder metal materials,  it is suggested to start with a smaller bit and then shift to a bigger one when it is aiming at a large hole.\nThe smaller the drill bit is, the more attention should be paid. Due to its small size, it is easy to break off when used improperly. \nNote: Be careful of the operation when you are using a finer drill bit since it is easier to break off. You may perform intricate drilling of valuable materials with its unique low speed optimization.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is more than easy to operate. With just one button built at the position of your thumb when you are holding it, you may just start working with a press on the button. When a pause is needed, you may release the button. \nTo replace the bit is also a breeze based on our particularly designed screwless locking mechanism. It is fairly intuitive and no extra tool is needed. Just gently rotate the chuck out, take out the drill bit, put in a new bit, and then secure it. The process can be accomplished within 10 seconds.\nAfter finishing the works, you may put on the drill cap to avoid accidents caused by unintentional pressing of the button. So it is a hassle-free device.\nThe drill has a built-in rechargeable lithium-ion battery so that you don\u2019t have to worry about the distance between the wall plug and workbench or troubles caused when you forget to unplug the power cord. It provides a safe, effective, clean energy, less stressful operation option. It is cordless, tailored pen-shaped designed and operates at 3.7 volts, 1.036Wh. That said, it can be used for at least one month in regular use at its full charge.\nWOWSTICK mini drill is rechargeable via USB type C charging cable. Full charging time is about 40 minutes and can be used about 2 hours.\nWOWSTICK is the sturdy, high quality handheld tool for DIY projects. The whole body is aluminum alloy one-piece molding, giving the most simplified look, comfortable grip and sturdy and durable in use.\nThe motor of the mini drill has also been heat-treated for endurance, so it can continue to work without getting heated for a long time. You will never complain about its quality build.\nWOWSTICK designers have been digging out the maximum abilities of the pen shape. From installations to actual working, creators always like to use the device instantly from idea to prototype and thus may get inspirations at the fingertips.\nIt comes with an improved ergonomic design to ensure comfortable grip in any situation. Using the aluminum alloy shell, it is ultra-compact and light, slim and very easy to handle for detailed projects. Holding it like a pen, its slim grip makes great sense in detailed works. As a result, no matter walnut or resin, you may just focus on the fun of making things.\nGo experiment with the WOWSTICK\u2019s easy drilling. Go ahead and grab your creativity now!\nThe Imezing team consists of a group of designers, engineers and seekers of quality life. Back to simplicity and convenience are our core concept.

They see that you are a Materialist, Xenophobe, and Militaristic Avian Species from a dry world run by an Imperial government.\nEra: Each game is called an Era and lasts about 2 hours. After an Era, you can play the same civilization immediately in a new Era or store and save your civilization in the game box to continue playing later. Each Era you play with a civilization will let you develop them further and explore deeper story lines. A player can also skip playing a Session with the rest of the group and come back in a later Era to continue playing their civilization.\nWinning Eras: You win an Era by being the first to complete a number of communal Objectives. The first player to complete their Objectives wins and the Era ends. The winner will gain an Era Reward that progresses them towards ascension.\nAscending: Your ultimate goal is to Ascend your Civilization. On average, this should take you 6 Eras to achieve. Your Civilization will ascend the game in victory, then does not disappear, but adds new content to the Galaxy for all players to discover! You can then begin a new Civilization with benefits from your ascended one.\nCrisis: As your Civilization approaches Ascension, you will gain the attention of powerful Crisis entities and forces that will threaten the entire Galaxy. If you take too long to Ascend, your aging Empire will encounter an enemy that even your mighty Empire might will fall to.\nGalaxy in a Box: Stellaris Infinite Legacy will let you and your friends build and tell the story of your own galaxy that will grow and change with every Era. You will play civilizations that will expand, ascend, and fall, each adding to and changing the game based on the choices you made.\nYour Story Begins: With your first game, you and your friends will venture into a brand new galaxy that is vast and full of wonder.\nGAME PLAY\nA game is played in Rounds, each of which is composed of 4 Phases. The Rounds are repeated until a player wins the Era.\nDuring a Phase, you will chose to Explore, Expand, Exploit, or Exopolitics. Each player has four Phase Boards, one for each of the listed phase types.\nIn the First phase of a Round, all players secretly choose ANY one of their Phase Boards. Nobody knows which Phase Board their opponents are planning! The players then simultaneously PLAN which Actions on their chosen Phase Board they want to take, spending each Action's required Resources and Leadership from their Reserves. Once everyone is done planning, they will one at a time RESOLVE their Actions. When done resolving, each player flips their Phase Board over to mark that they can not use it again this Round.\nIn the second Phase of the Round, all players will again secretly choose one of their remaining Phase Boards. They all simultaneously Plan their Actions and then one at a time Resolve them.\nAt the end of the Round, once all 4 Phases have been resolved, the players refresh their Resources and Leaders, flip their Phase Boards to their unused sides, and a new Round begins. \nPHASE BOARDS\nClick on the Explore Phase Board below to open a pdf describing each Phase Board. (Note, Kickstarter has a character limit for this campaign page.)\nClick on this image for more Phase Board details.\nStory Paths\nStellaris Infinite Legacy is driven by Story Paths that you develop through your decisions and actions.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent. This was a passion project before it was a product, and seeing the excitement spread throughout the community has almost given us a sense of duty to making flashy-connected-dice happen in the open. We think they are amazing, and we want to put them in your hands!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thanks", "descp": "We will put your name in the code base and in the official Pixels app as a thank you for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["98 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Die", "descp": "Get one individual die of your choice.\nYou will be able to select the exact die size and design through the backer survey after the campaign has concluded.\nWe will also put your name in the code base and in the official Pixels app as a thank you for your support.\n* Please note that shipping will also be charged after the campaign has concluded and will be based on your location.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

The Let\u2019s Dig for Treasure, Let\u2019s Summon Demons, and Don\u2019t Talk to Strangers games will immerse you into these hilariously dark retro worlds. Featuring clever and beautiful fan-favorite artwork, each game is a wild romp through the parallel Rhodes universe. The games are quick to learn and are created for 2-6 players, ages 14 and up.\nDynomite Games is an old-school sub-brand of Cryptozoic Entertainment. With a diverse portfolio of licensed and original IPs, Cryptozoic\u2019s catalog covers a broad spectrum of tabletop games and collectibles including Epic Spell Wars of the Battle Wizards and the DC Deckbuilding games.\n\nWe've made simple, streamlined game engines (with very little set-up time) so that anyone can dive right in--but we've seasoned the games with enough hidden depth and unique design space to satisfy all of you hardcore gamers too!\nCheck out a brief overview of each of these games:\nIt's the funky-freshest Push-Your-Luck experience out there, for the whole family! Just shuffle up the deck and divide it into 3 \"Dig Stacks\" and you're ready to start digging for treasure!\n1. On your turn, choose and \"dig up\" a card from any of the Dig Stacks...look for cards worth a lot of points, or cards that trigger a powerful effect, such as stealing a card from another player!  \n2. You can stop digging at any time, or keep digging up cards for as long as you want...the more cards you dig up before you \"stop,\" the more you stand to gain--but be careful--if you dig up a 2nd Worms Card, or even a SINGLE skeleton card, your turn will end immediately and you'll lose *EVERYTHING* you dug up so far (this turn)! \n3. Once an entire Dig Stack is empty, the game is over and players add up the total point values on their cards!  Be sure to look and see if you scored any \"bonus point\" effects (you did make sure to dig up some Milk to go with your Cookies, right?). \n4. You've got all kinds of zany stuff to find while digging: Loyal Dogs (protect you from a Skeleton!), Sewer Lines (worth negative points--give it to your least favorite opponent!), heck, you might even transcend death with The Crown of the Lich Lord, or turn those pesky worms into big points with Skwirmz the Worm God! \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are little Johnny, Suzy, and Fido supposed to do when the suburban droll has them down? I know, Let's Summon Demons!  Whether you're building sadistic synergies with the \"rotten\" kids or sharing the love with the \"sweet\" kids, only the savviest (and luckiest!) player--the best Demon Summoner--will walk away a winner!\n1. Shuffle up the Demon Deck and the Block Deck, and deal everyone a Starting Candle and a hand of 3 Demons. Your goal is to summon all 3 of those little devils before your opponents beat you to it... \n2. At all times, a rotating assortment of five cards will be available for purchase (the low, low price of 3 soul tokens) to all players--this is called THE BLOCK and it has Boys, Girls, and Animals of every style and strategy! Look for cards that combo together! \n3. On each players' turn, they'll roll the dice--if any player's cards they've acquired \"match\" the total rolled then that card activates--often resulting in the acquisition of more soul tokens! More soul tokens means more cards from THE BLOCK, means even more soul tokens--but to what end?\n4. Well, you can sacr--er--discard 3 of your cards to SUMMON A DEMON! The most powerful cards of all! Once any player has summoned all 3 of their Demons --and has a balance of 10 souls on top of that--they are declared the ultimate Demon Summoner and the game is over! With all of the variety offered between the 20 unique demons and the diverse BLOCK DECK, there is plenty of content to explore and master!\n\n\n\n\n\nSchool's out but otherworldly STRANGERS are here!  Mom & Dad haven't caught on yet so you're on your own, kiddo. Play your cards as efficiently as you can, helping to navigate your Kids one at a time from SCHOOL to a SCORING space--in order to score as many points as you can before the neighborhood is completely overrun with STRANGERS!\n1. At the start of the game, each player will draw a hand of 3 cards and place one of their kids in the SCHOOL space. Your goal is to get that kid into a valuable scoring space, at which point you'll place a new kid in the SCHOOL space and repeat the process. Some spaces are worth more points at the end of the game, and some confer a unique bonus (for example, your hand size increases by 1 for each Kid you have in the Library). \n2. Remember, you want to score a good space, but you'll have to Walk, Run, Skateboard, School Bus, and even City Bus to get there! Each turn you'll play one card and draw a new card to replace it!  \n3. But watch out!  When any player draws a STRANGER card, they can abduct any kid on a \"STRANGER SPACE!\" Furthermore, now that a STRANGER is lurking in that space, it is impassable for all future movement...so you may just have to re-route your plans on the fly! SAUCER cards can abduct *any* kid--even one that has already scored--but your opponent will have to get lucky when they flip the SAUCER COIN or you'll escape abduction!\n\n\nLike what you see? Giggling with glee? Store each game together when you back all three! We personally guarantee that this sleek and convenient slipcase looks a lot better on your bookshelf than a haphazard stack of boxes!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe expect the game to start shipping in June 2021. It is English-only and we're shipping worldwide in partnership with Quartermaster Logistics. This game is \"friendly\" in terms of shipping (i.e., we cover customs/import taxes) to the US, Canada, EU, Australia, and New Zealand. Shipping rates are based on actual costs to ship your rewards (depending on your country) and will be charged as part of your pledge.\nPlease note: Due to COVID-19, most shippers have added surcharges to their rates. The amount we charge for shipping reflects the latest rates. In some regions, the cost of shipping may exceed the cost of the tier you\u2019re pledging for; unfortunately, this cannot be avoided. In most cases, pledging for two or three games (\u201cDouble Trouble\u201d and \"Slipcase Exclusive\" Tiers) costs almost the same in terms of shipping as pledging for one game.\n\n\n\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not our first rodeo!

They come with Booster Rewards built-in rather than Stretch Goals. We're definitely going to print them on our own no matter what and want you to know that up front, but are asking for your backing so we can order the right amount and most importantly, create the extras that add to the entire experience for all of us\u2014like maps, pawns, and additional Archetype Cards. We play too, and we want all these goodies as much as we hope you do!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPinnacle is very fortunate and grateful to have a loyal and established group of friends and fans who enjoy playing our games, but it's sometimes very hard to get our products to you. We love game stores and sell to them through our fulfillment partners at Studio2 and through traditional distribution, but we also know many of you don't have a store in your neighborhood, or your local store just doesn't carry our games.\nFor those that do, great! Retailers who want in on our Kickstarters get discounted versions of the rewards including Stretch Goals for them and their customers. If you're a retailer, just sign up to our newsletter for all the details. (And gamers, please feel free to let your local store know!) Retailers also get their rewards when backer orders go out, usually several weeks before they show up in the traditional distribution chain.\nIn sum...\nIf you want Blood Drive and the extras we're offering with it, back this Kickstarter Booster.\nIf you want Blood Drive but prefer to support your local store, GREAT! You can pledge for the Digital reward level here if you like, get the Booster Rewards, then order the print version of the book from your store later next year. (But be sure to tell them or they might not order it on their own!)\nDeadlands is the premier Weird Western setting. You can download the free Test Drive, here to see what it's all about.\nIf you missed the Deadlands: the Weird West Kickstarter, you can still get in on the action through the pledge manager, which is still open. Anything you add through that pledge manager will be delivered as soon as it arrives in our warehouse in early 2021.\nYou'll be able to add these items to your Blood Drive order in the Pledge Manager.\nYou can also add on our other Deadlands products once we launch the Blood Drive pledge manager (available sometime after this Kickstarter Booster closes and funds). There you'll be able to add on extras like the Deadlands core boxed set, pawns, the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign, town maps, Action Cards, Bennies, and more!\nSpread the word!\nIt's hard for a small company like ours to get the word out about our game and our worlds. If you care to help boost the signal, you can do so using the following channels. Much obliged, amigo!\nBlood Drive is written and in layout. Your support allows us to create the extras and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the book and cards a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website  first, then through DriveThruRPG.com.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. \nWe'll charge for shipping after the Kickstarter through the pledge manager, but below is a table estimating how much the shipping will be. It's possible these prices may go down as we continue to seek out different options, but we won't charge you any more than what's listed below.\n*Prices exclusive of VAT/GST, shown in USD. We will collect and pay customs in the pledge manager. USA backers pay no additional shipping on Add Ons!\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your friends pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail Info@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box, but the Book Only tier will likely ship in a padded envelope).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead our \"Welcome, Retailer!\" Newsletter here for the basics we recommend for your store!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter products before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle products with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

Headed up by General P.K. Loyer, this site would bring together and train freedom fighters from worlds oppressed by the Goa'uld System Lords. \nOnce trained, these highly functional SG teams would be sent on missions to defend the galaxy and overthrow the Goa'uld System Lords. You are a member of one of these teams.\nFrom the perspective of the Stargate SG-1 TV series, our story with the Phoenix Site picks-up after the episode titled \"Allegiance\" in season 6, episode 9. The rebel Jaffa and Tok'ra come together with the Tau'ri at the Alpha Site to discover the base has been compromised. This leads to the initial authorization for the use of the Phoenix Site to bring together the best of the best from around the galaxy.\nThe world of Stargate SG-1 is perfect for a tabletop roleplaying game.

The options are endless.\nThe following are some of the unique features of the Stargate SG-1 RPG in comparison to other 5th edition games:\n\u25cf A Stargate Program Brief which details all we know in the Stargate canon leading up to season 7.

However, we have been inspired by many other RPG systems beyond 5th edition, and we believe we have brought together the best of what is out there. You will also find some very innovative mechanics of our own.\nWe\u2019d like to thank our playtesters and reviewers that have helped make the Stargate SG-1 Roleplaying Game a great game! \n\nSocial goals help spread the word about the project.

You have allowed us to make The Wagadu Chronicles even better that we thought it ever could be.\nThank you SO MUCH!\nYou can continue following the development of the game and books through our website and our social media: twitter, instagram & youtube.\nAnd you are most welcome to join our lovely discord!\nSee you in-game <3 !\n We believe that role-playing isn't always just about about grinding and growing stats. It's the embodying of a role; the presence of a backstory and all of the quirks and details that define your unique character.\nMany of us have experienced old-school role-play around a table with pencils and a bunch of dice. We know how immersive it is to speak like our characters and to be surrounded by other players who are making decisions based on their characters profiles. Role-play truly submerses you in another world, more powerfully than any NPC  quest could.\nImagine a videogame where everyone around you is role-playing. The noble Emere with whom you are travelling does not want to desecrate any tombs and ignores the loot; the Swala hunter you just met chants a ritual prayer before every hunt and the Asiman merchant never attacks or kills anyone because she believes her goddess wants peace to rule in Wagadu.\n\n\n For the first time in gaming history we are building an online game 100% tailored to role-players, from lore to mechanics.\nThese are some of the community features that we are implementing to create this unique environment:\nContinuous releases of free lore material.\n In-character role-play as a default for all players when in Wagadu's servers.\nOff-world lobbies where players can get technical support or any role-playing tips on how to act out their character before returning to the actual game world.\nRewards for groups of players that engage in interesting and well thought role-playing.\nWe intend to keep the space safe from harassment and trolls who want to disrupt other people's story and the role-play environment - we are spending a lot of energy on this and will have a number of moderation tools that we and the community can use.\n We have already started building our community on Discord! We chat about the setting, role-playing games and even have a Wagadu role-play coffee-house channel <3 Join our Discord!\npre-alpha footage\n\n The tabletop RPG books of Wagadu are crucial to this project because they flesh out the lore in a way that a videogame can't. If you want to truly experience and understand role-play in Wagadu, you'll have to take a look at the lore that is in the books. If you decide to focus only on tabletop role-play, your input and user generated content will affect the development of the MMO.\nWagadu is an ecosystem of tabletop and videogame, which can be experienced in different ways depending on personal taste.\nExcerpts from our free teaser 5E lore book\nWagadu is a strange place where different types of people fall from another world and have to fight to adapt and survive. Behind the scenes a lot has been done to create this world. We believe that role-playing thrives when the setting is well fleshed out and interesting.\nThe approach taken to create this fantasy world was: \"What if Tolkien were black?\". Just as Tolkien did, a lot of time was spent researching the mythologies and traditions of people, but in this case across the African continent. The result is seven \"lineages\", which are similar to fantasy \"races\" but more nuanced, with overlapping cultures and more fluid identities.\n\nMany of the lore elements, including some crucial elements of the setting such as the conflict of lineages with slavery or the \"Dwen\" spirit-children, are inspired by diasporic experiences of black people both in the Americas and in Europe.\nTo make this fantasy world more authentic we have been in contact with experts such an Africa biologists for the various biomes and  African elders for village lore.\nWe are sharing a free 300 page guide to the world of Wagadu, that be can directly downloaded here: \n\nWagadu's role-play and immersion are so important for us that we built the MMORPG mechanics in tandem with the lore. In the Wagadu Chronicles, world-building and gameplay strengthen each other.\n We are building something that has never been seen before in any MMO, a special cinematic mode called \"Dialogue Mode\". This is a mode that can be triggered when two or more people chat with each other. It allows for close ups and the use of many animations (from emotions to little show-off spells) you can basically create your own little live show with friends or strangers as you explore and role-play your character's story.\npre-alpha footage\n The 5E setting adapts the usual class system to Wagadu, the MMO takes a freer approach.  You have skill \"presets\" that look like traditional \"classes\" but you can freely break away from that and build your own warrior-oracle or farmer-chef, nothing stops you.\nYour character is made up of skills that go from 1 (beginner) to 5 (master), every level unlocks more advanced uses of that skill.\nThere are dozens of skills to choose from, we have many of them nailed down already but we will be looking for feedback (especially from our backers) on what additional skills to add during alpha and beta. Some examples from the current skill set are cartography, divination, archery and animal husbandry.\nEvery day, every player receives a free bundle of experience points (called \"Memories\") to invest in skills. No grind required, so you're not penalised if you decide to become a travelling merchant, a coffee-brewer or a tailor: you'll level up just like your mercenary friend.\nA special feature of The Wagadu Chronicles are \"ancestral blessings\". Throughout Wagadu, Ancestors leave skills for players to pick them up, these skills last from a few minutes to an hour and unlock some random power anywhere in the skill tree (and sometimes even completely unique powers that belong to NPC Ancestors). So your Daa'ima bodyguard character may well be able to breathe underwater for an hour or to heal everyone for 15 minutes!\npre-alpha footage\n Just as in other sandbox MMOs, we will leave the economy in the hands of the players. If there are only a few Fire Asimans in the game who can craft fire potions, these will become rare and expensive and people will have to travel more to find where to buy them.\nMost items in the game can only be crafted by other players, loot and NPCs will provide only a few basics.\nMany items, from pots to clothes, to weapons, can be customized by in-game editors if you have the right skills. No two robes are the same in The Wagadu Chronicles! You can sign your creations and even become a famous in-game designer (and ask higher prices). \nAdditionally, every item can be lost or stolen when you get slain - be careful!\n\n\n\n Surviving Wagadu requires interaction with Spirits and Ancestors of all types. Obtaining wood in Wagadu for instance, usually requires interaction with a Tree Spirit. You can convince it to give you some wood by making the right offering but also by behaving in ways the Spirit likes: if in the last few days you have planted and watered seeds in the farm, the Tree Spirit might be more generous to you. If instead you are holding an axe, the outcome might even be a battle. Navigating Spirit requests is made even trickier by the fact that different resource Spirits have conflicting requests and things that they love/hate.\nIn Wagadu, NPCs remember what you do and act accordingly. Your actions matter.\nAnother little peculiarity of The Wagadu Chronicles is that your character has a couple of \"hidden background\" traits: these are features that you inherited from an ancestor (such as descending from an Elephant-Spirit) and that are hiddenly assigned randomly at character creation. Spirits might react upon them, and discovering your hidden backgrounds can be an exciting role-play story and create unexpected bounds with other players.\npre-alpha footage\n\nTotems are central to every player's game, since they:\nact as spawn point.\nprovide healing & safety.\nbestow perks (e.g. farming bonus).\nallow to place player housing.\n  Groups of players can turn an unclaimed  wilderness Totem into a Village Totem by giving it recurrent offerings. This allows players to place housing around it. The type of offerings the Totem asks for varies based on its personality: one might request  30 calves to be born, another Totem might just ask for money.\nThe Totem requests vary slightly every week and a Totem's personality affects the village's players' gameplay and goals.\nPlayers can make offerings to additional wilderness Totems to add them to their \"Totem Pantheon\" and get their perks. When two different villages compete for the same Totem, a \"Spiritual Challenge\" ensues in which the highest bidder wins.\nSheer strength does not always mean victory. A Totem might request that the whole village never goes hunting, so that Lionblood village might give it a pass and let it be claimed by the peaceful clan of farming players that live in the next island.\n\n The Music of Wagadu is heavily inspired by a combination of African traditional instruments and with western RPG tunes. We aren't just building a refreshingly new soundtrack, we are also creating new associations based on African traditions, such as playing Ghana's bamboo-flute funeral dirge for death-related gameplay and Mali's Dogon bull-roarer for spiritual and ancestral summoning.\n We are collaborating with established traditional Ghanaian musicians such as Dela Botri and professors of the Department of Music of the University of Accra in order to make Wagadu sound truly authentic.\nFor the voiced parts of the game, we will be collaborating with black voice-actors, such as the iconic, Abubakar Salim (\"Bayek\" in Assassin's creed Origins) whose amazing voice features in our Kickstarter trailer.\nRecording sessions at Kay Boni's Cafe Abajo in Accra, Ghana\n\nTwin Drums is made up of a team of established game developers. We have worked for some of the biggest franchises and gaming companies out there. We have experience of working on different platforms and we are bringing all of these different perspectives into our game development. And yes, we are half black and a third queer: that\u2019s our secret super-power.\nTo make sure that The Wagadu Chronicles gets all the support it needs, we have partnered with League of Legends developer Riot Games - they have been amazing with us and we are very excited about this collaboration.\n\n We have some funding and support from a big developer. The Wagadu Chronicles is happening. The reason why we are here is because your support can help us improve the game by increasing our development budget and by joining us in this development journey with your feedback and participation.\nBeing able to see how many of you care about role-playing and afrofantasy and getting your support will help us make The Wagadu Chronicles the best game that it can possibly be!\n Please note that the price in USD is an approximation based on the original price in Euros since Twin Drums is based in Europe. Prices in USD may vary depending on the USD to EUR exchange rate.\nBear in mind that shipping costs have not been included in the pledges and will have to be paid subsequently. \nWe are currently collecting data and negotiating with our suppliers in order to get the best deal for most countries and we will be able to provide exact shipping charges closer to shipment!\nSome pledges provide multiple versions of  in-game items as a rewards. This is very special because all items in Wagadu can normally be lost or stolen at death (\"full loot\") but these backer reward items are \"bound to your soul\", they cannot be looted. Since we will not be producing them anymore by game release, their value will constantly increase and they will become very rare, expensive and recognisable in the game. It's your choice if to keep them, sell them or gift them to your closest friend.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that we are a small team making a relatively big game.

Corey?\nDo you like dice?\nThen you have docked at the right station!\nLast year Green Ronin published The Expanse RPG and this Kickstarter is to fund dice sets for the game. Sure, you can play The Expanse with any old six-sided dice, but now you can declare your allegiance to Earth, Mars, or the Belt with these Expanse dice! If the campaign does well, we\u2019ll offer exclusive Protomolecule dice as well!\nWe have once again partnered with Q Workshop, who previously produced our Dragon Age and Blue Rose Dice Sets. They make beautiful dice and we know their work will be stellar. \nAs you can see, the dice have already been designed. Earth, Mars, and the Belt each have their own set. We just need to fund the production and determine how many of each set to make. This is where you come in! We don\u2019t know if we should produce an equal number of each set or not. If OPA ranks are strong, we\u2019ll need more Belter dice. If a lot of you believe in the dream of the red planet, we\u2019ll need more Martian dice.\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out The Expanse RPG, you can download a free Quickstart here. You can also purchase PDFs of the game and its supplements as add-ons to this campaign. If you want print books, you can get those from the Green Ronin Online Store or your friendly neighborhood retailers.\nDice in the RPG\nThe Expanse RPG uses the Adventure Game Engine (AGE), which also powers our Blue Rose, Fantasy AGE, and Modern AGE RPGs. In AGE games, you roll three d6s when taking tests. Two of these dice are one color, and the third a different color. In The Expanse RPG that third one is known as the Drama Die and its results let you pull off cool stunts in play.\nYou\u2019ll note that each dice set has two different styles of dice. This allows you to make two complete sets of dice from each set, each with two dice of one color and a Drama Die in a different color. \nStretch Goal: Protomolecule Dice! Unlocked!\nUpdate: Our stretch goal has been unlocked! You can now get the Protogen dice as a $12 add-on!\nThere is only one stretch goal for this campaign but it's a good one! If we hit $30,000, we will also produce a set of Kickstarter exclusive Protomolecule dice that you can get as an add-on. These will come in a plastic bag (so no box) and cost $12. \nThese dice have the Protogen logo on them. Just some scientists on a hidden space station doing nothing sinister at all! \nImportant Note: Shipping!\nWe will be charging shipping on this project after the campaign ends through a pledge manager. We charge the actual amount the shipping costs and remember, game companies don't set shipping rates! \nAdd-ons\nYou can complete your pledge with PDFs from The Expanse RPG if you aren't already a player of the game. To purchase an add-on, click the Manage My Pledge button and increase your pledge manually with the total cost for all the add-ons you want. After the campaign is finished, there will be a pledge manager in which you can make a final decision on what add-ons you want (and you can add even more dice then if you want!). Note that all these PDFs are currently available on the Green Ronin Online Store and DriveThruRPG, so if you want to get them today, you can do so directly. If you choose to buy them through this campaign, you won't get them until after it ends, but as recompense they are at a discount here. \nThe Expanse RPG PDF: $25\nThis is the core rulebook for The Expanse RPG. Its 224 pages include everything you need to play except dice, but hey, you should have that covered! The Expanse RPG applies the fast-playing, stunt-powered AGE system to spaceships, solar colonies, adventure, and intrigue in the far-future. Blast off to adventure!\nAbzu's Bounty PDF: $17\nAbzu\u2019s Bounty presents six full-length scenarios designed for a new crew of characters in The Expanse Roleplaying Game. They embark on a series of adventures, from a fateful discovery in the rings of Saturn to acquiring their own ship to a deadly confrontation that could change the course of history for the entire solar system.\nGM's Kit PDF: $9\nThe Expanse RPG GM's Kit provides full-color, printable GM screen inserts with essential tables and references for game-play, as well as evocative artwork. It also includes printable color quick reference sheets that put the stunts and actions at your fingertips, a combat tracker, a set of pre-generated Player Characters, and a complete adventure to launch your crew right into the exciting universe of The Expanse!\nLegal\nThe Expanse Roleplaying Game is \u00a92019 Green Ronin Publishing, LLC.

Her crew mourned the loss of Captain Winona. The Einherjar Empire breathed a sigh of relief and returned to its abuse and tyranny. And a few impulsive men declared her a deity, worshipping the ground her buccaneer boots walked on. \nThis space opera tells the tale of a god's second coming, and of the people (and pet wolf) she left behind. God has returned.\n Jennie Gyllblad is a queer Swedish-born, UK-dwelling Comicatrix.\nCreator of British Fantasy Award-nominated Skal, Jennie is no stranger to painting the fantastical and outlandish. In By Man & Angels, though, she had the opportunity to turn her paintbrush to something both more foreign and more familiar. Based on Norse mythology, By Man & Angels draws inspiration from the full gamut of Viking folklore, and allows her to celebrate her Scandinavian heritage.\nOne of Jennie's lasting science-fiction loves is The Fifth Element. With its bold costumes and striking designs, its focus on the power and importance of love, and an occasional musical interlude, it isn't hard to see its influence in her work on By Man & Angels.\nPedro La Barba is a half-Caribbean, half-British writer, and lifelong fan of science-fiction.\n\n As a mixed-race man, Pedro never saw many characters who represented him in the science-fiction he grew up with. So, it was important to him to create a space opera where diversity existed not just through a range of colourful and exotic aliens, but through the spectrum of race, gender, and sexuality as well.\n\n Pedro's science-fiction touchstones are Farscape and Mass Effect. With its mismatched crew of outcasts, warm sense of humour, and designs that could pass for practical effects, he hopes to have paid tribute to a little of those works when creating By Man & Angels.\nThank you for taking the time to look at our kickstarter! Special love will always also go to my patrons and other supporters - You're keeping this little viking longboat afloat\ud83e\udd70", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe comic itself is already completed, so the main risks/challenges would be with the printing and postage.\n\nDue to Covid19 affecting the \"fancier\" printing methods that I use for a couple of my other comics (such as Hardcovers, Spotgloss etc) - I have made the decision to not offer any of those as potential rewards on this Kickstarter. \n\nThat's why this project may appear quite basic and \"No Frills\".

Near the Maul stands the impossible tower that houses Yara, his jewel, and his soldiers. A tower that no one dares enter, with walls polished to infinity, so no one can climb them.

There are risks in timing when it comes to any product manufactured in another country and then shipped around the world, including:\n\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays\n\nThere is also the very real risk of complications due to COVID-19 that we cannot foresee.

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

The Royal Navy has their eye on you and the more notorious you become, the more eager they are to stopping your exploits. \nAn encounter with the Navy will surely slow your progress, so you best be avoiding them. To do so, you're going to need a good ship and a great crew!\nThere's a lot of scallywags out there looking for adventure! So assembling your crew won't be very hard, but pulling together a winning crew... that's a different story.\nYour crew will play a major role in Tiny Epic Pirates. Each crew member brings different advantages to battle and to the actions you'll take. \nThe dice listed at the top of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent what number you'll need to roll to score a hit on another ship! Having multiples of a single number can result in lots of damage, but spreading your numbers out can result in more consistent results. The choice is yours!\nThe icons listed at the bottom of each crew card, and your captain's card, represent bonus actions that can chain together for epic turns! If the first icon matches your chosen action, you'll get to take the action of the second icon for free.\nIn addition to your crew, you'll have your reputation and your exploits. As you prove yourself in battle, your legend will grow and so will your ability to command your ship.\nWinning battles against other pirates, and against notable merchants, will increase your Legend Level. Each new level offers immediate benefits, as well as increases to your ship's movement and the number of dice you roll in battle.\nBut enough talk, you're no landlubber. You can learn more about Tiny Epic Pirates by engaging with us in the comments, watching the videos below, or by downloading the rulebook below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals\nIncludes 7 Plastic Ship Minis!\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Pirates, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe components shown below.\nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Crimson Silver Mini Expansion\nThe Crimson Silver Mini Expansion introduces new Floating Fortresses and Silver as a new resource!\nPlayers are able to visit the Floating Fortresses as they move around the board and perform upgraded versions of Trade, Plunder, and Crew Up. Players may also lay siege to these Fortresses for additional rewards. But beware, the Floating Fortresses have a contract with the Royal Navy and if any Pirates show their dirty face around there, the Navy will be on their tail!\nEven with the threat of the Navy though, the precious Silver these markets are known for is simply too alluring to avoid. A lot of blood as been spilled over this Silver. So much that it's known around these seas as Crimson Silver.\n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution.

Rumors of dead pirates returning to the sea... aboard an ominous ghost ship helmed by the legendary pirate Amdiak...\nSeveral new game elements are added to play including cursed gold, a ghost ship that haunts the players as they try to steal the cursed gold, ancient relics, haunted map cards and even skeleton crew!\nPlayers gain cursed gold by stealing it from the ghost ship and attacking other pirates who possess it. Cursed gold can be traded for an ancient relic said to hold ashes of Amdiak. Bury this relic and break the Curse of Amdiak!\nIf the ghost ship finds catches you though, your captain becomes cursed and you lose your cursed gold. Once cursed you will be able to recruit powerful skeleton crew to mindlessly obey your wicked command!\nDo you dare to set sail on ghostly waters?\nThe Curse of Amdiak expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Pirates.

Happy one year anniversary! A year ago, we were settling into a pandemic and watching the millions starting to rack up on this project. Now vaccines are being distributed, and, after spending a solid year in my house working on this beast, we're actually getting close to being done!\nThere is not a whole lot talk about this week. We're continuing to make progress on all the various fronts of this massive endeavor. The campaign elements have already been refined significantly since we started testing two weeks ago (though there is still a ways to go), artwork is coming in left and right, and we're going through all the various writing for scenarios and sections that needs to get done. Also lots of progress on the graphic design front with various cards and books.

Things are moving along over here. We just recently started play testing the campaign aspects of the game (players play through the entire campaign by sort of hand-waving the actual scenario parts of it with some simple metrics), and that is proving very helpful in refining some of the overall systems of the game, which is great.\nIt has taken a lot of effort to get to a point where all aspects of the campaign are in place (outside of some flavor text) to do this, and it feels good to finally get to these last stages of development! We've also brought some additional writers, graphic designers, and artists on to the team to get through all the work we have left in a timely manner, so that's exciting too!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #75", "update_userinfo": "Spending some time with the section book", "update_content": "Hello!

THEY are the ones in control of the signal, and it\u2019s your mission to take them down!\nOf course, it wouldn\u2019t be much of a game if it were that easy...\nThere are enemies hiding in your midst attempting to sabotage your progress, and even some of your own team may not be who they say they are. As a member of the resistance, it\u2019s your job to weed out the traitors and take them down before it\u2019s too late.\nLucky for you\u2026 you have these! Now put them on, or start eating that trash can. \nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 is directly inspired by the themes of the movie; it's rich and poor divide and the battle to control the system. The game involves collecting resources and banking them for use in the final assault, just like the end of the film.\nYour role will vary depending on if you\u2019re playing as a Human or an Invader. One will have you attempting to save humanity, the other will have you fighting to maintain your position as their overlords.\nBelow is a basic breakdown of the roles you fill to complete your mission.  \nHuman or Invader - either way, you\u2019re going to need your cunning, reasoning, and a trusty pair of Hoffman Lenses to win! \n\u201cI take these glasses off, she looks like a regular person.\u201d\nThis is the exciting bit\u2026\nThe Hoffman Lenses have no need for apps, phones or a computer. Just like the movie, simply put them over your eyes to see the truth!! We\u2019ve worked closely with our production team to ensure that our art and design aesthetic works in a simple, real-world way.\nPlayers can use the lenses to inspect and uncover Invader interference in three ways:\n Uncovering hidden enemy players - Players will be able to risk their glasses and enter a PVP encounter. If successful, the winner will be able to look at the losing player\u2019s character card and see their true identity. The question is, will the others believe you?\n Uncovering enemy sabotage - Before assets enter the final assault stash, they will need to be deposited at resistance locations. As a human, it\u2019s your responsibility to check items with the glasses before they go to the stash. This will allow you to identify and discard any sabotaged cards! As an Invader, you\u2019ll need to identify the sabotaged items and sneak them into the stash- ready to thwart the final assault.\n Checking the billboards - Resistance hideouts have billboards (cards) to identify them. Each contains hidden messages from Invaders that they use to coordinate their raids. It\u2019s important to know where your items are and understand the risk of potential raids, otherwise, they may get confiscated.\nThe Hoffman Lenses are one of the most unique and exciting parts of the game. They are also one of your most valuable assets in preparing for your assault on Cable 54! Limited tokens dictate the number of times you can use the glasses, so you will need to be tactical with how and when you choose to put them on. Get it wrong, and you could be left unprepared for an emergency situation!\n Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against the Invaders?\nCan a corrupt politician find redemption?\nCan a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer?\nThey Live: Assault on Cable 54 allows you to play as new and exciting original characters, as well as iconic ones from the movie, in a dynamic narrative-driven board game that is full of twists and turns. Each character is fully fleshed out with their own personal adventure that fits into the world of They Live.\nThese stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomized, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play.\nThese carefully constructed stories have different endings depending on if you\u2019re playing as a human or an invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the invaders, or sabotaging the resistance!\nHow your personal story works:\nEach player will start with an Awakening Card at the beginning of the game. This will set the scene, explain who you are, and tell the story of how you came to know about the Invaders (although... this may be a cover story). After the Awakening Card, it\u2019s completely up to you how, when and if you uncover the next part of your adventure.\nYou must successfully complete four randomized cards from your personal story deck to experience the ending and unlock your unique character item. However, just like in real life, if you mess things up you can't go back and change it.\n Each turn is split into 4 phases. The following diagram explains how each phase works: \nThe main game will involve the players looking at their cards and knowing if they are a Human or an Invader to assume the correct role. For obvious reasons, this doesn\u2019t really work for 1 player and could even mean outnumbered play for lower player counts.\n\u2018Blind Play\u2019 will involve the player or players controlling multiple characters. All taking part in the adventure without knowing their character\u2019s allegiance. You can enter PVP and engage your own characters, using the glasses to uncover the possible enemy within. If you do find a traitor in your midst, the game will take over control of the uncovered Invader and activate a separate Invader behavior deck.\nIf Invaders in your party make it all the way to the \u2018Final Assault\u2019 they will become active and produce significant debuffs to your character and engage with you in combat.\nThis mode is currently in the testing phase with additional behavior card art in development. \nTonight is the last stand for the resistance - the enemy strikes at dawn!\nThe game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the 'Final Assault' before the clock hits midnight.\nThe 'Final Assault' contains three story-based trials that will need to be overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level players that have been developed throughout the game. You will also need a good stash of weapons, items, and allies to be victorious.\nEach of the three trials will test your skills and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It\u2019s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.\nWith the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history.\nIf you fail, well, things will be a lot worse\u2026\n All of the other core rules are in our attached rulebook below. This includes details on combat (PVE and PVP), actions, stats, skills and more.\nThis is a continually evolving process in terms of explaining the game in a way that is suitable for public consumption. You will see this updated throughout the campaign, and after, concluding with the finished document before release and print. \nBase game components for the standard edition of the game.\n*Please note this does not include stretch goals unless stated, all numbers could increase through through further development*\n\nAdditional cards may be added for the 1-3 player \u2018Blind Play\u2019 mode. \nAndrew Aitcheson - Co-Creator\nMovie geek and game enthusiast, who has previously worked in the education field and has designed a number of teaching aids and games for adult learning.

We are aware of the huge amount of work it takes to produce and distribute within strict timescales even in normal circumstances. With the current climate caused by Coronavirus (COVID-19) disruptions and delays have become the norm rather than the exception. \n\nAction Taken \u2013 We have already factored in an anticipated amount of delay and slowdown into our production and the projected shipping dates are currently 3 months later than they would otherwise have been. If the delays that we have allowed for do not materialize then shipping will occur much earlier than the specified dates.\n\nRisk \u2013 The technology we are using for the glasses has not been used in board games ever before, does it work?\n\nAction Taken \u2013 The polarisation technology that we are employing is one that is currently in use in sunglasses already, it just has never been deployed for the purpose of identifying Invaders among us. We work directly with our factory (and not via a trading partner) which results in much stricter control for production. We have worked closely with the production team to develop the game technology and ensure that everything works as it needs to before getting to the point of Kickstarter.\n\nWe promise to keep you informed and updated as the project develops, highlighting any potential issues, but also keeping you up to date with the first looks and latest progress.\n\nRefund Policy:\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until we pay the production agreement with the factory, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover). Once we pay the production agreement with the factory, we do not offer a refund. If we fail to fulfill your game you are entitled to a full refund, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after 14 days may be processed via PayPal or the payment reversed through your credit card at our discretion.

An event called \"The Reckoning\" awakened an ancient evil, and you'd best hope the howls you hear on the High Plains are just a pack of ravenous wolves...\n \"The Year is 1876, but the history is not our own...\"\nThese words introduced Deadlands to the world back in 1996, spawning decades of amazing tales and memorable monsters. Now the granddaddy of Horror Western games is back with a brand new edition. \nThe cover that started it all, the original Deadlands, by Brom!\nIt's now 1884 in the official timeline. The Civil War ended in 1871 at the Battle of Washington, an epic conflagration of steam and steel. The Great Rail Wars are over as well, finishing not with a whimper but the bang of  Dr. Darius Hellstromme's ghostfire bombs at the gates of Lost Angels.\nEven the Servitors, the Reckoners' chosen champions on Earth, have been defeated\u2014at least for a while. Reverend Grimme vanished in a massive flood that destroyed his city, Raven's Last Sons were defeated by the Great Summoning, Stone was foiled in the barren expanse of Death Valley, and Dr. Hellstromme's latest scheme to open the gates of Hell proved fruitless.\nWe told the tale of the Servitors in four Plot Point Campaigns, still available and ready to play with just a little tinkering for this edition on our website!\nIn response, the Reckoners have turned their blasphemous gaze back to the grassroots of evil. They've given life to dark desires and horrible abominations that live in the shadows of the isolated frontier, far away from the attention garnered by the overt plans of their Servitors.\nThe heroes of the Weird West join with the secretive Twilight Legion in the distant outposts, chaotic boomtowns, and lonely settlements of the West to fight evil and quell the fear that gives the Reckoners their power.\nSo gather your posse of heroes and hit the trail, from the frozen north to the arid deserts of the Southwest, from the industrial East to the fractured canyons of California's \"Great Maze.\" \nThe Weird West awaits with adventure, mystery, and more monsters than you can shake a Peacemaker at.\nThink these Mojave rattlers look nasty? You should see the rest of it!\nDeadlands is the long-awaited return to Pinnacle's oldest and most popular setting. First published in 1996, the original \"Deadlands Classic\" system won countless awards and its bold, bright orange books are still a striking and valuable addition to gaming shelves the world over. \nFor those who want the whole experience, Deadlands has a rich and varied history to explore!\nDeadlands has told some epic tales since it first burst onto the scene in 1996, but you don't need to be steeped in its storied past to join in the hootin' and hollerin'. If you're an old hand, we think you'll find it both familiar and refreshing.  If you're new to the world or setting, this is the perfect time to join the wagon train (and if you've lapsed, we forgive you for that, partner). We've recapped and summarized the monumental events of the last 24 years so you can catch up.\nThis new edition is the biggest revamp of the game's background and rules since the Reloaded edition from 2005. It's been revised, rewritten, and refocused by both Deadlands Line Editor Matthew Cutter and original creator Shane Hensley.\nBack in the Saddle, by Aaron Riley!\nAll the rules have been updated and adapted to the latest version of the Savage Worlds Adventure Edition. You'll need that book to play. You can add it to your pledge as an Add On if you don't already have it, or you can check out the PDF now.\nArcane Backgrounds are tightened up. Those nasty Harrowed had the same overhaul we gave them in Lost Colony (including letting the Devil out!). There are new and streamlined rules for dueling. And of course a passel of new Edges, gear, infernal devices, and powers to blast the tarnation out of the creepy crawlies coming to do your party in.\nFor you Marshals (that's what we call our Game Masters), there's a comprehensive overview of the Weird West after the events of the Servitor Plot Point Campaigns, including new plots, perils, and intrigue for cowtowns, boomtowns, and old favorites like Lost Angels, Tombstone, Deadwood, Dodge, the City o\u2019 Gloom, and a few new locales we might surprise you with! And of course this handsome tome also includes enough rascals, varmints, and critters to keep a posse busy 'til doomsday.\nThis is more than just a rules update--it's a world update! And check out that gorgeous new graphic design by Karl Keesler, with art by some of the best in the business!\nNow that the tales of the Servitors have been told in their individual Plot Point Campaigns, Deadlands is returning to its roots with more local yarns of dread, terror, and violent action. The new edition and supplements to follow turn their baleful eyes from the world-shaking events of the Reckoning to isolated frontier towns or sinister machinations in the few larger settlements. The Twilight Legion must root out the evil that lurks in all-too-human souls, the lonesome hills nearby, or the dark woods at the edge of town.\nTo showcase the return to more personal tales of horror and adventure, we've created the Horror at Headstone Hill campaign set!\nThe campaign features a single county in Wyoming and the terrors that lurk in a booming mining town and environs. Your heroes roam about the map, interacting with the locals, solving mysteries, fighting abominations, and\u2014with luck and a steady shootin' iron\u2014eventually lower the \"Fear Level.\" That's how you defeat the Reckoners' terrorforming, amigos, and Horror at Headstone Hill showcases it front and center.\nThe Horror at Headstone Hill Campaign Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands: Horror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains an introductory booklet on the region for the players with notes from Tombstone Epitaph reporter Lacy O'Malley and the Twilight Legion, a Marshal's guide detailing all the locations on the map and a full sandbox-oriented Plot Point Campaign, a poster-sized map of the county, and a selection of player handouts to drive this incredible tale of six-guns and sorcery to its bloodstained conclusion!\n Something happened at Devil's Tower recently. Something terrible. A being called the Cackler raised a powerful sorceress of legend, Morgan Le Fay, sending ripples through the many worlds of Deadlands. From the Dark Ages to the far future planet of Banshee in Lost Colony, the \"Morgana Effect\" has caused subtle changes from the world we knew before.\nThe Cackler and his unholy posse ride the range in this world-changing graphic novel by Shane Lacy Hensley!\n The Morgana Effect is a big story that ripples (quietly for now) through all the settings of Deadlands\u2014including the upcoming Deadlands: Dark Ages, the Weird West, Noir, Hell on Earth, and already released Lost Colony. It's also a story-based reason to change the rules and some parts of the setting we've been hankerin' to adjust for a while. You can read more about the latter here, but we think even those of you who have been with us since '96 will welcome the changes once you take 'er for a test ride.\nOver the years we've seen some amazing gaming setups, but collecting and painting a comprehensive collection of cowpokes and critters can be both time consuming and expensive. That's where the Deadlands Pawns come in. \nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains over 100 Deadlands characters and critters printed on thick punchboard!\nWe've created a selection of heroes, villains, and monsters in thick punchboard (the sturdy stuff board game tokens are made from) to represent some of the most common and iconic encounters in the Weird West. These figures are even die-cut to the contour of the character image to make each pose as dynamic and striking as possible.\nThe Deadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard, containing over 100 pawns to bring the Weird West alive on your tabletop. If the set does well, we will expand the line to include additional Deadlands sets and pawn sets for our other lines. \nThat's enough jawin'. Now let's talk about what's really important...what you get for helping us bring the Weird West to life!\nWe've set up the reward tiers to be as simple as possible while still covering the most popular combinations you sidewinders always ask for. We've done 21 of these Kickstarters now, so we have a pretty good handle on things. But if you don't see the particular combination you want, just pledge for the book and add on anything else in the pledge manager we'll launch sometime after the campaign closes.\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nThe core book for Deadlands: The Weird West is a 192-page hardcover book, in our usual \"graphic novel\" size, and glorious, bloody, full-color throughout. That amazing cover is by Aaron Riley, a fan favorite of the entire Savage Worlds line!\nDeadlands Boxed Set contains the hardcover core rulebook, brand new poster map of the Weird West, GM Screen + Adventure, Set of 25 Bennies, Set of 7 dice, and a set of 12 Archetype Cards, along with Power Cards, Adventure Cards, and Infernal Device Cards\u2014all housed in a sturdy and attractive box to match your Deadlands: Lost Colony Boxed Set!\nThe Deadlands the Weird West Core Boxed Set includes a copy of the hardcover rules as well as a brand new poster map of the Weird West by the phenomenal Cheyenne Wright, a set of 25 Bennies, a set of custom-colored dice and Wild Die, and a Game Master's screen and introductory adventure, Double Down at Sundown, by Rob Wieland!\nWant to see the new screen? Here it is, partner! The tri-fold screen is our usual landscape format with gorgeous art on one side and all the charts and tables the Marshal needs on the other!\nThe new GM Screen for Deadlands: the Weird West! Click here to view Federico Musetti's gorgeous art as a larger image.\nHorror at Headstone Hill Boxed Set contains a Player's Guide booklet, a Marshal's book with a full Plot Point Campaign, a poster map or Uinta County, and several pages of player aids and handouts. Art not final.\nDeadlands Pawns Boxed Set contains 8 sheets of thick punchboard containing stunning full color miniatures die-cut to give you over 100 miniatures for use in your Deadlands games. Art not final.\nAfter the Kickstarter is over you'll be invited to a pledge manager so you can add any additional Pinnacle products you want to your order. Want the Rippers Resurrected Expedition Amazon supplement or Deadlands: Lost Colony or Rifts\u00ae for Savage Worlds Boxed Set? These will all be available to ship with your order.\nIf you want those existing items right now, partner, just head over to www.peginc.com and order, but please realize you'll have to pay shipping on that separately.\nIf you want to order everything at once in the pledge manager (to combine shipping with your Deadlands rewards) everything will be delivered toward the end of 2020. \nAdd-Ons require pledging for a physical reward level. \nAnd if you want to budget or add Deadlands-specific Add-Ons to your Kickstarter pledge now, here are the prices. Thanks as always for your support of our little company!\nWe always like to sweeten the pot. Help us reach our funding goals and we'll add a passel of digital and physical rewards. The first is a set of the cool new Harrowed \"Dominion Cards\" by Cheyenne Wright! If we reach that Stretch Goal, a set of cards will be added to every Deadlands Core Boxed Set. (You can order them as an Add-On as well.)\nWant to hear more from Sounds Like Crowes? Check out their website here.\nLearn more about the Wildcards and Saving Throw by clicking here!\nCheck back frequently to see where we're at, and tell your friends to check out our project\u2014every pledge means more for everyone!\nHelp us unlock more stretch goals by sharing the project! Here's where you can find us on social media:\nDeadlands and Horror at Headstone Hill are both written and in layout. Your help allows us to create all the extras we want to make and get the word out to other fans (by far the hardest challenge for a small company like ours).\nWe plan to deliver the PDF of the core rules a few weeks after the project funds and we get the final backer list from Kickstarter.  This means delivery of the main PDFs about a month after funding and the physical products about 5 months later depending on the printer and shipping, and barring unforeseen mishaps...y'know, like world-wide pandemics and all!\nDigital Rewards\nWe deliver PDF materials through the Pinnacle website and DriveThruRPG.\nPhysical Rewards\nAfter the Kickstarter ends we'll use a pledge manager to collate the physical pledges and allow you the opportunity to include additional Pinnacle products with your pledge. You will pay for shipping after the Kickstarter using the pledge manager. \nClick here to view larger image\nAll prices in USD and based on estimates calculated April 2020.\nCustoms and Taxes for EU, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand\nWe know that international shipping is an expensive part of buying games and we're constantly looking for ways to reduce those costs.\nThe above rates are postage only. Depending on your location, additional VAT/GST will be added to your order in the pledge manager. For example, current VAT for books in the UK is 0%, while Denmark is 25%. After collecting these fees in the pledge manager, our regional partners pay the taxes and file paperwork for you during shipping!\nTo save on international shipping, consider having one of your amigos pledge for your whole posse, then \"Add-On\" additional books to a single package. You should also encourage your local retailer to sign up as a Savage Retailer so they can order directly from us (before it hits regular distribution). Then you can buy the physical product from your favorite local game store, while you pledge at a digital reward level so you don't miss out on the digital Stretch Goals.\nWe Ship Anywhere in the World\nEmail site.admin@peginc.com for an estimate to ship to your location if you don't see it above.  You can also use the handy calculator at USPS.com (most rewards ship in a 12x12x12 inch box).\nDelivery for Merchants\nRead full details for Retailers in our Savage Retailer newsletter here!\nAll retailers located in the contiguous United States receive free shipping. Retailers in Hawaii, Alaska, and outside the United States receive discounted shipping. The store also receives Kickstarter product before retail release and may restock other Pinnacle product with their order. We recommend retailers sign up for our Savage Retailer newsletter here (no pledge required at this time).

We're Tucktec and over a year ago we introduced our Folding kayak to space-locked folks of all types. We are water enthusiasts and love to see our waterways clean and litter-free. Unfortunately, plastic bags and bottles are the biggest culprits.  We believe that to enjoy the water today and keep it clean for future generations we all have to do our part.  At this early stage of our company, we have an opportunity to make some decisions about our growth. So we decided to make a REAL change and see if we can start manufacturing our kayaks out of recycled plastic. That's why we're turning to the Kickstarter community.  If we can get enough interest and support to meet the minimum volume to set up specially made recycled sheets it can happen! You can help us kick-off our production from this time forward... making our kayaks out of 100% recycled bottles and bags! Help us launch Tucktec eco!\nOne Tucktec eco Kayak is equal to keeping 215 milk jugs out of the waste cycle and our waters.\nOne Tucktec eco Kayak is equal to keeping over 2,500 shopping bags out of the waste cycle and our waters.\n\nReady To Pack Less & Explore More? \nBenefits:\n No need for extra storage space \nNo need for a roof rack\nNo more renting kayaks\nFits in the trunk of a car\nPerfect for apartments & RVs\nGet on the water anytime\nHike into the sweet fishing spots\nMADE IN THE USA\n\nWhere Will You Explore First?\nIt's never been so easy to bring a kayak on your adventures!  Tucktec's small packed-size and weight turn any body of water into a day of fun!\nWhether it be in the city...\nOff the grid...\nOn a date...\nWith your furry friends...\nOr simply to just get away...\nAnyone. Anywhere. Anytime.\nSpecifications\nTucktec eco is a Hard-Shell Kayak that Folds up to store ANYWHERE.  Made from 1/8\" thick solid HDPE, the reinforced fold lines will not tear, puncture or split.  Ever!  Tucktec eco Kayaks are built tough to take abuse!\n Assembled Size:\n 10' feet long (304 cm)\n 31\" inches wide (78.74 cm)\nweight: 28 lbs. (12.7 kg)\nmax capacity: 350 lbs. (158.7 kg)\nFolded Size:\n 48\" inches long (121.9 cm)\n 15\" inches wide (38.1 cm)\n 8\" inches deep (20.32 cm)\n\nFeaturing:\nWIDE FLAT BOTTOM FOR STABILITY\nRETRACTABLE TRACKING FIN\nADJUSTABLE BACK-SUPPORT SEAT\nADJUSTABLE FOOTREST\nONE TWO-PART KAYAK PADDLE\nDRY-BAG\nOPEN COCKPIT.

It only took her THREE practice runs to get to where she easily set up her Tucktec eco in about 90 SECONDS!\nPLAY\n\n\nLightweight.\nStows anywhere.\nStraight Tracking.\nControl & Maneuverability.\n Safe & Durable.\nThe Tucktec eco is made from solid and rigid plastic formulated to fold easily, but remain tough and durable like a standard hardshell Kayak.  It's UV treated and even withstands extremely low temperatures. The hull sheet is 1/8\" inch thick (3.17 mm) and can handle abused from hard use, rocks, stumps, and even Oyster beds. All fold lines are reinforced up to 1/4\" thick (6.35 mm) and the main lever latch folds are carbon-fiber reinforced. The Tucktec eco is not a \"skin-on\" type of Kayak or a flimsy foldable Kayak. When set up, it looks, feels, performs, and holds up like a regular  Kayak.\nPLAY\n\nDon't forget to ALWAYS use a Coast Guard approved PFD (Personal Floatation Device) Life-vest, Life-jacket.\n  NOT recommended for Beach Waves or rough Ocean waters.\n  Not for use in whitewater above class 2 rapids.\n \nDoes it leak?\nTucktec Kayaks are made from one solid sheet.  All folds go in, and over themselves. There are no open folds that need to be sealed, and no way to leak.\nIt's Super Stable.\nPLAY\n\nAvailable In MANY Colors (see below for color selection)\nAt the end of the campaign we will send a survey for you to confirm your address and at that time you can select your color.  \nYou can get your Tucktec in GREEN, DARK YELLOW, TAN, BLUE, BLACK, ORANGE, RED, BRIGHT GREEN, PINK, PURPLE, & LIGHT BLUE.  We'll send you an email before we ship to confirm your color of choice.\n\nWhat About Shipping?\nAnother really cool benefit of a Folding Kayak is the shipping! You could expect to pay up to hundreds shipping a full-size kayak across the country or overseas, but not a Tucktec!\nPLEASE NOTE:  For INTERNATIONAL orders we are actively working with shippers to bring the cost down as much as possible. The cost shown below represents the HIGHEST amount you would ever pay for shipping.  Depending on how many international orders we get and other factors, the cost could go down for some international orders.\n**The shipping prices below are for up to 3 kayaks in one shipment** Example: if you buy 1-3 kayaks and live in US you'd only pay $30 (not $90).\nUnited States (Lower 48) - $30\nCanada, Alaska, Hawaii - $50 \nUK / EU - $60\nAustralia - $60\nAnyone from a country NOT listed will need to contact us with a shipping address to get an accurate quote.\n **International backers - import duties, taxes & charges are not included in the shipping cost.  These charges are the backer's responsibility and will be collected by the carrier upon delivery.  Please see FAQ for details.\n\nAs Seen On\nOur Story...\nThe inspiration behind Tucktec Eco came from my personal desire for a canoe or kayak our family could easily use on day trips and camping trips.  I did not have storage or a roof rack and at the time, being a working artist, I could not afford much.  I knew I did not want an inflatable... durability being an issue and they were very sluggish on the water.  I had seen a few other portable options, but all of those were too expensive for anything good.\nI got to thinking... there's got to be a way to take a solid full sheet of plastic and fold it in a way that would not only form the shape of a boat but do it in such a way that the folds would \"in and over\" leaving no open seam that would need to be sealed or possibly leak. \nI spent weeks at first folding little paper boats and floating them in the sink.  I\u2019d even add pebbles to see how much they would hold. My wife thought I was crazy.\nAfter several revisions, the Tucktec was born!  I now had the portable watercraft I was looking for.  A solid and rigid kayak that set up quickly, was sturdy and durable, and that even I could afford.\n-Dan, Tucktec Founder & CEO\n\n What Others Are Saying\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox\n\nMore than $15,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a lot of experience packed into a short time making the Tucktec Kayak. We also have the support of our local community. We use several local (usually family-owned) companies to make some parts and supplies. We are fully prepared to switch manufacturing from the standard sheets over to the Recycled sheets with no need for any new tooling or set-up on our end. We can scale quickly if needed.\nWe do not anticipate any problems. We are just switching to specially made recycled sheets but we understand things may come up that we can not predict. We can promise we will work as hard and as fast as we can and product quality will be our first priority. We will always be up-front, transparent, and timely with our updates to you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe all know plastic lives forever. We expect, with proper care, that the Tucktec eco Kayak will not only last for years of enjoyment, but has the potential to last for decades. Even after it's final paddle, the specially formulated HDPE plastic can be recycled up to 10 more times!\nReusability and recyclability\nWe do not package our kayaks in plastic bags or film. The only disposable portion of a delivered Kayak is the cardboard shipping box it comes in. The Kayak itself can be recycled and is made from one of the most accepted plastic for recycling.\nSustainable materials\nWe use the highest grade HDPE recycled plastic. Other than special additives for UV resistance, our Kayak sheets are 99% recycled, and 100% RECYCLABLE.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe manufacture in-house and source special parts and supplies from small local (usually family-owned) companies that exhibit community involvement and environmental awareness. We have worked with each company to make sure that even the plastic or aluminum scrap created from our production is recycled.\nSustainable Distribution\nOur own in-house warehousing means that we do not have to move product multiple times before it reaches the final customer.

A tv series adaptation of Tales From the Loop was launched just a few days  ago on Amazon Prime Video.\nNow, you can take another step into the amazing world of the Loop. In Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame, 1-5 players take the roles of teenagers who investigate the mysteries originating from the Loop, a huge underground science facility with strange effects on the suburban landscapes around it \u2013 just make sure you\u2019re home in time for dinner!\nTales From the Loop \u2013 The Boardgame is designed by Martin Takaichi and includes high-quality miniatures by Paolo Parente's Dust Studio.\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nArt by Simon St\u00e5lenhag\nIn 1954, the government ordered the construction of the world\u2019s largest particle accelerator. The facility was completed in 1969, located deep below the pastoral suburban countryside, outside of the big city. The local population called this marvel of technology the Loop. Over the years since it was built, strange phenomena have started to appear in the area - mysterious creatures stalking the land, machines malfunctioning in inexplicable ways.\nIn the Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, you take the roles of local kids and play cooperatively to investigate whatever phenomena that threaten the islands (or perhaps just the local video store), and hopefully stop them. Each day starts at school, but as soon as the bell rings you can use whatever time you have before dinner and homework to go exploring! Player actions are integrated, meaning there\u2019s no downtime as you wait for others taking their turn. It also makes cooperating with your fellow players dynamic as you can react to things that happen in a turn and don\u2019t have to plan it all out from the start.\nAt least four scenarios will be included in the base game (more can be unlocked as stretch goals), and each scenario takes approximately 90-150 minutes to complete.\nFull Setup of Prototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nAll the components of the core game are listed below. More components can be added if stretch goals are unlocked:\nMiniature produced by Dust Studios based on Simon St\u00e5lenhag's design\nThe Loop isn\u2019t the only technological achievement in the \u201880s that never was. Advanced AI, robotics and magnetrine development are highly advanced as well. Riksenergi, the governmental agency tasked with running The Loop, employs different machines to automate a large number of functions on the islands. While some have drivers or handlers, most are running on their internal AI code.\nIn Tales From the Loop - The Board Game, these machines are represented by beautiful miniatures sculpted by Yannick Hennebo based on St\u00e5lenhag's original designs and manufactured by Dust Studios. They are molded in high-quality PVC plastic and are between 25 and 40mm tall. You can buy extra minis as addons, check the Addons section below.\nIn the STANDARD EDITION, the miniatures are delivered unpainted. In the DELUXE EDITION, the miniatures are delivered PRE-PAINTED by Dust Studio.\nMiniature prototypes by Dust Studio - not final product\nADDON MINIATURE SCENARIO PACKS\nIn addition to the machine minis included in the core set, you can add models of a Gorgosaurus dinosaur and the \"Visitor\" robot, along with scenarios to use them with, Addons to your order - check the Addons section below. Each pack includes a model and 20-30 Scenario Cards. The Gorgosaurus and the Visitor are available unpainted or pre-painted by Dust Studio.\nBelow is a video demonstration showing what a turn can look like in the game, by lead designer Martin Takaichi. It doesn\u2019t go into detail about every rule (there\u2019s the downloadable rulebook for that, see below) but gives you a good sense about how the game flows and general gameplay.\nTo let you to try out Tales from the Loop \u2013 The Board Game for yourself, we\u2019ve decided to provide a Print & Play kit for download. It doesn\u2019t contain everything that will be in the final game, but four characters and one scenario is enough to play the game with three other friends! If you just want to read the beta rules the rulebook is available for download.\nDo keep in mind that this is in only a prototype in Alpha state \u2013 things can and will change from the P&P version to the final version. In fact, that\u2019s another reason we wanted to do this, to get feedback from you so we can make the game the best it can be. Use this survey to provide feedback and report on errors.\nLINK TO THE PRINT AND PLAY FILES\nPrototype of Tales From the Loop \u2013 The Board Game\nIn addition, backer Timothy Clark has made two excellent videos that go through how to set up the Alpha and pretty much all the rules for the game in a clear and engaging way. If the Alpha rules PDF put you off, or you simply prefer to learn by example, do check out these two videos:\nAs we have passed our base funding goal, we will be able to expand the games with stretch goals.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops. This requires smart management of three types of units: Archers, Spearmen and Cavalry. Players place these soldiers one by one, playing the Tactics cards that create another layer of interaction.\nGain meditation by shooting with the Monk Archer, then spend meditation on a Cavalry Squad Leader to move your Cavalry around the battlefield faster, and \u2013 finally \u2013 finish off by getting extra Honor for each of the Cavalry\u2019s engagements thanks to the Banner Holder. There are endless possibilities for great combos and memorable plays.\nOn top of that, your Advisors and General might give your troops extra abilities, such as shooting twice or looting twice the resources!\nAll of the above makes the Great Wall one of our most strategically involving designs that will be appreciated by many different groups of players:\n                            - those who love euro-styled games with their intricate economies and engine-building,\n                            - those who love over-the-table play,\n                            - and finally, those who simply like to wage war on a beautiful map.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

Other base functionalities, like brushes and shape tools, are already available through the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor and are not listed here:\nThe Citybuilder coherently assembles sections according to archetypes - e.g. poor human district or elvish administrative quarters - and logically auto-generates housing structures, squares and parks.\nEach house is equipped with its own automatically generated map-notes, including residents per house, construction costs, etc. and will be used to create note-based outlines for your cities. As is customary for the DUNGEONFOG system, notes can always be edited and expanded.\nEvery section can be set to a specific archetype, which will affect the random asset-pool for buildings:\nWealth level: Poor, Average, Rich, etc.\nType of building: Merchants, homes, administration, etc.\nRace/Species: Dwarven, Elvish, Human etc.\nPlan Settlements With Just A Few Clicks\nYou can also place landmarks and buildings manually. Temples, markets, towers, etc. can be planted precisely where you want them to be at any time. The remaining space can then be filled with buildings based on the selected archetype of the section.\nPin locations and link them to battlemaps\nPlay directly on the maps with our Fog-of-War viewer\nEach building, square and street can be mapped out in as much detail as you desire and require, including battle and dungeon maps. Let your imagination guide you without boundaries!\nClever Coding For Boundless Creation\nVector-based drawing enables you to manipulate landmasses to an unprecedented extent: Select, move or resize landmasses without losing quality on the graphics. Add, subtract or even combine landmasses to create unique regions. \nVector-based drawing allows you to revisit and manipulate all objects\nNever before was composing original regions and landmasses easier and more intuitive. By cleverly balancing tool functionality and harmonic art composition, the DUNGEONFOG core mechanics offer the perfect fusion of practical application and elegant map design.\nBIOMES\nBiomes are quickly and easily allocated with an intuitive brush tool. This renders different forms of vegetations, geographical formations and landscapes effortlessly and stylishly.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Grassland\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Forest\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Mountain range\nWith PROJECT DEIOS, you will have access to a base setting for fantasy assets that will include more than 200 assets, for biomes like:\nBiome Samples\nSince the monthly DUNGEONFOG prop packs enjoy high popularity, we will continue to develop new textures, settings and props on a regular basis.\nPROJECT DEIOS combines all your ideas, detailed maps and concepts for continents into one giant map model. Through clever segmentation and the gradual increase of detail complexity, your world creation is a stable, coherent concept without boundaries.\nAdvanced Export Functions\nEach region can be selected, viewed and exported separately, including all contained landmarks and linked maps. The scales are automatically adjusted to fit your viewport and level of zoom.\nPolitical borders can easily be drawn - the DUNGEONFOG core functions circumvent unwanted overlaps and neatly translate all attributes to practical and editable Game Master notes.\nClimate zones, water currents and other characteristics are effortlessly added with easy-to-use brushes. Each feature stays continuously editable, allowing you to change or add whatever you want as your story progresses.\nEach landmark you place on your creation is automatically attributed its individual location. PROJECT DEIOS stores all locations, landmarks and properties in a geospatial data model. This allows your creativity to venture out endlessly, because map sizes are almost unlimited.\nBuilding an entire world from scratch might seem a bit intimidating. With the community maps feature, you can form creative alliances and collaborate on your storytelling endeavors. You can also share your worlds or use and adapt maps from fellow Game Masters or authors. There is no need to hide your creativity away - be proud and enrich multiple adventures with your ideas!\nJoin A Community Full Of Stories And Creation\nThe three pillars of DUNGEONFOG have always been \u201cPlan - Create - SHARE\u201d. We will stay true to our core functionalities, even while expanding our scope to make effortless world creation a reality.\nA great advantage of the innovative DUNGEONFOG map-making toolset is the simple but crucial feature that every object, entity and map stays perpetually editable and can be reused and even shared. This enables Game Masters, Authors, Storytellers and RPG enthusiasts to collaborate, exchange feedback and help improve each others\u2019 worlds. \nYou can draw from the users' collective creativity by using community maps, adapt them to your story\u2019s needs and make your own original ideas accessible to others.\nCollaboration Opportunities\nWe\u2019ll even go a step further, and explore how we can make collaboration between multiple authors on shared maps a possibility. Collaboration is not just working together on one map - but also using other users\u2019 maps to add to your own stories. Discovering a beautiful world map will spark new ideas and with PROJECT DEIOS, you\u2019ll have the platform to add your own creative stories to existing maps and let marvellous adventures unfold.\nWe think that everybody should be able to create maps with the new DEIOS Suite! After launch, we\u2019ll offer Free Access with limited features to everyone.\nIf you'd like to have access to all of our features, consider backing us at the Bronze level or higher for access to the full DEIOS Suite. \nKickstarter only\n\n\nYou and your support through Kickstarter will bring the DEIOS Suite to life. So we\u2019re offering you special bargains as a thank you, which are only available exclusively during this Kickstarter campaign:\nKickstarter-Exclusive Art Packs\nWhen supporting our campaign at Silver (pick one), Gold (pick two) or Platinum (all) level, you will receive our additional, Kickstarter-exclusive art packs, each containing 25 assets for cities, regions and world maps.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Video Series By The GreatGM\nCreating entire worlds with manifold distinct areas and settlements offers possibilities for near endless adventures. It might be easy to get lost in boundless creativity and to lose sight of one's goals, were it not for the guidance of wise masters and the help of fellow adventurers. \nIn his exclusive 6-part video series, The GreatGM lends Kickstarter supporters (Gold level and above) a helping hand and shares his vast knowledge of worldbuilding and storytelling. Since his new series is exclusively tailored to the DUNGEONFOG system and the  DEIOS suite, all viewers can expect valuable hands-on tips and masterful tricks from The GreatGM himself.\nDUNGEONFOG, World Anvil, GreatGM and Caeora Have Teamed Up For This Project\nAt its core, DUNGEONFOG was founded to support Game Masters and storytellers on their creative journey, and to make map-making easy, intuitive and practically useful. But we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not alone on this quest. World Anvil, The GreatGM and Caeora also aim to transform map-making, storytelling and worldbuilding into an extraordinary experience for you. So we\u2019ve teamed up!\nPROJECT DEIOS is our shared vision - ONE system that can support ALL your map-making and storytelling needs. DUNGEONFOG was a massive Kickstarter success back in 2017, and our toolset makes the mapping process effortless, quick and perpetually interconnected. With these incredible partners, we\u2019ve formed a team of experts in the world of storytelling, worldbuilding and map-making to make PROJECT DEIOS a reality.\n www.dungeonfog.com \n www.worldanvil.com \nwww.greatgamemaster.com\nwww.caeora.com \nWorld Anvil Integration\nOur partner World Anvil brings a lot of experience with collaboration features to the table. Drawing on their expertise, we will develop a permission-based co-authoring, commenting and sharing system. Simultaneously, we have a keen eye on the smooth technical connection between DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil. \nWe\u2019ll start with basic integration features, like accessibility of DUNGEONFOG maps while editing a world in World Anvil, or accessing your written world descriptions as a resource while creating maps in the DUNGEONFOG editor. \nWe\u2019ll also pay attention to the functionality of pins: Creating locations will auto-generate pins, and therefore, redundant manual pinning will not be necessary. In addition, we\u2019re exploring many ways to integrate World Anvil\u2019s extensive Campaign Manager and their character manager, Heroes, with PROJECT DEIOS. For example, our player viewer could be integrated with Heroes, so that all party members know their location at all times, or the location of the main villain.\nEasy Collaboration\nThe joint communities from DUNGEONFOG, World Anvil and The GreatGM is a thriving community of map makers, storytellers, writers and Game Masters at your disposal. This makes sharing resources easy as never before. A thriving community also enables you to cheer for great maps by others and draw motivation from users that used your work.\nArtwork and Assets Will Be Created By Caeora \nThe assets will not only be created in his beautiful unique style, but will also pay attention to scaling & line art so that every map you create will always look stunning - whether you play digitally or export them in high resolution.\nOur dream is to help Game Masters, Authors and storytellers create entire worlds in all their detailed glory. Creating something this boundless is a huge endeavour! \nOur primary goal is to get enough funding to cover an additional developer and have enough funds to pay our partners for their work.  \nTo cover all core functionalities, we estimate the costs to be around 100,000 EUR (about $112,140). Since we launched DUNGENFOG, we managed to build up some resources that cover about 40% of the estimated development costs. Our partners agreed to help us with an additional 10%, which means we can already cover 50% of the development costs of our DEIOS Suite.\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to fully finance our dreams - rather, your support could pick us up halfway and carry us to the finish line. Therefore, we set the funding goal to 50,000 EUR (about $56,070). With additional  resources, we can hire additional developers and speed up the development process immensely, getting DEIOS into your hands sooner!\nProject DEIOS Pricing After Launch\nWe want to make sure that prices are compatible with using the DUNGEONFOG system as a hobby. At this point, we estimate the full package (meaning the \u201cDEIOS suite\u201d including the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor) to cost around \u20ac 7.90 (about $8.80) per month. \nBattlemaps are included in DEIOS - so you only need the DEIOS subscription\nOur DUNGEONFOG battlemap subscription will remain untouched and will be available as a separate subscription as well.\nWe will offer monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription models with respective discounts. As is usual for DUNGEONFOG, you\u2019ll always be able to pause your subscription without losing your creative work. \nWhile planning this project, it was highly important to us that we grant our supporters early access to the DEIOS Suite development stages. Therefore, our timeline includes several stages of development releases to keep waiting time short, while at the same time enabling room for early feedback and improvement. \nNow that we have reached our funding goal - let's talk about stretch goals! \nAs enthusiastic map makers and RPG adventurers, we have a full array of additional ideas we thrive to implement - so here they are:\nPortals and Planes - FUNDED!\nPROJECT DEIOS is conceptualized to evolve and grow infinitely. Our first stretch goal includes the possibility to not only build an entire world, but to conceptualize multiple planes of existence. To support even the most fantastic ideas, we will offer biomes and props to create adventures taking place in five additional settings - and it is up to you to decide which ones will be included in the DEIOS Suite. \nWhen we reached this stretch goal after the end of the PROJECT DEIOS Kickstarter, we will give backers the opportunity to vote for their 5 favorite settings, which could include:\nWe will notify all eligible (silver+) backers after the campaign where to place your vote\nOnce the stretch goal is reached and the funding is over, we will contact all eligible (Silver+) backers and ask you to help us decide on the new settings.\nIf you would like to add to that list, join us on Discord or post here in our campaign comments with the addition: \u201cSETTING -\u201d  (Example: \u201cSETTING - Candyland\u201d).\nOnce the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our voting tool and you can help us to determine what of those 5 settings will be created first.\nEach setting will include artwork for biomes, city buildings and landmarks and will contain more than 100 different assets for your worlds.\nThe setting will then be available with ALPHA 2 so you can test and review it as soon as possible.\n SOLAR SYSTEMS, STARMAPS and 3D World Mapping - FUNDED!\nEven multiple planes of existence are not enough for you? \nWhen we reach this stretch goal, you don\u2019t need to feel tied to one world alone - let your imagination venture out into unexplored galaxies and the unlimited possibilities of space. \n When reaching this stretch goal, we will add tools to create \nGalaxies\nSolar Systems\nand mapping tools to create a 3D mapping of your world as globe, disc, cylinder or dyson spheres.\nAll maps will remain linkable and you will be able to expand your creation into whole universes.\n RANDOM LANDMASS SEEDING AND CITY GENERATOR - FUNDED!\nWhile creating entire worlds and galaxies, not every village, town or region has to be created individually. Sometimes, a specific vision of a city demands special attention to detail only in certain places, while other districts could be more generally conceptualized. \nOr a story calls for a highly characteristic and specific shoreline, while the vast central plains don\u2019t need to contain that much detail. \nFear not, we have you covered: When we reach this stretch goal, we will develop a tool set to generate entire cities and landmasses randomly. All you have to do is adjust the parameters to you needs and create a randomly generated map.\n Random city generator: Adjust size, demographics and layout (medieval , western, etc.) and we will randomly populate your city map with districts and buildings.\n Random landmasses: Adjust landmass-types amount of water on you map, sizes,  island scatter and more to randomly generate world maps.\n Save the seed for your randomization and share it with your friends\nTo celebrate this unlocked stretch goal, we have added an additional +25 Asset Pack to the pool!\n\u20ac 175.000 - New Setting - FUNDED\nWith 175k funded, Caeora will now add another new setting that you can vote on at the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 250.000 DESKTOP APPLICATION - FUNDED\nWe can now hire an additional application developer full time and finish the desktop application together with the launch of DEIOS.\nOne-Time-Buy License Keys\nAll Platinum backers (and beyond) will receive in addition to all the other rewards 1 license-key to the standalone desktop application, which will run without subscription.\nThis means, that during our extended development time and beyond you will have:\nAccess to our ALPHA and BETA (online), \nAll Kickstarter settings and artpacks (also as part of your standalone license).\nPremium Access to Online DEIOS Suite until Desktop App has been released.\n1 License Key to standalone desktop application, that you can either use to activate your standalone desktop application, or gift a friend.\nAbout the Desktop Application\nOnce released, the software will available for download to any premium user at no additional cost.\nIn addition, we will offer a standalone license, that comes without subscription.\n+\u20ac 25.000 - The Indefinite Stretch Goal x6\n\n For every additional \u20ac 25.000 beyond our 250k stretch goal (275k, 300k, etc.) we'll increase the assets for all 7 settings by: \n + 50 battlemap assets  \n  + 15 additional landmarks  \n  + 15 additional special buildings for cities\nAnd + 50 new assets for solar systems & galaxies\n(in total 600+ assets)\n\n\nStep 1 - UNLOCKED: Digital badges for DUNGEONFOG and WORLDANVIL | +1 asset\nSuccess! All backers will be able to claim these exclusive badges for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles. And every backer will receive one additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 2 - UNLOCKED:  +3 month | + 3 asset\nSuccess! With all three Social Stretch Goals unlocked, we are now adding + 3 MONTH run-time to all PROJECT DEIOS subscriptions and every backer will receive three additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 3 - UNLOCKED: 3x +25 Asset Packs\n Wow - You have unlocked ALL our social Stretch goals! We are now adding these EXCLUSIVE ASSET PACK (25 items) to your DUNGEONFOG account:  \nFacebook Challenge - COMPLETE!\nFollow this link to our Facebook post and share it with your friends:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/dungeonfog/videos/470601057087850/\n  Twitter Challenge  - COMPLETE! \nFollow this link to our Twitter post and retweet it:\nhttps://twitter.com/WorldAnvil/status/1153093783283744772?s=20 \n\nInstagram Challenge  - COMPLETE! \nFollow this link to our Instagram post and like it:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B0V0V6SBU2D/?igshid=oahxha3re8of \n\n\nJoin us by backing our campaign today, so we can bring the DUNGEONFOG DEIOS Suite to you and all of our worldbuilding and RPG enthusiast-friends!\nThank you, Kickstarter!\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 800+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $350MM raised between them. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has the potential to completely change the lives of all of us here at the studio, so we're putting our all into it.\n\nWe've been very open with the development of DUNGEONFOG so far and we take comments and concerns from our community very seriously. In fact, a lot of the changes in the editor came from community suggestions. We will continue to take and implement suggestions for Project DEIOSlong after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make everything compatible with as many operating systems & browsers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some older computers and browsers will not be able to support all features. Please try the free version of DUNGEONFOG to see if your computer has problems running the current battlemap editor.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for fairly regular build updates with monthly intervals, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We will try our hardest to make DEIOS a tool everyone will enjoy and will remember.\n\nWeb development isn't always smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part), so that's why we\u2019ve added a bit of a cushion to our timeline and chose Spring 2020 for the release date. This will give us a bit of breathing room so that we can get it to you on schedule... or maybe even earlier!\n\nIf it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise. But in case we have a little delay ( unlikely, but possible), a bit more of your patience will be highly appreciated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Helping Fairy", "descp": "Let the fairies praise you and enjoy the warm, fuzzy feeling of our gratitude.\nAll Kickstarter supporters will be able to claim a special DEIOS badge for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["186 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "BRONZE", "descp": "With the BRONZE pledge, you gain access to the open BETA release and a 3-months membership to the full DEIOS Suite editor (after release).\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge\nOpen BETA (Winter 2020)\n3 Months DEIOS subscription (starts with launch)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["647 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "SILVER", "descp": "With the SILVER pledge, you gain access to the closed BETA, a 6-months membership to the full DEIOS Suite editor (after release) and 1 unique art pack, exclusive to Kickstarter backers.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital DGNFOG badge\nDigital World Anvil badge\nEarly access -

Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience.

Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Set in a world on the brink of war, it has much in common with Earth in the 1930's, but instead of mundane technology powered by steam, coal, and oil, this world is powered by magic, enthralled daeva, and lightning! Imperial superpowers teeter on the edge of cross-continental conflict, while beautiful and deadly airships patrol the skies. Adventurers wield both machine guns and magic, spirits haunt the desert night and the dead have been known to walk again. Seek out adventure, mystery and great fortune as an elite soldier, a powerful mage, or a cosmically-attuned spiritist!\nThe game will feel very familiar to fans of tabletop roleplaying games like D&D and Pathfinder. The players each control characters in a made-up world while the GM helps tell the story and describe how the world reacts to the players. Zafir play sessions are separated into missions, and each mission is 2-5 combat encounters. Encounters take roughly 20-35 minutes depending on number of enemies and complexity, and in playtests players feel like they're able to make smart strategic decisions without holding up play. In general, combat in Zafir feels like playing a cooperative boardgame or skirmish wargame.\nZafir: Tactical Roleplaying Game Rulebook (left), Kickstarter-Exclusive Special Edition (right)\nWhen we set out to develop the combat of Zafir, we were reacting to traditional RPGs like D&D and Pathfinder. In these games, combat often feels simplistic, leaving the players with very few tactical decisions. For many characters, the optimal play is simply to move toward an enemy, then strike them with your weapon until they drop. The decisions a player makes on the battlefield don't feel nearly as impactful as they should.\nZafir is much more nuanced. As well as being played on a three-dimensional, one-inch grid where verticality and elevation are critical, it boasts a cover system that rewards careful movement and and gives bonuses for attacking targets caught out in the open.\nEvery turn, each player will weigh up a host of tactical considerations. Should you move out of a defensive position in order to get an attack advantage? Should you hunker down into full-cover and lob grenades? Or maybe it's time to grab the high ground and gain that elevation bonus. Zafir creates an experience where every move and every attack is so much more meaningful, and one critical decision or tactical error could change the outcome of an entire fight.\nContained in its hardcover rulebook is everything you need to play!\nFor Players:\nStreamlined Character Creation: Build your character quickly and efficiently, using starter classes to help you learn the game as you launch into your first mission. There's no need to understand every rule in the game before you hit the table to play! Zafir's characters develop as you play, the complexity evolving gradually.\nSix Playable Species: Zafir is home to six sapient species, each with their own cultures and national identity: insaan (humans), hinn (elves), ath'enki (subterranean orcish folk), rhuthari (lionfolk), dyn (foxfolk), and jaan (lizardfolk).\nSix Character Classes: Choose one of six main classes, each with a different battlefield expertise featuring over 140 class abilities: Recon, Sharpshooter, Arcanist, Grenadier, Adept, Acolyte\nTwenty-Four Class Specializations: As your character levels up, they gain further class specializations that enhance your abilities and provide further special bonuses.\nClear, Concise Rules: A brand-new, unique combat system focusing on gun combat, cover mechanics, and tactical battlefield decisions, that plays as fast and exciting as an action movie!\nGuns, Equipment, Airships, & Artifacts: Access to a wide array of weapons, armor, vehicles, equipment mods and abilities to kit out your character exactly the way you want!\nLore, Locations, History, & Cosmology: A fully fleshed-out campaign setting, including extensive information on the people, the gods, the nations, and the history of Zafir.\nFor Game Masters:\nVillains, Minions, & Monsters: A compendium of bad guys, with over 50 enemy unit descriptions and abilities (including many monsters based on Zoroastrian and Persian mythology!), plus all the tools to design your own.\nStarting Mission: A detailed starting mission to help you teach the players the game and introduce them to the combat of Zafir.\nRecommended Battlefields: A series of pre-designed battlefields, for when you don't want to prep your own.\nTips for Running Games: Zafir might play a little different that other RPGs, but we've got a section chock full of great tips to help GMs run amazing games of Zafir.\nEncounter Generators & Loot Tables: A plethora of helpful tools to design great encounters for your players and give awesome, balanced rewards\nAzi-Zahhak, the Black Queen of Serpents, the Immortal Dragon (stats included in GM's Section)\nLike many of our favorite RPGs, we've designed six iconic characters as inspiration to players and as examples of the different playable species and classes.\nVishtek, Dalinus, Kira, Tiz, Tyrain, & Lotoku\nCheck out the project updates for details on the revealed Iconics!\nVishtek Okam'ran (she/her) - Ath'enki Adept (More Info)\nDalinus (they/them) - Jaan Sharpshooter (More Info)\nKira (she/her) - Hinn Trencher (More Info)\nTIz (she/her) - Dyn-errad Arcanist (More Info)\nTyrain (he/him) - Insaan Acolyte (More Info)\nLotoku (he/him) - Rhuthari Sapper (More Info)\nZafir Games is a one-person team currently being funded from personal savings. So far, we've contracted some absolutely fantastic art and writing from contract team members (see below) and we're absolutely certain this game is super fun and will make people happy to play it. However, finishing the game, paying artists for more beautiful art, editing the book, and printing and shipping it world wide will require significant funding.\nCurrently, 100% of the rules, 100% of the character and class abilities, and about 70% of the GM's guide and campaign setting are already written.

Use your fame and influence to bid for the most famous gladiators in history. These star players could earn your school much wealth and glory if you use them skillfully! Use your hired gladiator in epic arena combats - put on a spectacle guaranteed to excite the roman crowds and gain your school the fame it surely deserves!\nWinning the Game.  Use the starplayer gladiators most skillfully, impress the crowds the most, outmanoeuvre the other players and show off your best combat skills in the arena events to win! Do badly and the fame of your ludus will dwindle in the eyes of Caesar and the keys to the colosseum will go to your rival!\nHere are all the Stretchgoals we have unlocked already. The next one is an awesome addition to every pledge level of the game!\nGladiatores: Blood for Roses plays over 3-4 rounds. Each round is a separate arena event where each player bids their future fame (victory points) on randomly drawn starplayer gladiators. Players can bet on who might win the next fight, plan secret tactics and gain a wealthy sponsor who will help the player in the next event. Each player then uses their chosen gladiator in the next arena battle event against the other players gladiators using unique sets of combat cards specific to each fighter.\nEach gladiator character comes with a unique set of combat skill move cards.\nThere are eight unique gladiator characters to choose from in the base game, each with their own special combat card deck and variable powers. With over 20 combat moves that link together in unique ways, each combat will feel totally different with nearly 100,000 card combinations to explore!\nThe quick video below shows 2 examples of the rapid card play in action.\nPLAY\n\n Example 1: the attacker Achillia starts with a nasty cleave attack that the defender quickly parries away. Then a flurry of blows and counter blows happen before the attacker manages a successful deflect which allows her to stagger her opponent. Example 2: Kalendio the Retiarius thrusts with his spear but is blocked. He shoves his opponent but is bashed with a shield which he swiftly manages to dodge...\nWith so many card combinations to choose from, every battle in Gladiatores creates this unique and evolving narrative gameplay.\nTactical card play, risk-taking, bluffing, trapping enemies, clever use of gladiator special abilities or just sheer audacity in the arena battles will impress the crowd and gain you the most glory. Plan your moments to strike, use your secret tactics wisely, learn from enemy mistakes, spot and then exploit their weaknesses to get ahead and grab those victory wreaths!\nDuring the game, each player will accumulate victory wreaths that combine at games end for a final victory point score.\nGladiatores Blood for roses combines many well known game mechanisms in a novel way. These include: \nThe Praetorian (all in) and Senator pledges (all in x2 game) come with a sponsor pack. It includes a fascinating historical folio exclusive to this kickstarter, the extra unlocked miniatures and some special promo cards as a FREE trial of what will potentially be available in future expansions!\n Setup - Short setup time. Takes only 2 minutes!\n 8 playable characters - 8 unique gladiators with more to follow!\n Flexible game length - choose a quick battle (1 round) or settle in for the more strategic season mode (3-4 rounds)\n Variable gameplay - each gladiator character plays completely differently, with different combat skills, strengths and weaknesses in each game.\n Dynamic combat experience - our nRPS system takes a complex web of possible combat moves and countermoves - like a real sword fight! - and condenses it into an easy to understand and swift to play card game.\n Longterm replayability -  Different skill sets drawn each time you play + variable challenges means huge replayability.\n Easy to learn - Check out the rulebook section below to see for yourself or watch the videos on our youtube channel.\n Fantastic art - from acclaimed illustrators Anja Kryczkowska (Gloom of Kilforth, Evolution) and Brolken (Legend of the Cryptids).\n Expansions - We already have a range of new famous gladiators ready to expand your choice, new combat moves and some secret plans we have for future campaign play...!\n8 playable characters. In Gladiatores: Blood for Roses you can play eight unique historical gladiators with their own special abilities. Each character uses a thematic set of combat skills that emulate the styles of gladiators that existed during the roman era (e.g. the Secutor, Murmillo, Retiarius, Dimachaerus, Hoplomachus and Thracian). Randomly drawn extra cards complete the gladiator's skill set for the next event making each game an unique challenge.\n WITH MANY MORE FAMOUS GLADIATORS PLANNED TO FOLLOW...\nFor fun we are taking our gladiator school Ludus Leonidas across Roman Europe, all the way to the colosseum in Rome! Each stretchgoal is a famous city amphitheatre and with your help, we can knock down those stretchgoals and take our gladiators through the regions, closer and closer to the Gold prize in Rome! Follow our progress on this map below...\nGladiatores is the only gladiator themed game (as far as we know) that actually makes you feel as though you are fighting for your life in a blow-by-blow combat. We've designed a combat system that emulates / simulates the cut and thrust of actual combat. Our Card Dueling system takes a complex web of possible moves, counter moves and follow up actions and presents them in a very easy visual and playable way. The cards played in each combat between players creates a narrative flow of 'take that' actions and counter-actions that will keep players on their toes in every game!\n Also, Gladiatores: Blood for Roses is not just a combat game. In fact, the main purpose of combat is to use your star player gladiator wisely to either win the wreath of victory or by impressing the crowd - preferably both! All the glory gained from betting, winning or showing off to the fans during each event gains you victory points for your school, and ultimately a chance of winning the game!\nBidding: A first step before each event is bidding. Gladiatores are randomly drawn for the star player market and each player then gets to bid on one. Other players can outbid an earlier player who then has to choose an alternative. The cost to buy a gladiator is a player's future victory points! Players must therefore think wisely how much they can afford for that star gladiator they really want! See the graphic below for how this works.\nPLAY\n\nCombat: Each player's school then enters their gladiator into the next randomly drawn event. Each player draws their mini-deck of combat cards specific to their gladiator, and makes ready to fight for prestige, glory and the all important victory wreaths. Combat cards represent single moves a gladiator can make in the fight (e.g. Thrust, Cleave, Deflect, Dodge and Disarm). Many cards also have some 'countering' options written on the card's orange side banners. When another gladiator attacks you, play one of the cards listed on the banner and you break the previous card played against you, making its effects no longer valid. This card and counter-card play continues until a player chooses to (or cannot play another card). The results of the final card then trigger!\nJust take a look at the detailed combat exchange below for a good example of this in action:\n Very quickly you will be planning your combat moves like a pro!\nBy countering the attacker's cards with 'break' cards of your own leads to a detailed exchange of combat moves (much like a real sword fight!) which we call Chaining. Often you can chain your own combat moves, using follow up cards that give you extra advantages (for example like playing a DISARM card after a successful DEFLECT). The following graphic shows this in action...\nCard chaining example\nOften players will fight it out in a flurry of cards and countercards, trying to get past their opponent's defenses and strike a telling blow. But, you need to take care! This is not a deck builder. Rather, its a deck destroyer! Your combat deck is your stamina and endurance to survive the event. Spend your cards too quickly and your rivals will pounce on your weakened state!\nTo win, it's all about watching your rivals moves, choosing your moments wisely and forcing your enemies to use up their cards while holding on to your own... \n Event Cards: Every round of Gladiatores requires an event card to be randomly drawn. The event cards detail the glory prizes for coming 1st and 2nd, the size of the crowd at the event (number of rose petals = crowd favour) and the conversion of crowd favour gained during the fight into glory (bottom box). The base game comes with 6 events (2 each of bronze, silver and gold level). Each has variable glory rewards.\nGlory tokens: The glory tokens gained during events are worth variable victory points (VP). Most players should win at least 1 or 2 glory tokens in each event. Glory is stored on each Player's Wheel of Glory. Being 1st or 2nd to complete this wheel scores big VP bonuses and gives a big boost to your chances of winning the game overall! \nVP collection and Wheel of Glory\nThe Player with the highest VP score after the chosen number of rounds is declared the winner and gains their rightful place performing shows before Emperor Caesar in Rome! \nWatch Ryan's detailed How to Play video here.\nThe lads at Playing BoardGames recorded a liveplay of Gladiatores in action.

Being a small indie publisher, we cannot produce this fantastic limited edition game in its present form without your support.\n Stretchgoals will allow us to add in more amazing content (such as new gladiator characters, new combat moves and sponsors), improve production quality and improve the game for you and for everyone. \n Backers make a great game greater! We listen to you guys and will work to include some of your great ideas in the final game.\n Backers receive more and a better game at a better price compared to what they would get after the campaign through a normal retail edition. \n Shipping will be from warehouses in Europe, USA, (and possibly Canada and Australia also) so you will get your game much faster than through retail and won't have to pay import duties and taxes.\n Christmas! is not here yet but our plan and aim is to get the game to all backers ready for the holiday season.

All rewards can be confirmed for each backer at the Pledge Manager stage after the kickstarter is complete.\nArena Playmat - not final\nThe game is card intensive so the arena playmat (~24x20cm) is a very useful component that helps to keep the tokens and stacks of cards organised for all players during the game. We only use quality neoprene for these and they are very hard wearing but easily foldable.\n This is the replacement Active Player Marker (G1) included in the Deluxe game set. Approx. 70-80mm tall. Miniature comes unpainted. You can add more than 1 miniature if you wish - just increase your pledge using the manage pledge button by \u00a39.50/$12 for each additional model you are ordering. \nHere are three fantastic paint jobs done for us. Please click on the images below and give these amazing miniature painters a thumbs up or like.\nWe have also unlocked 2 alternative gladiator sculpts! Your choice of which model(s) you want can be confirmed through the pledge manager after the kickstarter finishes. If you want more than 1 miniature, just increase your pledge by \u00a39.50/$12 for each additional model you are purchasing.\nWe all know that shipping games over 1kg is expensive and with current trade agreements in a state of flux this means that publishers have to be sensible and careful over shipping rates. So we are subsidising shipping to everywhere as much as we can and depending on our final funding amount, we will try to subsidise this further.\nUK backers will get FREE postage and all others get the price reduced shipping/postage added when you pledge. All final pledge amounts, add-ons etc and tracked services can be confirmed or adjusted by you within the Pledge Manager after the kickstarter finishes. (Note that some add-ons might trigger extra postage - for example ordering a 2nd game).\nFor shipping we are working with multiple international partners in USA, CA, UK and EU to find the most cost effective and safest way to get you your rewards. Only 1% of backers from our previous kickstarter had problems with delivery (usually due to changes of address). We will hopefully add Australia-friendly also if we get enough backers from that region.\nShipping costs shown below are for untracked services, based on recommended pricings provided by our fulfilment partners.\nHERO PLEDGE       CANADA - \u00a37, USA - \u00a37, EU - \u00a36*, RoW - \u00a315\nCHAMPION PLEDGE       CANADA - \u00a39, USA - \u00a39, EU - \u00a38*, RoW - \u00a318 \nWe will ship to our international fulfilment centres at our cost. Tracked shipping service upgrades and all additional extras (e.g. extra game copies) can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign has finished. We did this for our previous kickstarter with a similar box weight and backers were all happy.\nPlease note that we do not ship to: Russia, Brazil, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \n* Some EU countries will have slightly higher charges due to available delivery services.\nThe game is 100% finished and components are already being organised with the manufacturer.\nOur calculated estimate for delivery of this project is early December 2019 (in time for the holiday season). This estimate covers additional time for final tweaks, last minute changes and problems that might occur. Being our second kickstarter project, we know how to maximise both quality and speed to get a game project manufactured. Our previous project was delivered to all backers before the final estimate date. Delays in manufacture and shipping however can and do often crop up due to many circumstances outside our control. Therefore our deadline for delivery of this project is a calculated estimate. In fact we aim to beat this target by at least a month but are being sensibly cautious and adding in some extra time. We will keep you informed of our progress on all this as we work to fulfilment. \nIf you are a bricks and mortar retailer (including cafes that sell games) and would like to support this kickstarter, please pledge at the special LUDUS pledge level. This level is a deposit against the cost of carton/case multiples (5+ games/carton) of this KS edition game (base game or deluxe + all unlocked SGs) at the normal retailer-friendly discount off the KS price (contact us to confirm). You will also get a free demo set with your 1st carton ordered and access to all promo and special additions.\nOnce pledged, we will then message you to confirm your final order, how many of each version you want, confirm shipping and delivery address after the kickstarter has ended. We guarantee your order will get sent out at the same time as all other backers rewards allowing you to jump ahead and get your order many months before normal retailers will! You can of course contact us through KS messages or info[at]badcatgames.eu to discuss any of this in more detail.\n And here are some really cool Avatars for you to download and share the love of Ludus Leonidas.

We have already sent off some of the files for pre-production checks and will be ready to pick up speed and complete the file checking stage soon after the kickstarter finishes.\n\nThe game is 100% complete, requiring only tweaking, additional final artwork changes to be added depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked. This means we can be ready to give the final approval for production in plenty of time, so that we can get the games to all of you before the end of the year.

In the board game, you and your friends are deadly diseases, battling to infect and wipe out the world! (You can get the original game here).\nArmageddon takes Plague Inc. to the next level, supporting new play styles, expanding strategic choices as well as adding more variety to an already extremely replayable game. It also lets you play with an extra player!\nNew Fungus disease type: The Fungus is all about mobility and spreading across the globe. With its Spore Burst it can infect new countries with ease, but it can struggle to fully take them over. Puffball increases the power of future infections, and Fungal Bloom exploits empty countries to score DNA.\nNew Bioweapon disease type: The Bioweapon is fully focused on lethality. The Armageddon ability lets it kill without worrying about the Death Dice. The more it kills, the stronger it becomes as Festering Corpses generates DNA from dead countries. However, it has limited infectivity and will need to consider Genetic Targeting to avoid eradicating itself. \nGenetic modification game mechanic: During the game, players can spend DNA to get unique Genes which power radical tactics and specialise their evolution. Paying too much for a Gene or letting an opponent get it for too little can be the difference between domination and extinction!\nTomorrow's World Country Cards: New country cards reflect our changing world in the game and mean countries might not be quite as you remember them. Isolationist USA has no transport links, Brexit Britain isn't in Europe, and you can probably guess what happens to Global Warming Greenland...\nNew Event and Trait Cards: Loads of new cards can be added into the existing decks, increasing variety and giving you new ways to interact with (and mess with) your friends. \nExtra player: New Plague Tokens and Evolution Slides allow an extra player to infect the world. The game now officially supports 1-5 players. (or 6 unofficially if you got the previous 5th player expansion from Kickstarter!) \n\nIn return for your support, the Armageddon Standard pledge gives you a first edition copy of Plague Inc: Armageddon at a discounted price as well as a Kickstarter bonus - the Repeat Infection pack which adds a number of new extreme event cards which are particularly powerful and/or dangerous in the right hands.\nIf you are feeling particularly enthusiastic - the Armageddon Enthusiast pledge adds the Collector Pack, Storage Pack and Digital Disease Pack - providing extra content in and out of the game.\nIf you are new to Plague Inc: The Board Game - then you want the Armageddon Newcomer pledge which includes a copy of the base game along with everything from the Armageddon Standard pledge.\nAs more people back the project, stretch goals will be unlocked which will add additional content and features to the game for free (for all pledge levels). \n Here are some of the lovely things that the press have said about Plague Inc : The Board Game thus far:\n \u201cThe game just looks great. From your player mat being a microscope slide image of your disease, to the blood splattered Death Die, the visual design is perfectly executed...I absolutely recommend this game.\u201d - Geek & Sundry \n \u201cI\u2019ll tell you two things: One the game is good and two, it really does feel like the app\u2026 Dice Tower judgement: Excellent!\u201d - The Dice Tower \n \u201c... a surprisingly enjoyable, intelligent experience that also works as a superb single-player game\u201d - The Guardian \n \u201cIt deftly weaves simple elements together to generate meaningful decisions on every turn, and it\u2019s straightforward enough that I\u2019d happily introduce it to newer gamers.\u201d - Ars Technica \n \u201cThere\u2019s a fantastic theme running through the game, and the challenge of getting your fledgling little illness and turning it into (quite literally) a world beater never gets boring.\u201d - The Gaming Review \n\u201cWe all loved it and we've played it multiple times\u2026 We genuinely all enjoyed it equally - aged 8, 23 or 45. Ndemic have done an excellent job.\u201d - The Brick Castle \n\nAs the Campaign progresses, a number of stretch goals will be unlocked and added to your pledge for free! \n\nWant a closer look at Armageddon and how it changes the game? Well, here's a video! Warning - this hasn't been edited into a flashy promotional clip - it is simply me (James - the creator of the game) looking at the new bits of the expansion and explaining the gameplay / strategy implications of them. \nIf you want to learn more about genes and how they work - here is the new rulebook for you to flick through.\nPlague Inc. The Board Game is a strategic game of infection, evolution and extinction for 1-5 players lasting 60-75 minutes. Each player is a deadly disease competing against other players in a battle to be the first to infect and wipe out the world! \nPlague Inc: The Board Game combines the best bits of the original video game (which has infected 120 million players worldwide so far!) with a unique tabletop design. The result is a game with a realistic theme and engaging gameplay which can be enjoyed by anyone who likes the idea of infecting people with the plague! \nEach player is a unique disease. They start off infecting one country on the World Board - but soon they will spread.\nPlayers spread their infection across the world by placing tokens in cities - earning DNA points if they are dominant. Players choose which countries are placed on the board but they must be both climate resistant and connected to a country before it can be infected.\nDiseases start weak and unspecialised but as players develop symptoms - they will become stronger and spread exponentially.\nPlayers can upgrade their unique pathogen by evolving trait cards onto an evolution slide (with DNA points).\n The symptoms a player evolves on their Evolution Slide significantly changes how their disease behaves. Once countries become fully infected - the controlling player tries to kill them with the Death Dice! The more lethal the disease, the more likely the country is to be wiped out.\n\nIf you'd like an even closer look at the base game, you can view our series of How To Play videos here.  \nWe have been working on this expansion for 3 years now and have a fully scheduled and costed plan to deliver it to you! Throughout the campaign and afterwards, we will communicate regularly with you to let you know how things are going. \nShipping and taxes are automatically included when you make your pledge and include a shipping subsidy.\nWe use distribution hubs around the world to ship the game out to you as cheaply as possible. Shipping is US, UK, EU, Canada and Australia friendly to avoid any VAT / import fees (we believe in spreading plagues everywhere!)\nIf we do not offer shipping to your country - please fill in this form to request it. We will try to get shipping quotes for any country that has enough people request it. \nCurrently, the game is available in English. We know that Plague Inc. is popular all over the world, so if you would like us to translate the game into your language - please fill out the form here. If enough people request a translation into a different language - we will see if we can make it happen!\nPlague Inc: Armageddon has been designed by James - the designer of the original board game, James is also the designer of the best selling digital game Plague Inc. and our latest digital game Rebel Inc. The art was art-ed by Ollie, Daisy and Ryan and production was produced by Matt. We work with a great team at Panda to get the game manufactured. \nIn addition to the core team, a big thanks is in order to everyone else at Ndemic Creations as well as all the people who have playtested the expansion. We couldn't do it without you :)  \nThe game has been designed and extensively tested already. Now, your input and support will help make sure that the game is as good as it possibly can be (the more eyes and brains looking at things the better)!\nAs previous backers will know, throughout the campaign, we will be actively seeking out your feedback and input. We will read every single comment that gets posted and will also be posting polls/questions related to stretch goals and other design decisions to get your feedback (e.g. Which graphics do you prefer?  Can you find an exploit in our rules wording etc).\nJames is particularly keen to get people to find rare exploits in the new genes :)\nRemember - you can get the original game right now on Amazon here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIn the last 7 years, Ndemic Creations has successfully made games that are enjoyed by over 120 million people across the world.

It all fits back into the box! \nTiny Epic Tactics achieves endless layers of strategy and fun through utilizing a simple combat system with variable player powers and 3D terrain! \nNesting inside the game box are 5 smaller boxes and a map/scroll. Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across. \nConquer your opponents in tactical combat where every calculated move matters... or journey across the land and through the caves in a grand cooperative/solo adventure! \nIn competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes and different types of heroes have different ways of attacking.\nVictory points are awarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play.\nGaining control of these areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered. \nTiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes).\nThe goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many heroes you kept alive. \nYour team will consist of 4 heroes, regardless of mode you are playing. You will have one Fighter, one Wizard, one Rogue and one Beast! Each type offer different strengths and abilities.\nFighters are strong and versatile. With lots of hit points and a strong melee attack, they are a great unit to lead the battle. While their missile range is short, it proves useful when moving into position. Their special powers reinforce their ability to stand their ground or to unleash high damage in short range combat scenarios. \nWizards are powerful and resourceful. Their high damage output at long ranges can make them among the most lethal opponents on the field. However, their low hit points make them a target. If one gets caught without an escape plan, they won't be around much longer. Their special powers range from support to multiple-target attacks.\nRogues are swift and cunning. They offer good mobility combined with long range missile attacks. This makes them particularly useful in softening enemy units while bouncing from one control area to another. Their special powers range from weakening enemy units to reinforcing their pesky maneuvers.\nBeasts are relentless and reliable. They have good movement, high hit points and strong melee damage. This combination makes them an army of one. You'll be tempted to send them to one control area and the rest of your team to another. However, they lack any sort of ranged attack and their special powers typically benefit nearby teammates. So you'll want to weigh your options tactically. \nThis image is updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\nDeluxe Content: Lanterns Mini Expansion\nThe Lanterns mini expansion adds a 'pick up and deliver' like mechanism to Tiny Epic Tactics furthering the options and replayability of the game. During the game's setup, each village is given an unlit lantern (backside of token). When a player sends one of their heroes through a portal (cave) they come out with a torch. A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game. \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \nThe Maps Expansion is a set of box covers and scrolls. It includes everything needed to convert the 6 Evergreen Woodlands boxes into 2 different settings: the Winter Highlands and the Savage Wastelands. \nThe Maps Expansion is usable with ALL play modes. These are NOT just aesthetic changes! These change the gameplay drastically. Each map takes a different approach to where control areas are placed, how much space is between the control areas and what terrain surrounds them. This requires a different strategy on how to approach and defend the control areas resulting in a very different experience!\nNote: dungeon interiors will remain the same.\nCheck out the images and video below for a closer look at these alternative settings. \nMaps Expansion Includes:\n1 Winter Highlands Map Scroll\n 6 Winter Highlands Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Savage Wasteland Map Scroll\n 6 Savage Wasteland Box Covers (to be placed over the Evergreen Woodlands boxes) \n1 Reinforced Envelope\nThe box covers are constructed of thick premium cardstock and can be flattened after use for easy storage.\nManually add $12 to your pledge, or select the specific reward tier, if you'd like the Maps Expansion to ship with your copy of Tiny Epic Tactics.\nCheck out the video below for a rotating view of all 3 maps.\nPLAY\n\nEveryone loves stretch goals, us included! \nDue to the constraints of box size (this is a Tiny Epic after all) and due to a total weight limitation, in order to keep shipping costs affordable for everyone, we are limited on how many stretch goals we can offer.

We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication.

Illustrated with over 1,000 pieces of unique, stylish art, it will take you on a fantastic adventure set in a dark reimagination of the Arthurian legends.\n Designed by Krzysztof Piskorski (one of the most well-known Polish fantasy writers) and Marcin \u015awierkot (owner of Awaken Realms, developer of Lords of Hellas, Nemesis, The Edge: Dawnfall), Tainted Grail will bring you adventure, survival and exploration mechanics perfectly paired with character development and exciting combat and diplomatic systems.\nImmersive, story-driven exploration will bring the world of Avalon to life, confronting you and your team with difficult choices that have far-reaching consequences. Over 100,000 words of branching story scripts provide many different paths to your goal as well as several different endings to your adventures!\nClick!\n                                                                    click!\n                           click!\n                               click\n                                                   \"The Tainted Grail is easily my most anticipated solo / co-op Kickstarter of the year!

After you survive it once, there are still lots of new things to see, and storylines to experience!\nAnd even if you make the same choices on your new playthrough, random Events, Encounters and randomized elements within the Journal ensure no two games play alike, while tense, survival-based gameplay lends itself to many unique moments of emergent storytelling.\nYour characters are not run-of-the-mill \u201cheroes\u201d. They are flawed outcasts, called upon after the true champions of the land failed or fell. Each has unique flavor, a powerful ability, one big drawback that you need to play around, and two decks of individual Combat and Diplomacy upgrade cards.\nRegardless of whether you play alone or in a group of four, the game scales up to provide an adequate challenge. What\u2019s more, you may add or remove players after each Chapter, modifying the group size as you go!\nYou will journey through a grim land based on Arthurian legends and Celtic mythology, exploring its daunting secrets. Your decisions will shape both your adventure and the game world around you, as each campaign is set apart by many years, revealing the long-term consequences of your actions. A deep, branching storyline allows you to tackle problems in different ways, ensuring no two games play alike.\nIn a land slowly sinking into the Wyrdness and torn apart by conflict, surviving each day is a challenge on its own. In addition, Guardian Menhirs, that ensure safe travel throughout the realm, are slowly going dark, turning a simple map into an engaging puzzle.\nTo overcome these challenges, your character develops along several conflicting attributes such as Aggression / Empathy or Practicality / Spirituality. These traits unlock a rich choice of skills and lead to different deck-building strategies, making character advancement meaningful and deep.\nThe character you develop is going to be tested during dozens of combat and non-combat encounters. Sometimes you will need brute force, but often diplomacy might be a better option. Regardless whether you fight with your strength or your wits, our unique dice-less encounter system makes resolving each conflict fun and exciting.\nTainted Grail will force you to make hard choices with consequences that might present themselves even several decades later, in a future campaign, changing the environment and the balance of powers on the island. This will make your every playthrough unique and will give you unmatched power to reshape both the world and your story.\nIn Avalon, there\u2019s a legend waiting behind every stone and every tree. All locations have their own rich stories and secrets to discover. Places and characters are often much more than they seem. As you slowly put all the pieces of the larger puzzle together, this land will always have a surprise waiting for you just around the corner.\nCreated by one of the best polish fantasy authors, Krzysztof Piskorski, the story of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon aims to push the boundaries of non-linear narrative, building upon the rich experience Awaken Realms has in fusing ambitious stories with excellent board game mechanics and striking visuals.\nAt Awaken Realms, we have a quite an experience in making and delivering big games. So far, we have created four ambitious titles that expand the standard scope of a board game - all were critically praised and provided a lot of unique experiences to players all over the world.  \nWe also gathered vast practical knowledge about deep integration of various themes, and we've learned how to build interactive, branching stories that seamlessly connect with gameplay.

Each player is the owner of a famous unique gladiator school vying for glory and renown in a series of arena battle events. The winner will be the player than can impress the crowd, make devious plans, outmaneuver his/her opponents and show off the best sword skills in the arenas!\nIn Gladiatores: Blood for Roses each player gets to play a different gladiator in each event with a unique set of combat cards tied to that gladiator's style that varies in each game. Being a card game, there is no need for a complex board, the game narrative evolves through the choice and reactions to the cards played. Secret tactics and double bluffing abound making it tricky to know who will win and gain the most glory!\nSecutor card set\nRisk taking, tactical card play, impressing the crowd, outmaneuvering your enemies and clever use of special abilities is what you will need to gain the most victory point wreaths. Plan your moments to strike, learn from enemy mistakes or even bet on an enemy gladiator to get ahead and grab the glory!\nGladiatores: Blood for roses combines many well known game mechanics in a novel way. These include: \nA 3 player challenge at Tabletop Scotland 2018\nGladiatores' combat system is designed to emulate / simulate the visceral cut and thrust of actual combat. This 'counter-card' system takes a complex web of moves, counter moves and follow up options and presents them in a very easy visual and playable way - creating a narrative flow of 'take that' actions and counter-actions that feel like you are actually fighting for your life in an arena...\nAlmost every card played has some 'countering' options written on the card's banners. Play one of the cards listed in the banner and you BREAK the previous card making its effects no longer valid.\nJust take a look at the detailed combat exchange below for an example:\nBlow by blow 'counter card' system in action\n Very quickly you will be chaining these cards like a pro!\n\nThen it's all about watching your rivals moves, choosing your moments wisely and forcing your enemies to use up their cards while holding on to your own...\nSetup - takes only 2 minutes tops!\nFlexible game length - choose a quick battle or settle in for the more strategic season mode\nPoker-like - some tactical elements similar to poker (bluffing, hand management) but with swords, sweat and possibly tears!\nVariable gameplay - each gladiator plays completely differently, with different cards, strengths and weaknesses in each game.\nUnique experience - our countercard system allows for complex chaining of combat moves and countermoves - like a real sword fight! - while still being really easy to understand and swift to play.\nEndless replayability -  With different skill sets drawn each time you play + multiple ways for combat cards to be chained through player choices means huge replayability. (We've not done the maths on how many variations there could be but its a lot ok?)\nEasy to learn - card structure facilitates rapid understanding and quick play, check out the rulebook section below or watch a brief how-to-play video on our youtube channel.\nFantastic art - from acclaimed illustrators Anja Kryczkowska (Gloom of Kilforth, Evolution) and Brolken (Legend of the Cryptids).\nExpansions - Excellent expansion potential with new famous gladiator types, new combat moves and some secret plans we have for future campaign play...!\n2 play modes - see below...\nGladiatores: Blood for Roses can be played in a quick 'single event mode' when time is short (like last orders at the pub!) and takes approximately 10-15mins per player. However the game is designed for multiple event 'Season Mode' play where each player gets to accumulate glory from each event, in a race to win a coveted place at the colosseum in Rome. Each event takes roughly 30-40 mins to play depending on type of player.\nThe game scales very well from 2 players upwards and we hope to unlock the 6th, 7th and even 8 player sets with new unique gladiators during this kickstarter.\nJoin us as a backer and help make it happen!\nA 2 player grudge re-match at UKGE 2018\nNone of the following reviewers were paid for their reviews or opinions of the game.\nClick to read the review\nClick to read the review\n                                                                      Click to read the review\n                                                                     Click to read the review\n                                                                    Here is Board Game Coffee explaining the game in their own fantastic style. Enjoy!\n WHO DARES ROLLS video review...\n See what Nick thought of the game in his preview video...\nThe base game comes with these five unique gladiators (+ KS Exclusive):\n With many more unlockable through stretchgoals...\nJust some of the gladiators waiting to join\nGladiators: Each player must play a different gladiator in each event. Note that the winner of a previous event will get 1st choice thus giving the player a tactical advantage in 'season mode' matches !\nThe main gladiator cards\nEach gladiator card shows the type, armament, special ability (lower boxed text) and the variable glory rewards for betting on that gladiator (at top right of each card). \nCombat cards: Each gladiator has a unique set of combat cards that are augmented in each event by drawing extra cards randomly from the combat decks. These cards form the gladiator's set of combat skills for the event; ensuring variability each time you play.\nSecutor specific combat cards\nCounter Card System: Each Attack or Defense card played can usually be countered by one or more other cards (clearly labelled in the orange banners at left or right of each card). For example, the picture above shows a CLEAVE card that can be countered only by a PARRY or a BLOCK.\n\nWe refer to the cards in the orange banners as BREAK cards!\n\nIf your opponent doesn't have either of these Break cards, you get to trigger the card effects for that card. Thus, cards and counter cards lead to complex exchanges of attack and counterattacks (chaining cards) that leads to thrilling and deadly one on one battles within the melee.\n\nHere is a further example of chaining multiple cards between two gladiators.\nCounter card chaining example\nCareful hand management will be necessary because each combat card represents the endurance of your gladiator to survive the fight and defeat all challengers. Run out of cards and your fighter collapses to the sand, defeated!\nEvent Cards: Every game of Gladiatores requires one or more Event cards to be drawn (depending on whether playing 'single event' or 'season mode'). The event cards detail the glory prizes for coming 1st and 2nd, the size of the crowd at the event (number of rose petals = crowd favour) and the conversion of crowd favour gained during the fight into glory (bottom box).\n\nGlory tokens: The glory tokens gained during events are worth variable Victory Points (VPs). Most players should win at least 1 or 2 glory tokens in each event. Glory is stored on each Player's Glory Wheel. Being 1st or 2nd to complete this wheel scores big VP bonuses and gives a big boost to chances of winning the game overall!\nThe Player with the highest VP score is declared the winner and gains their rightful place performing before Emperor Caesar in Rome!\nYou can download the current Rulebook here (note this is a work in progress)\n                                                                                                                                               You can help guide the final components of this limited edition game.\nStretchgoals will add in more content, improve production quality and improve the game for everyone. \nBackers make a great game greater! We listen to you guys and will work to include your great ideas.\nBackers receive a better game at a better price compared to what they would get after the campaign through a normal retail edition.\nWithout your help, we won't be able to print this gorgeous game in all its glory and share it with the world. Without kickstarter there might never be a retail version. \nShipping will be from warehouses in Europe, USA, and possibly in Canada and Australia (if enough backers join us from there) so you won't have to pay import duties and taxes.\nThe game (originally designed way before the film Gladiator came out) has been playtested thoroughly over the past four years and is completely ready for production now. That doesn't mean with your help we cannot make some beneficial tweaks and add in some fantastic additions to make it even better though... such as:\nnew unique gladiators, \nincreased player count\nnew combat moves,\nspecial Star Players \nRPG elements \nanimal challenges\nand more...\nFor fun during the kickstarter we are doing something different with the stretchgoals!\n\nWith your help we are taking our gladiator school 'Ludus BadCat' as far as we can towards Rome and the fabled colosseum. Every point on the map of Europe below is another stretchgoal that can be unlocked!\nJoin us as a backer and you become one of our gladiators, helping to take the ludus all the way to Rome and unlocking some sweet stretchgoals for you all along the way!\n Here are just a few of the many stretch goals we have planned for you.\nWe love our FLGSs and their support of the hobby and indie publishers like us. If you are a bricks and mortar retailer (including cafes that sell games) and would like to support this kickstarter, please pledge at the special LUDUS pledge level. This level is a deposit against the cost of carton/case multiples (5+ games/carton) of this KS edition game (base game or deluxe + all unlocked SGs) at the normal retailer-friendly discount (off KS price). You will also get a free demo set with your 1st carton ordered and access to promo and special additions.\nOnce pledged, we will then message you to confirm your final order, how many of each version you want, confirm shipping and delivery address after the kickstarter has ended. We guarantee your order will get sent out at the same time as all other backers rewards allowing you to jump ahead and get your order many months before normal retailers will! You can of course contact us through KS messages or info[at]badcatgames.eu to discuss any of this in more detail.\nYou can include any further add-ons you wish from this list by using the big manage your pledge button at the top of this page and manually adding the cost of your chosen add-on(s) to your total pledge amount.\n\nAll rewards will be confirmed for each backer at the Pledge Manager stage after the kickstarter is complete.\nThis is the replacement Active Player Marker (G1) included in the Deluxe game set.\nPLAY\n\nWe are also super excited to be able to offer 2 alternative sculpts of this famous gladiator (your choice of which models you want will be confirmed during the pledge manager stage) mastered at PDModels in the UK. If you want more than 1 miniature, just increase your pledge by \u00a314/$18 for each additional model you are purchasing.\nAlternative gladiator sculpts\n You can follow us on these social media channels\non Facebook\non Instagram\non Twitter\nor direct on our website... \nAs is now standard on boardgame kickstarters, shipping will be charged after the kickstarter (within the Pledge Manager). This is as fair as we can be considering prices go up every year! We are subsidising shipping everywhere as much as we can and depending on our final funding amount, we will subsidise this further. Shipping costs shown are for untracked services only, based on estimated weight of the game (inc. upgrades and stretchgoals). We did this for our previous kickstarter with similar box weight and backers remained happy.\nUK - \u00a32\nUSA/CANADA - \u00a39/\u00a310\nEU - \u00a39\nEU2* - \u00a312\nRoW - \u00a315-\u00a320\n* Destinations inc. Iceland, Switzerland, Malta, Scandinavia & Slovakia\nWe will ship to our international fulfillment centres at our cost.\nWeight of final package is estimated as <2kg.\nTracked shipping service upgrades and all additional extras (e.g. extra game copies) can be added in the pledge manager after the campaign has finished.\nFor shipping we are working with multiple international partners in USA, CA, UK and EU to find the most cost effective and safest way to get you your rewards. Only 1% of backers from our previous kickstarter had problems with delivery (usually due to changes of address).\nBeing our second project, we know how to maximise both quality and speed to get a game project manufactured. However delays in manufacture and shipping can crop up due to many circumstances outside our control. Therefore our Aug 2019 deadline for delivery of this project is a calculated estimate. In fact we aim to beat this target by at least a couple of months to finish early for June 2019 but are being sensible and adding in some extra time. We will keep you informed of progress throughout with updated estimates.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter.

We have already sent off some of the files for pre-production checks and will be ready to pick up speed and complete the file checking stage soon after the kickstarter finishes.\n\nThe game is 100% complete, requiring only tweaking and final artwork to be added, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing. Below are the stretch goals we have lined up if we exceed our initial funding goal.\nSTRETCH GOAL 1: HARDCOVER BOOK \u2013 UNLOCKED! \nIf we reach this goal, we will print Things from the Flood core RPG book with a top-quality hardback cover.\nSTRETCH GOAL 2: UPDATED MAP OF M\u00c4LAR\u00d6ARNA \u2013 UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach this goal, we will print a updated large full-color map of M\u00e4lar\u00f6arna, the main game setting.

Simon St\u00e5lenhag is best known for his highly imaginative images and stories portraying illusive sci-fi phenomena in mundane, hyper-realistic Scandinavian landscapes (expanded into America in his latest book The Electric State). Tales from the Loop was ranked by The Guardian as one of the \u201c10 Best Dystopias,\u201d in the company of works such as Franz Kafka\u2019s The Trial and Andrew Niccol\u2019s Gattaca.\nNot only have St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s unique and cinematic images earned him a worldwide fan base, but have also made him a go-to storyteller, concept artist and illustrator for both the film and computer gaming industry. This year it was announced that The Electric State will be turned into a major motion picture and Amazon Prime ordered a full season of a TV show based on Tales from the Loop.\nDuring his twelve years as a game writer, Nils Hintze has written a great number of scenarios, articles and reviews, as well as being the main author of critically praised and award winning Tales from the Loop roleplaying game.

The conflicts in his games are often built on personal dilemmas, where thrill and mystery is not seldom mixed with humor.\nNils is educated in creative writing, but he normally works as a psychologist. Nils is also one of the three creators of the Swedish role-playing podcast Podcon.\nFree League Publishing is the international name of Swedish game and book publisher Fria Ligan AB.

What used to be virtual reality is now reality, and sports that once occupied your flat-screen now occupy the world stage. The largest of them embodies the evolution and integration of athleticism and machinery. Once every five years, hundreds of millions of viewers tune in to witness the spectacle that is M.E.C.H.s: Mechanized Entertainment Combat Heroes.\nSuit up your Meeples for the ultimate battle royale with...\nSome items displayed are stretch goals and will need to be unlocked.\nThe amazing ITEMeeples are snapped into your Mech when you earn it in play!\nMotion GIF may take a moment to load.\nTiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of. \nIn Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. \nThey compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. \nThese actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill. \nYour programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset. \nCombat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own. \nWhy Back This Project? \n Great Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action.

Blockchain data is open, decentralized, and immutable.\nFeatures encourage thoughtful content, altruism, and self-awareness, while discouraging reactive and hateful posts.\nNo ads. Peepeth is accountable to users, not advertisers.\nRelease schedule: web browser version (beta) available now! Easy-to-use web version coming January 2019. Mobile app coming in March 2019.\nFirst peep by the founder of Ethereum\nCoin Center demonstrating Peepeth to United States Congressman Tom Emmer of Minnesota\u2019s 6th District.\nSocial media is broken.\nAdvertising-driven social networks are taking a toll on our wellbeing. They:\nInvade our privacy & sell our data\nHave total control and custody of our online identities\nAre filled with trolling and harassment\nManipulate our feeds to keep us online longer\nCater to advertisers at our expense\nProblems with social media\nData is saved to an open, public, and permanent database (the Ethereum blockchain), so anyone can make a competing interface for your data. Peepeth does not own or control your account or content.\nNo ads: Peepeth doesn't optimize for ad impressions (which introduces perverse incentives).\nFeatures encourage positive contribution over quantity. Peepeth encourages you to think before you post or \"like\", support charity, and learn more about yourself.\nThe blockchain puts you in control\nOn Peepeth, accounts and posts (\u201cpeeps\u201d) are stored on the blockchain. That gives you exclusive control over your account and content. No intermediary is technically required for you to post or access data.\nNo edit or delete (& censorship resistant backend)\nPeeps are publicly accessible, potentially forever. This creates accountability and gives your words more weight. The result is more considered peeps.\nThe datastore is strongly censorship resistant, because of the blockchain's immutability. Note, however, that Peepeth.com will not display content that violates the terms of use. See the \"Can Peepeth be censored?\" section below for more.\nSpam resistant\nPeepeth is spam-resistant because it costs money to write to the blockchain. Don\u2019t worry\u2014 Peepeth foots the bill for you\u2014 but spammers lose their free-peeping privilege, making spamming a relatively expensive prospect.\nTransparency\nAll data is openly stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Anyone can monitor the blockchain to see what Peepeth.com is not displaying. (Those who purchase the \"Authenticity badge\" or higher will be able to easily audit content that is removed from the main feed.)\nAlternate apps\nAnyone can start their own front-end interface that reads and writes Peepeth data (yourPeepeth.com), because the blockchain protocol is open.\nMonetize with tips\nAccept tips in cryptocurrency (Peepeth charges a 10% fee).\nVerifications\nVerify your identity by linking your other social media accounts through the blockchain. Twitter and GitHub currently supported; more coming soon. Peepeth charges a fee in cryptocurrency for verifications.\nOther blockchain services\nThere are many other possibilities for blockchain-based services in the future. Peepeth can interact with other smart contracts (self-executing computer programs on the Ethereum blockchain) to provide decentralized services.\nPeepeth's mission is to encourage positive contribution, both online and in the world. \nThe blockchain is only part of the story. Peepeth's features encourage thoughtful, responsible engagement, while discouraging hate, spam, and reactive posts.\nCharity badge\nHow can we do good most effectively? Buy a charity badge to support and raise awareness for an important, neglected, and tractable problem: malaria.\nYour charity badge is shown on your avatar, and bumps you to the top of follower suggestions (giving you serious Peepeth-cred).\nTogether, we\u2019ve purchases over 1000 long-lasting insecticidal bed nets from the Against Malaria Foundation, the top-ranked charity by several top Effective Altruism charity evaluators. Learn more here: https://peepeth.com/malaria\nOne \u201clike\" per day\nInstead of a Like button, Peepeth has the once-per-day Ens\u014d. Its rarity makes it more special to receive, and it encourages the creation of dignified, beautiful, and timeless content. An Ens\u014d is forever; there is no undo.\nEns\u014d (\u5186\u76f8 , \"circle\") is a circle that is hand-drawn in one uninhibited brushstroke. It represents creativity, freedom of expression, and unity.\nInsight badge (in development)\nThe words you use reliably predict your Big Five personality traits. Learn more about yourself by having powerful artificial intelligence derive your personality traits from your public peeps, and compare your results on Peepeth to your other social media accounts. Keep your results private, delete them forever, or display them on your profile.\nThis feature is a fun way to learn more about yourself, and to find others you might be interested in following. It's an optional paid service.\nInsight credits can also be gifted. One credit entitles you to perform this analysis on your peeps or on your content on another public social media account. Learn more here: https://peepeth.com/a/insight\nAre you sure?\nPeepeth periodically reminds you to review your post before committing it to the blockchain, resulting in fewer typos and greater reflection before posting.\nPeeps are forever. Reminders give you a chance to reconsider.\n#Politics\n(Under development) Many people find online political discussion frustrating and stressful. On Peepeth, users are urged to include the #politics hashtag in political peeps. This hides the content (but not the peep) by default (users must click \"reveal\"), giving users the freedom to ignore potentially toxic discussions. This is an evolving solution to a tough problem.\nLess \u201cme\u201d, more \u201cwe\"\nYou can pin a peep to your profile. Unlike Twitter, however, you must pin someone else\u2019s post (not your own). Pinning lets you recognize someone else's contribution.\nCode of conduct\nPeepeth\u2019s 130-word terms of use is adapted from a discourse on the Buddhist doctrine of Right Speech by Thich Nhat Hanh (in secular form). Peepeth.com's enforcement of the code is transparent.\nSee the code here: https://peepeth.com/a/terms\nMore on the way\nPeepeth is just getting started. There are other novel features in the pipeline.\nAlejandro Machado, \"\u00d0app User Experience Audit\"\nPeepeth\u2019s invite-only web beta is live, and is leading the way for decentralized app (dapp) usability.\nPeepeth is one of the few non-game and non-trading blockchain apps in use. It has pioneered novel techniques that make it very user-friendly. It has received 7500+ invite requests, and tens of thousands of peeps have been immortalized on the blockchain.\nIt is currently featured on every major mobile dapp browser (Trust, Coinbase Wallet, Status, Cipher), and by dapp portals such as App.co, EveryDapp.com, and other portals.\nPeepeth is one of the most usable decentralized, blockchain-powered apps. However, it isn\u2019t usable enough for mainstream users:\nUsers need cryptocurrency to use Peepeth. Getting it is hard.\nUsers need special software (a browser extension or dapp browser) to use Peepeth.\nNo mobile app yet.\nReaching the funding goal will help Peepeth become one of the first widely used dapps (decentralized applications):\nPeepeth will be free to use (currently, cryptocurrency is required)\nPeepeth will work without special software\nMore features critical to usability will be added\nDesign improvements\nFulfillment of backer's rewards\nThe Kickstarter goal is just a starting point. Reaching the stretch goals will give Peepeth a much better chance of becoming a self-sustaining mainstream platform.\n$250,000\niOS app\nMuch improved art and design\nMore novel features\nMore robust back-end\n$350,000\nMobile apps on iOS and Android\nGreatly improved design, branding, and messaging\nRobust and scalable back-end application\nBetter user support\n$1,000,000\nA top team\nWorld-class web and mobile apps\nBetter support and user education\nOutreach and partnership opportunities (integrations and widget)\nAll efforts will be made to achieve these goals regardless of the amount raised.\nHow can an advertising-free platform sustain itself?\nPeepeth sells features and takes 10% of tips. For example, it sells social media verifications, Insight credits (in development), and feature badges (such as the rewards here).\nThe success of verifications alone is showing that this model can be a viable alternative to advertising. Kickstarter funding will help build Peepeth into a product that can sustain itself without ad revenue.\nPeepeth\u2019s rewards enable special functionality on Peepeth.com. Most rewards consist of at least one blockchain badge (enabling special abilities), and Insight credits that can be gifted or used to gain personality insights from your peeps or other social media accounts.\nInscription on the blockchain\nSupporters at all levels will have their name immortalized on IPFS and the blockchain (including their link and message at some levels). This info will be shown on a special backers page on Peepeth.com.\nBlockchain badges\nIf your blockchain address owns a blockchain badge, Peepeth will detect it and grant your account special powers. Badges will be displayed on your peeps (except Authenticity badge).\nSome badges have unique names, images, or other unique inscriptions. If you are rewarded a unique badge, you can name / inscribe your badge on a first come first serve basis (or it can be done later, or not at all). Badge details will be displayed on your profile page.\nBlockchain badges are transferrable, but you'll need a small amount of cryptocurrency to send them (to cover the blockchain transaction fee). Insight credits are not transferred with the badge; you have to transfer them separately.\nSome badge privileges (automatic #nsfw flagging of peeps) can be deactivated if abused.\nExtra badges\nSome support levels include extra badges in addition to the main one.\nThe extra badges do not come with the Insight credits, tshirts, nested badges, or inner-circle privileges that normally accompany badge purchases. For example, the Penguin badge comes with two Honor badges. Honor badges, purchased by themselves, usually include Insight credits, tshirts, and lower-tier badges. However, the Honor badge that comes with the Penguin badge will not include those extras, just the core functionality of the Honor badge.\nInsight credits\nInsight credits are non-blockchain credits that can be used on Peepeth.com. Each credit can be redeemed for a personality assessment of your public peeps, done by advanced artificial intelligence developed by IBM Watson (substantiated by research). You'll receive a graph showing your personality traits and other characteristics, which you can display publicly on your profile, keep private on Peepeth.com, or delete completely.\nYou can re-test at a later time, and also compare your Peepeth results with your other social media accounts.\nInsight credits are giftable; you can bestow them on peeps you like.\nBehind the scenes\nAt some support levels, you\u2019ll get a behind-the-scenes look at the creative process, in the form of emails / video updates from the founder. Supporters will be kept in the loop in a way not commonly seen with other software development projects.\nThese updates will be more impromptu than formal; and give you a personal perspective on the process of building Peepeth.\nYour logo on Peepeth.com\nAt higher levels, backers will have their logo displayed on the front page of Peepeth.com for one year.\nThe more your company contributes above 10k, the higher and larger its logo will appear. Email contact@peepeth.com to learn how to contribute more than the Kickstarter max.\nWith funding, Peepeth will have a good chance of becoming the first mainstream dapp (decentralized application) and could introduce cryptocurrency and Ethereum to a mass audience.\nIn addition to its social media functionality, Peepeth will also be an easy introduction to cryptocurrency. It will teach users the basics, while not requiring them to buy cryptocurrency or install special software. Peepeth will also incentivize new users to acquire ether, because of the services offered on Peepeth and the opportunity to interact with other dapps.\nIs Peepeth scalable? Will it clog the Ethereum network?\nPeepeth has pioneered innovative techniques to batch content in a small number of blockchain transactions. No matter how many users it has, the core functionality will execute a constant number of transactions (not including other optional blockchain features).\nWhat does Peepeth mean?\nCheck out https://peepeth.com/a/name for more (including pronunciation)!\nIs Peepeth \u201cTwitter on the blockchain\u201d?\nPeepeth may look similar to existing services, but Peepeth is fundamentally different because of its use of the blockchain, its focus on encouraging positive contribution, and lack of reliance on ads.\nPeepeth is not neutral: it optimizes for thoughtfulness, self-awareness, and charity.\nPeepeth's back-end is open and immutable. Peeps are forever; which encourages more thoughtful posts.\nPeepeth doesn't control your account or content (you do).\nNo ads\nCan Peepeth be censored?\nPeepeth.com is a centralized, opinionated front-end for the Peepeth smart contract. The emphasis here is on cultivating positive contribution, mindful discourse, and self-awareness.\nPeepeth.com is not a neutral \u201canything goes\u201d platform, despite the immutability of its datastore. Peepeth.com is governed by a terms of use, and peeps that are not in accord with it will not be visible, by default, on the main feed.\nModeration is transparent on Peepeth.com, because of the open nature of the blockchain. That keeps Peepeth.com accountable to users, who are free to build and use another front-end for Peepeth data.\nIf the front-end can choose what content is displayed, how is it different than a normal social network?\nNo central body controls what gets posted to the blockchain. The data-store is open, so anybody can write to and read from the smart contract without Peepeth.com's permission. If Peepeth.com (or another front-end) imposes a too-strict terms of use policy, users will find out and move to another front-end.\nCan Peepeth be used for criminal purposes?\nPeepeth\u2019s criminal appeal is limited. Pairing payments and communications on the same channel reveals more info about criminals and their networks than non-crypto communication channels used with crypto payments. Pairing communication and money removes a level of anonymity because of the traceable nature of blockchain transactions.\nWill Peepeth be usable by people not versed in crypto?\nYes. The blockchain will be largely invisible when using Peepeth. Peepeth will, however, educate users about blockchain, and offer optional blockchain-based services.\nThanks to the thousands of people who\u2019ve shown support for Peepeth by requesting an invite, joining and peeping, or offering advice and suggestions. I appreciate everyone\u2019s contributions; Peepeth would not be possible without your help!\nCheers!\n-Bevan, Peepeth founder", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are many challenges ahead for Peepeth. Building decentralized applications is hard; making them usable and scalable is harder; and bootstrapping a community is the hardest.\n\nNonetheless, Peepeth has made headway on all three fronts with limited resources. A lot of technical and design heavy lifting is done, and there\u2019s a small but strong community in this invite-only stage.\n\nThe next steps will be challenging, but with funding, I\u2019m confident they\u2019ll be completed.\n\nA general risk that Peepeth faces is the difficulty of predicting a timeline, because of the unpredictability of software development. To mitigate that risk, the estimates here are conservative. Regular updates will be sent to keep everyone informed of progress.\n\nScaling the backend application will be a challenge. It\u2019s more difficult to scale than traditional applications because of the complexity of syncing data across the blockchain and server. It will require more resources than scaling traditional apps but it\u2019s a manageable problem.\n\nA related challenge is the eventual possible strain on the Ethereum blockchain, as users may choose to use optional blockchain features. Note however that using Peepeth will not result in additional blockchain transactions, because of an efficient batching mechanism that Peepeth uses; so network impact will likely be minimal. Also, scaling efforts are underway for Ethereum itself, and those non-essential features could be throttled.\n\nThe technical challenges, difficult though they may be, are surmountable. The more difficult challenges relate to product appeal, usability, and bootstrapping a community.\n\nPeepeth is not a neutral platform, and its goal and value proposition will polarize. The charity aspect and positivity focus of Peepeth will grate on some, and others may not like how it attempts to encourage positive contribution. That\u2019s by design; but it will be important to get the branding and messaging right, so that Peepeth\u2019s intent is viewed accurately.\n\nThe perceived complexity of the blockchain is also a risk for wider adoption. Although blockchain will be almost completely abstracted from the user experience, users will still have to be educated about keys; and many lay users may simply abandon the process at the word \u201cblockchain\". It\u2019s unknown to what extent this will deter users; but a major effort will be put on on-ramping and educating users as painlessly as possible.\n\nExisting social networks pose a risk. The network effect of the incumbents is strong, so Peepeth will have to be focused in its approach and branding and make itself unique. Gaining mainstream traction could take time.\n\nGovernment regulation of crypto could also pose a risk. Crypto is restricted or illegal in some countries; and that could affect Peepeth\u2019s future.\n\nNew ventures are risky. Blockchain applications are perhaps especially so, because of the additional complexity and user confusion they can cause. However, Peepeth has made strides so far, and has a good chance of becoming the first mainstream dapp.\n\nNone of these risks would prevent the main goal set forth in this Kickstarter from being achieved.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Bevan Barton\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi, I'm Bevan.

This new board game, designed by Adam Kwapi\u0144ski, is the result of a collaboration between Awaken Realms (creators of This War of Mine: TBG, The Edge: Dawnfall and Lords of Hellas) and Rebel (creators of Drako, Dream Home and K2) . It's a 1-5 players semi-cooperative Sci-Fi horror where you and your friends try to survive while attempting to fulfill your secret objectives that may sometimes collide. It will also enable full co-op as well as solo play experience. \nNemesis offers one-of-a-kind gameplay, that you currently won't find anywhere else in the board game world. It has been in professional development for over three years, so it already plays very well, provides good balance and contains a multitude of interesting mechanics, as proven by the prototype reviews below. \n\nIf you like Sci-Fi survival settings and ships swarming with alien life forms, you will love it - and if that genre was never on your radar, this game is likely to change your mind! \nBy backing this project on Kickstarter you will get all unlocked Stretch Goals for free to every Core Box! \n        Click to see details about sundrop\n                   *Out of all reviews / movies two were paid: Cardboard Rhino (rules presentation / tutorial how to play that took a lot of time to make!) and Man vs Meeple (which is a preview showing the game in detail). All other videos were not paid. \n Asymmetric crew members \n                                                                                                       During the game, you will control one of the crew members with a unique set of skills, personal deck of cards, and individual starting equipment. These heroes cover all your basic SF horror needs. For example, the scientist is great with computers and research, but will have a hard time in combat. Soldier on the other hand... \nYour characters complement each other and will need to collaborate in order to survive. There's one catch: you are never sure who can you trust! \nCinematic experience\nYou drift back from the cold void of the hyper sleep. At first, you only feel a tingling in your mouth and a taste of your blood, but soon all the other symptoms hit you. Your head is exploding. Your stomach is turning. A strange noise rings in your ears. This sound is loud, piercing. An alarm!\nFighting through dizziness, you open your eyes, the lights of other hibernation chambers blinding you momentarily. Broken glass. Wet floor. A stasis pod burst open like a ripe watermelon, dripping with red. The thing inside was once your friend. Now it barely resembles a human, ripped open from the inside - damage too severe for a simple stasis pod failure. You raise up and check if your other mates are all right. The good news is: they are. You all gather in the middle of the room, shivering, half-naked. The bad news is\u2026 plentiful. Ship stuck in the middle of nowhere. Many systems damaged. Bulkheads breached. Unknown contaminants in the air. You also hear noises in the hollow halls of the ship. You\u2019re not alone! \n\nPlaying Nemesis will take you into the heart of Sci-Fi survival horror in all its terror. A soldier fires blindly down a corridor, trying to stop the alien advance. A scientist races to find a solution in his makeshift lab. A hacker breaks into ship\u2019s navigational system and enables self-destruction. A pilot sets the alien nest on fire, while his friend seals himself in the control room. A traitor steals the last escape pod in the very last moment. All this \u2013 and other memorable actions \u2013 await! \nShip exploration\nOne of most important parts of Nemesis gameplay is exploration. Every room of the ship may contain useful items and enables a different special action, from activating fire extinguishers to cutting out infected tissue. This makes it necessary to reveal as many room tiles as possible. But beware, while searching for a proper room, you will make noise that may draw some uninvited guests. \nShip's layout is randomized before each game, so you are never sure what to expect behind next corner... \nUnique combat \nThis game is more about surviving than killing. When you face horrors from outer space, you may panic, and even if you manage to put up a fight, you will never know how much punishment your opponent can take. Killing intruders is a tough challenge, especially since ammunition is a rare commodity on the ship. \nEvolving Intruders \nJerry, big news! We\u2019ve received the first transmission with some preliminary data. It seems it\u2019s an auxotrophic, anaerobic, mineral-based trans-dimensional life form (what a mouthful). No DNA, XNA or anything else we could expect. Instead, a strange self-propagating crystalline structure. Outer skin layer? Pure Lonsdaleite! We've never seen more than few grains on Earth, and this thing is covered in it! Fifty percent tougher than diamond, go figure. \nIt sheds this outer skin during each development cycle, thanks to a violent thermochemical reaction. But that's not the worst part. You've heard about this research into weird crystals with a structure partially hidden in other dimensions? Well, our guys say these creatures employ a similar process. Much of their growth happens... elsewhere. Then, when they gather enough energy, they shift modified organs and body structures back into this world. The may also be native to deep space, as they survive vacuum well enough to put Tardigrades to shame. Anne also believes they\u2019re an extremely adaptable omnivore. Sounds scary, right? I hope the top knows what they\u2019re doing with this one.\nIntruders you meet on the ship are not only reacting to the noise you make but also evolve as the time goes by. The longer the game takes, the stronger they become. \nTime pressure\nEncroaching enemies are not the only thing that pushes you to work faster. The ship is already counting down to the emergency hyper-jump. If you fail to repair the engines before that happens, or if the jump catches you outside of your stasis pod, extreme acceleration is going to turn your character into a red splatter on one of the walls. \n\nWorld and design \nWe've reached for the stars. Asteroid mining was booming. Colonies on Mars and Venus approached self-sufficiency. Then, a wanderer came from far depths of the universe at half the speed of light. It glanced the Earth's moon, ripped it apart, threw out of its orbit, and caused catastrophic damage below. Solar system plunged into crisis.  \nStill, many chose to focus on profit, as the residue from the impact contained unknown minerals and exotic matter that made our plain old asteroids seem boring. Obsolete spaceships, previously used for colonizing the solar system, were refitted and crewed by people desperate enough to spend years in vast spaces between the stars, hunting for the next big catch. They became whalers of deep black, scavenging for comets, asteroids, dead proto-planets, and other strange objects coming from far corners of the universe.  \nClick to see full Intruder design\nMany disappeared. It was to be expected. Intercepting unknown objects at incredible speeds was not exactly safe. Then, there are rumors at least one crew found something they were not supposed to...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully finished 3 Kickstarter projects. While the Nemesis campaign goes live, we're in the middle of shipping the first wave of Lords of Hellas game. Soon after the end of this campaign, we estimate to start the shipping of The Edge: Dawnfall, which was delayed.\n\nThese two projects at this stage are managed production and delivery team, while Nemesis is on creative stage, so they do not collide. \n\nWe are confident about the delivery of the game - we have accumulated vast experience working on other titles and projects. The only risk factor, which can always happen, is a delay in delivery due to unforeseen circumstances. Even though the bulk of design work is already completed, as proven by many reviews, Nemesis is a huge and complicated title, and in pursuit of great quality it might take more time to complete. \n\nPlease note that this is not a pre-order and the final product might slightly change in the process or get delayed. We are fully devoted to creating an amazing experience and you can trust us that every choice we make will only be aimed at improving the standard of the final product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "Core Box", "descp": "Nemesis Core Box including all unlocked Stretch Goals.\nThis pledge does not include shipping.

A mysterious outbreak has claimed the lives of nearly everyone there... what's worse is they are crawling the stores and commons as Zombies hungry for flesh. Only a few Survivors remain. Are you among the Survivors? Or are you one of the ravenous Zombies? The choice is yours in Tiny Epic Zombies!\nArm your Meeples for Survival with...\nBazooka and Katana included in Deluxe games only. Additional items unlockable through stretch goals.\n   Tiny Epic Zombies is a 30 minute, 1-5 player, game of survival that features 5 distinct play modes:\n1. Cooperative team-play with game controlled Zombies.\n2. Cooperative team-play with Zombies controlled by a non-team player.\n3. Competitive free-for-all with game controlled Zombies.\n4. Competitive free-for-all with Zombies controlled by a player.\n5. Solo.\nIn Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.\nWhy Back This Project? \nGreat Gameplay! - Fast paced and easy gameplay gets you right into the action. Variable survivor and Zombie powers, and several objectives, keep you playing time and time again.\nGenerous Discount! Save almost 20% by pledging on Kickstarter.\nKS Limited Exclusive Content! - Deluxe copies will NOT enter regular distribution.

However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store. \n  GENERAL INFO: 1-5 players, 30 minutes, 5 play modes including competitive and cooperative play.\nTHEME: Modern day Zombie outbreak at the Echo Ridge Mall.\nHOOK: Fast paced, portable, and tons of replayability. Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!\nWIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.\nOVERVIEW: Simplicity shines in Tiny Epic Zombies. \nBased on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.\nExample Survivor:\nNote: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.\nIf you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.\nAs a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!\nAfter you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.\nAfter you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.\nExample Objective:\nThis is one of many Scenarios in the game. Each Scenario presents an objective. You'll have 3 Scenario in each game. Complete all 3 and you win!\nExample Zombie:\nAs a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies.

So we did what we do best \u2013 got inside. \nFor the past year, we sent Patrik Hermansson undercover in the alt-right. He infiltrated the heart of the movement, and he caught it all on hidden camera. He heard them boast of ties to the White House, and he was among neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.\nBased off our undercover research and infiltration into the movement, we have unique and unprecedented footage and access inside the international alt-right movement.\nThis story is too important not to be told \u2013 but regular production companies and distributors aren't comfortable taking it on. We know the only way to bring this project to life is to turn to passionate individuals who care about the future of this country's democracy. \nWe have one goal: finish the movie so that we can expose the alt-right for what it is: international, well-funded, and able to influence in the highest corridors of power.\nOnce finished, the movie will form the center piece of our \u201cRight the wrongs\u201d Tour of America. We will take our film to town halls and campuses as part of an educational initiative to shed light on the alt-right and develop support for how to combat it and close it down.\nPress\n\"Mr. Hermansson, who was sent undercover by the British anti-racist watchdog group Hope Not Hate, spent months insinuating himself into the alt-right, using his Swedish nationality (many neo-Nazis are obsessed with Sweden because of its \u201cNordic\u201d heritage) as a way in. It wasn\u2019t always easy. \u201cYou want to punch them in the face,\u201d he told me of the people he met undercover. \u201cYou want to scream and do whatever \u2014 leave. But you can\u2019t do any of those things. You have to sit and smile.\u201d\" \u2013 The New York Times\n\"Speaking of his experiences infiltrating the network of white supremacists, Patrik Hermansson said: \u201cFor almost a year I\u2019ve been at the heart of a world of extreme racism, antisemitism, Holocaust denial, esoteric Nazi rituals and wild conspiracy theories.\u201cWhat I found was a movement that sometimes glorifies Nazi Germany, openly supports genocidal ideas and is unrelentingly racist, sexist and homophobic.\u201d\" \u2013 The Independent\n\"In the Hope not Hate report, Hermansson writes about meeting Jorjani: \"I ask about AltRight Corporation and its aims and objectives and he explains how it is a \u201cgovernment in waiting.\u201d But then, out of nowhere, as though it was no big deal, he says: \u201cWe had connections in the Trump administration, we were going to do things!\u201d\" \u2013 Newsweek\nEndorsements\n\"It has been a honour to be involved in this very important project.

Eight times the people of this Earth, over vast millennia, built their civilizations, reaching heights we cannot even fully imagine now. They spoke to the stars, reshaped the creatures of the world, and mastered form and essence. They built cities and machines that have since crumbled to dust, leaving only their barest remnants.\nThis is the Ninth World. The people of the prior worlds are gone\u2014scattered, disappeared, or transcended. But their works remain, in the places and devices that still contain some germ of their original function. Some call these magic, but the wise know that these are our legacy. They are our future. They are the...\nSet a billion years in our future, Numenera is a tabletop roleplaying game about exploration and discovery. The people of the Ninth World suffer through a dark age, an era of isolation and struggle in the shadow of the ancient wonders crafted by advanced civilizations now millennia gone. But discovery awaits for those brave enough to seek out the works of the prior worlds. Those who uncover and master the numenera can unlock the powers and abilities of the ancients, and bring new light to a struggling world.\nThe original Numenera RPG was launched via a 2012 Kickstarter campaign that shattered every record (at the time) for tabletop RPGs. The corebook has seen four printings, and Numenera is enjoyed by tens of thousands of gamers in an active global community. We have published over 60 supplements and accessories, and released a terrific starter set for new players. The Ninth World has spawned a critically-acclaimed hit computer game, board games, an excellent short film, a line of novels, and other licensed items, and Numenera has been translated into many languages including French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, German, and Portuguese.\nThis has been a fast-moving campaign, with lots of new information revealed and many stretch goals unlocked. If you're new to Numenera, scroll down. If you're familiar with Numenera and want a guide to the information and stretch goals unveiled so far, check out the info at the bottom of this update.\n  Numenera is a game in which player characters explore the ruins of aeons past to gather amazing treasures and help build a new future for a world struggling in darkness. Since the launch of Numenera in 2013, we have delivered well on the first part, but we\u2019ve always wanted to do a more thorough job exploring that second part. That desire has led us to Numenera 2 and this Kickstarter campaign.\nThrough this Kickstarter we\u2019re going to replace the existing corebook with two new corebooks. The first is called Numenera Discovery and the second Numenera Destiny.\nNumenera Discovery will be a book that covers familiar territory; it is basically a revision of the original Numenera corebook. Next summer, we will allow the original corebook to go out of print, and Numenera Discovery will take its place. In Numenera Discovery, you\u2019ll get some revisions to make things clearer and more fun, and to increase the options available to players. Nanos, Jacks, and Glaives will get an overhaul. Many foci and some of the descriptors might see some reworking. You\u2019ll have more options, clearer rules, and perhaps a bit of expansion to the regions of the Steadfast and the Beyond that are covered in the existing corebook.\n  But Numenera Discovery is not a new edition. We will make virtually no changes to the way the game plays mechanically\u2014and none of those changes affect the way NPCs, creatures, or items like cyphers or artifacts work. We also won\u2019t be making changes to the setting. So if you already play Numenera, your bestiaries, adventures, card decks, character portfolios, and books like Into the Night, Technology Compendium, and Jade Colossus will not be affected by these changes. We will not issue any \u201csecond editions\u201d of the existing supporting titles\u2014and if you choose not to get Numenera Discovery, future Numenera supplements will work fine with your existing Numenera corebook. Your ongoing campaign will flow smoothly through the change in corebooks. You will even be able to mix existing characters with those from Numenera Discovery into your game. In fact, the game can be played with both the existing corebook and Numenera Discovery in use at the same game table!\n(One small exception: Numenera Character Options and Numenera Character Options 2 will remain compatible, but will become substantially less relevant following the improvements to characters in Numenera Discovery. We will retire those titles.)\nAs excited as we are about Numenera Discovery, we may be even more excited about Numenera Destiny. This title will enable characters to truly become a part of the setting\u2014to help shape the future of the Ninth World. The people of the Ninth World are locked in a medieval-like state, a world of struggle and danger and often suffering in the shadow of the prior worlds\u2019 wonders. Numenera Destiny allows you to build adventures and campaigns in which players don\u2019t just explore the wonders of the past\u2014they utilize them to help lift the Ninth World out of darkness.\nYou can make the world a better place. Help a community defend itself from abhumans or the iron wind. Create centers of learning or trade. Innovate, build, and protect. Manage an entire community and help it prosper and grow\u2014or simply create a cool base or vehicle for your adventuring group. Numenera Destiny will allow you to take what you discover and make your mark on history as someone who elevated the Ninth World into the future.\nAdventuring\u2014exploring the weird and wondrous remnants of the prior worlds\u2014remains, of course, at the core of Numenera play. Numenera Destiny will give you new things to do with your discoveries, along with entirely new and epic ways to structure your campaigns. You\u2019ll discover materials, power sources, and treasures that you can utilize in an entirely new, robust crafting and building system. And perhaps best of all, Numenera Destiny will offer three new character types and a number of new descriptors and foci geared toward this innovative style of play.\n    You can back this campaign to receive either Numenera Discovery or Numenera Destiny, but you\u2019ll really want to get both books. When purchased in print as a set, they come in a beautiful and handy slipcase, giving them a truly deluxe feel. We've upgraded this through stretch goals to include some extra handy components and a beautiful Order of Truth medallion.\n  We at Monte Cook Games have a long and successful history with Kickstarter, and one of the things we love most is that it allows us to build the products we\u2019d really like to see and play. It\u2019s often too risky to add unusual or expensive features to an RPG product if you\u2019re just launching and selling it through normal channels. But through Kickstarter we can propose improvements and ideas through stretch goals, and if you fund them we can make them a reality.\nWe have some cool Kickstarter-exclusives as part of your rewards. But every upgrade to the new corebooks, the slipcase, or any additional titles unlocked through stretch goals will improve the product for everyone who plays the game\u2014whether they back this campaign now, or purchase the book at a game store three years from now. In other words, the more we can accomplish through this campaign, the better we can make Numenera for every player, ever!\nBut speaking of those Kickstarter exclusives. . . .\nA major focus of Numenera 2 involves helping and fostering the communities and people of the Ninth World\u2014making the Ninth World a better, safer place for its inhabitants. So, throughout this Kickstarter campaign, together we\u2019re going to build and grow a Ninth World community called Ellomyr. Your involvement will directly impact the story of Ellomyr as it (hopefully) grows and flourishes. And when the campaign is over, we\u2019ll take Ellomyr\u2019s story and make it into a sourcebook called The Trilling Shard. This is a Kickstarter-exclusive item not available anywhere else, and it\u2019s included (in PDF, print, or both) in every backer level. Pay close attention to this campaign, read the updates, comment and vote and help pull in more backers, and you\u2019ll contribute directly to the content of The Trilling Shard.\nIn addition, we\u2019re also going to produce a short Discover Your Destiny ebook that every backer will get in PDF format. It will be delivered ahead of the release of Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny.\nAs a skilled adventurer, you have traveled more than most and seen your share of small, isolated communities in the Ninth World. But there\u2019s something about the village of Ellomyr that has caught your attention. The folk welcomed you warmly when you arrived, sharing their food and their homes. These people clearly work hard to maintain a safe place to live and raise their families. Like so many little villages, it lies in the shadow of ancient ruins that no one completely understands. Among other weird relics of the prior world, Ellomyr\u2019s central square is built around the infamous and immovable Trilling Shard, an ancient symbol-covered stone that quavers with sound at rare times.\nBut the Ninth World is a harsh, unforgiving place, filled with dangers arising from the prior worlds. Raiders and strange biomechanical beasts, weird radiation and mysterious technologies, terrible plagues and dangerous storms all threaten the people here. They need your help.\nOver the course of this Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re going to track the development of Ellomyr and hopefully watch as it grows and flourishes. But it will only do so if brave and capable individuals such as yourself help the people there overcome dangers and deal with challenges. As threats or needs arise, you, the backers, will help the community face these challenges. The more you participate in the campaign, the more easily the challenges will be overcome and the more Ellomyr will thrive and grow as a community.\n      In other words, you will become a part of Ellomyr\u2019s ongoing story. When The Trilling Shard is released, you\u2019ll be able to recount how you participated in the events that shaped the community. Will it become a thriving city that offers a safe and bright future for Ninth World citizens or will it be lost to the darkness and dangers that threaten it? We\u2019ll only know when this campaign is completed.\nSo please check back in and see the events of the story transpire as you follow along. Post snippets of your own character's story in Ellomyr in the comments, on social media, or on your blog (or all three). Where applicable, use the hashtag #Numenera2. If it's on social media or a blog, we might share it. While this is all in the spirit of a fun, joint experience, if we see something that really wows or entertains us, we might ask you if you'd like to contribute your snippet to The Trilling Shard sourcebook (and we pay our authors, of course). To begin, just introducing your character and stating that they're a part of helping Ellomyr is a great start. And if your favorite way to participate is art rather than writing, we'd love to see and share fan art of your character, of Ellomyr, or the events as they unfold.\n\nAs always, if you want to share a link to this Kickstarter, that's sincerely appreciated.\nNumenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny: Each of these titles is a 416-page, lavishly illustrated hardcover (that\u2019s the same size as the existing Numenera corebook). When purchased together in print, they come in a sturdy, beautiful slipcase that has been upgraded with premium production design, additional content, and a nifty Order of Truth medallion.\nThe Trilling Shard: A sourcebook on Ellomyr and its challenges, setbacks, opponents, solutions, and triumphs over the course of this campaign. The exact specs of this product remain to be determined (in part by your contributions to this campaign!) but at a minimum it will be a 64-page softcover with a poster map.\nDiscover Your Destiny: This PDF product will come out early next year (before Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny). It uses story to introduce players to the Ninth World, and focuses on the narrative concepts behind Numenera 2. It leads players\u2014both new and experienced\u2014through creating a character using some of the brand new material from Numenera Destiny and highlights some of the changes people will see in the transition from Numenera to Numenera 2.\nNumenera Player's Guide: Create characters, explore the setting, and learn the basic rules in this inexpensive second copy of key rules and setting material. The 64-page softcover is perfect for getting a taste of the game, for having an extra rules and setting reference on hand at the gaming table, or for game masters to hand to new players.\nBuilding Tomorrow: More installations and items to build, more allies to recruit for your community, more sample communities to build from\u2014and more challenges to face. Building Tomorrow is a 160-page hardcover sourcebook that expands on the community-related content introduced in Numenera Destiny.\nSlaves of the Machine God: A powerful overlord with an army of automatons: is this a simple, straightforward threat to you and your companions, or is there something more going on than meets the eye? An epic adventure of twists and turns in a 144-page hardcover with poster map.\nPriests of the Aeons: This 192-page hardcover with poster map includes new foci and descriptors, cyphers and equipment, and other options and items for your character. It also covers the Aeon Priesthood in detail, giving you information on working with\u2014or joining\u2014the Aeon Priesthood to help enlighten the Ninth World.\nRuin Deck: When the characters start plumbing the depths of a prior-world ruin, the GM needs as much help as they can get. This deck allows GMs to generate an exciting, vivid and\u2014of course, since it\u2019s Numenera\u2014weird set of ruins to explore. Limitless adventures in one deck of cards.\nNinth World Bestiary 3: More weird, wild, wondrous\u2014and generally dangerous\u2014creatures with which to populate the Ninth World. This 192-page hardcover with poster will feature over 150 all-new creatures for your Numenera campaign, perfect as threats to your growing clave or general encounters in the wilds of the Steadfast, the Beyond, or beyond the Beyond.\nTomorrow's Bones: Ancient ruins, strange ships, weird creatures, and Jaekel pirates all spell a Ninth World high-seas adventure with a Numenera twist. The third official Numenera novel, in deluxe hardcover and popular ebook formats.\nIo Deck: 100-card deck that GMs can use to generate iotum, shins, and cyphers found when the PCs salvage numenera. However, some of the cards also contain potential dangers that can arise, making every draw from the deck a possible game-changer.\nExplorer's Keys: A 96-page softcover featuring ten (yes, ten!) Instant Adventures. The unique Instant Adventure format is perfect for running low-prep games, making these adventures just as suited for an impromptu game as they are for adding to your ongoing campaign. Many are community focused, but all work great as exciting standalones as well.\nCreature Deck 3: This 100-card deck offers a selection of creatures from the Ninth World Bestiary 3 and other new sources so that you can easily reference them at the table in a handy format. Pull out just the creatures you need for a session, or even generate an encounter randomly with the turn of a card.\nMore products will be added to this section if we\u2019re fortunate enough to unlock them via stretch goals.\n   Add-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator; it\u2019ll help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-ons items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\n        Retailers: The NINTH WORLD RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many copies of Numenera 2 products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up your cash between now and release. Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Numenera Discovery and Numenera Destiny are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the corebooks individually and the slipcased set. For every copy of the slipcase set you order, you\u2019ll get a print copy of The Trilling Shard for free. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera PoP kit. You also get a copy of The Trilling Shard for yourself, in print and PDF, and the Discover Your Destiny PDF. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\n    IMPORTANT NOTE: \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" does not mean free shipping. It's Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support this project. If you are outside the US and getting physical rewards, see below.\nREWARD FULFILLMENT Soon after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when a reward is ready, we\u2019ll send you an email letting you know it is time to log on to your account on the MCG Shop and redeem your rewards, which you will do for free with coupons. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address at that time. (So if you\u2019ve moved, or want to send the reward to a friend as a gift, you\u2019re providing a totally up-to-date address.) If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE* Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you, since you will not be charged importing/customs fees.\n*The UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nOTHER INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the tenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games. All of our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards. Most of those campaigns are completely fulfilled, while those that are not continue to deliver their rewards on schedule. That means we\u2019ve delivered over 200,000 rewards to date. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, almost two-dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, T-rex attacks, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless the planetovores breach into the universe of normal matter to consume the Earth without Carter Strange around to save us, we are confident that the project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "FIRST STEPS INTO THE NINTH WORLD", "descp": "You get a copy of the Numenera Starter Set, with rules, characters, adventures, dice, and everything needed to play.

Right now 66 million girls dream of going to school. \nOneSqin is already sponsoring girls in Tanzania to attend the SEGA school, through the non-profit organisation NurturingMindsInAfrica.org.\nSEGA Girls School in Tanzania\nThe SEGA Girls School is a residential secondary school for Tanzanian girls who otherwise are unable to attend school due to extreme poverty.\nStudents at SEGA Girls School\nThe SEGA students are vulnerable girls, who have left school before completing their primary education (up to 7th grade). Some have lost their parents to malaria, AIDS or other diseases; some can't afford uniforms, books or transport to traditional government schools; some work to support themselves and their families and have no time to attend school.\nSEGA Girls School Student\nTHE FUTURE\nScholarships at SEGA are just the beginning. As OneSqin grows, so will sponsorships of education for vulnerable girls across the world. Future plans include the launch of a dedicated factory, providing opportunities for women at risk of social exclusion. \nWHO WE ARE\nFounders Neil Richmond FRSA and Sinisa Jovic are supported by an international team of like-minded volunteers. We believe that if business doesn\u2019t revolve around profit, it can be a powerful tool for social change. \nThe choices we make as consumers have a huge collective impact on our world. OneSqin offers the chance to make it a positive one. \nOneSqin CIC is a UK registered Community Interest Company, a certified member of Social Enterprise UK and is supported by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the Royal Society of Arts (RSA).\nThe OneSqin team: Ana, Avivah, Dora, Erik, Gillian, Hanna, Jason, John, Joy, Julia, Leesa, Leyla, Lucci, Neil, Petra, Rosie, Romana, Seb, Sinisa, Suzie\nThe OneSqin manifesto\nThere\u2019s a notion that real change has to involve great sacrifice. Sticking your neck out, risking what you love, swimming against the tide. But while there\u2019s always room for more heroes in this world, we respectfully disagree. (It\u2019s our belief that a little change can go a long way.) All profits from OneSqin products go to projects that empower girls in need, by removing barriers to education. So that now, simply by buying the things you need, you can help lift girls across the world out of poverty. Change doesn\u2019t always have to mean a battle. In fact, one small change made by enough people can transform many lives.\nThe #OneSqinEffect\nTo help girls across the world, OneSqin needs your help to become a social phenomenon.

It takes 2 minutes to set up, lasts around 30 minutes, and no two games are ever alike.    \nPlayers take the role of prisoners on a quest to Escape the Dark Castle, and must work together to overcome its many horrors, traps, and challenges - each of which is represented by a large, beautifully illustrated chapter card. \nAs these immersive chapter cards are revealed one by one, the game takes on the form of a shared storybook experience, with the players making decisions about what to do each chapter before using a combination of dice and item cards to complete challenges.\nThe game is largely inspired by 80s fantasy classics like the TV programme Knightmare, the Fighting Fantasy gamebook series, Dungeons & Dragons, and Heroquest, but you don\u2019t need to know what those things are to enjoy this game. \nThis game has simple rules so it\u2019s easy to learn. You\u2019ll be able to get started within about 5 minutes. Below is an overview, and you can read the full rules here. You can also watch a full playthrough video in our Reviews section further down the page. \n\u2022 It\u2019s approachable - The game is designed with non-gamers in mind, but is no less rich and rewarding for it. Now anyone can enjoy the atmosphere of a classic fantasy quest. \n\u2022 It\u2019s quick - It takes 2 mins to set up and around 30 mins to play. No downtime, no elimination, and full player engagement throughout. No-one will be bored.\n\u2022 It\u2019s social - Many chapters offer a compelling choice for the group, stimulating regular player interaction and discussion. It's perfect for the pub or a games cafe, but can even be played solo!\n\u2022 It's different every time - You never know what the next chapter will be, so there is plenty of tension and suspense as your unique adventure unfolds each game.\n\u2022 It has a unique look - So many games look alike these days. Here is something truly distinct for your collection. We've worked hard to create a stylish look evocative of retro classics.\n\u2022 There are no heroes - The playable characters are refreshingly ordinary. No musclebound heroes or buxmon heroines here, and there is an equal mix of male and female characters.  \n\u2022 You choose your path - The decisions you make will change how each chapter turns out, and play a significant part in determining success or failure. \n \u2022 It\u2019s the start of something big - We plan to add new chapters, characters, items and advanced rules to expand the game, not to mention taking you beyond the castle itself.  \n \u2022 You\u2019ll fall in love with fantasy (again) - By focusing on immersion, we\u2019ve taken a tired, overused theme and created a refreshing, streamlined experience for everyone to enjoy. \nDon\u2019t just take our word for it. We\u2019ve been conducting public playtests for the last 6 months at the following venues:\nEach playtester filled in a feedback form after their session. Here is what the gaming public has to say about Escape the Dark Castle:\nWe'll keep this section updated with other third party reviews and features as they roll in:\n11/06/17 \n\"Elegant mechanics, with simple but significant decisions really make \u2018Escape the Dark Castle\u2019 sing....There is a great feeling of risk/reward with the combat system that makes the encounters feel increasingly desperate...Every choice feels important right down to who should turn over the next card, for you don\u2019t know what is lurking around the next corner!...Back it. Back it now.\"\n- Iain McAllister, The Giant Brain\n23/06/17\n\u201cThat was epic, I won\u2019t lie\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic set of mechanics\u2026\u201d  \n\u201cI love the way it tells a story, it's so different to what you normally see\u2026\u201d \nEnjoy a full playthrough with this video review from Beasts of War\nCriminal: \u00a31 or more\nThis pledge level is great if you want to support the project and follow it's progress.  \nYou won't get a copy of the game when the project funds, but you will have the satisfaction of knowing you helped to make it happen, and of course you'll have our heartfelt thanks no matter how large or small your pledge.  \nWe'll keep you updated as the campaign progresses, and you can always change to one of the other pledge levels later if you decide you want the game after all. \nWe're glad to have you onboard.\nPrisoner: \u00a325 \nThis is our standard pledge.

But keep an eye on it - cancellations are common in the last 48hrs of Kickstarter campaigns and if a slot opens up you might be able to grab it!\nPledging at this level means you\u2019ll get a copy of the game signed (on the box cover) by the designers, along with all unlocked stretch goals. You'll also get The Story Pack add-on for free, a collection of 16 stories delving into the backgrounds of the prisoners, and how they each ended up in the depths of The Dark Castle- see the Add-Ons section below for more details. \nBut there\u2019s one final reason to pledge at this level: If the stretch goal Become a Prisoner! is unlocked, you'll be one of only 100 people with the option to buy the limited add-on Become a Prisoner!, turning YOU into a character card! For full details see the Add-ons section below. \nShipping will be charged based on your location, but we've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum.\nCastle: \u00a375 \nThis is our retailer pledge.  \nYou must have a store to claim this reward, and there will be a verification process when the project funds. \nYou'll get 6 copies of the game, including all applicable stretch goals, at a great trade price. \nShipping will be charged based on your location, but we've done our best to keep those costs to a minimum.\nWe'll be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care. \nWe are EU, USA, and AU friendly, ensuring backers in these locations will pay no extra customs charges beyond the shipping cost itself.\nPlease note: For deliveries outside of these locations, check the rules and regulations on importing goods to your region before you pledge. \nThe following shipping costs will be charged based on your location and pledge level as shown: \nOur \u00a311k funding goal will cover the print run and associated logistical costs, but if we are fortunate enough to exceed that goal we'd like to offer you the following upgrades and add-ons:  \n(note that all stretch goal targets are in \u00a3 GBP)\nNaturally, the cards will be great quality regardless, but what we\u2019d really love to do is upgrade them from the standard you find in most board games to a thicker, more luxurious feeling card with a linen finish. Backers at all reward levels would benefit from this. \nThe dice will also be great quality as standard but, given the chance, we\u2019d love to go for larger dice rather than the standard size found in most board games. They\u2019d be that bit chunkier and more satisfying this way. Backers at all reward levels will benefit from this.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll unlock the Become a Prisoner! add-on. That add-on will only be available to backers who pledge at the Boss level, which is limited to 100 backers so pledge early to avoid disappointment! For full details see the Boss pledge listing above, and the Become a Prisoner! add-on listing below. \nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add an additional Boss card to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add 3 additional Chapter cards to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nAt this level we'll commission experienced composer Alex Crispin (who also co-designed and illustrated the game!) to produce an original soundtrack, perfectly suited to accompany a game of Escape the Dark Castle.\nBackers at all reward levels will have access to this as a digital download for free, but we'll also unlock an amazing add-on option for those who want their OST on cassette! More detail in the Add-ons section below. \nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add ANOTHER additional Boss card to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels, meaning your base set will include 2 extra bosses. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nWhen we reach this level of funding, we\u2019ll add ANOTHER 5 additional Chapter cards to backer copies of Escape the Dark Castle at all pledge levels, meaning your set will include a total of 8 extra chapters. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else. \nCombined with all the other stretch goals, this would give you a total of 10 Kickstarter exclusive cards on top of the base set contents.\nWhen we reach this level, we\u2019ll add a very special rare and powerful relic to the game \u2013 the Golden Axe! This is an additional item card which comes with its own special dice. In the game, the wielder of this awesome weapon will roll the special dice alongside their character dice in combat. It may be cumbersome, but it\u2019s devastating when you connect! This is a Kickstarter exclusive and will not be available anywhere else.\nAdventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight\n\u00a312 + shipping\nAs an extra special treat for all your amazing support we\u2019ve decided to bring forward our first expansion, Adventure Pack 1: Cult of the Death Knight, at the kickstarter exclusive price of just \u00a312!\nWhat you get:\n3 New Characters & their Custom Dice - each a powerful specialist  \n15 New Chapter Cards \u2013 taking you to new areas of The Dark Castle \n1 New Boss Card \u2013 the Death Knight himself, Lord of Decay\n3 New Item Cards \u2013 Introducing Curses, terrible afflictions to thwart your progress\nWe\u2019ve made this expansion available as an add-on, open to all backers immediately. The best part is, it will ship at the same time as the base game, so you\u2019ll get all this great content in one big bundle! \nThe three new prisoners are all specialists in one particular area: The Mason\u2019s MIGHT knows no bounds, the Hunter can be counted on for CUNNING, and the Bishop is well-known for his WISDOM.

We\u2019ve added a chart below to help make this clear, so please check before you pledge.\n For example, UK backers need to pay an additional \u00a31 to ship the expansion alongside their base game, and should increase thier pledge by \u00a313 (12 + 1) to claim this add-on.  \nElsewhere in the world, the increase is higher, and sadly that\u2019s a reality of shipping over 2kgs (4.4lbs) of game to distant lands. Please be assured, we make no profit on the shipping \u2013 it\u2019s an unavoidable evil, much like many of the things you\u2019ll encounter in the depths of the Dark Castle\u2026\nThe Story Pack \n\u00a38\nPrepare to immerse yourself even further into the world of The Dark Castle with The Story Pack - a total of 16 dark tales penned by published game-writer and co-designer of Escape the Dark Castle, Thomas Pike. \nWhat you get: \n9 Character Origin Stories, each delving into the personalities of the prisoners, and of course the dark events which led to their incarceration in the depths of the Dark Castle.

We make immersive tabletop games with approachable rules and uncompromising artwork. \nA Labour of Love \nEscape the Dark Castle is our first game. It's a labour of love that's been in our lives for more than 3 years.\nIt started out as something we felt passionate about creating just for ourselves - the kind of game we wanted to play (and invite non-gamer friends to play) which just didn't exist on the market at that time. We wanted to capture the atmosphere of classic 80s and 90s fantasy games, but with none of the fiddly rules, piles of tokens or confusing special abilities that tend to clutter most modern games in this category. If we could do that without resorting to a whacky or comedic tone, we knew we'd be on to something. \nResisting overcomplication and staying true to our vision, we bonded uniquely over the following years of developing and crafting the game. As old friends living in three different cities, the development sessions became an excuse to get together, and in the end played a big part in keeping our friendship strong as our lives took us in different directions. It means a lot to us. \nEventually, the next natural step was to try and bring Escape the Dark Castle to a wider audience, and Themeborne was set up to launch the game and give you the chance to enjoy it as much as we do. \nWhy use Kickstarter? \nWe've put all the time and money we have into bringing the game to where it is today, from creating the content and artwork, to building prototypes, to attending conventions for playtesting. We've laid a solid foundation and given it everything. Now we need your help to make this dream a reality by crowdfunding the first print run of Escape the Dark Castle.\nIf you back this project, not only will you be securing your very own copy of the first edition, you\u2019ll be helping a talented new team of designers enter the industry. The team at Themeborne is deeply passionate about tabletop gaming, and we'd like nothing more than the opportunity to continue making great games for you in the years ahead. We have grand plans.\nHere is just a taste of what Themeborne has in store: \nMore Castle: Of course, we can expand Escape the Dark Castle with more chapters, characters and items. There is so much we can do from this solid base.\nMore Escape the Dark: We've always envisaged Escape the Dark as a series of games - the Castle set is just the beginning. The scope for other themes, settings and licences is absolutely huge, and we're very excited about going down that path.\nMore Advanced: Escape the Dark Castle is very deliberately simple and accessible, but from this basis we can craft a longer, more involving adventure for those who want something more elaborate and strategic. \nMore Games: Escape the Dark is not the only project we have simmering away at the studio. We've got several other designs in development already, from a pure-strategy game we believe is genuinely ground-breaking to a manic, team-based party-game like nothing else on the market today. \nAll told, we've got several years worth of games stored up, and all of them will be delivered with our trademark focus on theme, style and player experience. So, if you like the way we do things and want to see what we do next, back us today!  \nAre you a content creator? We\u2019ve got a press releases, logos, photos and more - ready and waiting for you here. We may be adding more as the campaign progresses, so check back regularly. \nNeed something specific?

We're confident in what we've created. \n\nIs it ready to print? \n\nWe didn't want to keep anyone waiting, so before we launched the campaign we made sure the artwork, design and development of Escape the Dark Castle was 95% done. All that remains is finishing touches. \n\nWill the materials be good quality? \n\nWe\u2019ve had in-depth discussions with more than a dozen experienced games manufacturers all over the world in the last few months, and been through the quoting process looking for the best materials that will work for our game. This will be a top notch production. \n\nWill it ever arrive? \n\nWe'll be working with our expert fulfillment partner Gamesquest to make sure your game is delivered promptly and with expert care.

An enigmatic monolith, eons old and sacred to all four races is the source of this wild force. The shaman who is most able to draw and manipulate this energy from the monolith to defeat their rivals wins the game and becomes the new Master Zee!\nElemenZ comes in two play modes:\n2 Player - a tense dice-based tug-of-war game where players attempt to complete combos to draw new dice from the central supply to aid them in later turns or to energise the monolith by locking in energy dice - while also blocking, stealing or denying dice from their opponent. The winner is whoever completes energising the monolith first.\n\n3-4 Players - a push-your-luck duelling game where each shaman player strives to control and manage their elemental energy better than their opponents, using combos carefully and tactically to drain their rivals energy pool while protecting their own - until they remain the last shaman standing.\nEverything you get in the game\n More stretchgoals to follow when we break through the \u00a310k barrier...\nAny future retail release of ElemenZ will only include the 2 player and 3-4 players games and will not include the KS limited promo Avatar expansion. This expansion will only otherwise be available at shows, conventions or our website so now is the best time to get the whole lot together at a great price!\nElemenZ takes the concepts behind many recent dice battle games and takes a big leap forwards in terms of interactivity, reduction of luck and rapid play. Instead of playing characters with Hit (life) Points that must be slowly reduced to zero, or other games that focus on dice roll outcomes with no chance of player interaction or negation, Elemenz folds the 'life points' into the dice themselves, limits luck using a 'wild' or 'joker' effect on the dice and keeps player involvement at the core of gameplay, by giving players multiple options to affect ('mess with') other shaman turns.\nElemenZ has a unique mix of mechanics that will be familiar to those players who know King of Tokyo, Bang! the Dice Game, Age of War and similar dice rolling games (the 3 roll rule, take-that style, symbol matching and end-of-turn risk results); but shakes these concepts up in innovative ways to make for a more tactical, risk-versus-reward decision making, bluffing, energy management style of game that keeps all players interacting in devious ways throughout each turn.\nThe Four Energy Totems\nSo what makes the ElemenZ dice special?\nEach dice in Elemenz has 2 faces with the colour element (e.g. water on the blue dice) meaning a 1:3 chance of rolling your own symbol and a 1:6 chance of rolling either the 'Z' or another element. Graphically it looks like this:\nThis reduces dice randomness and means players have a better chance to boost their Attacks, Defense or Heals with their own element symbol. However, a player may need to roll an alternative symbol and with only a 1:6 chance, increases the level of tactical risk taking in the game.\nClick the review for the YT video\nOf course you are not obliged to use the dice only for playing ElemenZ!\nSorceress doing some Waterbending\nThey make very good special dice for Sorcerors, Elementalists and Magicians in roleplaying games too!\nEach shaman player is armed with a pool of energy dice - their life points that is both their defense and offense in the duel. Each dice can become one of the four fundamental elements or pure wild energy (the 'Z'). Each player must manage and control this limited supply of wild energy carefully and cleverly to protect themselves while at the same time defeating all rivals. Shamans do this by manipulating combinations of the elements to create combos that trigger powerful effects.\nThe four alien shaman play boards\nEssential combos are presented on the main player boards. Shamans can activate as many completed combos as they like in their turn. It is up to the other shamans to disrupt this by using their own abilities and combos.\nAnatomy of the Shaman boards\nUsing the wild 'Z' symbol is a risk-versus-reward mechanic. A 'Z' on a dice can 'mimic' another element as long as it is partnered (termed anchoring) to a dice with that symbol. (The Example below shows an Ice Storm combo using a 'Z' anchored to the water symbol)\nUsing a 'wild' dice in a combo\nRolling 3 or more 'Z's at any time however causes an immediate Wild Surge effectwhich finishes the player's turn immediately and they cannot activate any combos this round. However, they can still interact by spending tokens or using Avatars (explained further on).\nEach shaman also has a unique race ability that influences their play style. The Water shaman for example has the chance to heal twice in a turn while the Earth shaman benefits from cheap defense.\nPrototype player Totem boards\nEach shaman also starts the game with a spirit totem board that buffs their abilities, protects them against various in-game effects and acts like a battery, supplying energy for the shaman's abilities in the form of Pulse. \nFinal Totem board - Air Shaman\nThis pulse energy (in the form of tokens) offers various additional effects (e.g. forcing dice re-rolls, adding a specific element or healing) to support the shaman or influence other player's combos.\nSet of Pulse tokens\nPulse tokens (similar to the energy dice) are a very limited resource that shamans must use wisely to keep them in the duel. A pulse token can only be used once and is then out of the game - making tactical choice on when to spend and when to keep pulse tokens at the heart of using the totem boards cleverly and efficiently. Further, pulse can be replaced or even removed by other shamans and should a totem become drained of all pulse, the totem is removed from the game also and its special abilities are lost to the player!\nIn addition, for the kickstarter limited edition, we've included an initial set of Avatar tiles (for FREE!). Avatars are energy sprites that appear from the monolith when the shamans duel. Each Avatar tile has a unique ability that can be harnessed by a shaman, but each tile can only be used once and costs a precious energy dice to buy. Once used the Avatar returns to a central pool available to all players. So a useful Avatar might give a shaman a moments advantage but may come back to bite the same shaman later!\nBase set of Avatar tiles\n Avatars can also be burnt (removed) from a player's control by spending a pair of dice of any symbol so attention must be paid to which Shaman is hoarding Avatars for later use. Full explanation of these rules and more along with suggested tactics is in the rulebook which you can download below.\nWe have many more Avatar tiles planned but need your help to unlock them!\nNote: Both the Avatar expansion tiles and/or the Totem boards are Modular and can be excluded from the game without affecting core game playability - ideal for younger players or those just learning the game!\n\nClick on the image below for an in depth explanation of both the 3-4 player and 2 player gameplay by Fluff and Crunch.\nMore gameplay summaries and playthroughs can be found on our Youtube channel.\n The 2 player game uses similar dice combo mechanics to the multiplayer but now the wild 'Z' dice 'locks' the dice out of action when rolled. The focus here is to use combo options wisely to draw the flow of energy dice to your side in a tug-of-war while trying to shut down your opponent's moves. Accumulating a good pool of all 4 types of dice is key (but not so easy to accomplish) while getting dice locked into the monolith positions quickly is also vitally important as your opponent will be doing the same! However every time you lock in a dice, you reduce your pool and options for future turns!\n2 player prototype gameboards showing dice 'locked' into the monolith\nThe winner of the 2 player game is the shaman who best controls the pool of dice and who first fully energises the monolith with all eight dice locked in.\nClick quote to read Eric's review for yourselves\n                    Click here for the current rules booklet (Both English and French versions currently - seperate PDFs) for both multiplayer and 2 player games.

It was an era when Scotland made the challenging transition from an agricultural country to an industrialized one, heavily relying on trade and export. \nAs proud members of the old clans you use your unique abilities and cunning skill to earn the greatest wealth and fame.\nThe game is designed by Juma Al-JouJou, a solo-entrepreneur and founder of Karma Games. Juma has also designed and self-published Green Deal which Tom Vasel rated as the 5th best economic game of all time. Clans of Caledonia is illustrated by Klemens Franz, the illustrator of award-winning games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye.   \nThere are more than 220 custom wooden tokens! Click for larger view.\n   Clans of Caledonia has a unique blend of mechanisms and includes elements of engine-building games (e.g. Terra Mystica) and economic mechanisms such as a dynamic market (e.g. Navegador) and export contracts (e.g. Voyages of Marco Polo). \nThe way you produce whisky, bread and cheese from grain and milk is interwoven with the trade and export of goods. This makes it a highly interactive strategy game, with great strategic depth despite having a very accessible rule set.  \nThe modular board, the 8 different clans with unique powers and the multiple scoring and port tiles ensure outstanding replayability.\nA game example at the 2-player count. Click for larger view.\n     The modular board offering 16 different map setups.

Click for larger view.\n      In addition to all the components from the Clans of Caledonia pledge level including all Stretch Goals, the Premium Clans of Caledonia pledge level includes 70 metal coins and a KS exclusive box sleeve.\nMetal Coins\nMoney is so important in this game! Upgrading the coins to 70 metal coins is the best upgrade possible. It feels great to hold heavy coins in your hands and their jingling sound is music in the ears of their wealthy and proud owner! In addition, there is basically no wear and tear! Perfect for a game with such a high replayability. \nThe supplier is producing sample coins right now. The producer of the metal coins is the same supplier as the one for Scythe from Stonemaier Games, so expect some awesome metal coins! \n  Render image: Lily, The Lion Rampant of Scotland & Mary Stuart. Klemens designed the coins specifically for Clans of Caledonia. The coins have a diameter of 20, 22 and 24 mm respectively and will be 2 mm thick (just as thick as the coins in Scythe).\n       Add-on: You can also add up to four additional sets of metal coins as an add-on to your pledge of the game by adding \u20ac19 per set of metal coins. Please check the FAQ for details. \nExcess Premium copies produced by this campaign may be sold in limited number at retail at a higher price. \nBox Sleeve (KS exclusive)\nThe premium sleeve slides onto the game box for a premium hold. The front proudly presents the eight clan chiefs of Clans of Caledonia.\n  The sleeve features all of the clan crests on the sides and a map of Scotland on the back with the current clan seats. Click for larger view.\n  Exclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter. There will only be enough sleeves printed to cover replacements. Take note that we also reserve the right to print similar box sleeves for special releases. Due to the high cost of producing metal coins, it is expected they will be very limited in retail. \nWe also want to give you the chance to shape the final product in a truly unique way! You can make suggestions and vote first for an additional port tile, then for a scoring tile and finally for a clan tile. At certain points during the campaign, voting for these will take place and will end: \nParticipate and shape the final product!\n   You, Kickstarer backers, will add one extra port, scoring and clan tile that will be included in every single game in this print run! The additional 9th clan will also be eternalized on the box sleeve. These additional tiles will be clearly marked as untested. The community of players can playtest and balance these tiles after release together. \nThe earlier you join in, the more you can shape the final game! Join this FB group to submit your ideas and vote!           \nClans of Caledonia includes more than 220 custom wooden tokens, a modular map and a full solo variant including custom silk-screened dice. We recognise that many of these features are often added as stretch goals but we don't want to compromise a top quality final product. Also, we don't want to risk the game balance by adding content that was not playtested (and that is not marked as untested). \nEven though we think that is the case, we are still going to add a few more components with your help!  \nAll Stretch Goals unlocked!\nFacebook Shares \nRetweets \nBoardgamegeek Thumbs \nDownload your favorite clan as a social media avatar.\n                                      Videos\nReview by Man vs. Meeple\nPreview by Counter Culture\n First impressions by slickerdrips\n\nHunter & Cron (German)\n\nAntlab Games, 2-Player\nSlickerdrip, Solo\n2-Player with Juma, the Game Designer, and Nick-Nack\n\nWritten Reviews\nBoardgamequest: \"If you\u2019re a fan of games such as Terra Mystica, Clans of Caledonia offers something equally fulfilling in an equal or shorter playtime\"\nMeoples' Magazine: \"Clans of Caledonia is great with two, three or four players.The clans are well balanced.\"\n\nSpielkult (German)\n\nRead the rules here.\nAnd play the game on Tabletopia now!\n                                   Within a month of receiving your copy (or if you haven't received your game by Dec 31, 2017) you can return the game and we even pay for return shipping, no strings attached. \nDepending on how early you pledge, you will receive:  \n  The guarantee applies to your pledge amount. The pledge amount equals the tiers you chose plus shipping costs.  \nClans of Caledonia was heavily playtested and I continued tweaking and balancing the game even when everyone thought I should stop. Thus, I am confident that, if it's a style of game you usually like, you will love Clans of Caledonia!  \nI strongly believe it's a stellar product that is truly outstanding and can bear comparison with the best Euro games on the market today.\nInspired by the so-called Stonemaier Method, we will ship games in bulk to fulfillment centers around the world to reduce customs fees & VAT and to keep shipping prices low. Country codes are here.\nShipping fee automatically added at checkout.\nBackers are limited to 2 games per pledge (any combination is fine; you will only pay the shipping fee once per pledge, not once per game). To add an additional game beyond the first, manually enter the \u20ac total when making your pledge or click the \"Manage your pledge\" button at the top of the page. \n\nShipping costs are heavily subsidized. If we had subsidized shipping even more to make it free in the US, we would have had to increase the pledge by \u20ac10. So we deliberately kept the tier low so you can actually save money by pleding for two copies because you pay shipping only once per pledge.  \n\nWe will be shipping from within US, within EU, within Canada and within China to the respective backers. Depending on the success of the campaign, we may also ship from within Australia. \nCustoms & Duty Free Shipping in US, EU and CA\n\nThe game will contain two rulebooks, one rulebook in English, and one in German. Since the game materials are language independent, we plan to offer digital files of translations of the rules in various languages.\nThe game comes with printed rulebooks in English and German.\n  Translations in French, Italian, Spanish and Dutch will be provided as digital files online.\n  Juma is a solo-entrepreneur and game designer. There is no big publisher behind this project. Consequently Kickstarter is the only way for Juma to publish this game as it helps him to assess the level of demand for the game and to finance the costly production. \n  All Kickstarter backers receive a money-back guarantee, but the sooner you back the better your guarantee is. Backers during the first 3 days receive even a 110% money-back guarantee! \nShape the final product! Based on your suggestions and votes, we will add one additional clan, one additional scoring tile and one additional port tile. The earlier you pledge, the more you can participate. \n Approximately 30% off MRSP and subsidized shipping: you are not likely to get this game cheaper any time soon. We are known for keeping our prices stable. \nExclusivity: The sleeves and metal coins will not be widely available after the Kickstarter.\nThere is no big publisher behind Clans of Caledonia so without your pledges this game won't be produced at all. \nBy backing this Kickstarter, you allow me to devote more time to our awesome hobby and bring more great games to you soon!\n\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering either version of the game to retailers during the campaign. Retailer backers, just like other backers, will receive their rewards before the games will go into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact Juma at juma@karma-games.de (please use \"Retailer\" in the email object) during the campaign for pricing information. \nAbout the Creators\nI am Juma.  \n  I am the father of a small family in Berlin (Germany) and an avid gamer. I studied Philosophy & Economics (bachelor's degree) and Innovation Management & Entrepreneurship / Business Administration (master's degree). No wonder I love economic games. \n\nKarma Games is just me - there are no emloyees, no marketing manager, I do it all! :)  \n\nWhen I was 16 I participated in a music school exchange program and was hosted by a lovely Scottish family on the Isle of Bute, west of Glasgow. I believe that the design process of this game can be traced back to that great experience!  \n\nKlemens Franz is the illustrator of Clans of Caledonia. Klemens has illustrated many award-winning strategy games such as Agricola, Caverna and Isle of Skye. Klemens is based in Austria: http://www.atelier198.com/   \nDan Cunningham, founder of Iron Kitten Games, reached out to me, a few months ago and asked if he could help. He was incredibly helpful with various tasks, from creating 3D renders and animations, to production, Tabletopia implementation and Kickstarter related issues (a truly multitalented individual!).\nMichael Csorba, recently asked if he could help and supports me with communication and running the Kickstarter. He is the only one who also resides in Berlin, it's great to see a team member face to face once in a while! \nAdriano Rahde, from Ao Amor in Brazil, has created the amazing Kickstarter video trailer! Thank you! \nPlaytesters: More than 50 regular playtesters helped to create this awesome game. I'm grateful that you were all willing to play the prototype again and again -  even in the early stages of development when it was still rough around the edges. Your contribution and feedback was invaluable! \nA lot more people actively reached out to me and offered help, some Boardgamegeek users who helped so much with editing the rules (especially Francois Landry Corbin, Mike Poole, Steven Barba and many more). The truth is: without the many people who volunteered to help, this game would not be as great as it is. It was a real community effort. I was, and still am, amazed how awesome so many board game enthusiasts are. Thank you all! \nOther Products\nJuma designed two other games that you can order from the Karma Games website.\n\n  Fette Ernte is a card game for 3 to 5 kids to learn about growing vegetables (only available in German).\nPlease feel free to visit our website and sign up for our newsletter here: http://www.karma-games.com/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI do have some experience with managing and fulfilling a crowd funding project. My last campaign was delivered one month ahead of schedule and only four months after the campaign finished. That game was also called 5th best economic game of all time by Tom Vasel. \n\nDespite my experience, there are still some risks involved that everyone backing the project must be aware of.\n\nThere could be delays: freight and worldwide fulfillment is complex and involves numerous companies. I read everything about the topic on Stonemaier Games' blog (an invaluable resource, thank you Jamey!) and consulted other creators for tips and tricks on how to manage fulfillment the best way possible.\n\nIn addition, I decided to work with the best fulfillment partners even if it comes at a higher cost. \n\nDue to proximity to the fulfillment centers or the factory some backers will receive their games significantly earlier than others. The majority of backers should receive their games around October 2017, ideally a few weeks before the game fair in Essen, though. If delays arise it may happen that the game is available at the game fair in Essen before some backers received their copies. \n\nI will do my best to solve any problems that may arise and keep you regularly updated.\n\nClans of Caledonia features variable player powers. It's tough to balance an asymmetric game. In the beginning the game was playtested with 50+ different play testers. They provided diverse qualitative feedback that led to the final gameplay mechanisms. \n\nOnce the game mechanisms were nearly final, I focused on balancing the clans. Therefore, I playtested again and again with the best players of Clans of Caledonia only because the stats were far more reliable than with new players whose skills varies a lot. I gathered the stats, fine tuned the clans and made some quantitative analyses in Excel that indicated that the clans are very well balanced. My playtesters agreed. \n\nNonetheless I am aware that other games with variable player powers ended up being perceived by players as much less balanced than the creators predicted. In order to mitigate this risk, I included a Clan auction variant that ensures nearly 100% fairness. Furthermore, one can also play this game without variable player powers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Sl\u00e0inte", "descp": "Join in and suggest the additional clan, port and scoring tiles.

It is easy to learn, simple to play, and won't take up your entire weekend. It is a Scott Almes design after all, designer of the Tiny Epic series.\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is this simple: each player performs two actions per round. You can take a Capital Action, which could be followed by other players by using a serf. Or, you may take a Conquest action, which can be mustered to allow you to double down on your own actions. After each player has taken their two actions, players will collect resources based on the regions they control and then start a new round. This continues until a player triggers one of the four end game conditions: Expand, Exploit, Explore, or Exterminate! \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, Scott has us warring across a giant game board (26 x 26 in. that extends to 39 x 26 in.), sailing the great blue sea in boats that actually hold your minis!\nAnd soaring through the clouds with minis on the backs of dragons, griffins, and in airships!\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea is the classic tale of orcs vs humans and the warring factions of a fantasy realm. It is a game of territory control, resource management, mastering your faction and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses.\nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you'll have 3 heroes, each with special abilities that will become more powerful as the game goes on. You'll have 5 warriors, which will defend your capital city and conquer regions across the land. You will also have 12 serfs, who are used to collect resources, build buildings, as well as take extra actions through a clever follow mechanic. Serfs are a limited resource, so you must deploy them wisely in order to ensure victory.\nWill you rely on the resourcefulness of the Human's? The strength of the Orc? The ingenuity of the Dwarves? or the magic of the Elves?\n      In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, every decision is a meaningful decision and players will need to be clever to claim victory. One way to surprise your opponent is through well timed use of SPELLS! The effects of which range from resource gain and buffs to your army to interrupts and counter spells. \nBut the focus is always on the 4 X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate! Each of them represent an end game trigger.\nEXPLORE  \nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a giant 26 inch by 26 inch beautifully illustrated 4-fold game board, and expands to 39 inch by 26 inch with the Expansion board!\nClick to see the Full Map with the Extended Board! \u00a9 2017 Gamelyn Games, all rights reserved.\n  During play, the land and water regions will feature exploration tokens that offer surprises to the players brave enough to enter.\nOnce the final exploration token is revealed, the end of the game is triggered.  \nEXPAND  \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you will need to expand your kingdom, your army and your reach. Building certain structures in your Capital will allow you to recruit Heroes! \nAnd, Heroes become better as you level up your Capital City.\nRecruit all of your serfs and warriors and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXPLOIT \nThis wouldn't be much of a 4X without the most important X, exploitation! Simply collecting resources and turtling in your castle won't get you very far in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. Players will need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their faction and that of their opponents to assure victory. Part of that is knowing when and where to build your towers to secure area control. Build 3 towers and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXTERMINATE\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a luckless combat system that requires timing and wits. To resolve a war, players compare the strength value of their armies, as modified by their selection of a single Tactic Card, highest strength wins. Each player has an identical deck of 7 Tactic Cards and, in each war, must secretly choose one of the 7 to play in conjunction with their army.\nThis gives players perfect information on the potential maneuvers of their opponent. But, how you will exploit this during play is up to you to discover!  \nDestroy an opponent's Capital City and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nVICTORY  \nVictory points can be earned during play for winning wars, casting spells, and certain hero abilities; and at the end of the game for certain units trained, regions controlled, buildings built, towers built (based on their distance from your Capital City), and the level of your Capital City. \nWhoever have the highest victory points at the end of the game, wins!\nEXPAND YOUR GAME\nDon't miss out on expanding your game to support 5 and 6 players and getting 4 more incredible factions. The stalwart Lionkin, the ravenous Undead, the tribal Lizardfolk, and the sprawling Goblins! You'll want to try them all!\n      MERCENARIES\nMercenaries are a Kickstarter promo that will not be available in retail, though future players will be able to buy them directly from Gamelyn Games. For backing us on Kickstarter, you are getting them for FREE! \nIn game, the Mercenaries are essentially super buff Heroes available to purchase for any player. First come, first serve. They are usable with any number of players. If a Mercenary is ever defeated in battle, it returns to the general supply and is again available to all players. \n.\n  $79 Core Game Contents:\n1 Game Board (26x26in., four-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n15 Screen Printed Wood Resource Tokens \n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n1 Screen Printed Wood First Player Token\n94 Exploration Tokens (including stretch goal tokens)\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n28 Tactic Cards (7 per player)\n8 Solo Enemy Cards\n60 Spell Cards (including stretch goal cards)\n4 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\n1 Rulebook\n$139 Deluxe Expansion Contents:\nAll Core Game Contents PLUS...\n1 Extension Game Board (26x13in., two-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n6 Screen Printed Wood Resource Tokens \n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n14 Tactic Cards\n4 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\nREAD FIRST: videos of the game do not depict the exact components you will receive. It is too cost prohibitive to create prototypes with 80 miniatures. So, the prototypes featured in the videos have standee characters instead of miniatures. Also, some rules may have been tweaked during development but these videos will give you a great feel for the game so we've decided to include them. For exact details on the components that you will receive in the game please see the components list and images above. For the most up to date rules, please download the prototype rules HERE. Thank you.\n  ATTENTION\nWe're doing things differently than other projects. We are not \"gutting\" the game only to give it all back to you as Stretch Goals. We are offering a fully loaded premium product right from the start. Essentially we have already built into the game the majority of the \"would be\" Stretch Goals. Therefore this project may not have as many Stretch Goals as you are used to seeing. We hope that you enjoy this fresh approach and offering, and we hope that you are still willing to share this project up to the end. \n  Additional Stretch Goals are given to every backer of the Core tier or better, unless otherwise stated on the Stretch Goal graphic.\n                  Click to find us on Facebook!\n                                Click to find us on Twitter!\n  This concludes the stretch goals for Heroes of Land, Air & Sea.

You will NOT be hit with additional shipping charges from us after the project ends. In most cases, you will not be hit with customs or VAT either as we are offering Customs Friendly Shipping to the countries where most of our backers are located. \nYour rewards will be shipped at our cost to our international hubs. Based on where you are located, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or New Hampshire (USA and the rest of the world).  \nBackers who do not complete their pledge manager by the deadline, which will be made clear via an email notification, may need to have their rewards shipped from the US. This may incur additional shipping charges to international backers that would need to be paid for at that time. \nDue to the size of the rewards and risk of bounce back, we cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. \nShipping Rates are described below: (Base / Deluxe)\nUnited States, Canada, Germany, China: $15 / $20\nEuropean Union, United Kingdom, Australia: $20 / $25\nHong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan: $25 / $30\nNew Zealand: $30 / $35\nLatin America, Rest of World: $55 / $60\nThe most effective way to assure that we reach all potential upgrades is to share this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Instagram, blogs, etc. Share this project with EVERYONE!!

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have many years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 75% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with our long time partners Panda Game Manufacturing. Who we've worked with on over 10 separate projects and have a great relationship with. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping.\n\n3. We are working with Ship Naked for project fulfillment. Having worked with them for over 5 years, we are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled all our projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment. I will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress.\n\nThank you for your trust in us! Let's bring Heroes of Land, Air & Sea to game tables all around the world!\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe offer a full refund, including fees, up to 14 days after the project ends. After 14 days and until your game has been packed, we offer a no questions asked refund minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recover).

Refunds within 14 days are issued through payment reversal via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is funded in USD. All refunds will be issued in USD in the exact amount of USD received, minus applicable Kickstarter and payment processing fees depending on the time of your refund request.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you accept that the final look of the game, its components, materials, and rules, may differ substantially from what was presented while the Kickstarter was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our email notification requesting your pledge confirmation, via our pledge manager service, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligation to you in full for your pledge or donation. We may however, at our discretion, still refund or ship your reward if you contact us after the 8 week period.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our email notification requesting your pledge confirmation, via our pledge manager service, you agree that our responsibility is to ship your order as entered and confirmed in our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery of your order to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be required to receive your order.

Since we love The Strange and its fans at Monte Cook Games, we decided to give them the most spectacular experience with The Strange that we can create with a deluxe boxed edition.\nAs you can probably imagine, we want to make it absolutely beautiful and crammed full of all the coolest extra content we can come up with: character sheets, XP cards with a brand new design, and maybe even a gorgeous cloth version of the Ardeyn poster map, if we hit some stretch goals. We did it once before, and with your help, we\u2019re going to make that dream a reality again, this time to create a deluxe boxed edition of The Strange! \n(Already own The Strange? Don't worry\u2014we've got some things that will interest you as well as those new to the game.)\n       Our \"sharefest\" goal was to get 100 shares of this Facebook post and 100 retweets of this Twitter post so Bruce would record a 10-minute video of himself reading an excerpt from Myth of the Maker, the novel that inspired the creation of The Strange RPG. We hit that goal, and you can now watch that reading video on our YouTube channel! Thank you very much for helping spread the word about this Kickstarter campaign! \nThe Strange RPG is where stories, movies, myths, novels, and even comics and games come alive in limited alternate dimensions called recursions. Player characters explore these recursions, accumulate treasures and wonders, and defend the Earth from entities they discover who are jealous of\u2014or want to consume\u2014the real world. Recursions float in a medium that scientists call dark energy, but that PCs call the Strange. Sometimes, fictional characters and creatures in a recursion wake to the realization that they\u2019re not real. Then they seek to break out of their limited dimensions and reach Earth. As do far more vast and completely alien creatures called planetovores that have been swimming in the Strange for who knows how many millions or billions of years.\nCritically acclaimed, The Strange was nominated for the Origins Award for Best New Roleplaying Game and received 3 ENnie awards, including awards for Best Setting, Best Game, and Best Art. A novel of The Strange is about to hit store shelves, called Myth Of The Maker. \nFor more about The Strange, please visit TheStrangeRPG.com.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n  The standard edition of The Strange RPG is a stunningly beautiful 416-page hardcover. It\u2019s currently in print (and will remain so) and is available from the Monte Cook Games store, your local game store, and online sellers such as Amazon. So why a boxed edition?\nA few years ago we created a boxed edition of Numenera that proved incredibly popular. The Reliquary box we ended up with by the time the campaign was finished was nothing short of stunning. It even ended up winning a Golden ENnie award! And as we mentioned, fans of the Cypher System have been wondering when we\u2019d give The Strange the same treatment. That time has come at last.\nThe Strange Boxed Edition Is Exclusive to This Kickstarter This is your only chance to get this edition directly. Except through a select few retailers who might support this Kickstarter, the boxed set will not be available in stores.\nA Deluxe Box\nOne of the cool things about not selling this box through retail stores is that it doesn't have to be marked like a retail product. We can leave off the bar codes and sales text and that sort of stuff. That means the entire outside of the box can just reflect the amazing esthetic of The Strange. So we\u2019re going to make it look awesome\u2014front, back, and sides! The box itself will be of sturdy design, with a deluxe linen finish. It\u2019ll be a great way to carry The Strange around, and it\u2019ll look absolutely wonderful on your game shelf. \nThis boxed set is not a new edition for The Strange. The box (see THE STRANGE BOX backer level) will contain the same content you find in the existing hardcover rulebook, but in easy-to-use, smaller books. This way, the GM can be paging through the setting guide, and a player can be looking up a new ability at the same time.\nThe books in the box will all be softcovers. With the exceptions noted in the table above, their content is not different than the existing hardcover rulebook, so if you already have that, it's not new material. And, conversely, if you don\u2019t own The Strange yet, this box gives you all the game content you\u2019d find in the hardcover. It\u2019s the same game either way. The difference is in the format.\nWe think an ultimate boxed set edition could be so much more than just that, though. What we want to do is create a boxed set so deluxe that its mere existence will seed an entirely new recursion. As stretch goals are reached, the content described as already being in THE STRANGE BOX will be improved by additional components! \nThe LIBRARY OF IMPOSSIBLE THINGS\nThe LIBRARY level includes everything provided in THE STRANGE BOX, as described under the rewards to the right. Since it grows as we unlock stretch goals, the main page is the best place to see where we are at any given time.\nBut in addition to that, backers ALSO get a PDF copy of ALL the previously published books from the original game line. All told, that\u2019s a collection of 27 titles exceeding $150 in value.  \nThe ESTATE VAULT has all the contents of THE STRANGE BOX, which means that you get all the in-box and box-upgrade content added to the campaign thanks to stretch goals, which could significantly improve the size and contents of the box. (It also has all the additional titles of the LIBRARY level.) However, the ESTATE VAULT will be even more special and deluxe, as it will be handcrafted from wood! In addition, we will add a physical Estate Badge, a book safe for storing your dice or other secrets, and a deluxe dossier to keep track of your current cases. Finally, you will get every item added by stretch goals, even goals that are not in-box upgrades to content.\n    But I Already Have The Strange!\nDon\u2019t want all the content, but really want a deluxe box to keep your stuff for The Strange in? Back at JUST THE BOX backer level and get what it says: just the box. Your existing The Strange corebook will fit nicely within it, and there\u2019ll be space for two or three additional books, plus dice, pencils, an XP or Cypher deck or whatever, and so on. If you want more than one box, choose Empty Box as an Add-On.\nAdd-ons are rewards that you add to your existing reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. Check out our pledge calculator to help you figure out exactly how much to pledge based on the backer level and add-ons you desire.\nWant some helpful aid for calculating your total pledge amount if you want some add-ons? Go to the pledge calculator by clicking here. Once you know the total amount, return to the Kickstarter page and click Manage Your Pledge, then Change Your Pledge, then just add the new total into the Pledge Amount. You'll be able to specify the rewards you want after the campaign using BackerKit.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\nShipping and Reward Fulfillment\nSoon after the Kickstarter campaign for A Strange Box ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.\nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll send you an email with a coupon code to redeem them. You decide when to use the coupon, and give us your correct shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of some and bundle them together if that\u2019s more convenient for you (or you'd like to save on international shipping costs). We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below. \n\nIf you change address between reward shipments, you won't need to tell us, since you'll enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient's shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward. \nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge. You will be charged shipping at the time of reward redemption. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you. Plus, those of you in the UK and EU will not pay customs/importing fees.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK or Europe: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $52, you\u2019ll pay $42. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.\nArt by Matt Stawicki\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has previously released a boxed edition of a similar-sized game (that being Numenera) to such great success that we\u2019re doing it again with The Strange. All our previous campaigns have been successful and jam-packed with rewards, and most campaigns are completely fulfilled, while those that are not continue to deliver their rewards on schedule. That means we\u2019ve delivered over 200,000 rewards. These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Strange, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, boxed sets, more than a dozen hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them. Especially considering that we\u2019ve created a deluxe boxed set edition for a different title not long ago.\n\nWe are extremely proud of our track record. Of course, there\u2019s always the danger of meteor strikes, Ebola pandemics, or catastrophic solar flares. But our staff is spread out across the country, so we\u2019re unlikely to all be wiped out at once. Unless the planetovores breach into the universe of normal matter to consume the Earth without Carter Strange around to save us, we are confident that the project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "JUST THE BOX", "descp": "You get a beautiful, sturdy box to store game materials for The Strange that you already own.

Armed with 7 custom energy dice and a spirit totem that buffs their abilities, the players do battle - controlling wild energy forces carefully and cleverly to protect their own energy while defeating all rivals to become the Master Zee!\nWhy is ElemenZ different from other dice battle games? The dice in ElemenZ are both the way that players can complete combo effects and the life points of the Shaman. Instead of having a constant pool of dice and a quantity of life points, in Elemenz players must think carefully how best to protect their dice while removing the dice of rivals. Using the powers of their Totem wisely and accessing the dangerous wild 'Z' energy helps to do this - but it can be risky because too much 'Z' will backfire leaving a player vulnerable and the totem energy can quickly run out!\nHighlights\nDifferent Shaman specific powers\nPush-your-luck elements\nTake-that style of play\nRisk-versus-reward\nTactically and thematically rich\n2 different games in 1 box (2 player and a 3-4 player game)\nFast paced (approx. 15-30mins) but easy to learn\nNo two games ever play the same\nYou Get 2 Games in 1 box. ElemenZ offers 2 different games to suit your playing style!\n\nThe basic game is a tight and quick paced dice battle game for 3-4 players, ideal for families, those just learning the game or those wanting a quick challenge with friends. The (KS exclusive) expansion comes with an extra four totem boards plus 31 energy tokens offering more of a tactical energy management game - ideal for more experienced gamers.\nThe 2 player game is an energy tug-of-war game where players manipulate the pool of elemental forces (dice) in a bid to be first to energise the enigmatic monolith on planet Zee.\nGame 1 - 3-4 player dice challenge game\nGame 1 expanded - 3-4 player with Totem boards and tokens\nGame 2 - 2 player tug-of-war dice challenge game\n     Kickstarter components List:\nLimited edition game box design - different artwork from retail version\nx4 double sided boards - 1 side is for multiplayer, other side for 2 player\nx28 custom engraved dice (15mm) - 4 custom coloured sets (7 per player) \nx4 KS exclusive Totem boards - for use in the expanded game\nRulebook - will contain both English and French rules versions (more languages to follow).\nx31 KS exclusive energy tokens - for use with the totem boards\nFuture retail versions of ElemenZ will only include the 2 & 3-4 player basic games, not the totem expansion to the game. The totems will only be available as part of this KS print run and as promo items sold at shows so jump in now as a backer to get the whole bundle together.\n  The five elemental forces of nature (Air, Earth, Fire, Water and Wild 'Z' energy - called Zee) are represented by symbols on the dice and on the tokens. The dice are the energy store that each Alien Shaman player has available to dominate and defeat their opponents.\nIn the 3-4 player game players use various combinations (combos) of dice symbols rolled to trigger effects that aim to reduce enemy player's dice pools, until only 1 player is left. 'Z' symbols are wild and mimic symbols on other dice.\n\nBut the wild 'Z' is a risk versus reward mechanic - rolling 3 or more 'Z's at any time causes an immediate Wild Surge which finishes the player's turn immediately and they cannot trigger any combos (including defense combos).\n  We've provided a handy 5 point infographic that explains how the expanded 3-4 game works (the basic game works the same - only without the totems and tokens).\nThe 2 player game (pictured below) is similar but rather than defeating your opponent, it's a race to energise the enigmatic monolith - by using complementary elements. Doing so requires a healthy pile of energy dice drawn from the central pool by using combo effects. Combos must also be rolled for every dice locked in to the monolith.\nHowever, you must stay alert as the best chances of completing the monolith lie in your opponent's dice and you will need to steal some of them quickly to get ahead in the race!\n Watch the complete trailer below for a more detailed description of the alien shamans and the worlds they inhabit.\n  Click here or on the picture below for the current rules booklet (English only currently) for both games. You can also find Print-n-Play files for the boards and tokens + instructions on how to customise D6's to play the game there.\n             This game is fully tested and ready to go to the printers. That's not to say that with your help we could make it so much better/nicer/groovier (add your chosen adjective here). We have some excellent stretchgoals planned but need your help to make them real. So take a look at the first few below - if we smash through these we have plenty more planned but don't want to reveal all secrets yet... (hmm, ok then, just one... Avatars).\n    On a windswept ridge, four Master Shamans, ambassadors of their race, climb towards an enigmatic rocky and ancient monolith atop the summit. This planet, Planet 'Z' as it is called in all four languages, is a wild uninhabited place of raw and uncontrolled primal energy - the cosmic forces that shape life on all planets.\nExcept for every seven years. \nThen, the Master Shamans arrive to do battle, summoning their elemental totems, energetic forces of wild energy from deep within the world, channelling the primal energy in a duel to decide which culture will gain ascendancy for the next seven years.\nYou take on the role of one of these alien Shamans.

We can therefore keep the shipping as simple and cost effective for you as a backer as we possibly can by taking on some of this large cost ourselves with the safety of a company that really knows it's stuff.\nThus we are able to offer reduced rates for the EU, US and Canada - which is why we can proudly offer hassle-free 'friendly' shipping to the EU, USA as well as Australia and New Zealand (there should be 'no' extra customs or tax fees to pay) when you get your pledge reward. \nNote: The expected weight of the game is ~1.5kg per copy and our shipping costs reflect this which is why we will use a tracked postage service for international backers pledging for 2 or copies and for the Master Zee pledge level.\nCanadian Backers: We can probably 'friendly' post to Canada also for single game copy pledges (but we cannot guarantee this as the threshold for personal imports is quite low).\n      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDESIGN: \nElemenZ is ~90% complete. We need to reformat the rules and translate to French and would like to improve the graphic design elements a little but essentially the game is ready to roll! Even with potential stretchgoal unlocks and additional artwork acquired, we will not be far from completion. We have factored in these additional time elements to our projected plan and can still aim for release latest in November 2017.\n\nMANUFACTURE: \nOur chosen partner for production is Whatzgames from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's and Repos manufacturing among many others. They produce high quality games, are reliable and know the industry inside out as well as the requirements for Kickstarters. BadCatGames has every confidence in them to do a sterling job and produce a stunning game for us on time.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING: \nOur haulage, shipping and fulfillment partner in the UK is the highly regarded GamesQuest that has fulfilled kickstarters for CoolMiniorNot, Modiphius, Stonemaier Games, and many more. Through them we can offer very cost effective backer shipping rates, quality control and rapid distribution anywhere in the world. Although our worst case deadline is Nov 2017, we are really aiming on delivery and fulfillment much earlier than that and we will keep you all informed every step of the way.\n\nUNFORSEEN EVENTS: \nThe BadCatGames team has been in retail and distribution between us for over 20 years so we know what can potentially go wrong. However, there is always a small chance of odd things happening - such as boats sinking, fires in warehouses or us being carried off by Byahkee if we play any more Arkham Horror. Rest assured, BadCatGames needs to prove itself to the gaming market and we aim to do this with flying colours and 100% happy backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "BadCat Games\n4 created \u00b7 88 backed\nBadCatGames is an indie tabletop game design studio and publisher of exciting games like Elemenz and Gladiatores: Blood for Roses.

Deluxe CORE Backers and CORE Backers will receive unpainted minis. STANDEE CORE Backers will receive STANDEES.\n Featured Reward Tiers:\n     Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is a 4X style board game (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) for 2-6* players that plays in 2 hours, and features 80 highly detailed miniatures, including an option for pre-painted hero figures, and over 30 constructs! *To play with 5 or 6 players you would need at least 1 added Faction Pack. The core game plays 2-4 players.  \nDeluxe Reward Tiers offer an option to have your Hero Miniatures come pre-painted. Miniatures in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea are made of PVC and ABS on a 28mm scale and with 24mm bases.\n Heroes of Land, Air & Sea breaks the mold of regular 4X games in that it is easy to learn, simple to play, and games only last 2 hours. It is a Scott Almes design after all, designer of the Tiny Epic series. \nIt's this simple: each player performs two actions per round. You can take a Capital Action, which could be followed by other players by using a peon. Or, you may take a Conquest action, which can be rallied and allow you to double down on your own actions. After each player has taken their two actions, players will collect resources based on the regions they control and then start a new round. This continues until a player triggers one of the four end game conditions: Expand, Exploit, Explore, or Exterminate!\n  In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, Scott has us warring across a giant game board (39 in. x 26 in.), sailing the great blue sea in boats that hold your minis and soaring through the clouds with minis on the backs of dragons, gryphons, and in airships!\n  Heroes of Land, Air & Sea is the classic tale of orcs vs humans and the warring factions of a fantasy realm. It is a game of territory control, resource management, mastering your faction and exploiting your opponent's weaknesses. In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you'll have 3 heroes, each with special abilities that will become more powerful as the game goes on. You'll have 5 warriors, which will defend your capital city and conquer regions across the land. You will also have 12 peons, who are used to collect resources, build buildings, as well as take extra actions. Peons are a limited resource, so you must deploy them wisely in order to ensure victory.\nWill you rely on the Human's resourcefulness? The Orc's strength? The ingenuity of the Dwarves?\n  or the magic of the Elves?\n  In Heroes of Land, Air & Sea, every decision is a meaningful decision and players will need to be clever to claim victory. One way to surprise your opponent is through well timed use of SPELLS! The effects of which range from resource gain and buffs to your army to interrupts and counter spells. \nBut the focus is always on the 4 X's: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate! Each of them represent an end game trigger.\nEXPLORE  \nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a gigantic 39 inch by 26 inch beautifully illustrated 6-fold game board!\nClick to see the Full Map! \u00a9 2017 Gamelyn Games, all rights reserved.\n  During play, the land and water regions will feature exploration tokens that offer surprises to the players brave enough to enter.\nOnce the final exploration token is revealed, the end of the game is triggered.  \nEXPAND  \nIn Heroes of Land, Air & Sea you will need to expand your kingdom, your army and your reach. Building certain structures in your Capital will allow you to recruit Heroes! \nAnd, Heroes become better as you level up your Capital City.\nRecruit all of your peons and warriors and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXPLOIT \nThis wouldn't be much of a 4X without the most important X, exploitation! Simply collecting resources and turtling in your castle won't get you very far in Heroes of Land, Air & Sea. Players will need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their faction and that of their opponents to assure victory. Part of that is knowing when and where to build your towers to secure area control. Build 3 towers and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nEXTERMINATE\nHeroes of Land, Air & Sea features a luckless combat system that requires timing and wits. To resolve a war, players compare the strength value of their armies, as modified by their selection of a single Tactic Card, highest strength wins. Each player has an identical deck of 7 Tactic Cards and, in each war, must secretly choose one of the 7 to play in conjunction with their army.\nThis gives players perfect information on the potential maneuvers of their opponent. But, how you will exploit this during play is up to you to discover!  \nDestroy an opponent's Capital City and you'll trigger the end of the game!\nVICTORY  \nVictory points can be earned during play for winning wars and casting spells and at the end of the game for certain units trained, regions controlled, buildings built, towers built (based on their distance from your Capital City), and the level of your Capital City. Whoever have the highest victory points at the end of the game, wins!\n        Updated to reflect unlocked stretch goals.\n  Box Contents:\n1 Giant Game Board (39x26in., six-fold)\n80 Miniatures (20 unique designs), OR 80 Standees (based on tier)\n32 Constructs (8 per faction)\n4 Capital City Boards (1 per faction)\n21 Wood Resource Tokens (for up to 6 players*)\n8 Action Tokens (2 per faction)\n4 Score Tokens (1 per faction)\n1 First Player Token\n90 Exploration Tokens\n12 Hero Cards (3 per faction)\n6 Decks of 7 Tactic Cards (for up to 6 players*)\n48 Spell Cards\n6 Plastic Stands (for aerial constructs)\n1 Rulebook\n*The Core Box comes with 4 factions to support 4 players; but is does include 2 additional Tactic Decks and 6 additional Wood Resource Tokens to potentially support up to 6 players if additional factions are available.
