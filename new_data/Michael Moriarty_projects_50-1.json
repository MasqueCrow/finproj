[{"backer": "Michael Moriarty", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Do you remember the game from your childhood \"Rock Paper Scissors\"?   \n Well it's is Back! Stronger, Faster, Bolder : \nThe Origin\nRock Paper SlingShot is a table game based on the popular hand game Rock \nPaper Scissors. When we look back to our childhood, that hand game was one of the first game we learn, it was quick, simple and every one know it. Furthermore, you need nothing else then your hand to play it... and there was that catching song! \nWell, it's with the same spirit that we build Rock Paper SlingShot... rest assured there is no catching song...Not Yet!  In Rock Paper Scissors you had 3 signs, each sign beat one and is beaten by the other one. In our table game we add two new signs; Flames & Slingshot. So now, each sign beat 2 and are beaten by 2. Now, to makes thing interesting, we make evolution come along, not once, but twice (Darwin would be so pride!) for each 5 signs. Meaning that the Rock become Boulder and Mud Slide, the SlingShot become Catapult and Noah's Arch (hey! it's all woods), and so long for the other signs. They forms 5 families that share the same family Fonts as well. \nNow we were getting somewhere, but we needed something to keep them in line... \nSo we add 4 Jokers to the mix. We have Tornado, Deluge, Nuclear Bomb and Trump Wall (why not!)\nSo now when someone ask you : what Noah's Arch, the Trump Wall and a flamethrower has in common? You can said Rock Paper SlingShot! \n\nThe Game\nThe aim of the game is to get rid of all your cards before every one else. It's a turn based game. All cards are equally distributed among players. The first player start by putting one or many instance of a card. The next player need to beat it with the same number of card(s), or use a joker, or pass his turn. It's easy, because on each card there is a drawings that indicate which cards you can beat. A six-year-old child can play without the help of an adult, and have good chance of winning too. \n The Spirit\nOur goal was to create a game that is easy to learn and can be played quickly (the game lasts 8 to 15 minutes). The best part, you never know who's going to win, because there are no absolute cards that beat all the others. When you play a joker (the highest ranking card in the game), you can always be beaten by the next player with a lower ranked cards with special power\". Speaking of special cards, there is a very special one in the game: it is a joker with the famous Trump Wall. You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... \n\n For Everyone  \nFor every age group that can enjoy a game that is quick to play and easy to learn. Super simple rules : become a skilled player after just one game!\nSo what is the target audience? Everyone. Really everyone. If you have family, colleagues, friends, you can play with them. If you don't, it's sad... But there is also a solitary mode!\n3 Ways To Play\nFor the people who want more strategies or want to keep score, we add 5 different types of tokens to the game. One for each family of cards ; Rock, Paper Foil, Scissors, Flames, and SlingShot.  \n Play for fun ; No need for tokens, each game has his winner, no need to keep score. \nPlay for points : The first to finish playing all his cards get a token. The one with the most tokens at the end of the night, is the real winner. \nPlay with Strategies : In this mode, each player want to be the first to collect all 5 family token. For that, the player need not only to finish first, but he also need to play his last move with a card(s) of the same family as the token he need to get. So, if you finish with a joker... No token for you!  If you finish with a token you already have, no token for you.\n\nThe Stretch Goals\nThere is 7 stretch goals (cards) to be add to the game :\n1) Trump Wall Joker : You can use it to beat your friends, but be careful, several cards of lower rank can destroy it... It is the less powerful joker in the deck. Goal : 25 000$\n2) Justin Trudeau Selfie : This card add an extra instance to the card(s) your are about to play. Goal : 50 000$\n3) Putin Election : Put this card after someone play multiple cards, and it become the value of only 1 card instance for you to beat. Goal : 75 000$ \n4) Mao's Red Book : With this card you can convince any of you card to become another one (except joker). Goal : 150 000$\n5) Obama Care : When a player play this card everyone must dump one of their cards. Goal : 300 000$\n6) Your name Hacker : With this card you can dump one of your cards just before your turn to play. Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abHacker card\u00bb\n7)Your name Challenge : With this card you can challenge someone that just play something hard to beat (except Joker) to beat his own hand. If the challenged player pass, the next player to play is you with a new set of card(s). Goal : if someone take the Pledge \u00abChallenge card\u00bb\n\n The Deck   \nThe set of 64 cards, plus stretch cards.\n\nThe Rewards   \n The Main Creator \nMy name is Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e9ron (ok! just call me Jeff). I've study in marketing and used to work in customer service. Trust me when I says; every body wants to have more time on their hands to do the things they loved. Bad news! This game wont help you save time. Ok, it's playable quickly, but you will want to play it again and again.  \n\nRock-Paper-SlingShot is my first game, but I did my homework. I worked on it for the last four years. I took the time to test the gameplay with a lot of peoples from different backgrounds and used their suggestions to improve the game. I am still open to suggestions and I want this game to keep evolving. So by the time you get your copy of Rock-Paper-SlingShot, there will be a section on the game website for you to suggest rules variations to renew the game for the joy of every one. You may event suggest an adaptation of another game to be played with the Rock Paper SlingShot deck. I want you to be a part of this game & love it, as I do. \n\nMy Belief\nI believe that success is measured by the number of lives you have positively touched, even if it is only for the duration of a game. The important thing is to share good times with your loved ones. Have fun & stay safe.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOnce we reach our funding goal, we need to print and package the games fast so they can be in your hands way before Christmas.

A player who totals over 21 is bust and is out of the game. After each player has had their turn, the player whose total is nearest 21 wins the game.\nEach turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to \"hold\": If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and the game will switch to the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues. If a player chooses to \"hold\", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

Double-6 scores 25 points. A double-3 cancels out a player's score and puts them back to zero. Any double other than a 3 or 6 scores 5 points.

This group primarily consisted of artists known as The Ferus Gang: Moses, Billy Al Bengston, Robert Irwin, Craig Kaufman, Edward Kienholz, Ken Price, Ed Ruscha, Larry Bell, John Altoon and Wallace Berman. They were the first generation of post-WWII artists who rose to prominence between the years 1957 - 1966 at the Ferus Gallery under owners Walter Hopps and later Irving Blum. Moses\u2019 path to this group began about 10 years earlier with an unlikely encounter.\nMoses had been with the Medical Corps when he was in the Navy. Afterward, he thought he might want to become a doctor, which led to taking pre-med classes at Long Beach City College. But it wasn\u2019t taking. He was having difficulty doing the math and memorizing. Someone suggested he take an art course. They talked about this kind of crazy bohemian guy, Pedro Miller, who ran the art department.\nMoses went to his first art class, where Miller began to discuss copies of C\u00e9zannes, Van Goghs and Picassos that leaned on a shelf around the room. Moses was intrigued. Then Miller set up a still life and said, \u201cNow we\u2019re all going to make a painting.\u201d Moses really wasn\u2019t sure what to do. As Miller came around to each of the students, he knew he had to do something. Sort of out of exasperation, he dipped his fingers in the paint and did this whole thing with his fingers. Miller took that painting up to the head of the class. He put it on an easel, and said, \"I want you all to see something. That\u2019s a real artist.\" Afterward, Moses got a reputation as the talented artist in the group, who they nicknamed Picasso.\nMoses always spoke of this as a defining, pivotal moment in his life, one that opened the possibility of being an artist.\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine today, but there was almost no art scene in the 1950s, except for the burgeoning film industry. There were surfers, Bohemians and beatniks. The Los Angeles Board of Supervisor\u2019s even banned Art Fairs as a form of communism. The powerful New York art scene thought we were just a desert wasteland. Little did they know we were soon to become the Wild West of the art world. That\u2019s when Ferus Gallery and the Cool School came along. Ferus is the latin word for wild. This gallery was located behind Streeter Blair\u2019s antique shop at 736 La Cienega in Los Angeles, an area better known today as West Hollywood. It was on what soon became known as Gallery Row.\nAfter a somewhat circuitous period, Moses enrolled in the graduate art program at UCLA, where he met and became friends with Craig Kaufman. Kaufman introduced Moses to Walter Hopps, who had just opened the Ferus Gallery. Walter put Moses into the first group show at Ferus in 1957, and then offered Moses a solo show at Ferus, comprised of the work that was also to be in Moses\u2019 graduate show at UCLA. This created some small controversy with the faculty, who felt like Moses had crossed some sort of line by showing his work off campus at a commercial gallery. This early recognition led Moses to this group of artists who would become life-long friends and form the core of the emergent contemporary art scene in Los Angles known as The Ferus Gang.\nIn its nine year lifetime, Ferus held important exhibitions for major east coast art stars as well, namely Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Donald Judd and Frank Stella. Andy Warhol had his first solo show at Ferus in 1962, exhibiting the famous Campbell\u2019s soup cans for the first time. Then there were others on the scene like John Baldessari, Dennis Hopper, Frank Gehry, Joe Goode, Tony Berlant, and feminists artists like Vija Celmins.\nKienholz ran the store during the day and used it as a studio. According to Peter Goulds, Founding Director of LA Louver in his work Kienhholz Before LACMA, Hopps was an autodidact intellectual, very much into art history and had connections with Cubist and Dadaist Marcel Duchamp, contemporary collecting interests and the Arensberg Family Collection, and with the emerging young Los Angeles collectors of that era.\nAfter Hopps and Kienholz parted ways, Ferus Gallery was in the red and changed hands to Irving Blum, who was a smooth personality and groomed Ferus and the LA art scene until the gallery got out of the red. Blum took the gallery from a loose knit group of beatniks and molded them into a competitive and brilliant group of artists that brought about the commercialization of the LA art scene. History says there was much lost and much gained in that process. Blum ran the gallery until its closure in 1966.\nWhat Ed did, his unique path, was very different. He was very iconoclastic, as they all were, but early on he explored mark making to an intense and unusual degree,\u201d said Turner. \u201cIf you look at his early graphite drawings in the sixties, made at a time when pop art imagery, primary color, large bold eye-catching works were taking hold, you see that Moses was headed in a very different direction.\nHe was doing these works on paper with graphite, not using huge amounts of color. But they were remarkable. You can feel the intense pressure of the graphite onto, and into the paper, almost like he was trying to push through to the other side! There is one very well-known series of huge graphite drawings of dense rose patterns, inspired by a tablecloth that he and his wife, Avilda, found when they were in Tijuana. That pattern interested him. You get this sense of curiosity from these pieces, a sense that he was asking, how far could you push that idea and find something that was magical by doing something to an unusual degree, very intensely and with a laser focus.\nA lot of that early work of his seems counterintuitive to that macho bluster that the Ferus Gang had. You had these very intense, very intricate, delicate, monochromatic works on paper that were in some instances somewhat intimate in scale. You can see when you look at the arc of Moses' career, he was really exploring, and pushing through from the familiar to get to another dimension with the material. That became a hallmark of his work throughout the rest of his career \u2013 pushing the possibilities of his materials.\nThe Ferus Gang\n  Ed Moses Foghorn #10 2017\nFerus Gallery 1962", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy big hope with the film is to uncover the true story of Ed Moses and his art and that of the Ferus Gallery. There is also a love story behind Moses, his art and life. The process of unearthing the footage and further interviewing will bring to screen those moments.\n\nOne of the big challenges of this project is a significant portion of the footage is already shot (e.g. prior artists interviews). It is a matter of cataloging and finding out what the footage was shot on. Then we will need to convert the footage to 4K for broadcast. That is a significant portion of the budget.\n\nThen the next challenge will be to further interview other people who knew Ed Moses to continue the story line. \n\nWe have contacts within the art community to help create the secondary necessary footage to make this project happen. \n\nWe also have access to the original footage of Ed Moses in talks with gallery owners and other artists. \n\nWe also have access to Ed Moses' art.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Ruptured Media Films\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nKriss Perras is a screenwriter and director.

Well, you may now say hello to the world\u2019s first ever 3-arc electric lighter, and it is rechargeable too.  \n      Brush That Comes With Lighter\n      All available colors Blue, Silver, Gold, Black, Anodized\n      Brush and charger\n    Matchboxes and sticks have been replaced by lighters a while ago because someone was looking out for our pockets and safety while making flames. Now, it is time to perfect the lighter story, and in a bid to do this we came up with our own unique idea to get anyone who still has a \u201clighter budget\u201d to discard it already. The finished prototype of the electric 3-arc lighter is a functional and beautiful piece of hardware.  \n JUST HOW AWESOME IS THE 3-ARC LIGHTER?  \nLifetime investment:  \nA lighter as a lifetime investment is probably unheard of, but the bold 3-arc lighter can only be defined in those terms. The rechargeable feature of the lighter means users can now actually use one lighter for years. Of course, if you want to, but if you do some arithmetic you\u2019ll see just how much you\u2019d be saving if you didn\u2019t buy any of those unreliable lighters monthly.\nSAFETY:  \nMost people do not know this, but unless you are looking to burn something up, you only need flames not fire. The 3-arc lighter is electricity driven and works in a process that involves electricity jumping between set 3 electrodes and producing a dazzling electric arc because the air between both sets of electrodes has now become ionized.  \n This arc is simply beautiful flames forged from electricity, different from the wild fire other basic lighters produce. The 3 arcs of gentle flames are as safer than the uncontrolled flames we have become accustomed to. You can hardly go wrong from pushing a button to start a lighter than scratching on matchboxes.  \nDURABILITY:  \nAll materials featured in the design of the lighter are authentic and newly refined including the prominent zinc alloy.  \nFUNCTIONALITY:  \nAll the most awesome gadgets these days are one touch. The electronic 3-arc lighter matches up in this one touch functionality; it takes just a gentle push of the only button on the device to trigger the lighter and reveal it\u2019s 3 gentle arcs of flame.  \nThe charging system is as simple as can be too, just place the lighter in its charging stand and plug to electricity and watch your investment charge back.  \nDESIGN:  \nThis is where all the ideas come together. The 3-arc lighter does not heat up, lighters that produce fire get hot in little time because the flames pour everywhere and the induction heats up the whole lighter.  \nThis is not only dangerous considering those lighters are highly flammable, it is also not fun to hold a heated lighter. However, the 3-arc lighter stays cool even throughout intense use because it is mere technology producing gentle flames. The cutely designed 3-arc lighter will put some spice to how you light your birthday cake candles or romantic dinner night candles.  \nRECHARGABLE:  \n Making a product that will serve people for pretty much decades was our goal, and in these modern times where electric power is everywhere, a rechargeable lighter cannot go wrong. In 1.5 to 2 hours, you can charge the 450mAh battery of the 3-arc electric lighter.  \nFEATURES:  \nELECTRIC POWERED \n 3-ARCS\n VARIETY OF COLORS\n 450MAH BATTERY\nCOVER IS ZINC ALLOY \nVERY AFFORDABLE PRICE \nUsability:\nThe 3-arc lighters are not just pretty, they can be used in a diversity of applications, for candles, paper, gas cooker, incense and more. Tilting the lighter to awkward degrees doesn\u2019t affect its functionality, so, if you are in a tight spot and you need to light it up, go ahead, it\u2019ll work. \n Waste: \n The only time any waste comes from the 3-arc lighter is if for some reason you must trash it. Otherwise, you do not have to worry about fumes or smoke from burning fuel. \n WHY WE NEED YOUR BACKING? \n The lighter industry is not where a lot of investors turn their attention towards. So, when we finalized the prototype 3-arc lighter, we were confident no one else has this product out there. So together, with your backing we can produce more of the prototype on a commercial scale and get the 3 arc-lighters to people who need them. \n With a little thinking, we figured it\u2019s best to let the people who might appreciate this product do the backing and join in the story.\n WHOLESALE INQUIRIES\n  If you are interested in carrying our product in your online shop, please send us an email to zenlighter1@gmail.com before the end of the campaign.  \nAPPRECIATION\nI would just like to take the time and say thank you to all the backers, and customers.

Rivera places the focus on relationships. After all, running a business involves many interactions and what will make or break it are the people. Both customers and partners. So, finding the right collaborators is key to building any business.\nAnother strong point is that the book is not written as a narrative or full of theory, but rather a very practical workbook with easy to follow steps and useful guides that range from assessing business capabilities to determining which strategic collaborators are right for you to tips for creating a Strategic Collaborator Management Manual.\nThis is a go-to book for any entrepreneur that is looking to create, build and grow a business by focusing on collaborative relationships.\u201d\n5.0 out of 5 stars\n\"Great resource for entrepreneurs\"\n By A. Martin on August 27, 2015 Format: Kindle Edition|\n\u201cEntrepreneurs advance by collaborating, but there are few guides on what strategies to follow. Rivera bases this guide on his years of experience to help entrepreneurs form lucrative relationships that benefit all involved. The practical steps are clear to guarantee viable outcomes. A must-have in the entrepreneur\u2019s library.\u201d\nDefinition of Collaborative Relationships\n \u201cCollaboration is when two or more persons/businesses with complementary resources, get together to share them to create greater efficiencies and help each other grow their business. Collaborations are generally for specific time periods and resources.\u201d\nWho is the Strategic Collaboration Educational Business Game designed for?\nThe target buyers/users of the game are:\n\u2022 Entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs seeking to learn about forming collaborative business relationships and how to maximize their benefits and minimize risks. \n\u2022 Business Development Organizations can use the game for training their staff and clients on the process of forming collaborative business relationships.\n\u2022 Employers promoting \"intrapreneurship\" at their company. \n\u2022 Parents who detect an entrepreneurial potential in their 16+ aged children.\nHow do you Play and Win?\n1.

Test and fine-tune the final game product, including instructions, artwork, game pieces, packaging, game delivery costs, etc..\n2. Establish a cost-effective game production and distribution system.\n3. Funds will be used to fulfill all game pre-orders on time.\nHow will I keep in touch with my backers during the campaign and after the game is released?  \nBackers can view weekly informative postings on project status. They can also share ideas on how they can best utilize and help promote collaborative relationships within their business and educational/training communities.\nMy background relevant to the Project.\n I was introduced to the business world when I was 12 years old and worked after school and during summers at my father\u2019s grocery store in Brooklyn, NY, until I graduated from New York University with my degree in Economics.\nMy business development-related experience since then, at the local, state, national, and international level, includes holding senior management positions at the U.S. Small Business Administration (New York District Director, SBA Regional Director for six-states based in Denver,CO; and Senior Advocate, Office of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy; National Director at the Minority Business Development Agency/U.S. Department of Commerce; and headed the Bureau for Latin America and the Caribbean at the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID). This position required U.S. Senate Confirmation.\nHave served as a consultant to investment banking firms, federal and local government agencies, telecommunications firms, and the World Bank.\nMost recently, I\u2019ve focused my services on helping small and medium size firms expand their operations by building collaborative business relationships. Last year, I published an e-Book, \u201cStrategic Collaboration Workbook for Entrepreneurs \u2026a How-To Guide for finding the Right Collaborators to help grow your business\u201d\nI realized recently, that another way of helping persons acquire the know-how on the power of collaborative business relationships was to utilize the principle of \u201cgame-learning\u201d. That\u2019s why I decided to develop Strategic Collaboration\u2026An Educational Business Game.\nThe initial feedback on the concept has been amazing. I am confident that with your timely support we will serve a good purpose by providing aspiring entrepreneurs with an important, and easy to use tool, that will help them quickly learn the basics of forming collaborative business-relationships.

It has greatly expanded the horizons of individuals who want to develop creative projects and start entrepreneurial ventures. Still, existing crowdfunding platforms, while being great avenues of empowerment, often work under rules that are too strict and which ultimately lead many crowdfunding project authors to fail in their campaigns, or to shy away from getting started in the first place.\nCrowdfunding\nWe believe it is time to create a \"before crowdfunding platform\" \u2013 that people can use while taking their first crowdfunding steps. \nWe noticed 3 interesting things\nA lot of startups get their first funding from friends and family\nFriend and family fund half of all \u201cself-financed entrepreneurs\u201d\nGetting funded by friends and family is expected to be used before using crowdfunding. Indeed, many investors invest in people before they invest in ideas or products. Since they don\u2019t know you, their first integrity check on you as a person is whether your friends and family believe in you strongly enough to give you seed money for your new idea. If they won\u2019t do it, they ask, why would strangers invest in you?\nThat\u2019s why we decided to create Friend Funding, where the chances of feeling shy or failing to crowdfund a project are very low. Through Friend Funding, we will help you in a funny, smart and witty way to fund your projects, starting with your circle of friends and family.\nFriend Funding think of crowdfunding Campaign as a \"\u00a9 digital piggy bank\", that your friends and family can contribute in a funnier and smoother experience.\nThe premise is simple. You reach out to your friends and family, and instead of just asking for a contribution, you ask for a contribution in a fun way, a way that makes the whole seem like a game.\nWe will also offer your friends and your project\u2019s fans badges whenever they contribute, while also offering you points as they support your project.\nBadge Friend-funding.com\nEvery month the top 3 most popular projects which have the most points will receive the Crowdfunding Package (Website creation, logo, advertising for a month, contibution to your Crowdfunding Campaign up to 1500\u20ac and much more...).\nTop 3 project\nFeaturing both a free and an affordable premium subscription for getting funding, crowdfunding project authors will find on our Friend Funding website a crowdfunding avenue that they can easily pursue and that they can successfully use, by understanding its simple rules and letting its structure work for them.\nPlus, Friend Funding\u2019s premium subscription offers a wealth of features that greatly enhance your chances of getting the funding that you need. It includes support from mentors, premium advice, social advertising, design support, brand name support, pitch validation and much more.\nSo this is it! With Friend Funding, you\u2019ll no longer need to feel pressured by all-or-nothing campaigns, or by a crowd of potential backers who knows nothing about you, and whose attention is being fought for by endless crowdfunding initiatives.\nAt Friend Funding, we are creating an even more fun and entertaining method for raising startup capital, a method that will help you reach out to the people most likely to support your campaign.\nYou\u2019ll have a flexible, rewarding, friends and family-based crowdfunding source that can actually work \u2013 just as you want it to.\nSince Friend Funding needs to operate from a technologically smart, safe, user-friendly and dynamic platform, we are seeking to raise 5.000,00 \u20ac to fund its full operational creation, by covering the following expenses:\nThese amounts are for a 3 month development schedule. Everything else is already paid for by the project creator using personal friend-funding.\n Accountancy work : 720,00 \u20ac\n Hosting :                 432,00 \u20ac\n Platform Design :    360,00 \u20ac\n Platform Coding and Development : 2.500,00 \u20ac\n(Project Team has already coded 30% of the work.

Imagine, then, that technician remotely logging in to your computer and fixing the issue for you at the push of a button.\nAt 'The Ready' we make that possible. We connect users with computer technicians over a secure cellphone connection. Using verbal instruction or a remote connection to the computer, technicians troubleshoot the issue together to solve the problem. It's like having a technician on call all the time. \nCreating an App for Technicians and Users\nThe Ready provides easy, at-home assistance with common issues like virus removal, backup assistance, computer optimization, and software configuration. It makes it easier for anyone who needs assistance to have it and anyone who is able to give assistance to give it. \nUnlike other apps, The Ready puts the technician at the center of the solution. By allowing qualified technicians the opportunity to provide tech support from anywhere, we're able to source and qualify many more technicians, with varying levels of expertise. \nFor users, the cost is significantly less than taking their device to a computer shop or having a technician physically visit their house to fix their issue. This lack of overhead allows more money to go directly to the technician. It gives them the opportunity to make money using the skills they already use everyday. \nEmbracing the Future  \nThis platform leverages the experience of seasoned IT technicians to help users anywhere, anytime. It puts them at the push of a button for users who need them. \nService when you want it, where you want it. In today's day, you can access just about anything you need with the push of a button. Car service. Groceries. Lawn care. Childcare. We're bringing this type of service to tech support by creating a quick, easy, secure way for users to connect to technicians.\nAs the number of consumer devices increases over time, so does the cost to maintain those devices. So does the need for a different solution. Get connected to the future of home-based technical support. \nHow it Works\nBoth the user and the tech have the app installed on their mobile device. The user initiates a \"ticket\" in the app, which notifies the right type of tech that there's a user who needs help. The ticket comes with a brief description of the issue. Techs can then accept the incoming call using the app if they are available and feel they can help the user. There is a reasonable per minute fee associated with the call.\nThe User Experience\nMillions of people need tech support everyday, but they don't know where to look, don't want to take their device somewhere and drop it off, or don't want to be routed through a call center. They probably wish they had a tech friend, right? Someone they could pick up and call who would be glad to help them through their issue. The Ready gives qualified technicians the ability to be that tech friend at the touch of a button.\nUsers will carry around the power of infinite technical knowledge in their pockets -- always an instant away from getting an answer or solution to almost any technical issue, simply and efficiently.\nAnd users can rate the techs, creating a user-based rating system visible to other users. \nThe Technician Experience\nAfter development is complete and The Ready officially launches, technicians can join and and earn extra money solving technical issues for everyday users. \nOff work early and want to make a few extra dollars? Turn on the app and be ready. Slow night or weekend? Turn on the app and be ready.\nTechs can work from anywhere there is an internet and phone connection for any length of time they choose.  \nThey'll use their knowledge and experience to build an online reputation through user reviews. \nThe Dream\nThe Ready team has worked diligently to get this app this far, but we need help. We thought there was no better way to raise money for a user-, in-home-based app than to crowdfund to those people who will use the app. Whether you're a technician or a potential user, it's clear to see the benefits of having on-hand tech support. Help us take it to the next step by helping us do the nitty-gritty, technical development. \nWe're at a good spot. We've worked through the model itself, the design and flow of the app, the preliminary legalities, and all that jazz. But we need to build out the app and give it legs to enter the market place. \nPending a positive kickstarter campaign, The Ready app will be available in the Google playstore for all android devices in the spring of 2017, with a projected iOS app launch date in late 2017. \nThank you for your support, please help and tell others.\nLet's get ready!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe preliminary stages of app creation are completed. Now we move to the development of the app. The goal of this kickstarter will cover the cost for interactive development of the Android app. From there, we'll launch it and pursue an iOS app.\n\nAs with any new product on the market, our most immediate challenge will be building awareness. We have a plan that includes building a databases of interested users and techs, gaining social media momentum, paid advertising, and a little guerrilla marketing. \n\nWe also intend to implement a referral-based system that will provide incentive for technicians to promote the app to people they know who frequently request their technical service/expertise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Justin Lee\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nAge: 34 Location: Indianapolis, IN Experience: I have been a technician for over 10 years My name is Justin Lee, married, father of 2...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project ends": "JUNE 17, 2016"}, {"Project launches": "MAY 18, 2016"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/557996309/the-ready-android-app-the-future-of-at-home-tech-s", "project_name": "'The Ready' Android App; The Future of At-Home Tech Support."}}, {"backer": "Michael Moriarty", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "My name is Roland Kpokou, I'm the founder of Mr tasty sauce.\n I have been working for over 12 years at Tesco serving and delivering great service for our customers and colleagues, however I had since my younger age a great passion for food and cooking specially hot and spicy food .\nI have been working on a 5 year journey to create the perfect hot chilli sauce Through research and also tips and recipe from the family, I have now arrived to a point where I strongly believe and can declare that im in possession of a great products.\nA hot chilli sauce called Mr Tasty Sauce.

Once I obtained my dream job, I realized how close first responders are to the community. A first responder is an employee of an emergency service who is likely to be among the first people to arrive at and assist at the scene of an emergency, such as an accident, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. First responders include police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and emergency medical technicians.\nI have been to many law enforcement funerals and emergency scenes involving fire department personnel, emergency medical responders and law enforcement. I have been approached by many citizens asking, how they can support their local first responders. I have been trying to find a way to bring together local community support and first responders.\nEarlier this year, I was talking with a good friend, who is a retired police officer and previous fire fighter. During our chat, that\u2019s when this business idea and the community support model began. I was excited to get this idea moving, as I knew this was a great way to bring together the community and first responders. My business plan is to establish a private gourmet coffee brand, Thin Blue Grind, in which coffee consumers could purchase fresh local coffee and 10% of the proceeds would go directly back to the first responder community through non-profit organizations. I want to be the Northern California\u2019s premier coffee supplier. All orders will be donated to the customer\u2019s local community where they reside. As I expand, I want to support the nation through a daily cup of coffee offering \u201cCoffee with a Cause.\u201d\nSince I\u2019ve also always enjoyed my daily cup of coffee before a hard day\u2019s work, I knew I had to build the perfect coffee blend. I roast green coffee beans at home and love the taste of the fresh roast. After doing extensive research and considering all financial aspects, I realized, I need to have my coffee bean roasted at a local commercial coffee roaster. Having my beans roasted close to home, will provide the same quality and freshness I want to offer. This will allow me to provide great quality coffee beans with unlimited distribution potential. This partnership will also allow me to expand and offer other coffee roast as the business grows. I am a firm believer in partnering with other local businesses where I can build close relationships.\nWe are close to launching an online store with local delivery and pickup. We will be selling our House Blend (The Lineup), French Roast (Night Shift) and Light Roast (The Recruit) to launch the business. We also will offer other coffee merchandise with our logo to support first responder awareness in the community. Kickstarter funds will be used to offset and reduce our start up business costs, which includes equipment, packaging, branding, and marketing. This will enable Thin Blue Grind to open our business and donate to local first responder organizations.\nI want the community to know purchasing coffee from the \"Thin Blue Grind\" will make a substantial impact to our community by doing the thing they do every day \"DRINKING COFFEE.\" Thank you and please support the Thin Blue Grind, Coffee with a Cause.   \n\nOur Roasts\n  -SECOND TIER FUNDING-\nWe are thinking BIG here!\nIf we reach our projected goal, we will shoot for the stars. Any money raised over the original goal will go towards bringing \"Thin Blue Grind\" on the road. We have a small family vintage camping trailer that would make a great mobile coffee business. We would build out something like the picture below. It needs some work to make it into a useable mobile business, but would easily be retrofitted. This would allow us to bring my love of coffee, family history, community support along with awareness of our first responders!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur risk is very minimal based on our ability to have freshly roasted product available next day after roasting for pick up or delivery.

But here comes the magical super, feel good bit..by making a pledge here today to back us, you will enable BODO to ensure that; A pair of quality manufactured donation sandals reaches the people who really do need them via our work with the Barefoot Foundation.\nBODO donation sandal - Adult\nBODO Donation Sandal Sole Adult\nDonation Sandal - Children's\nOkay- but how is a pair of BODO Sandals  going to help a person in need?\n\u2022 Preventing Illness In harsh terrain where feet are susceptible to injury, soil-transmitted infections and ground-borne parasites like hookworm can enter the body easily through cuts and wounds which may later lead to chronic sickness, pain, disfigurement, amputation, and eventually death. Effective preventative measures to help individuals withstand the threats of illness include having suitable footwear together with advice on foot hygiene.\n\n\u2022 Saving the Cost of Medical Bills In developing countries where medical resources are limited, costly, and oftentimes ineffective in curing diseases, for those on little means - medical treatment can financially cripple already-struggling individuals and families. Therefore, preventing illnesses that stem from wounds to the feet can hugely help in preventing needless expenses in the long run.\n\n\u2022 Allowing Access to Work/Education Shoes are often a prerequisite for being allowed into schools or places of work in many developing countries, thus having access to shoes will positively impact one\u2019s prospects in receiving education or securing work.\nBODO Footwear - Infographic\nDonation Sandal Infographic\nBODO Sandal - Light Blue, Ariel Image\n\nEVERY pair of BODO sandals sold will fund a second pair of sandals for someone in recognized need in (initially) South America and the Caribbean.\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nCrafted from recycled tyres\nHow it all began\nBODO Sandal - Construction Image\nBODO Sandal, 1st draft design, Pink\n  BODO Sandal - Concept\n\n\nWhile Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, was on a trip to see family in Trinidad and Tobago, the two-island nation where his parents were born and raised, he was told a story about his late uncle who used scrap tyres to make durable footwear, which helped prevent injuries in the Trinidadian oil fields during the 1960s. Peter, impressed by his uncle's brilliance and ingenuity, began thinking about this concept as a means of recycling the millions of discarded tyres the world over.\nFollowing his trip, two discussions led to the current BODO business model.\nDISCUSSION ONE The first talks focused on the short lifespan of footwear versus the warranty on vehicle tyre tread. Once warranties expire, the majority of the world\u2019s tyres lie in waste dumps. Yet the material from these tyres could be re-used and recycled to make other durable products. A question came to the fore: could footwear made of tyres offer more durability and provide a way of recycling this waste?\nDISCUSSION TWO The next set of talks addressed the inadequacy of footwear amongst people living in poverty and the impact this has on their lives, plus what solutions could be provided from recycled tyres to make comfortable and long-lasting footwear.    \nThe concept behind BODO sandals is not original. The world\u2019s poor and innovative have been making sandals from used tyres since vehicles and roads came into existence. Yet for Peter Lochan, founder of BODO, it seemed an amazing discovery.\nWhat we need\nBODO is inviting YOU, and the rest of the Kickstarter community to be a part of our campaign. The Kickstarter funding will enable BODO to kick-off its public launch by allowing us to do the following:\n1. Complete the manufacture our first run of BODO sandals - including creating and developing our product range (Our products are completed and waiting to be shipped over) \nBODO Sandals - Packed and ready to be shipped.\n2. Create sales and marketing campaigns for customer acquisition\n3. Targeted digital marketing in order to continue to raise awareness of our product within retail and fashion industries\n4. Grow our team by recruiting top quality staff to work alongside the current team.\nWhat have we been doing ?\nBODO, though a young company, is spirited in its endeavours to create a solid foundation for the company so it can thrust its success well into the future.\nIt has already triumphantly achieved vital milestones in forging distinct relationships with key suppliers and partners within its industry, and continues to tirelessly foster these close networks.\nNotable examples of its accomplishments include passing entry requirements and a board to become members of SATRA, an independent research and testing organisation.\nIt has technical facilities in the UK and China serving customers throughout the world. As well as testing products and components to European and international standards across a wide range of industry sectors, SATRA develops, manufactures and sells test equipment. SATRA is a Notified Body for various European directives including personal protection equipment (PPE), which is one of SATRA\u2019s largest sector operations.\nSATRA has its own chemicals analysis laboratory for testing restricted substances in accordance with European REACH, and US chemicals regulations for which it is CPSC-accredited. This was a very crucial step for BODO as its product testing is key to succeeding in its market. BODO will continue this work with SATRA and consider them invaluable to the development of BODO products.\nSatra - Infographic\nThe BODO Sandal - Infographic.2\n\nBODO Sandal - Red\nBODO Sandal - Red\nOur work with the Barefoot Foundation\nBODO has also been successful in negotiating a key contract with The Barefoot Foundation, based in Columbia, to distribute its donation sandals.\nThe Barefoot Foundation, aside from enabling BODO Footwear to distribute its donation sandals to those who need it most, will also open many doors for BODO Footwear in partner networks, and gives BODO an exclusive and accredited edge. It helps BODO move away from normal charity status, and allows their customers to embark on the BODO journey with them\nThe Barefoot Foundation\nWe have been busy...\nOne of the most crucial deals BODO has negotiated and secured is with the UK\u2019s leading footwear distributor, William Lamb Footwear, who have worked with some of the biggest, established footwear brands across the world and currently has a waiting list of customers. They will be involved in manufacturing the donation sandal.\n\nThe firm involvement of William Lamb Footwear speaks volumes about BODO\u2019s potential as a main contender in the market and is testament to BODO\u2019s professionalism, ethos and ability to create and maintain its relationships.\n\nThe sandal soles in BODO\u2019s collection are all made from recycled vehicle tyres, and are heavy on style and comfort.\nbodofootwear.com\nBODO's Key Achievements to Date\n1.

It is expected that the future trademarks will be successful, which will secure BODO\u2019s future even more.\nPatents and trademark applications are not simple processes, yet BODO Footwear has been well equipped with the knowledge of their industry, thus yielding excellent results.\nbodofootwear.com\nTargets\nBODO Footwear has established the following targets for year 1:\n\u2022 Sell 9,000 pairs of sandals in order to donate a further 9,000 pairs.\n\u2022 Successfully launch in the UK market.

BODO Footwear will work with retailers to maximise sales, and thus donations, rather than working to maximise margins. BODO\u2019s assumption is that as sales grow, low margins will become more profitable as unit production costs fall.\n\u2022 Vigorously promoting BODO Footwear and the work of its partner social projects, through marketing and social media.\nBODO Sandals - Female", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1 - Unable to obtain enough sales distribution or partners lose interest\n\nBODO is working daily to develop these relationships, and already has several interested partners. However, we recognise that distribution must grow in order to increase sales and show donation results. We will not stop at the first few interested parties, but will continue to seek out and approach new partners as we develop. Should the sale of BODO sandals become less interesting to certain partners, we will have a reserve of other partners ready to commit.\n\n2 - Donation organisations\n\nBODO has full commitment from our first donation organisation, Whisper Orphans, and continues to vet others who operate in countries where adequate footwear is in need. Should issues arise with the donation distribution or with any organisation, BODO would be able to act quickly to identify a new distributor.\n\n3 - Loss of manufacturer (due to quality, breach of contract, etc.)\n\nBODO has identified several possibilities for making both the commercial and the donation sandals. Our preferred manufacturer, based in China, has proven the best choice for quality and price. However, since we aspire to find facilities that reduce shipping costs and help local economies, we continue dialoguing with other manufacturers. With these alternative contingencies at hand, if the existing contract were compromised in any way, we would swiftly revert to our backup manufacturer and lose no time.\n\n4 - Quality of either sales or donation sandals not up to standard\n\nThe importance of quality has been addressed with our chosen manufacturer. We will conduct periodic quality control on both sandals in order to determine any issues that need adjustment. We would then quickly be able to address them either with the existing manufacturer, or with a new partner.\n\n5 - Intellectual property infringement\n\nThanks to our expertise in online intellectual property protection, we have implemented a robust online protection plan against potential hackers. As for the sandals themselves, we will continue to conduct periodic assessments of existing and upcoming competitors.\n\n6. Bad press (seen as copying, quality-related, any problems with associated partners)\n\nWe are very active on the Internet, as well as in target markets, and are constantly monitoring media related to our product and our partners. We have a team ready to react to any bad press and are developing a crisis communication plan as we move forward, which will be ready for launch and adapted periodically thereafter.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Peter Lochan\n2 created \u00b7 19 backed\nBODO (BuyOneDonateOne) is run by Peter Lochan.

I am a published author but over the past few years have felt that I want to publish a book with meaning and purpose. And so this project was born.\n In 1994 I started dating a great guy with a wonderful family. I met his Aunt Renee shortly after and she was very quiet and shy. Being developmentally disabled it was hard for me to relate to her at first Over the following years I would see Renee from time to time however she was sheltered and protected by her mother. In 2008 we sadly lost her mom and Renee\u2019s protected and secure world was thrown into turmoil. Being unemployed at the time I took the opportunity to try and help Renee through this time and also to get to know her better. The years have flown by and she is such a joy to be around. Society would consider her not normal but I always chuckle and think society has it backwards. She is more sure of herself and what she wants than I am. This project was actually her idea during one our many overnight outings she said \u201cI wish I could write one.\u201d (a book) And so this project begins.\nIn doing this project I battled with how to go about it. I wanted stories from many people dealing with a variety of disabilities but I wasn't sure how it would be received. I have been overwhelmed by the support and contributions.\nProject Funds Overview (Where will the money go?)\n   Marketing $280.00 - The Marketing funds will be used for promoting the book online and create a website to bring additional awareness.\n   Contributors Gift Book $350.00 -  For contributing and supporting this project we would like to gift each contributor to the book a copy.\n   Publishing Costs for 250 Black and White Books $870.00\nIt would not be possible for this project to happen without the support and guidance of a great many individuals including but not limited to: All the amazing writers, poets and artists who contributed, the Abilities Solution for all of their support and giving my Aunt a home all of these years, the SBTS team who volunteered countless hours going through submissions and every single person with a disability visible to the human eye or not who struggles to be understood and accepted.\nTHANK YOU EVERYONE!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are fortunate to have many submissions coming in.

It's a \"Clash-of-Clans\" type strategy game.\nWe studied more than 25 games of the same type and took the best parts of them and removing what wasn't so cool. So this game should have all the best parts without the frustration encountered sometimes in these kind of games. \n Here are a few of the features of the game: \nPlay without waiting! You won't have to purchase gems to be able to fight as many times as you want !\nCoop Mode : attack hard-to-beat bases with the help of other players and share the loots! Auto-detection of nearby devices to play with your friends !\nSix game modes: Solo and Multiplayer, but also Coop, Arena, Defend and Missions. You will never get bored with this game diversity ! \nTransformable robots : up to 8 heroes assemblies have to be found during Missions. Once you get all the right parts, you can add new transformable heroes to your army ! \nTrade or buy parts on the black market ! \nSteal other players' expansions ! You can win up to 5 subsidiary bases and get many more resources from these expansions! \nBrotherhood : send gifts and exchange resources or even help other members of your corporation ! \nCatch giant monsters when they attack your base and re-use them during your attacks. You can also collect DNA samples and create your own rare monster ! \nStrategy-based attacks : you can beat hard bases if you have a good attack strategy \nRPG elements : you can assign points at each new level! For example increase life points, agility, armour, or even attack range ! Each unit has its built-in characteristics (ground or air unit, melee or shooting, etc) but you can customize each unit as you like ! \nDestroying the headquarter : destroys all the other buildings as they are all linked to the main building. \nAuto Graphic Detection : The first time the game is launched, it automatically lowers graphic complexity according to processing power available so that each gaming experience is fluid no matter what device it's played on.\nBuildings\nGold and Uranium are the two main resources. You can gather and stock them in the appropriate buildings: \nEach building is upgradable : you start at level 1 and when you have enough gold, you can upgrade it . There will be a total of 16 buildings levels for each building\nHeroes\nEach hero will be transformable and upgradable..\nSnowPiercer\nBasilisk\nUnits\nHere are some samples of units. Each unit will be customizable\nthe units will be upgradable infinitely! but it will become harder and harder to upgrade to the next level.\nGiant monsters\nIn the game, you will have the opportunity to catch or to create giant monsters, and use them in battle ! Be careful, because training them is quite a challenge, so they sometimes go berserk and start attacking your own troops. But this is a skill and you can improve it at a point where it will never occur. You can equip them with armors, like a regular human to protect them from damages.\nGodzilla\nHelldog\nKing Kong\nDefense Turrets\nRocket-launcher (terre/air) Ground/air.\nMissiles (air only) Vertical.\nCanons balls can be destroyed by shooting them ! (zone damages).\nLaser (ground).\nLightning strike type that progresses from unit to unit until there is no more power.\nFreeze tower (zone : slow down the units).\nTower that changes the behaviour of one unit by making him attack his own side (only 1 available).\nTower that launch a subterranean wave that makes a group of units jump into the air then crash on the ground (does also damages to buildings nearby).\nTower that sends a ring of fire that damages everything on its path \nRadiating tower that affects only biologic creatures.\nBlack Market   \nA market will be available for the players and will give them useful objects to develop units. The more the building will be developped, the more it will have good items in store (DNAs, armors, speedup bonuses, etc.).\nItem examples :\nExperience points\nHero Experience points\n1 free update (rarely)\nBuilding time speedup\nNew hero part\nMonsters armories\nSalt, mercury and alchemix sulfur\nUranium/gold production speedups\nArmy creation cost rebate\nMonsters genetic code Shields (1 per day with monthly pack)\nRessources\nSelling & buying units   \n Each player will have the opportunity to sell units when they are not online, in exchange for ressources or even gems. This wil allow other players to attack bases otherwise unbeatable by buying stronger units.\nAlchemy laboratory\nAn alchemy laboratory will be available at the fifth level. The player will have the opportunity to gather sulfur, mercury of salt during his missions or buy some on the black market.

GPS, point of sale, maps, weather. Space-enabled data makes our modern life possible. Yet few people know the companies operating the satellites. Fewer still have access to the satellites themselves.\nWeebill wants to change that. \nWhy? Because we now stand on the cusp of a new era of space adventure. Advances in technology and changes in communication are rewriting the rules of the business. \nThe fundamental vision of Weebill is a simple one; we see a future where space becomes easily accessible, affordable and open to all.    \nWe want to spark this movement.\nWeebill\u2019s HyperQube satellite offers the most powerful CubeSat available on the market in an incredibly small 10cm\u00b3 chassis while being readily available to the public for the extraordinary price of $50 000AUD.\nAvailable to all, capable of limitless missions, the HyperQube will be the best orbiting platform for the surging space-enabled data market.* With a new space economy springing up, this unit will be able to conduct a greater variety of tasks than similarly sized, less powerful satellites. \nEarly motherboard prototypes of the HyperQube\nThe HyperQube encrypts incoming and outgoing data with the best in industry standards \u2013 AES-256bit, Serpent 256bit & TwoFish 256bit on all incoming and outgoing data with absolutely no interruption to operations.\nMost satellites have little to no encryption system in place, a worrying trend given the expected growth in orbitals and their applications. With HyperQube, your data will be scanned and encrypted through your browser, which is then sent to our master servers. From there, the data is compressed and encrypted further, making sure it's safe to send. It is then transferred to the ground-stations for transmission. The whole process is fast, easy and safe.\nFunding will allow further testing of shielding and on-board redundancies to ensure smooth operation in space.\nIn the heart of the HyperQube lies 6 Weebill Atom X1 motherboards working together as one, otherwise known as the X6. The Atom X1 is based of the 64bit ARM architecture and has been tested and proven for reliability and low-energy requirements. The X6 features 24-cores at 1.6GHz and 12GB of high-performance DDR3 RAM. That's up to 700GFLOPS of processing power available from a 10cm\u00b3 satellite. Something unheard of until now.\nThe heart of the HyperQube, the Weebill Atom X1 Mark II & III\nThe HyperQube will be powered by atomOS, our non-embedded Linux-based distribution built from the ground up. It provides a hardened operating system built for security, stability and speed. The OS will be released once the HyperQube has flown at least once. Regular security patches will be updated over the air, ensuring the HyperQube will always be the the most secure satellite out there.\nBackers will also receive a copy of the Weebill Ground Control application. Allowing you to check on the satellite's location and status, see the latest images, check on development updates and much more. \nWeebill ATOM X6 ARM CPU - 24 Cores @ 1.6GHz \n12GB DDR3 RAM\nAES - Serpent - TwoFish 256bit encryption on all communications \nNext-Generation S-Band communication systems \n1.2TB SSD \n2x 35mm 13MP 4K Cameras \n1U High Efficiency Solar Panels (28% Efficiency)\nLifetime in space (Without propulsion): 6-12 months. \nEarly prototype of the HyperQube running completely on its internal power.\nThe HyperQube is versatile machine, with an open-ended design that can support a variety of functions both in communication with the ground and autonomously. The CubeSat can be deployed for single purpose or mixed missions. For those who purchase the CubeSat, or obtain time on it as a perk, a HyperQube will allow you to:\nPerform complex calculations and see the results\nAccess the camera for photos and videos\nObtain data from sensors\nConduct scientific research\nSupport games in orbit\nDid we miss something? Send your idea to us and if we can do it, we will!\nAfter successful funding, the Weebill HyperQube will be available to the public from July 2017 on our website for $50 000AUD. \nCompanies are recognizing the wide application of space-enabled data, and consequently, the new commercial uses of space itself. Financial technology start-ups are nibbling into the transaction flows of legacy banks. They are matching lenders with borrowers, distributing pay via mobile phones, and flocking to niches existing banks are prevented from servicing. Weebill represents an early-to-market solution for a domain where regulated banks don't currently dominate. It has the ability to conduct transactions on a highly encrypted platform. As the nature of banking changes and splinters, Weebill will be positioned to service the flow of transactions including Bitcoin and digital currency Hyper Ledger.\nBut the business uses for the HyperQube aren't just limited to banking.  A few others are:\nShort and and medium term off-the-grid and secure data storage\nEncrypted communications\nEvent monitoring (Space weather and Earth weather)\nEarth Remote Sensing (Real-time magnetometer observations, real-time Geiger counter observations and more)\nThe Weebill Atom X1 Mark II\nCurrently, our demonstrator mission can be ready for the launch to Low Earth Orbit with spectrum access available by January 2017. The launch window is between February - July 2017. If Weebill raises the $AUD230,000 needed for the first launch, a powerful new tool will become a reality for the space-faring public. The HyperQube\u2019s applications are limited only by your imagination.\nMy name is Gavrilo \"Gav\" Koncar. I'm the founder of Weebill. I believe that the advances in computing that have revolutionised communication will soon redefine define space, opening up the frontier to individuals in a way unthinkable only a few years before. I believe space activity will soon be in everyone\u2019s hands. Weebill will make that possible. \nWeebill was founded in 2014 with the simple goal of placing an imaging telescope in space. After a few months had passed, we decided that the marketplace for imaging devices was already well-served. But in our design-phase we came upon something: inside the core of the telescope was one of the most powerful motherboards designed for space. Since then we have focused on perfecting the board and making it available on a mass scale, with one core belief; space needs to be open, secure and available to many. \nOur team includes Dr Jason Held as our principle adviser. Jason is a former US Army expert in military space missions. Jason's experience with the Hubble and International Space Station provides Weebill Space Systems with connections to other manufacturers and partners within the industry as well as direct contact to various government organisations.\nOur primary satellite engineer is Dusan Djordjevic, who holds a dual bachelors in Science and Engineering.\nSo, what's in the name? The smallest bird in Australia is the Weebill. It's an extremely nimble creature, fast and more than able to thrive alongside Australia's larger, louder species. Weebill Space Systems is also a native of Australia. We develop our technologies in the same spirit: small, nimble and incredibly effective. All our products are designed and created in Melbourne, Australia.\nMission Control is supplied by Saber Astronautics. The founders represent a wide array of backgrounds and capabilities, combining traditional space engineering, and military space operations. Their engineers helped develop the Hubble Space Telescope and International Space Station. Saber is based in Sydney and Denver.\nOur primary rocket launch contractors are AU Aerospace, who specialize in CubeSat launches. They're based in Adelaide.\nThe build of the satellite itself will be in-house here in Melbourne, Australia while extensive testing will occur at UNSW Space Research Facility in Canberra. This will be done multiple times to ensure a maximum chance of success. \nOf the funding sought, $AUD55,000 will be used for the production of the first HyperQube. The launch window (February 2016 - July 2017) is expected to cost $AUD50,000. There is an additional cost of $AUD75,000 for insurance of the launch and $AUD20,000 for mission control by Saber Astronautics. Regulatory changes in Australia may soon favor small satellite launches, which may possibly reduce costs, as well.\nThe same technological progress that has seen computers shrink from room-sized boxes, to desktop units and finally, to smart phones, is now changing space. The space age will finally be in everyone\u2019s reach. Help make Weebill\u2019s HypeQube a reality. Be a part of the future. \n*Subject to any applicable export control restrictions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is the risk radiation interferes with the HyperQube's computing functions. We will test the CubeSats circuitry in space-like conditions at UNSW Canberra before launch. The funding we are seeking will cover the laboratory testing cost needed for maximum assurance of space-readiness.\n\nIt's possible there will be communication problems with the HyperCube, which can lead to a loss of the high-speed communications systems. Our backup UHF system will be in place for this specific situation and can be used to diagnose and restart the communications in full speed.\n\nThe HyperQube could fail to function upon launch. If that happened, it would likely be possible to collect data which could help advance a follow-on mission. In the event that the rocket carrying the HyperQube fails, insurance could reimburse company for the cost - providing funding for a second attempt.\n\nPlease understand that space is extremely difficult and unpredictable in regards to satellites operating. In case our mission is cut short and you don't receive your time on the satellite, you will receive it on the next launch.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Weebill Space Systems\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nPioneering satellite technology with the most powerful, secure and adaptable CubeSats ever made.

The story follows Daniel Grey and the events behind the disappearance of his brother and friends. Remote addresses several key themes and important issues in our society, including missing persons, the dangers of social media, addiction, obsession, and the profound impact of deep personal loss. We have assembled a diverse, experienced, passionate team that is both eager and committed to this project.\nThis film is the first chapter in a much larger universe, The Red String Theory. This complex storyline was first conceived of in 2011 by Dakota R. Kuhlman. Dakota founded Exit Reality Entertainment in the summer of 2015, with the goal of bringing Remote and The Red String Theory to a wide audience. Exit Reality Entertainment is a young, dedicated, media production company with the goal of bringing entertaining, original media to film, the web, and print.\nWe are currently in the final stages of pre-production. We have the team, the cast, the screenplay, and the budget. Our team is ready and excited to make the jump to production.\nTHE MOVIE - SYNOPSIS\nRemote is a psychological thriller and independent film with underlying elements of comradery and humor. The story introduces the character Daniel Grey, who is compelled to perform his own investigation after the disappearance of his brother and friends. During this investigation, he discovers a series of disturbing, unsolved cases too similar to be coincidence. Daniel Grey receives a call from Charles Dawson, a realtor, who informs him there may be a link between one of his listings and the missing students. The film reveals the shocking and sometimes hilarious events that take place leading up to the disappearance of Daniel's brother and friends.\nABOUT OUR CAMPAIGN\nOur production budget for Remote is $25,000. By achieving this goal, we can move forward and begin production in early June.\nWe decided the best way to fund Remote is in two iterations: production and post production. We have chosen this approach so we can begin principal filming as soon as possible and to ensure an accurate, post-production budget.\nThis Kickstarter campaign only covers the production stage of this film. If the community likes our project, we hope to cover post-production costs later this year through a second, smaller campaign.\nWe have designed a solid production budget that cuts all possible costs without sacrificing production quality. The Exit Reality Entertainment team has opted-out of any payment for the film - we are not paying ourselves from this campaign. We have diligently polished and reduced our budget to it\u2019s lowest possible level. Our total production costs are approximately $17,000, excluding the cost of running this crowdfunding campaign. Ultimately, there are some costs we simply cannot cut.\nThis is our most ambitious project. However, we believe this story is worth telling and that we can deliver a great film - which is why we\u2019re asking for your help in the development of this film.\nBUDGET BREAKDOWN\nOur costs are broken down into nine major categories: equipment, essential personnel, location and legal, craft services, props and set design, hair and makeup, contingency, incentive costs, and crowdfunding fees.\nSome of our costs have been mitigated and delayed. Specifically, we are hiring three essential outside personnel who are willing to delay the bulk of their payment. While we still need to rent or purchase some equipment, we are borrowing what we can from within our network. We are even opting to build our own jib, rails, dolly, frame, slider and other rigs.\nWe have reduced other costs, such as hair, makeup, props, and set design to their bare minimum.\nWe believe we have a realistic, accurate, and frugal budget for this production, and are taking every opportunity to minimize costs, while also ensuring the quality of the film.\nMEET THE TEAM \nWe\u2019ve hand-picked a fantastic, talented team for this project. Our team is both committed and capable of producing a compelling film. We are all very grateful and excited to work on this project.

Over the next several years, we will release a series of films within the larger universe of The Red String Theory.\nThe Red String theory follows the interconnected storylines of several individuals and revolves around the concept of predetermined circumstances. As the characters develop, they all eventually discover they are not there by chance. In fact, they should not be there at all.\nThe Red String Theory follows three families through stories of hidden political agendas, power struggles, military conspiracy, global affairs, and the manipulation and control of human experience.\nEverything you\u2019ve done, everything you believe, is a result of the choices you\u2019ve made in the past. This is the undeniable truth. But is everything you believe a result of actions within your control? Is it possible that the choices you have made - the choices that have brought you down this path to where you are today - were designed and intentionally placed in front of you by an unseen person, one with a hidden agenda? What if every choice you\u2019ve made has been designed and orchestrated. Not predestined, but predetermined, calculated, implemented.\nAfter three generations of these families, three young individuals discover that their very existence is due to events that took place framed within this illusion of choice. As this discovery is made, a dark plot unfolds to transform the entire world that they know into something different.\nThe question remains: if every choice you ever made was predetermined, how can you stop the inevitable?\nOUR REWARDS\nWe thought about our incentives carefully.\nOur incentives are designed to be engaging, to provide additional insight into our characters and story, to give credit where credit is due, and to be unique, handcrafted, and personal. Our incentives also needed to provide value and involve you, our supporters, while also limiting the need to inflate our production budget - and consequently our total Kickstarter goal. We believe we have accomplished all of this.\nIn addition to our unique incentives, we are also including some traditional incentives, such as the digital and physical movie and soundtrack, along with movie memorabilia.\nOur favorites incentives include:\n$5: Special Thanks Credit in the Film! \n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Production Journal and Q&A\u2019s Access \n$25: Digital Download of Full Original Soundtrack by Phantom Noise *recommended* \n$50: Live Stream of Production, Pre-Release Digital Premiere, Custom Missing Person\u2019s Flyer \n$75: Memorabilia Package \n$125: Bizarre Skype Call from Mr. Vice, Personalized Thank You Video \n$175: Vinyl Figure Character Collectable \n$250: Your Missing Persons Poster in the Movie! \n$300: Incorporate an Easter Egg in the Film\nA full list of our incentives is also listed on the right sidebar of this page.\nWe hope you enjoy the incentive options. We put a lot of time and thought into them and would love to hear from you.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nTHANK YOU for reading about Remote and getting to know us and the scope of this project. This project, like anything worth doing, is difficult, but we are very excited to be a part of it. Remote and The Red String Theory are stories we want to share with the world.\nTo make this movie happen, we just need your support. Everything else in place.\nPlease help support this project by making a Kickstarter contribution on the right side of this page.\nWe can\u2019t do this without you. Thank you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS & CHALLENGES\n\nAs with any film production or entrepreneurial endeavor, there is an element of risk - both to the producers and the financiers. There will be challenges we must overcome, some which are expected (and that can be planned for), and others that may arise without notice.\n\nRisk to this project include: underestimating our budget, scheduling conflicts, breach of contract, film delays, conflicts within the team, copyright protection, successful distribution and audience reach, and of course, not achieving our Kickstarter goal.\n\nWe believe our budget is tuned to near perfection, and should sufficiently cover production, with post-production funding to come later. We\u2019ve done our best to factor in the cost of this Kickstarter campaign and all production costs while keeping a modest 10% contingency fund of our budget before factoring in crowdfunding costs.\n\nOther challenges will have to be solved if they arise, and will be mitigated by clear contracts, prudence, good team communication, and advanced planning.\n\nIn examining the risk to you, our supporters, there is the risk of non-delivery, delays in production, and delays in shipping. We believe we\u2019ve taken all possible steps to mitigate these risks.\n\nThis project will be completed.\n\nWe have a team extremely committed to this project, as can be seen in our Kickstarter video. To show our progress, we will post weekly video updates, announcements on our production journal, and social media updates.\n\nWe will monitor and allocate our funds closely to ensure they are spent only where needed and pre-allocated, and that spending is done so frugally. To ensure this, we are requiring approval from two of the following positions: Executive Producer, Operations Manager, and Finance Director.\n\nLastly, there is the risk that our incentives may be delayed. Unfortunately, this is a common issue on crowdfunding platforms. We are taking steps to ensure we meet our projected timeline by planning deadlines for incentive production, setting internal shipping deadlines, developing content-delivery systems, significantly overestimating our delivery dates, and delegating responsibilities.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Exit Reality Entertainment\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExit Reality Entertainment is a small, media production company, focusing on the creation of film and digital media.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "ANNOUNCEMENT: Our New Campaign", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWe'd like to thank you for backing our project here on Kickstarter.

Check out our web page and facebook.\nwww.headhonchogame.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Head-Honcho-Game-199029413449510/\nThe game\nAnyone who has ever worked will enjoy this game.  The object of the game is to purchase stock. The player with the most stock at the time is the boss and controls the game and makes all the decisions that arise during the game.  As the boss you decide peoples' fate, if they should be fired, fined, and any other decisions that need to be made. You manage strikes and negotiate what employees will get or not get. you\u2019re the boss! Be as easy or as tough as you want, but beware because the tables can turn with just a roll of the dice and you may have to answer to someone else!\nWhats in the box?\n1 Quad Fold Board\n8 Game Pawns\n2 Dice\n20 Write-Up Cards\n20 Achievement Cards\n20 Life Happens Cards\n20 Sick Day Cards\n20 Vacation Day Cards\nPlay Money ($1.00, $5.00, $10.00, $20.00, $50.00, $100.00)\n100 Shares of Stock (25 1 Share & 15 5 Share)\n1 Score Pad\nDirections & Quick Start Rules\nQuick Start Rules\nWe provided quick start rules so you can get right into playing the game. We know how frustrating it is to read through a bunch of rules before you can play a game.\nTime Card & Will\nEvery employee must fill out their will and indicate where they want their money and stock to go if you happen to pull the death card! You can leave it all to one player, split it or give it back to the company.  Don't worry if you die; in this game you will have the opportunity to rejoin the game and still can take it all!\nHuman Resources\nStart the game on this spot. You are not automatically hired. You must roll an odd number to get hired and start the game.\nRestroom & Cafeteria\nNo one can leave the game for drinks, snacks, bathroom, etc until someone lands on one of these spots. If you do, you must pay a fine for leaving your work area. \nTraining\nLand here and you can do a training session on anything you want for the boss. If the boss feels like you did a good job, you will be rewarded with a bonus. If not, you get nothing.\nConference Room\nWhen you land here you have the opportunity to meet with the boss and negotiate a pay increase, stock, vacation and sick time. Fight for all you can get!\nStrike\nWhen someone lands here all the players' team up and strike! Take this opportunity to negotiate for more pay, vacation & sick time and possibly more stock.\nLose Stock\nWhen landing here you could lose your position as the boss, or maybe even the game.\nWrite-Up, Achievement and Life Happens Cards\nDrawing on these cards can make or break you in this game. Many of these cards require decision making.  Don't worry, you will not be making them unless you\u2019re the boss.\nVacation Day & Sick Day cards\nEarn as many of these as you can, not having them will result in lost turns which means less opportunities to buy stock.\nExpansion Packs\nTo bring even more excitement to the game we will be developing expansion card packs. The current cards are generic in nature to most jobs. The expansion pack will replace the write-up, achievement and life happens cards. They will be job specific to bring more of a personal experience to the game when you get an expansion pack related to your current job. It would also be fun to try expansion packs for jobs you have never done. The current expansion packs we are working on are:\nEducation\nMedical\nPolice\nLaw\nInformation Technology\nConstruction\nWhat people are saying about this game.\nPLAY\n\nBelow is some comments people have made about the game.\nWhy back this game?\nIts Different: There is not another game out there like this. \nGreat Game Play: Everyone who play tested the game loved it.\nFlexible: Create your own house rules to make the game even more exciting.\nExpandable: With the expansion packs (soon to come) you can change the game to fit the profession you work in. This will make for even more exciting game play.\nWith your generous donation we can finish the printing of the money, stock, game cards, directions, quick start rules and score pads.

Sofia had a nostalgic style with flowing lines and simple aesthetics that drew me into her art. Take a look at this panel:\nExample Panel from Lilacs, art by Sofia Hagen\n The Story\nOn his way to work, Max bumps into a lady selling flowers and is given a bouquet of Lilacs that transport him to visions to impossible to believe. But they involve Max himself and the flower lady is confident in what the lilacs predict.\nIf you're a fan of stories about fate, attempts at changing your future, and making decisions that could affect you forever, then Lilacs is the comic for you. With a Twlight-zone twist, Lilacs might make you rethink about chance and circumstance.\nWhat's Done, What's to Come?\nThe comic book is complete.

Soon, people start to die and fingers point to him--it doesn't help the evidence continues to amass against Grant. He thinks the deaths may have something to do with a supernatural being that killed his parents years ago, but the local Police Chief has other theories. Grant recruits the help of a ghosthunter to investigate the suspected banshee while Grant figures out means to prove his innocence.\nThe Golden Door - Two boys, ages 14 and 9, have recently lost their mother and have difficulties finding comfort in their emotionally and occasionally physically abusive father. That same summer, they witness their father continuously painting a door golden-yellow in their house and soon, their curiosity overcomes them to find out what's behind the door.\nThe Horde Trilogy - After hearing the converted tornado siren and watching a mass exodus from the campground that has served as home for three months, Percy, Jack, Harry, Melody and Joann make a decision to move further into the state park to find solace from the undead. However, as they move deeper into the forest, a discovery awaits them that is more horrific than what is chasing them.  \nThe Three Novels to Choose From\nThe Team\nGregory M.

It\u2019s an offensively fun card game that rewards quick wits and dirty minds. Suitable for ages 17+, Quick And Dirty is easy to learn and a typical game takes between 10-30 minutes. Players can join and leave at any time and it supports a virtually unlimited amount of players with no slowdown in the game at all!\nIt\u2019s the perfect addition to liven up your next party, games night or pregame. Our game is even small enough to fit in your pocket or purse, so you can easily play it at a bar or take it travelling with you. We even made a waterproof plastic version that\u2019s perfect for the pool, beach, or spilling drinks on! So get some friends together, maybe some drinks too, open Quick And Dirty and let the good times roll\u2026\nA category card and a letter card get flipped over. First to say an answer starting with the letter that fits the category wins the round! Give the round winner the black card to keep score, then flip two new cards to do it all over again. The champion is whoever has the most black cards at the end of the game.\nQuick And Dirty is a social game, there are no strict right or wrong answers and part of the fun is justifying why your answer is correct. A typical game finishes once all the black cards have been played, but you can play for as long, or as little as you like. Because each round comprises both a category card and a letter card, our regular game deck gives you over 1000 unique round combinations to play through, meaning you can play for hours without the game repeating itself.\nWe encourage you to play the game however you like, but you can check out our suggested rules for social or competitive play on our website at: http://www.quickanddirtygames.com/rules \nWe came up with the idea over a year ago. Whenever we had friends over we liked to play games, but we ran into some common issues:\nsome people didn\u2019t know how to play \ngames would slow down with too many players \npeople became distracted\ngames took too long to finish \nnot enough social interaction\nNone of the games we played were quite perfect so we decided to make our own. The result was Quick And Dirty. \nThe original idea started on handwritten scraps of paper. Quick readability was important for a fair game, so we ended up deciding 4 sided cards worked best. We then experimented printing some of our categories onto cardboard at a local print shop, and it was starting to feel like a real game! By now we\u2019d received encouraging feedback from everyone who played and began to think about how we could turn it into an actual polished game.\nWe racked our brains to come up with about 250 potential categories between us, but found that not all of them worked well in the game. To be a good category it had to have a wide range of possible answers, be easily answered with a single word or short phrase, and most of all lead to funny responses! So out of our initial 250 potential categories, only about 1 in 10 would meet our criteria for a good category. We then reached out to writers and paid to have over 500 more potential categories made for us. After thoroughly evaluating all the potential categories and exhaustive playtesting, we came up with the best 42 categories you see in this deck!\nThe many stages of prototypes\nAfter settling on our categories, we then tested a series of different card designs to find which worked best. Everything from the logo shading on the card, to line widths and placement, to the font type used. We worked with printers to get professional prototypes made, including custom storage boxes, prepared graphical instruction cards, formalized the rules, and ended up with something beyond what we ever could have imagined at the start.\n\nThe last phase has been preparing to bring it to market, we had to set up a company, website, and film the Kickstarter video you see here today, as well as determine pricing, costs and the logistics of how we would fulfill a successful Kickstarter. All our hard work has finally come to this and we hope it brings you as much fun as we had creating it!\n\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ve worked with printers and designers over the last year to develop a production ready prototype. After playtesting many iterations and hundreds of categories, the game is now 100% complete and ready to go. In order to bring the game to market we need to commit to a sufficient size production run, which is why we need your help. If we achieve our Kickstarter funding target we can put the game into production and get copies into your hands within weeks of the campaign ending!\nOur cards will be professionally printed 3.5\u201dx3.5\u201d squares with their own custom compact tuck box. Our printers also specialize in Kickstarter fulfillment services and will be assisting us with shipping and fulfillment worldwide, which is how we are able to provide cheap postage to US customers and only a small additional fee for customers worldwide. EUROPEAN UNION CUSTOMERS NOTE: THERE WILL BE NO ADDITIONAL CUSTOMS/TAXES FOR YOU TO PAY ON DELIVERY. WE PAY THE VAT!

In the event of catastrophic issues with our primary printing company, we have an alternate supplier in place and will be able to fulfill orders with only minimal additional delays.\n\nA note for EU customers: in order to facilitate EU friendly shipping and deal with customs and VAT complications we need to use a third party mail forwarding service in Europe. This will add an extra step to the shipping process and may mean slightly delayed delivery for EU customers relative to other countries.\n\nAlso in the event both of us are killed, maimed, kidnapped or otherwise incapacitated we regretfully will not be able to fulfill our Kickstarter.

Battery life is a major problem now that smartphones and other devices are being used to do more and more. EZ SMART SHELF is an innovative solution that offers freedom and convenience with wireless charging technology embedded into our shelf surface. You can wirelessly charge any make, model or manufacturer\u2019s Qi compatible device by simply placing it on top of the EZ SMART SHELF surface. The rate of charge automatically reduces once the battery is full to prevent damage and to extend battery life. The wireless charging unit maintains a safe transfer of power with built-in high voltage and overheating detection. EZ SMART SHELF\u2019s embedded wireless charging technology is UL and FCC Standard Certified for international safety guidelines, and simply plugs into a standard 110 volt wall outlet. International outlets more than likely will require a plug adapter.\nPLAY\n\nEZ SMART SHELF -- A Simple, Safe and Smarter Way to Charge. Inductive charging allows the consumption of electricity to be minimal, providing a low cost, low maintenance surface solution for safe power transfer compared with the traditional cable-based contact method. Wireless charging helps mobile devices become more energy efficient and sustainable while reducing the number of disposable cables and batteries.\nHOW IT WORKS\nSimply place it on the ez Smart Shelf surface.\n1. Place your phone or other compatible electronic device onto the EZ Smart Shelf surface, ensure proper alignment and let the charging begin.\n2. The battery indicator of your device will change to charging status after a good connection is made.\nThe embedded wireless charger is compatible with the Qi universal standard for wireless charging of battery operated mobile devices. Many of today\u2019s cell phones come equipped with Qi compatibility. Older devices that do not have a Qi receiver built in can buy compatible Qi charging receivers to retrofit their phones compatibility. Receiver accessory types consist of a Built In Case, Apple Lightening Plug, Battery Cover, Flip Cover, Receiver Coil (external), Receiver Coil (internal), Universal Android Clip, Universal Dongle, iPhone 5/6 Clip.\nHow Qi Inductive Charging Works\nThe wireless power transfer occurs through electromagnetic induction. With inductive charging, electricity is transmitted wirelessly through the use of electromagnetic fields instead of traditional cables.\nThe principle is simple. The Qi enabled EZ SMART SHELF surface houses a transmitter coil that transfers energy to your phone through a receiver coil. The alternating current in the transmitter generates a magnetic field that resonates with the receiver and induces voltage powering the wireless charging technology.\nRemovable push-button battery operated light\nThe 60 lumens LED Light is powered by (3) AAA batteries (included!), and turns on/off with a simple downward push. The Night Light serves a useful purpose of illumination without leaving your bed. LED bulbs shine bright and are made to last for years. The LED light fits snug inside EZ Smart Shelf and is made for easy removal and reattachment when used as a reading light or flashlight.\nHolds a wide variety of beverages\nThe removable flush-mount recessed drink holder accepts a wide variety of beverages with molded in stand-offs on the bottom of the holder to help prevent condensation build-up and keep containers from sticking to the bottom. Remove the beverage holder to accommodate larger taper shaped cups, mugs, glasses, wine glasses and containers whose top dimensions are 3\" or more in diameter. Receptacles can be used to extend the Smart Shelf\u2019s storage capabilities by allowing personal items and larger items like eye glasses, remote controls, jewelry and various other items to be stored.\nOUR STORY\nIn short, our story is a simple one The President of Smart Shelf invented the product concept from a terrible experience that happened not once, but twice\u2026 With no nightstand in his modest sized room, he used to place his glass of water on the window sill with his phone plugged in on the floor. One night he reached for a glass of water to quench his thirst and accidentally spilled it on the floor, damaging his cell phone. That\u2019s when he decided to get a nightstand. The second time it happened, he reached for a glass of water in the middle of the night -- it spilled and damaged his cell phone along with the items and finish on his nightstand. Each incident was a costly disaster. Out of frustration and the need to correct the problem, an idea was born. Once shared with family and friends, we knew we had a novel idea.\nFor the past year and a half, we have been working with dozens of people perfecting the idea for the perfect solution. It was important to create something effortless to install, easy to use; environmentally friendly; and something convenient and reliable enough to securely keep a phone, and hold a drink in place. The journey has been long perfecting our product, but we wanted to make sure we did everything right. We applied for a patent early last year, and we put a lot of work into designing and building the first prototypes. We recently completed our pre-production runs and our EZ Smart Shelf is now ready for production.\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nWith your help, we can purchase the needed quantities of raw materials at volume prices and meet the minimum requirements needed to go into production.\nIf you would like to help us achieve our goal, please donate to this campaign.

Upon receiving most of the surveys back, we\u2019ll purchase our materials and commence production. Based on the manufacturer\u2019s estimates, this process should take about 45-60 days to complete dependent upon volume.\nManufacturing\nWe have great relationships with our manufacturing partners strategically located in metro-Detroit and Denver; both who have a proven ability to deliver. Having manufactures strategically located in both the midwest and western regions helps with shipping and delivery depending on the origins of the orders. To ensure that every shelf is created to standard and delivered on time, we will be maintaining constant and personal contact with the manufacturers during the entire production process. Once the production is completed, we will ship the products to our backers.\nAny pledge amount brings us closer to our goal of bringing our novel product to market.

After Flint changed its water source from treated Detroit Water and Sewerage Department water (which was sourced from Lake Huron as well as the Detroit River) to the Flint River (to which officials had failed to apply corrosion inhibitors), its drinking water had a series of problems that culminated with lead contamination, creating a serious public health danger. The corrosive Flint River water caused lead from aging pipes to leach into the water supply, causing extremely elevated levels of the heavy metal. In Flint, between 6,000 and 12,000 children have been exposed to drinking water with high levels of lead and they may experience a range of serious health problems.[1] The water change is also a possible cause of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in the county that has killed 10 people and affected another 77.

A partir d'une id\u00e9e simple Capata cr\u00e9e des produits utiles et design destin\u00e9s \u00e0 tous les nomades, les voyageurs ou encore les surfeurs.

At first, we thought and thought about details, colors and materials which can make the difference and be sure that it will be a make-able sleeping bag. Finally, after doing \u00ab monsters \u00bb we found the good compromise and we made about a lot of samples. We did tests into the wild and approve what we wanted in adequacy with ours values and ours desires : a well thought, design and technical sleeping bag. Our sleeping bag is unisex and made for all heights. \n__\n/X\\   CONCEPT  /X\\\nNous avons suivi un processus de d\u00e9veloppement s\u00e9rieux pour cr\u00e9er notre Lazysack\u2122. Au d\u00e9part, nous avons pens\u00e9 et repens\u00e9 les d\u00e9tails, les coloris et les mati\u00e8res afin de faire toute la diff\u00e9rence et \u00eatre s\u00fbrs de faire un sac de couchage r\u00e9alisable. Finalement, apr\u00e8s fabrication de prototypes \"maison\" nous avons trouv\u00e9 le bon compromis et avons fait des \u00e9chantillons. Nous avons \u00e9galement fait des tests grandeur nature et d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de ce que nous voulions en ad\u00e9quation avec nos valeurs et nos envies : un sac de couchage bien pens\u00e9, design et technique. Notre sac de couchage est unisexe et est cr\u00e9\u00e9 pour tout type de taille.\nConscious about ecological problems, we choose to produce Eco fabric, to respect the environment. Contrary to ours competitors of sleeping bags, we choose quality superior Premium 210T Polyester. Designed with Durable Water Repellent technology, our Lazysack\u2122 lets water slide on the surface to let the Lazysack\u2122dry. The filling of our Lazysack\u2122 is made of synthetical fiber which allows to be warm because we estimate that even ducks have the right to keep warm ( and keep theirs feathers !) . We called this 3D fiber\u00ab Xwarmfiber \u00bb, a technology which allows to keep the warmth into the Lazysack\u2122 using the best insulator in the market. The comfort temperature is 46 degrees Fahrenheit ; the limit temperature is 39 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature risk is 15 degrees Fahrenheit.  And to be sure you\u2019ll have the biggest comfort during your lazy trip, we added an anti cold flap. To finish we put the best quality zippers to guarantee the better durability of opening and closing possible. \n____\n/X\\   CARACTERISTIQUES  /X\\\nConscients des probl\u00e8mes \u00e9cologiques, nous avons choisi de fabriquer notre Lazysack\u2122 sous le label Eco Fabric, permettant ainsi de respecter l\u2019environnement. Contrairement \u00e0 nos concurrents, nous avons choisi le 210T Polyester Premium de qualit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure. Con\u00e7u avec la technologie DWR notre Lazysack\u2122 laisse l\u2019eau d\u00e9perler sur sa surface pour laisser le Lazysack\u2122 au sec. L\u2019int\u00e9rieur de notre Lazysack\u2122 est constitu\u00e9 de fibres synth\u00e9tiques qui permettent d\u2019avoir bien chaud car nous estimons que m\u00eame les canards ont le droit d\u2019avoir chaud ( et de garder leurs plumes! ). Nous avons appel\u00e9 cette fibre 3D \u00ab Xwarmfiber \u00bb, une technologie qui permet de conserver la chaleur \u00e0 l\u2019int\u00e9rieur du Lazysack\u2122 en utilisant le meilleur isolant existant sur le march\u00e9. La temp\u00e9rature de confort se situe \u00e0 9 degr\u00e9s ; la temp\u00e9rature limite se situe quant \u00e0 elle \u00e0 4 degr\u00e9s et enfin la temp\u00e9rature de risque est \u00e0 -9 degr\u00e9s. Et pour encore plus de chaleur, nous ajoutons un rabat anti-froid afin d\u2019assurer au maximum \u00e0 l\u2019utilisateur un confort absolu. Pour finir nous mettons les meilleurs zips afin de garantir la meilleure long\u00e9vit\u00e9 possible des ouvertures et fermetures.\n                 Our goal is to make our project of Lazysack\u2122, real. It means that we want to offer you the best design and qualitative product. We want you to enjoy a new way to explore the wild with our Lazysack\u2122. If we succeed, you\u2019ll help us to offer new colors and carry on the Capata project.\nStretch goals :\nOur first stretch goal is 15 000 \u20ac to be the campaign a success. In this case, you\u2019ll have the choice between the Royal Blue Lazysack\u2122 or the Black Marble. if we reach 25 000 \u20ac we\u2019ll make a new color : the Tomato Red.

We've tested this backpack so extensively that we're offering a 10 year warranty on the bag. It's built to last. Period.\n3) Pure Functionality.

By offering our jackets directly to you, we're able to remove the distributor and retailer and offer you a Backpack that would usually retail for $300+ at only $159.\nCrafting quality dry goods has been more than a passion for us; it has become a lifestyle. Being design enthusiast, we began making beautiful quality denim in 2010. Since then, we've designed and produced shirts, hats and bags, with the focus being on aesthetics and durability. It's our mission to eliminate over priced fast fashion, and bring back quality dry goods at a reasonable price.

Unlike most other bags on the market, the 365 hat can sustain the sun, snow, and any weather in between. \nUsing Ballistic Nylon and full grain leather, we were able to give the S+A bag a tough exterior without sacrificing aesthetics.Ballistic nylon is a thick, tough, synthetic nylon fabric used for a variety of applications. Ballistic nylon was originally developed by the DuPont corporation as a material for flak jackets to be worn by World War II airmen. The nylon is ideal for extreme weather conditions and heavy usage.\nThe quality of hardware on any item is crucial to its lifespan. We cut no corners in ensuring that our zippers would last. Everything from the zipper puller to the tape width have been tested to sustain heavy usage.\nWe used TSS to enforce all seams from ever falling apart. The sewing machine sews the first stitch, then it sews over that same stitch twice more before moving on to the second stitch. On the second stitch, it sews three times, then moves on to the third stitch.\nFunctionality\nBad weather can hit us anytime, and protecting our electronics can be a mission.

We strongly believe that it is our responsibility to give back to our community in order to create something larger than ourselves. ---As fuel costs rise and people become more aware of the environmental impact involved with car use, bicycle riding has become a more common form of transportation, even on busy streets and highways. Because few cities have designated bike paths or lanes, cyclists must share the road with both small and large motor vehicles; sometimes those vehicles do not pay proper attention to bike riders and engage in unsafe driving habits. Compared to a car or truck driver, bikers have little to no protection if they are involved in an accident. As a result, the injuries a cyclist incurs during a crash, even when wearing a helmet and protective gear, are often more severe than those sustained by motorists. Common bicycle accident injuries include road burn, fractured limbs, head and neck injuries, traumatic brain injuries, and even death. One-third of American workers commute 1-5 miles each way to the office, which is a short enough distance that the number of cyclists may continue to increase. Commuting to work by bike has increased 60 percent in the last decade.\n\nHelp us make save lives and #BeBrighter by supporting our KickStarter campaign!

If you are here, you may have a love for great grandma Gloria's mahogany coffee table and a fierce hatred for condensation. Maybe your constant ceramic coffee cup companion calls for a custom coaster. Perhaps, your affection for fine furniture frustrates you for lack of matching accessories. Whatever your need, we assume you are here to solve a problem and we have just the solution for you!\nEverybody needs a coaster!\nWant to add a handsome accessory to your drink-ware? Looking to protect your heirloom furniture? Want a personalized piece of art in your dining room? Our simple, elegant, and customizable coasters crafted from verified sustainable or reclaimed hardwoods will be an eye-catching addition to your table or bar.\nThese hardwood coasters are available in 3 shapes and 4 wood varieties, each measuring 4\" across and 1/4\" thick. Choose from circle, rounded square, and curved square (see image below for exact shapes). Finished with multiple coats of acrylic lacquer for a great shine, long life, and water resistance.\nAbout Our Wood\nOne of the core principles at our woodshop has always been to use reclaimed, salvaged, and sustainable wood sources. The Walnut, Maple, and Cherry woods used in our coasters are harvested as part of Appalachian Hardwood Verified Sustainable program. Click on the image below to find out more!\nThe \"Blue Pine\" wood that is used for our coasters is actually from a tree called the Lodgepole Pine. These trees have been killed by beetles carrying a fungus that changes the color of the wood. These trees are removed from the forest floor and milled into lumber to prevent risk of injury and forest fires. To learn more about the Pine Beetle Epidemic, head over to National Geographic.\nCoaster Wood Choices\nCoaster Shape Choices\nWe are currently offering 3 basic shapes for our coasters. We may add a few more options as stretch goals, but the 3 starter shapes are below:\nMonogram Options\nFor the custom engraved coaster rewards, a monogram is included. Monograms come in two varieties. A single letter monogram usually represents a family name. A 3 letter monogram can represent a person's initials or two individuals' first name initials and their last name initial in the middle. You can select from one of the 3 styles below for your monogram:\nRewards\nAdd-ons\nIn addition to a coaster reward, you can add on the following items by increasing your pledge the appropriate amount:\n$5 - Whidden's Woodshop Tote Bag\n$8 - Resuable Alder Wood Thank You Card\n$10 Reward: Alder Wood Thank You Card\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWhidden's Woodshop is currently our young family's primary income.

There is nothing worse than trying to charge your phone at one outlet, but realizing that the nearest flat surface, or where you were planning to store your phone, is on the other side of the room! This is never a problem with our strong cable.\n\u25cf Tangles = Breakage For those of us who have used charging cables, we know that tangles aren\u2019t only unsightly, but a tangle left to its own devices can cause breakage along the length or end of the cable. Eventually, it causes the cable to rip or break altogether. Not only does our unique cover protect the cable from breakage, but it also prevents tangles outright with a nylon fabric casing.\n\u25cf Cheaply Made Products Don\u2019t Last Sure, you could buy a dollar-store charging cable as a last resort, but how long will that last? Cheaply made charging cables are notorious for breaking, not holding the charge, or even completely falling out of the device mid-charge. Why risk your expensive device with a cable that could possible break your phone? Our product contains quality materials produced by careful craftsmanship by a small, independent company. \nImpact:  The Strong Cable features incredible innovation, and vastly improves upon the average charging cable. We have built solid relationships with our suppliers, and we have already thoroughly vetted their supplies and our resulting products. We have a strong foundation for this product, but we need your support to help us get there! \nWhat We Need & What You Get: We are seeking the support of the community to help us meet our 400 item MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity). By donating to our campaign, you are helping us reach our goals and push towards wide distribution of our product, marketing the Strong Cable, and much more. \nAdditional funding will be used towards the costs related to rewards, furthering our campaign and more! To thank our generous backers, we are offering numerous exciting rewards at a variety of donation levels. Please view the rewards on the right-hand side of the page and select the reward that works for you!\nOther Ways You Can Help: If you can\u2019t make a donation at this time, there are still other ways you can help us reach our goals! Please take a moment to share our campaign with your friends and family via social media, email, and word of mouth. With your support, we can reach our funding goals and meet our minimum order quantity requirements!\niPhone 6s, 6, 5s, 5c, 5\niPad Air 2, Air, Mini\niPod Nano 7\niPod Touch 5\nAndroid Devices (Micro USB)\nWindows Phones (Micro USB)\nThis timeline provides us with an adequate amount to deliver the Strong Cable. We do not foresee any potential delays and have done our best to smooth out any kinks in our process. If any further delays are expected our backers will be notified immediately! \nThe Strong Cable will be sent to Apple to receive MFI certification. This will allow us to use the \"Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad\" logo on our product. MFI certified accessories use certified Apple connectors purchased directly from Apple. This means that you will receive a higher quality product. We have built solid relationships with our suppliers who have experience producing MFI certified products.
