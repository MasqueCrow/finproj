Since then, we have been hand-crafting unique designs for all your tabletop games using the highest quality hardwoods from our local suppliers. During this time, we have grown substantially from a one-man crew to a three-person team. With this Kickstarter we are hoping to expand our team further by hiring more craftsmen, as well as expand our community by attending future conventions! (Once it it safe to do so, of course!)\nWe are excited to launch our new Council of 11 Dice Vaults with 14 different carefully curated sets of precious gemstone and glass dice. Each set comes with a standard 7 piece set of polyhedral dice, an additional D20, and three additional D6s to support any of your gaming needs. In addition, we have partnered with 3 of our favorite artists, 88riddles, Cait Greer, and Xerjester to provide you with many customization options to help beautify your new vault AND support excellent artists.\nWhen first discussing this Kickstarter, we were overwhelmed by the number of gemstone dice options available to choose from. Thankfully, we have a very nerdy, very eager friend group who were more than happy to lend us their expertise to pare down the options. Together we decided on the 14 gorgeous sets of gemstone and glass dice that we are now offering! If you act fast, the first day of launch we are offering an 'early bird' special, where our dice sets will only be $90 each! After which they will be at their regular pricing of $100 per set. \n For this Kickstarter, we are introducing the Council of 11 Dice Vault! Iterating on the design of our widely popular Council of 7 Dice Vaults, each vault features 11 individual felt-lined hexagonal slots, ensuring the safety of your 11 piece dice sets whether on display or at the gaming table! We've selected 18 beautiful hardwoods, both domestic and exotic, to ensure a wood for every aesthetic and budget. \nRaised Prismatic Glass\nPrismatic Glass\nAfrican Bloodstone\nRaised Obsidian with Colored Numbers\nRaised Obsidian\nOpalite\nRaised Green Glass\nRose Quartz\nRaised Garnet\nLapis\nDeep Purple Cats Eye\nRed Tigers Eye\nBlue Cats Eye\nGreen Flourite\nTier \"A\" Dice Vaults ($35)\n Tier \"A\" Dice Vaults are our most affordable tier featuring the classic domestic hardwoods Cherry, Red Oak, Maple, and White Oak.

All the D6's feature the T&C logo in place of the 6.\nWhy does my order look different than the photos?\nWorking with natural materials, there will be variation in all vaults and dice.

Dice by Wyrmwood brought the leader in bespoke tabletop gaming to the world of high-end dice: more than 11,000 backers pledged over $1,500,000 for beautiful dice crafted from gemstone, glass, and more. A few months earlier, Dispel Dice arrived onto the scene with their own campaign, and more than 20,000 backers pledged well over $2,000,000 to make it an incredible success for this first-time creator, launching their brand of sharp-edged, luxury resin dice with inclusions. Now, both brands are ready to take the dice community by storm once again... together.\n\nBrand new, exclusive designs from Dispel Dice, available as sets of seven or, for the first time, as single D20s and sets of 3D6, join new gemstone and glass offerings (along with some returning favorites) from Wyrmwood. But don't worry, we've BOTH got some surprises in store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLAY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese three very special pieces combine classic Wyrmwood designs with artwork from Dispel Dice, inlaid in holographic flake, a Dispel favorite, to truly capture the spirit of our collaboration on this project.\nDispel Dice draws inspiration from space and celestial bodies, and this design, inlaid into a Macassar Ebony Dice Vault, is a tribute to that fascination with the heavens.\n\nMeanwhile, Wyrmwood has always drawn inspiration from the foliage of earth, particularly evident in our \u201cGaia Collection\u201d entries. This piece draws from that tradition to stunning effect, with holographic flake and brass inlay on a Macassar Ebony Dice Vault.\nThe first floral design Karen created was the \u201cShe Loves Me (Not?)\u201d set, and this design was crafted specifically to pair with it. The Macassar Ebony Tabletop Vault, paired with brass and holographic flake, will complement any fine set of dice beautifully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Dispel hit the scene in 2019, they hit the ground running with some truly unique designs - but Karen (Founder of Dispel) had some special designs she wasn't sure could be produced... but now that her first campaign has allowed her to establish her own production, they have finally mastered the process of suspending some very special inclusions - real flowers!\n\nThe designs Nightbloom, Dewdrop, and She Loves Me (Not?) feature real flowers preserved in resin. From roses to forget me nots, these designs are for someone who's looking for something a bit more in their set of dice.\n\nTo commemorate these new floral colorways, Dispel's team has designed the Lunar, Rose, and Forget Me Not Vaults. These vaults represent a true marriage between the brands; Wyrmwood vaults inlaid with brass and the very same holographic flake that is used in the Dispel Dice!\n\n\"I've been a fan of Wyrmwood since I've entered the hobby, so it is an absolute privilege to be able to put together a design that represents both of our work.\"  - Karen\n\n\n\nTwo of the biggest names in tabletop gaming, both standing for the highest quality, game-changing innovations, and outstanding service, coming together with new designs and materials you can't get anywhere else... this was already one for the books, but with your help, we're going to make it official: we're attempting a Guinness World Record.\n\nOriginally, the idea to break a world record came from Wyrmwood's first Dice Kickstarter - but never came together. With this campaign, Wyrmwood and Dispel will be organizing the most dice that ever been in a single sequence. How many dice will we be lining up? Well, that's up to all of you...\n\nWith the current record being north of 6,000 dice, we will be attempting to include one die for every backer we have. If we reach at least 7,000 backers we are officially on our way to breaking a world record. If that isn't enough, we will be sending each and every backer one of the dice used in breaking the record! Giving everyone a piece of the record that they made possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks for this project are relatively small, but some do exist. As we've seen in the past year, global supply chains can be disrupted in the event of certain extreme events, such as the global pandemic. Wyrmwood and Dispel Dice are not immune to these issues, though we are better positioned than most.\n\nDispel Dice controls all manufacturing of their dice end to end, as does Wyrmwood with our Dice Vaults and Tabletop Vaults. However, we both require some raw materials and equipment from outside suppliers. In addition, Wyrmwood is turning to a partner to manufacture stone and glass dice, and where there is a supplier, there is always a risk of complications or delays. However, our partner is highly proven and we have confidence in their capacity to meet the demand.\n\nWe have set our delivery dates with our current production and other plans for the year in mind, and are both highly confident in these dates being achievable. We've planned for success with this project, and much of the planning phase has concerned making sure we were ready to meet it, should the project prove very successful.\n\nWyrmwood has successfully completed fulfillment of tens of thousands of pledges across 12 campaigns over the past 8 years. While we have actively fulfilled campaigns, Dispel Dice has fulfilled tens of thousands of orders in their first campaign, and is aggressively shipping more daily, as is Wyrmwood with their active fulfillment. We are both fully committed to fulfilling each and every backer's pledge. Backers should have every confidence in receiving rewards of the highest quality, delivered in a timely fashion according to our estimates, and we will update backers regularly with how the project is going, both before fulfillment and during it, until it's complete.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Wave 5: Dice by Wyrmwood & Dispel", "descp": "Backers at this level should have their pledge items shipped out by the last day of April, 2022.\nPledge for as many sets and add-on items as you like.

The foes detailed in this supplement, ranging from capricious fey to corrupt fiends, can fit nicely into any 5e campaign where the players are looking for a devious and deadly challenge.\nSavage beasts, twisted aberrations, and unrelenting undead: the Monster Grimoire has covered all of your needs. The book also contains a variety of player-facing content to immerse them into a dark setting: terrible familiars, twisted sidekicks, and more!\nIn addition to monster lore and stats, each monster comes with something new and amazing: suggested salvage! Not only will monster entries suggest treasure for the creatures, they detail methods that characters might use to harvest monster parts to turn into equipment or magic items. Want to know what can be made with the fangs of a vanquished vampire? We\u2019ll tell you!\nPlayers expect the unexpected, so as a GM you should always have a surprise ready. The Monster Grimoire provides methods to add surprising changes to your current foes. Utilize monster templates like the fiend and the specter.\nNew monsters are great but using them appropriately can be tricky. This supplement provides in-depth advice and analysis on creating dark fantasy encounters within campaigns that terrify and delight your players, without overwhelming them.\nGrim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire will have 400 terrifying Monsters spread across 5 box sets, giving you 80 quality cards in each set. These will show a visual of the gruesome foe on one side, and all the stats, actions and information specific to each individual creature on the other. These Cards will provide you an excellent reference for each and every Monster in your encounters, right in the palm of your hands!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a discounted rate! All backers will have access to add-ons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which add-ons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for add-ons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey; however shipping will be approximately $3-$5 per add-on (depending on the physical size of each item).\nStretch goals are our way of giving back to the community as we succeed, however due to the scope of some stretch goals, not all can be free. Any stretch goals with the text 'ADD ON' next to it, require an additional price to purchase.\nAs a result from the incredible successes we have had running playtests in our previous campaigns, we are again inviting backers to join and contribute to this play testing period of Grim Hollow: The Monster Grimoire. Production of the book and all related content is well underway and play testing is the ultimate way to get a sneak peek into these mechanics, as well as help shape the final product into something great. We can't wait to show you all what we have in store!\nGhostfire Gaming does not use Kickstarter to charge shipping. Once the product dimensions and weights are confirmed, we send a survey email to all backers via a program called BackerKit, which collects shipping on all pledge tiers.\nThe following table has shipping estimates in USD for the Soldier of Fortune pledge tier only. It is based on the average cost for us to ship internationally a single hardcover book of similar dimensions and weight to The Monster Grimoire and is subject to change.\nThe remaining pledge tiers are not subject to the below costs. \nWe design and manufacture our products internationally, and will endeavour to and are always looking for ways to keep shipping costs as low as possible. \nSome of our products are not yet finished which means that as soon as the dimensions and weights are available the shipping costs for the higher pledge tiers will be entered into your BackerKit survey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is always a concern, so we have taken tangible mitigation steps to manage risk, particularly around fulfillment and manufacturing.\n\nOur top priority is to make an excellent gaming product that will make our brand, backers and community proud.

You can find shipping estimates below for your respective country. We have plans to distribute from the following locations: China (Asia Pacific backers), EU (European backers), UK (UK Backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers), and California (US and Rest of the World backers). This should allow us to be UK, EU, CA, AUS and NZ customs friendly.\nEU and UK backers, please note that in order for us to comply with the current tax laws that have changed or will change this year, we will be charging VAT in the pledge manger system. EU countries that are not part of the European Union will not be charge VAT. These are the best estimates that we currently have. The information will be final and clearly displayed in BackerKit before confirmation. In Canada, in place of VAT, we will be charging GST in BackerKit.\n\nShipping Restrictions\nAt this time, we are not able to ship to the following locations: Latin America*, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Syria, and Cuba. We hope to have a global trade release after the Kickstarter is fulfilled and we apologize for not being able to offer this Kickstarter to those countries. Due to the size of the packages, we cannot ship to P.O. boxes. *Mexico is excluded - we will be able to ship to Mexico.\n\nFor VAT details, click here.\nFor GST details, click here.\n\nWork in Progress\nThe images shown are work in progress (many are marked Final Design Pending) and the look of the items in this Kickstarter may differ from what was presented while the Kickstarter was active. We have marked the items that might change, however anything in the Kickstarter could differ from what was shown. We are however working hard to make sure that what you see is what you get.\n\nLocalization & Languages\nThe plan for Worldbook: Lawbrand post-Kickstarter is to ensure that you\u2019ll be able to find the sourcebook through wherever you currently purchase your tabletop RPG books. We\u2019re working to find the right publishing partner to make that happen in as many regions and languages as possible. For the Kickstarter, we will only be offering the Sourcebook and the materials in English.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our first Kickstarter, and while we are excited to have Auroboros on Kickstarter so that you can be part of the development, delivering goods this way is still new to us. We want this to be a fantastic experience for you and we are hoping to fulfill this Kickstarter as quickly as possible. That being said, there are some risks that are out of our control and could impact our desired delivery timing. These include: Shipping, Customs and Production delays\n\nBy far, the biggest concern for us are shipping delays, as called out above. The global supply chain is catching up from its shutdown last year. If things continue to go the way they have been, we estimate that shipping will be back to pre-2020 efficiencies by the time we are shipping.\n\nOur second biggest concern is customs delays. We have been working with experts on Kickstarter shipping and fulfilment and received up to the minute advice on this complex and ever-changing environment. Our goal is to make this as friendly and easy for you as possible. However, this is our first Kickstarter and dealing with recent and upcoming VAT changes is frankly, new to everyone. There is a world that we missed something and because of that, we experience a customs delay. If that becomes reality, please know that we will do everything in our power to resolve the issue to expedite clearing customs.\n\nThe estimated delivery date for Auroboros is Q1 2022.

The adventurers are trapped in a strange land - can they find their way home? And can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dendelion? Illustrated by Egil Thompson.\n From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread. These creatures are inspired by Eastern European folklore. By Artem Serebrennikov; illustarted by Sade.\n Fearsome Critters. Writer John Bupp takes a look at a handful of fearsome fey critters! The small, apelike agropelter hurls branches from nearby trees; the infamous jackalope can mimic any sound it hears; the short, pudgy puckwudgie can be helpful, but a terrible foe if slighted; and the six-legged campus cat can terrify its prey with its mere gaze. Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\n Beasts of the Feywild. More summer means more fey! This time we have a bunch of new fey beasts for your 5E game - from the Dreaming Tree to the Sylvan Spaniel, from the Moon Horse to the Flower Mouse, these creatures from writer Jason Reilly are sure to enhance your game sessions! Illustrated by Vanessa Bailey.\nWe knew you'd want a list of the monsters in this book. They range from CR 0 to CR 11.\n Agropelter (CR 1). 3-ft. villainous ape-ducks able to hurl tree branches.\n Dreaming Tree (CR 5). A fey tree which feasts on the dreams of those sleeping nearby.\n Flower Mouse (CR 0). A tiny fey creature sometimes used as a mount by flower fey and faeries.\n Golden Goat (CR 1/4).

A rabbit... with antlers, and a talent for mimicry.\n Mirage Butterfly (CR 1/8). Mounts of the flower fey with minor illusion powers.\n Moon Horse (CR 2). The preferred mount of the Summer Court, this horse appears to be made of ivory.\n Ochoduchi (CR 6). An 8-ft tall horned goat humanoid with razorsharp claws, based on a monster from Georgian folklore.\n Poludnitsa (CR 4). A capricious trickster which adopts different guises, based on a creature from Polish, Russian, and Slovak folklore.\n Puckwudgie (CR 1/2). A short, grey-skinned shapeshifter, capable of good or evil.\n Samovila (CR 9). A tall winged fey of drought and harvest with otherworldy features which holds great power in the faerie courts; based on a creature from Serbian and Bulgarian folklore.\n Swarm of Flower Mice (CR 1/4). Flower mice are not dangerous alone, but can swarm their enemies.\n Swarm of Mirage Butterflies (CR 1/2). A swarm of mirage butterflies can combine their illusion powers to greater effect.\n Sylvan Manx (CR 0). These cats come and go as they please.\n Sylven Spaniel (CR 1/4).

A fetid-smelling six-legged black cat with a frightening gaze.\nBut if you buy this book for anything, buy it for the sylvan spaniel. How cute is this?\nIn addtion to the 18 fey monsters, Adventure Into The Feywild is a 15-page adventure by Kiel Chenier included in Into the Feywild. In this adventure for 1st-5th level characters the adventurers are trapped in a strange land\u2014can they navigate the labyrinthine Hedgegrove, domain of Princess Daneliean Dandelion, and find their way home?\nWhen it was originally released for EN5ider's 100th issue back in 2016, the included adventure got some glowing reviews.\n\"If you are comfortable improvising and roleplaying, this is one of the best and easiest modules to run. The charts are amazing, hilarious and lead to some truly great moments. I needed very little prep time which was much appreciated. I think my players will remember this session fondly for a long time.\"\n\"The random tables alone are incredible.  The adventure is great, too, but I'll be re-using these tables!\"\n\"My party loved this adventure so, so much. It's fun and flexible and gives you lots of chances to let your players determine the direction of the story. In particular, if you're comfortable tweaking the storyline based on the random roll events, it can take you to some really strange and exciting places that can absolutely resonate with your players.\"\nLet's take a quick peek inside!\nThis is the 11th in this series of mini-quickstarters.

Take grenadier feats to make black powder explosives with alchemical powers like the web grenade, hallucinogen grenade, or the ooze grenade! It takes a lot of effort stuffing an ooze into a hand-size iron shell, but hurl that thing into the midst of a pack of enemies and out pops a gelatinous cube, hungry to dissolve the nearest living thing in acid.\nAnd of course it wouldn\u2019t be a guide to golems without a Golemist specialization for the Artificer, able to build and command constructs of all shape and sizes from a variety of different materials, new stats for golem mooks and bosses for the GM, and new rules for a highly customizable golem race that\u2019s fully compatible with the other golem race whose name I probably shouldn\u2019t say because it\u2019s product identity. Play as a golem with the improved carrying capacity of a heavy frame, the improved movement speed of a light frame, the swim speed of an aquatic design, or some extra cantrips from your built-in mana engine.\nAnd that\u2019s not all! Mutagenic infusions! Annihilation grenades! Walking castles! Details to come in updates along the way.\nReward Levels\nThe importance of $1 backers can never be overstated. Kickstarter promotes projects based on number of backers, not the amount of money pledged, so if you want to help the project succeed but can't spare much money, $1 pledged on the first day can mean as much as $50 pledged on the final day. The success of this project is something I ultimately measure in backer count rather than money raised, so pledging $1 is a good way to support the series as a whole even if you're not so interested in this specific book.\nAt the $5 Blueprint Ink level, you get a digital copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems. A family commitment by my formatter means that you should expect this reward three weeks after the campaign's end rather than the usual two.\nAt the $12 Golem Ink level, you will get a physical softback copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems in addition to a digital copy.\nAt the $25 Ink of the Maker level, you will get a signed softback copy of Bianca's Guide to Golems in addition to a digital copy. This comes with a signature, a hand drawn aspect symbol of the aspect represented by the book (hand drawn by a guy who commissions all of his illustrations, so think of this more like a second signature than art), and a Roman numeral indicating exactly which signing of the book you received. Once we reach 100, there will never be another signed and symbol'd copy of the book (if you track me down at like a convention or something - whenever we start having those again - I'll still sign it for you, but only the first 100 get the symbol). Don't worry if you've missed one, as signed copies of previous books in the series are available as add-ons - up to the first hundred.\nAt the $50 Basic Golem level, your character's name will be attached to a golem, infusion, or spell in the book. Should you choose a golem at this level, it will be a mid-tier generic construct, like the bishop or knight constructs of the Order of the Third Eye or the Plumbum constructs made by Bianca, not a unique character (for that, you want the Advanced Golem).\nAt the $100 Advanced Golem level, a boss based on your character will be added to the book, along with a digital and signed physical copy. The action-oriented bosses of Bianca's Guide to Golems each come with five cinematic actions, including one ultimate attack that can only be used after the other four, resulting in bosses that are simultaneously intimidating to players, who never know what they'll do next, and also less likely to actually TPK anyone, because they can't spam their best attack over and over. Each boss comes with a brief background and personality. Standard caveats apply: Characters submitted must be appropriate to a general audience, not include hate speech, and must fit in with the book's theme (it could be an Artificer, a construct, an abjuration or transmutation focused caster, an ooze, or anything else related to these concepts).\nAt the $250 Ultimate Golem level, the most powerful boss in the book will be based on your character. Designed in the same style and theme as the $100 reward, this boss will be the ultimate challenge in Bianca's Guide.\nAt the $500 Golem Series level, an entire series of 3-7 golems designed by your character will be added to the book. The majority of the golems are standard mooks, but one or two are powerful boss fights.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000 - Bianca's Golems. By default, the 'zine will ship with the five golems of the Order of the Third Eye from Petals and Thorns. At this level, Bianca's seven golem models will be added, from the tiny crab-like Cuprum model to the large, construction-specialized Plumbum model, to the gregarious and battle-ready Stannum model used for her companion Tin'kan. These golems will be available both as statblocks for use as NPCs (some as mooks, some as bosses) and as craftable options for the new Golemist Artificer specialization.\n$2,000 - The Walking City of the Mana Kings. This is a description of a ruined empire of artificers and wizards whose entire society relied on golems and constructs, dripping with plot hooks and locations full of magical materials to plunder, including, somewhere out there, the deactivated remains of their city-golem, a massive miles-wide foundation supported on four titanic legs that once walked across the plains with the capital city built atop.\n$3,500 - Magic Item Shops. Magic-Mart, that is, a magic item shop that stocks an unlimited inventory of all magic items with sticker prices, is terrible. A few quick and sloppy limitations on Magic-Mart can help, but not much. Sometimes Magic-Mart only stocks magic items of a certain rarity, or they have a Schroedinger's inventory containing every magic item up until you hit their gp limit when suddenly they have no magic items. None of these are as satisfying as a magic shop with a curated inventory of specific magic items, and at the $3,500 stretch goal, Bianca's Guide to Golems will come with a dozen-ish such magic shops, with descriptions of the shop, shopkeeper, and a pre-selected inventory for a specific theme and tier of the game.\nContact\nYou can get in touch with me by messages on Kickstarter, by sending an email to chamomilehasa@gmail.com, or at my Discord.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm usually able to deliver these 'zines within two weeks of the Kickstarter campaign's conclusion.

He shares his projects on Instagram and YouTube. And now the time has come to do the next step. Together with his wife Marina, they decided to create Miniature Terrain Making Vol. 1.\nThe book contains a wide range of easy & effective techniques to get your terrain ideas on the gaming table. As well as chapters about advanced modeling techniques to make highly realistic terrain and scenery. Of course the book also includes inspirational pictures and exclusive terrain projects.\nBy joining this Kickstarter you receive more than 20 pages with printable templates that boost your crafting to the next level.\nTechniques & Materials\nModel making materials like foam, different types of foliage, or balsa wood. This section explains how you can use specific tools and materials effectively to create stunning looking terrain for your collection.\nThe following example shows different ways how you can make walls of XPS-Foam.\nTerrain Tutorials\nA SiFi battlefield, dramatic rock formations, a grimdark forest, ancient pyramids, or deadly swamps: Of course the book offers a great variety of projects, including detailed process descriptions.\nThis terrain for example is mostly made of cardboard. The tutorial illustrates techniques to make scenery using materials you already have at home. You can even use the packaging of the book and get started.\nTemplates\nTo simplify the building process you get 20 pages with templates of items like walls, windows, paving, or doors. You can print them and craft complex shapes that make your models look cutting-edge. The templates can be used in various ways and can be combined with different building techniques like layering cardboard or engraving foam. (More templates will get unlocked by reaching more stretch goals)\nGuest Articles\nOur first guest in the book is Michael from the well-known YouTube channel Tabletop Workshop (TWS). He is also the author of the famous book `Tabletop Terrain From XPS Foam \u2013 Buildings\u00b4. Michael will share some of his most improved techniques and tips exclusively for you.\nInspiring Terrain Pictures\nAnd of course, the book provides inspiring projects that have been crafted with patience and passion.\nThe goal is to keep this Kickstarter simple. The more backers participate, the more content you will receive. That means: More pages, more templates, and more extras!\nAll books will be delivered with tracking and priority.\nPlease note as well: Your pledge on Kickstarter covers your reward and shipping fee. The country-specific VAT and other taxes or import fees collected by the local authorities are not included!\nWe are planning to ship your copy of the book by December  2021. We will keep you updated!  Stay safe and healthy!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith her professional traits as an experienced graphic designer and artist Marina will create a unique book. \n\nPhilipp is fascinated about making terrain models for more than 25 years now.

Steamforged Games retains the right to sell these in the pledge manager and on the Steamforged website, as well as during conventions and as part of special promotions.\nIt\u2019s time to journey to an uncharted land, because the Astera basecamp needs YOU.\nBecome a hunter of the Fifth Fleet to track down and slay the fearsome monsters roaming the New World. Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts!\nBattle massive monsters in a wild open world.\nWith two complete core sets, playable standalone or together, you can embark on quests in two distinct habitats teeming with native beasts. \nAs you gain more experience, the monsters get tougher. Every beast has three difficulty levels to challenge your skills. Successfully slay a 4-star monster, and you\u2019ll win your campaign!\nWant a one-shot monster fight without the tracking? \nArena quests let you hunt any monster, at any difficulty level, using any hunters, right away. Simply equip your hunters with the recommended loadout and dive headfirst into the fight!\nExplore the lush Ancient Forest...\n\n...the arid Wildspire Waste...\n...or combine sets to expand your world!\nPlay with any combination of hunters and hunt any combination of monsters during your campaign. Because hunters can make equipment from other sets, combining sets opens up a whole new world of weapons and armour for your hunters to craft.\nFind out how the core sets combine\n\n\nBecause hunters are defined by their weapons, every hunter is a different way to play. Where the great sword hunter trades movement for raw strength, commanding respect with its incredible stopping power, the dual blades hunter favours swift strikes and mobility \u2014 dashing in with a flurry of blows before dodging to safety.\nSome video game weapons come with extra special features, like the charge blade and insect glaive. To really squeeze the juice from that Divineapple in the board game, those hunters come with special rules.\nThe monsters you hunt will determine which loot you earn and what weapons you can craft to help on your next quest. So, you\u2019ll need to decide together where to follow the Scoutflies next. \nOnce you\u2019ve chosen a monster, track them through the lush Ancient Forest or arid Wildspire Waste using the choose-your-own-adventure quest book.\nImmerse yourself in the New World, gathering resources, avoiding health-sapping pitfalls, and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment.\nJust like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. The tracks you discover will determine what state you find the monster in, and which special attack is added to their deck.\nEnjoy the beauty of the landscape as you climb trees, scale cliffs, and explore caves for bonus resources \u2014 but don\u2019t get too distracted. Every quest has a time limit. As you hunt, you\u2019ll discard time cards, giving you less time to take down the beast when you eventually track it down...\nDiscover more about the Gathering Phase\nIt\u2019s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these! Every monster is a boss, and every boss is a unique challenge, with different ways of moving, different attack styles, and special rules that will trigger during battle to change things up.\nMonsters dictate the flow of battle, deciding who to target and even taking the first turn.\nLuckily, the more experience you gain, the better you\u2019ll get at predicting the monster\u2019s next move. As you learn their \u2018tells\u2019, the clues on the back of every behaviour card will give you a bigger hint at what\u2019s coming next.\nOnce the monster has made their move, it\u2019s your chance to react! Because these are wild beasts you\u2019re fighting, you won\u2019t always have the same opportunity to act before the monster moves again. \nYou\u2019ll need to decide who\u2019s best placed to attack, who needs to sharpen their weapon, and who needs to get the heck out of the way before the beast strikes again...\nDiscover more on Monster Behaviour\nYour position matters. Monsters have four arcs for their behaviours and their body parts: front, left, right, and rear. Where you\u2019re standing determines whether you\u2019ll get hit, but also what parts you can target.\nBreaking parts can trigger rules that change monster behaviour and earn bonus loot for your whole party, which you can use to craft upgraded weapons for taking on tougher beasts.\nWhen you\u2019re taking on a monster, three things are vital to success: positioning, teamwork, and managing your cards.\nThere are no dice in combat. Instead, combat is controlled by cards which you\u2019ll use to create combos, meaning you\u2019ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina.\nBecause attack cards can also be used for movement and dodging attacks, which also uses stamina slots, you\u2019ll need to make strategic choices about when to play cards and when to keep your board clear.\nKeep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!\nDiscover more on How Hunters Work\n Craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles, swapping cards into your deck to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks.\nChecking potential rewards is key to choosing your next monster quest. Some equipment offers elemental damage and resistance which could help you in a future hunt.\nBecause everything you craft stays in your inventory, switch equipment between quests to give you the best chance against the next beast!\nYou\u2019ll start with a unique attack deck based on your hunter\u2019s weapon and upgrade options you can craft from bone and ore. The more monster loot you claim, the better your weapon choices become!\nDiscover more on Upgrading Your Hunter\nLike the video game, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game is a campaign game. Over multiple sessions, you\u2019ll face tougher monsters, upgrading your hunter and equipment as you go.\nThe more monsters you slay, the better the weapons you can craft, the bigger the monsters you can hunt \u2014 until you\u2019re ready to take on a 4-star monster and win your campaign!\nWith 25 campaign days to spend (more if you're playing with combined sets), you'll need to make strategic choices about which monster to hunt and when. \nWill you hunt tougher versions of the same monster to craft all the weapons you can? Or try a fresh challenge?\nAfter a heart-pounding hunt, you may want to kick back and relax. Spend a few campaign days at HQ visiting the Smithy to craft new equipment, petting the Poogie, and enjoying a meal whipped up by the Meowscular Chef!\nHow Hunters Work\nTracking Monsters\nMonster Behaviour\nUpgrading Your Hunter\nArena Quests \n Combining the Core Sets\n   We\u2019ll ship your rewards to one of our international hubs. Depending on where you are in the world, your rewards will be sent to you from our hub in either the UK, USA, Netherlands, China, or Australia.\nBelow are rough estimate costs for shipping a Core pledge. The prices shown are best estimates based on current rates but please be aware that global shipping prices are currently very volatile due to COVID-19 and Brexit. Once the campaign is finished and you\u2019ve confirmed your address and any add-ons, your accurate shipping cost will be calculated in the pledge manager.\n\n\n\nSadly, due to customs, import laws, and other restrictions, Steamforged is unable to ship pledge rewards to these locations (see point 10 of terms).\nBecause of the size of the package, we\u2019re also unable to ship to P.O. Boxes.\nKeep in mind that any pledges confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from our UK hub at a later date. For non-UK backers, this will likely increase shipping costs.\nFor the regions listed as \u2018friendly shipping\u2019, we cover any VAT or sales tax charges. So, those are accounted for in the pledge price and shipping estimations. \nBackers in other regions will be liable for any VAT or sales taxes which may be applied in their own countries. There will be no extra costs for VAT charged in the pledge manager.\nBelow is a rough schedule of when you can expect key things to happen once the campaign ends. This schedule should give you an idea of when your payment card will be charged, and when shipping is likely to begin. Because circumstances are different from project to project, this timeline is estimated based on our experience.\n We want to get your rewards into your hands as soon as possible. Because of the potential for unexpected effects on planning and production schedules, there\u2019s a chance you might not get your rewards before the game is available at retail.

While they might be first time designers, \"Ani\" is a long-time employee of Queen games as a graphic designer, and we are very excited to be adding them to our arsenal of published designers. Check out this Designer Diary video they have have on the making of Scrap Racer.\nPreviews and Live Plays\nGame Play\nScrap Racer is a push-your-luck dice game that is suitable for novice gamers or seasoned veterans looking for a raucous experience.\nYou are a daredevil Scrap Racer who knows only one goal: Win the race\u2014no matter how dangerous!\n\n\n A race lasts for three laps, and whomever leads the field at that point will be the winner. \nOn a turn, the active player rolls up to six dice (one at a time) and advances their racer according to the results. But be careful! If you roll doubles, you must draw a crash card and anything can happen\u2014depending on the double you may get a boost or be slowed down, letting others catch up. However, you can gain bonus cards for repeated doubles that can make up for lost position, if used correctly.\nUsing the unique abilities of the racers and collecting Boost markers, the players can manipulate the outcome of the race to their advantage. On top of all of this, players may have to fight for track position. Whenever two racers share the same space, a duel takes place to decide who will advance by one space and who will stay.\nWhen a racer crosses the finish line, a Goal Card is drawn which will advance the racers in the back, ensuring a photo finish.\n\nAdd On\nWe have published one other game by a Queen Games employee\u2014Orcs Orcs Orcs by Frank Thyben (lead developer).  Backers in the United States may add this game on to their order for special pricing during the campaign.\nClick for more game information\n\nProduction and Delivery\nThe production of Scrap Racer is planned for May 2021. Our games are printed in Europe, so there is little delay between the end of printing and them arriving for fulfillment in our warehouse.

In these cases, we are not able to reimburse you for any charges.\n\nPost Campaign Communication\nWe will monitor the comment section and messages while the campaign is active in order to answer everyone's questions.

These are more refinements than radical changes. If you are only playing Mythic Battles: Pantheon, you can either use them or ignore them, because remember, it's YOUR game!\n-Talents&Terrain types\nSeveral talents and terrains are not included in MBR. In order to maintain a balance with the new talents, some talents from MBP have had their frequency of appearance on MBR profiles greatly reduced, or are even absent altogether, such as Phalanx.\nSome terrains and boundaries have disappeared like Swamp or Chains, while others have been added like Divine Source. Others have simply undergone a name change, such as Lava which becomes Burning. Rules for terrain types and boundaries not listed in the MBR rulebook remain fully valid on the boards where they were normally played. \n-Ascend\nWe were not satisfied with the way climbing was handled in relation to rock type terrain, we felt it too restrictive. So we created a fourth complex action, Ascend, which allows a unit to enter a Rock terrain type area if that unit starts its move in an adjacent area (regardless of its move stat). It becomes possible to ascend the rock but starting its movement next to the rock terrain type and losing access to some powers and talents because of having performed a complex action. The Climb talent remains a safe bet since it still allows you to go entera rocky terrain with a simple step, it also allows you to enter cliff type terrain, and can cross escarpment type borders. In addition, a unit with Climb gains +1 defence when on a Rock against any attack from a unit without this skill.\n-1V1V1 change\n3-player games used to end when a deity had absorbed 4 Divine stones or was the last one alive on the battlefield. While it allowed for the creation of fortunate alliances, it did not encourage risk-taking and left the first loser out for the rest of the game. The 3 player games now end the same way as the 2 or 4 player games. Players who prefer the previous version will definitely want to play it anyway.\n-Titan vs God\nThis option is back on the scene to allow for as many different confrontations as possible, exploring even more themes. Titans tend to be scary because of their raw power, which is hard to handle, especially in your first few games, and so the only option was that they were forced to fight each other.\nThe confrontation between titans and gods is once more possible, by offering the side that DOES NOT recruit a titan, a bonus, that player gets to deploy a unit for free, like a troop unit or a unit with the Scout talent including (if they wish to) their god.\nThis allows many options, such as blocking the path of an opponent's unit, advancing a unit to quickly get divine stones, or placing your god so that he doesn't lose any of his precious activations to deploy and keeps them to attack or absorb divine stones. This extra move also restores the balance of stress on the titan player's side, as you'll have to deal with enemies with a slight edge.\n-Rune\nIn MBP, omphalos could be used to recover vitality. Here, runes can be used to increase the effective combat value. If victory by absorbing four divine stones is slipping away from your prospects, you can always seek glory in a desperate assault on the opposing deity. And, if you miss, perhaps, you're getting a little too close.\n-Absorption according to the pantheon of origin\nIn the past, it was the origin of the deity (Greek, Norse) that decided whether you could enjoy the special power of a divine stone or not. For example, if Thor collected omphalos, he could not use the special power of it because he was not a Greek deity. This added a thematic imbalance, but it was still an imbalance. Now, each type of divine stone allows all deities to enjoy its benefit. Thor could benefit from the omphalos, which he would normally absorb, and Zeus would do the same for the runes. So the scenario or board you play on will decide what bonus you can have, and not discriminate against pantheons.\nMythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k and Mythic Battles: Pantheon play separately but can also be played together. Whether you prefer to see Ares and Tyr in a deadly duel or see their martial prowess displayed under the same banner, the choice is yours. You just have to use Mythic Battle: Ragnar\u00f6k rules and include any talent or terrain type which is not part of Mythic Battles: Ragnar\u00f6k corebox and add it to the rules.\nIn its final form, the rulebook will contain an additional section on this topic with arbitration on rule points that might be problematic in very specific situations and add terrain and skills from Mythic Battles: Pantheon that have not made their way to the frozen lands.\nNo need for any kit, pack or add-on if you want to mix the two games.

For some destinations, the fees are still high, but they are the only ones we have been able to obtain that meet our requirements.\nThe shipping costs in the table below are very reliable estimates that will vary by a maximum of a few dollars (up or down). They take into account certain taxes such as VAT as well as the annual inflation of logistics costs, and the Stretch Goals.\nIndeed, contrary to other Kickstarters, our shipping fees estimates are not fees that don\u2019t include the Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign, but the estimates INCLUDE the Stretch Goals that could be unlocked. The estimates are therefore the high end of the fees you could pay, and not the other way around.\nWe regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes, and to following countries:  Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Syria, Russia,  Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nMonolith is a company founded in 2014.

In the beginning, while in Midgard men spread, the gods only had Valhalla; until a stranger came along and offered his services, boasting that he could build them such a fortress in exchange for the Moon, the Sun, and Freyja. The gods hesitated but finally agreed, on condition that the work be completed in a single winter, before the first day of summer, and that no hand would help him. The Master Builder then asked that his horse, Svadilfari, be left as his assistant; this was agreed to at the instigation of Loki, who did not think for a minute that he would be able to do it. But the gods were surprised. The horse could bear heavy loads, more than any other; and the stranger, methodical and talented, built, stone by stone, a wall higher and thicker. Three days before the beginning of the summer, he had only the door to place on the fort to finish the work. Worried, the gods gathered and decided that Loki, who had made the agreement, must find a solution or face their wrath. That evening, while the Master Builder was out looking for stones, a beautiful mare (which was Loki) came to distract the stallion, who did not want to work anymore and ran after him. The Master Builder could not get hold of his horse for three days, and lost his bet. Mad with rage, he denounced the treachery, entering into a black anger while transforming himself into a j\u00f6tunn. The gods, seeing that they had dealt with a giant, considered that they owed him nothing and ordered Thor to kill him, which he did willingly.

Now you can track status, spells, hit points, initiative and others, allowing all players to understand, at a single glance, the game situation quickly and easily.  \n\n100% compatible\nAnd if you already have miniatures with a standard 1-inch base* (2.54cm), the interactive bases are compatible with those too!\n\n* We tested the basis with all the major lines of miniatures: Wizkids, Frostgrave, Zealot, Blacklist (just to name a few): bases fit all perfectly!\n\nThe tags present in the greatest number are \"numbers\". They are in blue and red colors. You can use them in many ways: hit points, initiative, ability buffs or debuffs, number of turns, etc.\n\nWhat's better than casting a spell, like \"Arcane Shield\" and see it directly linked to your miniature? But that is not all! Spell models also stand up on their own, so you can summon them to spaces away from the character as well.\n\nThis is one of the best parts: you can also show the conditions of your character and opponents! whether they are poisoned, deafened, charmed, or regenerating, no problem: you will have them all!\n\nYea! they can have a dual function: to signal the use of a particular fighting style for that game turn, or, if associated with similar models, to identify which of them has a melee weapon from who has a long-range one. \n\nand many new ones are on the way!\n\nThe interactive system is not the only innovation of this project. Together with it, we offer a line of miniatures printed in high-quality plastic! \nTheir design is made in collaboration with the Italian artists Claudio Casini and Simone Rasetti.\nToo many miniatures to paint? no problem!\nGame Start has obtained the license to use the Sundrop technique on the miniatures of this line (the same used for the Awaken Realms miniatures), thus giving everyone the possibility to have pre-shaded models with a technique that highlights the details.\n\nSundrop consists of coloring the models with strong contrasts of light and dark, giving the models a unique \"old style\" effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe images proposed in the photo gallery below were made using the models painted in Sundrop and the proposed addon \"Fantasy World Creator - Essential Edition\". \nThe visual result is that of playing an adventure on an old-fashioned picture book.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketed and Promoted by\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox, the tech marketing company behind many successful Kickstarters.\n\"More than $50,000,000 has been raised with Sprint's support\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 7th Kickstarter campaign, all previous \"World Creator\" projects have been supported and delivered successfully.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the six months window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. We do not intend to allow this to happen for this project, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge. Suppose you confirm your pledge within six months of our notification via email: in that case, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by standard methods. Shipping costs may vary from what is indicated in the \"Shipping\" section, as they will be applied next year and therefore may be subject to increases.

Now we\u2019re doing the dragons.\nWelcome to 7 Moons: Heroes of Dragon Reach\n7 Moons is an original family board game from Gunpowder Studios, set in a mythical, magical world of dragons and monsters, where 1-4 players seek to save the beautiful kingdom of Dragon Reach from the impending Shadow Army. \nThe story of Dragon Reach, the magical kingdom in which 7 Moons is set, is woven richly into the game, giving players an immersive experience with them at the heart of the adventure.\nThe standard game is packed with high-quality components, engaging stories and enchanting locations. It's got some neat game mechanics too, and like all of our games, 7 Moons can be played by anyone from 8 to 80  and enjoyed by novice and experienced game players alike. And if you're into even more bling for your buck, check out our DELUXE PLEDGE. \n* Coins will be cast in metal and embossed (not printed) for a real-coin feel. The KS deluxe edition coins will additionally feature an exclusive 'KS' mark on each coin. Retail versions of the deluxe edition will not feature the KS coin mark. Designs may be subject to change prior to production.\nIf you wish to pledge a little more towards our target, we'll send you a deluxe version of the game, filled with even more goodness: real metal shiny Dragon Reach coins and proper wooden playing pieces to replace some of the cardboard tokens in the standard game. \nPlus Story Tokens\nTo show our appreciation to everyone who helped us get 7 Moons funded, we're going to be adding a new optional game feature: the 7 Moons story tokens, which will bring more adventure, replayability and fun to the game. We'll be including the tokens in the printed game, and providing the print and play rules online for free.\nPlus solo gaming for all!\nSolo Gaming is now included in all games. Play 7 Moons as a solo adventurer using our specially designed single-player AI rules. Experience all the elements of the multiplayer game and try to save Dragon Reach as a lone emissary. \nThe challenge of 7 Moons is to get your city's defences ready before the Shadow Army arrives and attacks. You have very little time, and there are many ways to raise gold to build strongholds and recruit allies, so your choices are important factors in your success or failure in protecting your city - and the whole realm - from the marauding hordes of evil creatures heading your way - fast.   \nHeavyweight, illustrated character cards hold your resources and provide a handy game reference. You set out from your city on foot, but pretty soon you'll need to buy a horse so that you can carry more gear and get around faster. Better still, lure a friendly(ish) local dragon and then you'll really be flying. \n7 Moons plays simply and smoothly, but is enough of a challenge to keep you entertained and focused, game after game. That's another hallmark of every Gunpowder game: we keep our game mechanics and rules deliberately simple so that you can concentrate on your game plan and how you're going to win. \nQuests are a great way to swell your coffers and gain allies to fight for your city, but they're risky and take precious time you may be reluctant to spare. Fail, and you'll have nothing to show for your efforts. Succeed, and the rewards will have been worth the time and trouble. \nVenturing into the Dragon Reach wilderness is foolhardy, dangerous and often very rewarding. You can also travel through the wilderness to reach destinations faster, though bandits may relieve you of your gold, and your dragon may decide to flee. But if a risky short cut means getting your resources to market before the other players to beat them to the highest price, it could be a risk worth taking. \n7 Moons requires a fine balance of gameplay as it nears its end game: the attack of the Shadow Army. As your city grows stronger, the Shadow Phase draws closer. But while it may be tempting to get your defences in place as quickly as possible, if your fellow players are far from ready when the Shadow Army attacks, you put the whole realm at risk of defeat. Then again, you don't want to be the one who's still building their first stronghold when chaos descends on Dragon Reach. \nAny one of these diabolical legions could spell doom for a city. Wave after wave of foul creatures will test your decision-making and strategy in the final showdown.\nWe don't scrimp on components because we know that one of the most fun things about getting a new board game is opening the box to reveal the abundance of treasures crammed inside.\n\n7 Moons: Heroes of Dragon Reach is a game packed with adventure - a game of travelling, trading and preparing for the war that approaches. For 1-4 players aged 8 and up\nBack of the box  \nView larger image\nCustom playing pieces\n7 Moons comes with  25 originally designed wooden meeples, including foot traveller, horse and dragon in four player colours, a Shadow Army token and 12 wooden strongholds. The rest of the components are made from heavyweight card, including a thick game board depicting the lands of Dragon Reach and its four great cities. Quest and wilderness cards are vividly printed on high-quality stock, with engaging narratives for a fully immersive experience.\nLots of chunky tokens\nWe all love tokens, right? 7 Moons comes with over 100 resource tokens for wood. stone and iron, plus the special dragon crystals (should you discover them). There are also larger components for the magic artefacts hidden within the game, so that everyone can see when you've got one of the game's rare special treasures in your possession. Behold, my Sword of Alliance!\nSimple rules, smart gameplay and plenty of ways to win\nWell written, easy to follow 12-page rulebook with quick-start rules and clear referencing (see full rules link below)\nRules\nClick here to see a preview of the rules: View rules preview. We've playtested the game thoroughly, including breaking it several times until we were happy that it was going to withstand the rigours of play in the real world, especially for our loyal backers who put their faith in it making into the real world in the first place. But we'll continue refining the rules before we go to print, so that they're as unbreakable as a stone giant's pickaxe by the time you receive your copy.   \n One flat-rate shipping cost and fast delivery\n* For selected countries, we have negotiated delivery of each game direct from the manufacturer for a super low price. We will deliver your game to any of the following countries for one flat fee of \u00a310 (or your local currency equivalent): Australia, Canada, China, United Kingdom, USA (Alaska and Hawaii may incur additional costs) and the European Union. Delivery to other countries is available: see shipping costs at checkout.\nFlat-rate shipping also reduces the delivery time to you - packed, tracked and delivered to your door asap for one low price.\nSafe passage\nWhen your game is ready to ship it will be professionally packaged and sealed, then sent using a fully traceable tracking system direct from the factory to your door, as straight and swift as an elven arrow.\nThat's the plan!

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals.

You pay for the shipping for your copy and we'll pay for the shipping to the reservation copy.\n Scout: $150 (plus shipping) For Friendly Local Games Stores Only. With this pledge you'll receive 6 copies of Coyote and Crow (1 case). You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow! All of the benefits of the Whisperer, Tinkerer, Warrior and Healer pledges, but your book will be signed and numbered by Connor Alexander. You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

The next adventures will be \"Victorian Iron\" Steampunk Adventure, and Sci-Fi Corridors. Now let's visit Deep Earth! \nFunctional Elevator! - See below\n PLEASE NOTE:  All Terrain models in this project are digital STL files only. There are no physical terrain pieces. Designed primarily for FDM printers. \nStackable Terrain adds a huge new playing area to your table! \n 4\"x4\"x4\" modules give you a playable cut-away view of corridors running through a mountain mining facility. Complete with stairs, elevators, trap doors, and secret rooms, it is a whole new experience. \nAdd a massive new playing area to your terrain!\n   Features: \n Multilevel traps and mechanisms. New game-play mechanics with open shafts, falling rocks, and machinery.\nLittle did the unsuspecting Burglar know, that the rock dropper had been alerted!\n Save Table space. Our stackable terrain is only 4\" wide. Run it along the edge of the table with your existing terrain to create a huge new playing area. Of course, you can use it as the main feature on the table as well by using the inside and outside corners to create a massive complex. \n Will not fall over.  Modules are designed to accept stainless steel table clips (optional) that hold the modules firmly in place along the edge of the table. Available on our fulfillment store. \n Spectacular lighting! - Option 1: Remote control 30mm Light Pod ports are designed into each 4\"x4\" module.

(Optional, magnets are not required, but we highly recommend them for super quick construction and stability.) 3mmx5mm round magnet slots are designed into each module to hold them firmly together adding to the stability of the wall. Stack several stories high, super easy set-up and tear-down. (Magnets not included. Available on our fulfillment store.)  \n FDM printing looks great on these mine walls!\nWhile resin printing creates a smoother surface we were pleasantly surprised to see the carved look that came out on the walls using FDM printing. In fact we actually prefer it!\nCheck out the cool carved effect using FDM printing.\nFree Stuff - Have a cart full of gold on us! \nThe \"Ancient Kings Wall Skin\" Download Is Available For All.\nThe wall skin is a good place to start.

Check it out in the Add-Ons.\nSee Add-ons for limited painting requests\n Save Big On Printing Time & Material!\n Attention to minimal 3d printing and supports. We have designed a unique core module that accepts a 3mm thick skin on the floor, wall and ceiling. Instead of printing out the entire module every time, you simply print the 3mm thick skins. This allows a variety looks by overlaying different skins on the same core module. Nearly all of the prints are support free.\n Secret Area Screen - (design in process)\n (Included in Core Pack). Your players will never know what's behind the secret area until it's time. Finished version will be a textured design (without secret area lettering)\n  When will this ship?\nScheduled file release is June 2021. We have tested all the prints and everything is printing nicely. However, we will still work with our beta testers printing on different printers to vet the designs. We may take a little additional time after the project to fine tune individual components to make them retail ready. If you have experience as a Beta Tester and would like to participate let us know in the KS message system. \n Tidbits:  \nPrint time. - We could not stop printing! Each time we built a level we wanted to add more. We finally had to stop to get this KS out early in the year. Our build took two months of printing using between 2-3 FDM printers night and day. Two printers went down, and two new Sovol SV01 printers were purchased. Things went much smoother from there. We are very happy with our SV01's. Miniatures were printed with our Epax 4k resin printer.\nPreferred FDM material came down to Hatchbox Silver or grey. The consistency and strength seemed to be very reliable. Least useful FDM was some of the more the brightly colored materials as it ended up being very brittle.\nPaint time. - One month of painting, then another couple weeks of printing and painting in the studio for fine tuning once we were ready to film.  \nWe were going to release 3 themes originally. - The Rock Theme \"Ancient Mines\", a Victorian Iron Steam Punk theme, and a Sci-fi Theme. What was interesting about that was mixing and matching the skins from different eras for unique looks. However, once we started shooting the  Rock Mine we realized it was just too massive for one KS.  We will release those in a separate KS project later this year.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th Kickstarter, thank you again to all our return and new backers! \n\nWe have been manufacturing products since 2005 and so we are very familiar with manufacturing, delivery and customer service. This project, however, is a little different as it includes digital STL files and 1 physical product, the Fog Monster 2. The good news is, it is a much faster turn around than creating new physical products! Fog Monster 1 was first produced in 2018 and FM2 is currently being distributed, so it is easy for us to do another production run on this physical product as all the molds are made. We are making a new production run for this KS to allow backers to use the fog FX in the terrain. \n\nWe have been 3d printing on resin and FDM printers for 7 years and absolutely love it! We have had many requests from our backers to release 3d print files for our projects and now we are happy to be able to do so. We have been testing and refining our files for over 3 months and they are in ready condition. We may add some addition features and textures during and after the KS. \n\nWe are continuing to make refinements as we receive feedback from beta testers and once we believe the files are \"retail ready\" they will be released. We do not anticipate any hold ups but, as always, there may be a few troublemakers in the bunch. We have years of experience to easily solve any problems we may run into.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nWe are focused on saving time and money on printing materials by creating a unique \"Skinning System\".

Photography by The ESC Plan.\nProject Fulfillment\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that we have once again partnered with Quartermaster Logistics (QML) for fulfillment for this project.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. They have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers peace of mind. We have been pleased with their performance in the past, and continue to have the utmost confidence in their ability to successfully fulfill our projects.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nFriendly Shipping & Taxes/Fees\nPledge rewards shipping to one of our \"friendly\" zones will be delivered with no additional customs, duties, or taxes (including VAT).\nPledge rewards shipped to a location outside of these zones can be subject to taxes, customs, and duties according to the destination country\u2019s regulations/legislation. It is the responsibility of the recipient of the order to pay for any such additional fees.\nShipping Hubs\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for UK backers), Germany (for EU backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping pledges to various regions.\nIMPORTANT: These estimates are based on the weight of the main products in a pledge and an average weight regarding possible unlocked content. Additionally, these estimates do not take into consideration the weight of any optional add-ons you purchase. Therefore, actual shipping costs may be more due to increased package weight from both the final amount of unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons you have\nPO BOXES\nPlease note we cannot deliver to P.O. boxes.\nEXCLUDED SHIPPING REGIONS\nUnfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nBREXIT\n                                                 Quartermaster Logistics is opening a fulfillment center in Germany in order to continue to allow us and others to offer EU-friendly shipping post-Brexit.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFinal Product\nProducts shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change. Therefore, the final products you receive may differ from what is presented here.\nProject Updates\nIt is your responsibility as a backer of this project to read project updates in order to stay up to date with important details and requests from the Blacklist Games team.\nCommunicating with Blacklist Games After the Campaign\nPlease note that we do not monitor the Kickstarter messaging inbox outside of a live Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, after this project has ended, please ensure to communicate with us via https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/help\nRefund Policy\nFull refunds are available within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end date. All refunds taking place within these 14 days are reversed in full via Stripe to your credit card.\nAfterwards, refunds minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recuperate) will be available before and during the first 30 days the pledge manager is open. Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nThis Campaign Is Not A Store\nAny amounts pledged to this campaign are contributions meant to help bring the project to life. For your contribution, we are providing you with rewards for your support. In other words, this campaign is not a store and you are not making a purchase. Therefore, if you are interested in receiving rewards for your contribution, you must complete your pledge manager by its closing date after the campaign ends. If you do not, we cannot guarantee you will receive rewards for your pledge. We may, at our discretion, choose to provide anyone who did not complete their pledge manager by its deadline with a second chance to get the rewards relating to their pledge level, depending on availability of stock (see \u201cCompleting the Pledge Manager\u201d section below for more details).\nCompleting the Pledge Manager\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d as a pledge for this Kickstarter that wish to receive rewards after the campaign has ended must make sure to select rewards in the pledge manager and confirm their order by the closing date of the pledge manager. All remaining \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the closing date of the pledge manager has passed.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. We also cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity at that point in time.\nRetailer Eligibility\nTo qualify as a retailer, you will need to provide proof of owning a legitimate, active brick and mortar hobby/games/media retail store. You will also be asked to provide your business license and/or proof of registration with your government\u2019s tax authority. Failure to provide this information will result in being unable to confirm your retail order and you will only have access to standard backer pricing in the pledge manager.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing several successful crowdfunding campaigns (some fulfilled, some in various states of fulfillment), we are confident in our ability to bring you a quality product. Please see the campaign details above for our current estimated delivery date; note that due to this project being manufactured in China, delays can occur. Additionally, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards at different times.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with crowdfunding campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, with our strong relationship with our manufacturer, a fulfillment company already signed on and, most importantly, dedication to our backers and their satisfaction, we have no reason to doubt this campaign will move along as smoothly as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Lasting Tales Tier", "descp": "Get the Lasting Tales core book!\nINCLUDES:\nLasting Tales Hardcover Core Book", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2022"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["344 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 75 or more", "title": "Fantasy: Series 2 Tier", "descp": "Get the Fantasy: Series 2 miniatures set, and the Fantasy: Series 2 Stretch Goals!

It has allowed us to stay connected with friends and family, and even meet new friends as we've adapted our in-person games to a more virtual setting.\nWe decided to start Epic Dice Designs with the goal of introducing more people to the games that we love, and bring to life our own design concepts framed around stories and characters.  We want to share Epic Dice Designs with the world, and to do that, we are looking for your support to ramp up production and bring our first concept to life, the Heavy Metal Collection: Volume 1!\nThere are a total of 21 different set styles included in the collection, with an additional 9 sets waiting to be unlocked and different funding levels.\n\nDICE FEATURES\nThese sets are 25% heavier and 25% larger in size than standard dice\nDice are die-cast zinc alloy metal then coated in color enamel\nThese are perfect for any RPG such as Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, Savage World, Math Games, or anything else you can think of\nNumbers are large for easy reading, number 6's and 9's are clearly marked\nQuality Inspected: every die is inspected by hand before being packaged so that you only get the best\nIf you receive defective dies or missing dies set, please contact us for replacement\nLifetime Warranty\nSo which, Hero, Villain, or Creature will you choose...\nBARBARIAN'S BLOOD BATH  \nBarbarians are mighty fighters, with preponderance for senseless violence and an inbuilt blood lust. They are ruthless and fearless, qualities that make them much sought after to act as mercenaries by various unscrupulous factions and armies on the theory that it is much better to have them on one\u2019s own side than to stand and fight against them. Having said that it is better not to mix with them at all for as their name implies they have no caring for any type of society or its rules and social graces.\nThey are proficient with any and all types of weapon. They wear any armor they can afford or lay their hands on. They wear no uniform nor carry any banner. Many are cruel in their nature as their style of weaponry tends to show. Never make the mistake of attempting to befriend a Barbarian. They have no concept of friendship or of loyalty. If you offer a Barbarian the hand of friendship they are more likely to cut it off rather than shake it.\n\nBARD'S BALLAD \nBards sing songs and many of these songs are ballads that tell stories of long forgotten battles and heroes, bringing their memories back to a listening audience who are inspired by such tales of heroism and bravery. Such songs can be dangerous and have been known to raise arguments and even create wars between different factions who feel they have been libeled in such stories. However it is not just the music that makes a Bard a powerful character. \nJust because a Bard is a musician do not assume they are a pushover in a fight. A Bard has survived many bar room fights and they are very proficient with their fists and with both long and short daggers.\n\nBEHOLDER'S GAZE \nA Beholder is a monstrous aberration, a nightmare to behold. In fact nightmares are preferable. It is a large, grotesque. floating, round creature with a huge fanged mouth above which is a large central eye. On its top, appearing like the tentacles of a sea creature, are a number of twisted and turning stalks with an eye set into the end. \nThe creature is even more fearsome when you realize that each of these eyes is capable of releasing a number of different magical spells. It is capable of creating such spells as disintegrate objects, turn flesh to stone, deep sleep, slow the motion of objects or beings, charm animals and humans, cause death, induce fear, levitate objects, and inflict serious wounds, to name just a few. The list is endless and to make matters worse, the Beholder is constantly evolving and creating new and more deadly spells.\n\nCLERIC'S CHAOS\nA Cleric has  the inborn ability to straddle two worlds, the world of humans and the world of the gods. Clerics serve as many different Gods as there are religions, and sometimes they serve more than one God within a particular religion. Similar to a Monk, a Cleric has been encompassed by a particular religion and has been taught and trained inside a temple or monastery over many years and has been indoctrinated into its ways and beliefs. During the more advanced elements of this training the Cleric becomes imbued with a divine magic that has been passed down from their Gods via the monastery\u2019s religions elders.\nThis divine magic can be used in many different ways, depending on the type of spell the Cleric chooses to cast. They can be healing spells, or spells that can cause an enemy great harm. They can be spells that raise morale among allies and bless them with an inspiration that creates supreme endeavors in battle. Equally they can curse the enemy, they can bring down plague or illness on them, they can cast a dread that will freeze and petrify warriors, helping to turn the course of any on-coming battle.\n\nCREATURE OF THE DEEP\nThe Creature of the Deep is a creature with a humanoid shape covered with the scaly skin of a snake. The Creature lives at the bottom of the oceans and has been known to use rivers to travel inland. They are dangerous and use their claws as weapons to scratch and scourge their enemies. They also use a three pronged trident in conjunction with a large net that entraps their enemy. They also use these implements to hunt and catch fish and other small sea creatures.\nCreatures of the Deep do not ignore mankind. In some lonely coastal areas they come ashore and will trade and communicate with members of the local population. However never allow a creature of the deep to imbibe alcohol. It affects them very badly and causes them to become violent.\n\nCRYPTID'S KEEPER\nWhen Cryptids appear anywhere on the surface of the planet they cause consternation, destruction and mayhem. They carry no weapons, they have no need for weapons, these creatures use the power of their very beings and bodies to kill randomly. They are large and heavily armored by a toughened skin making them extremely difficult to kill.\nNo one knows very much about the Cryptid's life cycle or how they come to breed, or know if such a variety of strange and deadly creatures live alone or in colonies. Perhaps each different creature has a different lifestyle. No one knows anything other than they are deadly and their appearance heralds nothing but extreme danger.\n\nDRAGON'S DOMAIN\nFew people have actually seen one in the air but those that have will never forget the sight. Its scaly body shimmers and reflects the light appearing like a giant rainbow in the sky. Its wingspan is the size of a small village with a mighty tail that tapers to a fine point. It has talons sharper than the keenest blade and teeth that can cut through anything it bites. Its breath is hot, so hot that it can singe someone standing in front of it.\nThey are wise, especially to the ways of men. A dragon mates for life and is faithful to their partner. Both sexes share an equal responsibility for looking after the eggs and the hatchlings.  Once the young have reached an age of five years they leave the nest to establish a colony elsewhere.  As to the gold? The only gold a dragon sits on is the gold of their eggs, the future of dragon kind. \n\nDRUID'S DEMOLITION\nDruids are one of the oldest races on the planet and have watched the growth of mankind from deep within their green woodland sanctuaries. As the world of man expands the Druids sink deeper and deeper into their woodlands, guarding ancient sacred sites, protecting and preserving as best they can. It is believed, but not proven that some Druids have mastered the art of transformation into an animal form.\nDruids carry a long dagger and a curved sickle. These are used for gathering and cutting plants and small branches, however they can be used as very effective weapons. Their weapon of preference is a crude staff similar in looks to the old fashioned quarter staff. A great natural magic is embedded within this staff, a natural magic that has taken the holder many years of learning and practice to master. The staff is decorated with small totems such as a badger or bird skull dressed with leaves and feathers. Each one is personalized to their particular Druid and anyone attempting to use it, even another Druid, will end up in a very bad way...\n\nGOBLIN'S GREED\nGoblins are  malicious and mischievous. They play tricks and have a sense of humor that revels in another\u2019s discomfort. They are sly and untrustworthy. If you ever shake hands with one make sure you count your fingers afterwards.  They are also tough fighters, although only when cornered. They are not renowned for their bravery. If they are challenged by humans or creatures bigger than themselves they will turn and run if they can.  In addition to fighting with small axes and daggers they are also capable of biting and scratching.\nGoblins live in many different environments. There are colonies of them in woodlands living in underground networks borrowed out under tree roots. In the mountain regions they live in caverns and cave systems, In more recent years they have even established colonies in some of the larger towns where they have built homes in ruined buildings and sewer systems.\n\nHEART OF A DRAGONBORN\nA Heart of a Dragonborn is an extreme rarity. It is an elemental force with the blood and soul of a dragon inside a human body. They are warriors of the highest order, indeed many Knights and Crusaders believe such a half-human to be the highest pinnacle of pure fighting ability and spirit.\nThey wear unique armor that is said to be made of dragon hide that is impenetrable to blades, arrows and absorbs blows from weapons such as axes and maces. Beneath their armor their skin is dark, thick and slightly patterned appearing as if they are covered in scales. Their eyes are narrow, pupils vertical slits and like dragons, they do not blink.  Their faces are long and their nostrils slightly flared echoing their dragon origins.\nAs dragon blood runs through their bodies such a half-person is incorruptible. They are not attracted or influenced by money or gold. They serve no Lord or King and fight for no other purpose than their own. They do not explain their actions, indeed they do not speak to anyone. Their silence is forbidding and they are unapproachable.\n\nMAIDEN'S MELODY\nA Maiden can be of any class. They can be empowered with magical powers similar to that of a witch or sorceress. They can be battle hardened Warrior Maidens being proficient with a variety of deadly weapons. They can be Ice Maidens, woman who hail from the Far Northern Regions who have a certain power over snow and ice. They can be Water Maidens who can call on the inherent powers of rivers and lakes. Equally there is a flame haired clan known as the Fire Maidens who control the element of fire. Even more secretive is a particular class known as Death Maidens, woman who specialize in undertaking highly secret assassinations.\nAll maidens are solitary, self-sufficient wanderers and nomads roaming throughout the lands. They never settle only staying in one place long enough to fulfill a commission or complete a mission. They are insular and never take a partner. Many of them act as mercenaries but they demand such a high price that very few Lords and armies can afford to hire them for general battlefield warfare.  However some have been known to accept temporary employment as rangers or scouts, others as spies.\n\nMONK'S MEDITATION\nA Monk begins and lives the early years of life in a monastery where they receive training in both the mental and physical aspects of their chosen following. Through hours of meditation and lessons in spirituality they seek perfection of their eternal souls. Through equal hours of the study of martial arts they seek the perfection of the ultimate warrior.\nOutside the monastery a Monk may seem inoffensive, bordering on the meek and humble. However you can be assured that beneath their robes a monks body is a finely tuned fighting machine. Their fists are like iron, if they can punch their way through piles of roof tiles think what they can do to a human head. They are agile and can kick an opponent in the back of the head from a standing position in front of them. They are also expert in the use of the type of weapon most people have never seen before let alone fight against, such as the rice flail and deadly sharpened metal stars. They are also expert with spear, sword and dagger.\nPALADIN'S PERSEVERANCE\nThe Paladin is a Holy Warrior combining the beliefs and actions of both a Cleric and a Warrior. They model their beliefs and mode of dress after the typical knight in full armor that fought in the European wars and Crusades of the Middle Ages, carrying the Holy Cross in one hand and the bloodied sword in the other. They are fiercely loyal both to their religion and their Lord. They are heavily armored with ornate helmets with a surplus worn over the top that carries the symbol of their religion or the Lord that they follow. The same symbol is usually embellished on their shield. \nA Paladin without a symbol emblazoned on their tunic is a sword for hire, but be aware, their fees are extortionately high. They are expert with heavy arms such as battle axes, both single and double handed swords, long and short daggers and a lance for mounted combat. Some have also been known to carry the deadly ball and chain or a mace. However, make no mistake, whatever the weapon the Paladin chooses to carry, they are experts in their use.\n\nRANGER'S RAID\nA Ranger\u2019s skills are a wondrous but lethal combination of archer, hunter, scout and tracker. They are quiet and unassuming people and whilst not having an aggressive or warring nature, if a Ranger finds themselves in a fight they will usually win it. They are equally skilled with blade and bow. You are very foolish if you chose to make an enemy of such a person. They are at one with nature and by observing a falling leaf or hearing distant birdsong, they can tell who or what is abroad in the forest. By glancing at the sky they can predict the weather three days hence. For the right fee they can track an animal or a fugitive across a continent. \nBy nature they cast a lonely figure, more at home in deep forests and isolated countryside than in towns and villages. They own no loyalty to any faction, king, or leader. They worship no deity, their only God being the changing of the seasons. They are self sufficient and experts at foraging off the land. They are also experts in camouflage and wear clothing that echo the color of the forests or surrounding landscape. If you see a ranger it is because they wanted you to see them. Whenever a localized war breaks out, it is a Ranger that investigates the enemy lines and positions.\n\nROGUE'S REVENGE\nA Rogue can be of any race, creed, or gender. They do not wear a uniform or a particular item of clothing. They are only discernible by their actions. A Rogue relies upon their own skill and stealth to earn an unlawful living. They are very convincing con artists and use their enemy\u2019s vulnerabilities to gain the upper hand. Never take part in a game of chance with a Rogue if you wish to keep your shirt.\nThey are very adept in discovering and using their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They are quick thinkers and can usually find the solution to any problem. They also have the ability to talk their way out of trouble, although are well capable of defending themselves if pushed. They are expert in using weapons of stealth, both crossbows and long bows and specialists in both long and short dagger usage.\nSORCERER'S SPELL\nUsually Sorcerers are to be found in the employ of evil minded Kings, Emperors or people in positions of great power to assist with their aims and ambitions, although sometimes Sorcerer\u2019s can work alone on some great ideological scheme of their own device.\nSorcerers are solitary people preferring to create their magic from their own magical workshops, which are usually found in towers. Sorcerers like towers. They give them an air of superiority and allows them to look down on the rest of the world. It gives them great pleasure to have the world at their feet. It\u2019s also a secure location as they tend to surround the tower with protective spells. Woe betides any man or creature that tries to sneak up on a sorcerer in their tower. Many an uninvited guest has found themselves floating on a lily pad catching flies with their tongue, or wandering in a strange town in a strange land wondering how they got there and who are they anyway.\nTHE FEARLESS FIGHTER\nAs their name implies The Fearless Fighter knows no fear, they are frightened of nothing. A Fearless Fighter can be of any race or breed and of any gender. These fighters are the ones to be found at the head of the battle, urging their fellow troops and fighters onward and upward. They are the ones that put the heart, bloodlust and fighting spirit into their fellow fighters. They are the ones who will carry the standard high. \nWhilst they may not be the most proficient fighters with whatever weapon they chose to carry, on the battlefield they are natural born leaders. They are capable of making the most inspiring and dramatic speeches that blind their fellow fighters to their own fears and the reality of battle, enabling them all to commit great feats of bravery, courage and endeavor. A Fearless Fighter is not a scribe, but when in full flow their words inspire their fellow warriors as if they are hewn out of letters of fire.\nThe Fearless Fighter is also immune to any fear created or cast by spells or any fear inducing magic, no matter how high ranking the sorcerer or magician that cast them may be.  No one knows why, but a Fearless Fighter is simply immune to all Fear Spells That mere fact makes them even more valuable to any General or the leader of any army.\n\nVALKYRIE'S VENGEANCE \nLike a carrion crow that feeds off the death of warriors, a Valkyrie\u2019s place is the battlefield for it falls on the Valkyries to choose those warriors who will die in the battle to come. They chose who will live and who will join their Lords in the drinking and feasting halls of the dead. How they make their choice is not known, but their appearance over the battlefield excites and encourages the warriors below and serves to drive them on to a greater bloodlust.\nValkyries are always female, but as no one has ever seen a young Valkyrie, or an old Valkyrie, it is assumed they are actually immortals. They appear in the sky and have the gift of the power of flight from a pair of feathery, tapered wings that appear across their shoulders and down their backs. When they fly, they let out great screams and screeches, but no one is sure whether they are communicating with each other or whether the sounds are just expressions of pleasure.  It is neither lucky nor unlucky to see a Valkyrie, the only portent their appearance predicts that somewhere very soon there will be a battle and people will be killed.\n\nWANDERING WIZARD\nAs their name implies these wizards wander from realm to realm, from country to country looking for a home, a new Lord. As they have no one to answer to they are extremely dangerous. Their magic is wild and untamed and they use it not just for protection in the landscapes of the wild but they use it for hunting and to create their own comforts.\nWandering Wizards are capable of shift shaping and will seek out wolf packs and run the wild hunt with them. Indeed many Wandering Wizards have a wolf as their constant companion. Sometimes they have been known to raise demons and creatures of evil and set them free to roam and create havoc just to amuse themselves. Wandering Wizards do not carry weapons. They have no need of steel for protection. On no account should a warrior or knight of fortune ever attack such a Wizard. Magic is not only mightier than the sword, but it can be cast from a distance.\n\nWARLOCK'S WATCH\nWarlocks practice both white and black magic and like witches are capable of creating and casting spells for good and for harm and like witches use many natural ingredients as the basis of cures and potions. Like a witch they have enough control of magic to make one\u2019s life very uncomfortable if they so chose. Their skills with spells and potions are very effective. They can cure warts, or bring on a painful death.\nWarlocks that practice black magic are very dangerous. Like sorcerers and wizards they are capable of conjuring up demons and lesser demons only as their power is less, these apparitions can prove unstable and the last thing anyone wants to be confronted by is an unstable demon.\n\nWITCH'S WRATH\nThe real Witch conducts magic of the highest order. The evil malevolent witch studies and practices black magic which specializes in demonology and the worship of Satan whilst the white witch practices white magic which is sympathetic to nature and is a power for healing and good. Their magic is formed by learning and practicing spells, or incantations that create and draw the magic to them. These spells are notated in spell books that are handed down from generation to generation.\nMany witches are capable of shape shifting and all have a creature that they call their familiar. This familiar is a low-ranking demon that has the ability to take on the shape of an animal, such as a toad, dog, or black cat.  It is never wise to cross or upset a witch, as they are very powerful and have the ability to make life very uncomfortable for any who threatens them.\n\nFelt bag included with all D20 Reward Tiers.\nAll D6, 7pcs Main, and 12pcs Sets come with a collectible, felt-lined case.\n\nUNLOCKABLES\nOn top of the 21 styles included as options in the Heavy Metal Collection: Volume 1, we will be unlocking a new style at each of the funding levels listed below.

This Kickstarter we\u2019re introducing Keychain Spellbooks, leather bound hand-finished boxes crafted to store miniature gemstone dice (made from real gemstones!). In the past Elderwood has brought you Spellbooks and Spellbook Minis, so if you think we took our last idea and just smushed it, you\u2019re probably (and also exactly) correct.\n\nLike their predecessors and their predecessor\u2019s predecessor, Keychain Spellbooks are lovingly crafted from a variety of stunning natural wood options, wreathed in lush foil-stamped leather, and embellished with your choice of signature art. Except even smaller. Available in two types of interior and teeming with tenacity (and teensy gemstone dice), these tiny two-inch tomes are tailor-made to tend to your teeny treasures. \nKeychain Spellbooks are guaranteed (not really-- in life there are no guarantees) to make your keys harder to lose.\nThis campaign we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to bring you Mini Gemstone Dice exclusively available to bedazzle the interior of your Keychain Spellbook. Mini Gemstone Dice are just like regular Gemstone Dice, except it\u2019s easier to fit a whole set in your mouth. Read on to learn how to customize your Keychain Spellbook and add on Mini Gemstone Dice to your pledge.\nThey took all the raves that didn't happen in 2020 and put them into K9 Crystal Gemstone Dice.\nWood\nBegin your itty-bitty journey by selecting which of our hand-sanded, oil brushed woods speaks to you in the loudest, tiniest voice.  Classic woods are available for all Classic Keychain Spellbooks. Check out our Pledge Guide to calculate your additional pledge amount for Premium and Elite woods, and visit our build preview tool to see how your choices might look. \nWood so smooth you could... do something that requires a smooth wooden object.\n Leather & Foil\nPLAY\n\nKeychain Spellbooks are swathed in your choice of luxuriously durable leathers stamped in a gorgeous foil of your choosing. Our time-tested and supremely supple Granada leathers are available in seven of our classic colors, so you can drape your little friends in a drum-dyed cloak that most vividly expresses the spirit of their moon sign, or something.\nIn this Kickstarter, you'll be able to pick a different foil color for the border and the icon selection. Choose from these lustrous foil colors: gold, silver, bronze, maroon, forest, ocean sky, pink, rose gold, and pewter. Down below you'll see a handy reference image that displays what each of the available foils looks like pressed on the available leather choices. We are so thoughtful.\nNot pictured: Rose Gold, favorite among millennials.\nYou're getting veeeeery sleeeeeeepy. Unless you're not, in which case please ignore.\nArt\nDress up your Keychain Spellbook with a selection from our classic signature art options.\nInterior Configuration\nChoose between two different interior options for your Keychain Spellbook - Open and Spiral styles.  \n\nThe Spiral Interior holds 7-10 mini dice while the Open Interior can hold, like, a lot more.\nKeychain Eyelet Loop\nAww, look how happy this gargoyle is with his little Keychain Spellbook ^_^\nYou can put this bad boy on your keychain to ensure you're never without a set of tiny, shiny dice. We've force tested the leather eyelets and they're able to withstand up to 25lbs of force with the leather alone. We want to ensure the long life of the product and will be including antiqued metal reinforcement for the eyelet on all production versions.\n  If you just want to put this cutie in your pocket (or you have no keys and no keyrings), you can order without the eyelet, too.\n  Something something obscure Minecraft joke about Dice Plains Spikes etc.\nFeed your pint-sized puck some delicious little dice. We've got a veritable sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of tiny math rocks to offer, from gemstone to metal to resin. Check out the menu below, and then reference the pledge guide to see how to upgrade.\nMini Gemstone Dice (add $60 to any pledge)\nExactly like regular Gemstone Phoenix Dice, but cuter and infused with more positive karma. These sets include D20, D12, D10(dec), D10, D8, D6 and D4.\nPick your engraved font - Phoenix vs Norse styles\nAll Mini Gemstone dice are expertly cut and polished from their source stones. Phoenix and Norse editions of Mini Gemstone dice give you the chance to select from two different engraved numeral styles. Phoenix edition is an elegant flowing font with a phoenix engraved on the d6, and the Norse edition features a Dwarven stone-cut runic font.\nHey, does just one of you want to come to electrical with me?\nFinal versions of the Mini Rose Quartz Phoenix Edition will feature gold numerals\nMini Metal Phoenix Dice (add $20 to any pledge)\nLike death metal is to music, these dice are to other dice.

This line of highly detailed resin cast models is suitable for miniatures that are in 28-32 mm range. Although Altburg buildings are bigger in scale, they still fit very well with our second, 28mm range - Midgard. The Graveyard model fits very nicely with both of our ranges. Altburg has been created with interactivity and modularity in mind, taking the gaming experience to a new level. We wanted to create an ultimate Graveyard kit that allows Wargamers and RPG players to create their own Graveyard of any shape or size! Our Graveyard is realistic, highly detailed, and versatile - a true standout in the market. Together, let's get this produced and onto your gaming tables and diorama displays!\n\nEnter the Graveyard! \nGraveyard images shown above consist of parts that are included in the Priest pledge level (note that the base is not included, some additional parts are included)\n\nWhile created in a larger 32mm scale, the Graveyard fits 28, or even 25mm models beautifully and gives plenty of room to move models around the different features of the Graveyard.  \nThe Crow pledge contains everything a village or a small town Graveyard should have.\nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\nTombstones\nTomb\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $145, but for our backers it is discounted to $131.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save $24.  \nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\n\nThe Gravedigger pledge contains all essential features a Graveyard should have. On top of that, to fight off grave robbers, it contains 57 in. (145 cm) of surrounding walls and fences, and a set of Dead Trees for added atmosphere.  \nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\nTombstones\nTomb\nDead Trees\nUndertaker Hut (kickstarter exclusive!)\n 3\u00d7 Straight Walls\nCurved Walls\n 2\u00d7 Straight Pillars\nCorner Pillars\nMiscellaneous Pillars\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nSmall Graveyard Gates (gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $367, but for our backers it is discounted to $330.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save $64.\nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\n\nThe Priest pledge contains all that a big city Graveyard should have. Many tombstones and other common Graveyard features are complemented by Walls and Fences that allow you to enclose your Graveyard through your own, intricate design, topped with magnificent Graveyard Gates. The total length of walls in this set is 88 in. (223 cm). To round it off, this pledge also includes two sets of Dead Trees to make your crows feel right at home. \nIt consists of the following:\nChapel\nMausoleum\n 2\u00d7 Tombstones\nTomb\n 2\u00d7 Dead Trees\nUndertaker Hut (kickstarter exclusive!)\nGraveyard Gates\n 3\u00d7 Straight Walls\n 3\u00d7 Curved Walls\n 3\u00d7 Straight Pillars\nCorner Pillars\n 2\u00d7 Miscellaneous Pillars\nGargoyles (kickstarter exclusive gift - if unlocked)\nSmall Graveyard Gates (gift - if unlocked)\nRuined Walls (gift - if unlocked)\nShrine (gift - if unlocked)\nAccess to purchase all add-ons.\n\nRegular price for this set (after kickstarter) will be $540, but for our backers it is discounted to $486.\nIncluding discount and gifts (if unlocked) you save a massive $131.\nTo see more info on each of these elements, check out the Add-Ons section.\nIn order to process this project we will be shipping in groups with slightly different fulfillment times - which will be listed for each backer level.\nAfter you have chosen a Pledge level (reward), you can choose to add any add-on to your pledge. Each Add-on has the price tag next to it. You simply click on Manage your pledge and increase the amount pledged for the value of the chosen add-on. You can choose any number of each add-on, you just need to increase the full amount pledged for the total value of all add-ons chosen. \n\nFor example, you can choose the Crow pledge level, and want to add one additional set of Tombstones and a set of Dead Trees add-on. You select the Crow pledge and then use Manage your pledge to increase the total amount pledged for the amounts of $36 for the additional Tomstones and $46 for the Set of Dead Trees. So your total pledge would be $131 + $36 + $46 = $213. You can manage your pledge any number of times during the campaign. After the campaign, you will be asked which add-ons you have chosen in our Pledge Manager.\n\nOne of the great features of the new Graveyard kit is modularity without sacrificing quality or detail. We designed a system of walls and fences that allows you to make the Graveyard to your own liking. Once you've enclosed your burial ground, it is time to fill it with some tombstones, tombs, mausoleums or even some trees, the chapel or an undertaker hut. Feel free to add any number of these to your pledge. In addition, these add-ons can be used in various ways, not necessarily as a part of the Graveyard. For example, the Chapel can be a stand-alone piece and can fit in various settings, the Undertaker Hut can be used as a shed of any kind, and the possibilities of the fences are andless.\n\nThe Chapel is a great addition to any gaming table, and it fits in many different settings and time periods. Apart from using it with Graveyard, it can be used as a small roadside chapel for example, or maybe even a private family chapel in your town.\nDimensions: 9 x 4 x 4 in. (23 x 10 x 10 cm)\nChapel add-on consists of 7 parts and is valued at $58\nMausoleums are monumental features and make any Graveyard, look remarkable. They are large and impressive constructions most often built for a deceased leader or nobility.\nDimensions: 6 x 3\u00bd x 4 in. (15 x 9 x 10 cm)\n Mausoleum add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $34.\nThe Tombstones present the core of any graveyard. Throughout history, graves have been a focus for mourning and remembrance. The names of relatives are often added to a tombstone over the years, so that one tombstone may chronicle the passing of an entire family spread over decades. Since tombstones and a plot in a graveyard cost money, they are also a symbol of wealth or prominence in a community. Some gravestones were even commissioned and erected to their own memory by people who were still living, as a testament to their wealth and status. In this set you will find the tombstones of various sizes, as well as some vases and crows!\nTombstones add-on consists of 33 parts and is valued at $36.\nTombs are small buildings that serve as a repository for the remains of the dead. To get even more variety in your Graveyard pick a tomb or two. :)\nDimensions: 4 x 2\u00bd x 3 in. (10 x 6 x 8 cm)\nTomb add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $18.\nDead Trees will give your Graveyard that creepy, dark atmosphere and make it more intriguing. Dead Trees can be used in all settings.\nDimensions: \nTree one: 8\u00bd x 5 x 4 in. (22 x 13 x 10 cm)\nTree two: 7 x 7 x 4 in. (18 x 18 x 10 cm)\nDead Trees add-on consists of 11 parts and is valued at $46.\nThis Kickstarter exclusive add-on will make your Graveyard standout. The Undertaker Hut comes with lots of cool details like a coffin, shovel, pickaxe, hoe, saw and a workbench. The hut can be also used in different roles and various settings.\nDimensions: 3 x 4 x 3 in. (8 x 10 x 8 cm)\nUndertaker Hut add-on consists of 8 parts and is valued at $42.\nThis massive, decorative Graveyard gate, with iron doors and inscription in stone will make your graveyard a true centerpiece! The gates are a part of the Fences system, but can be used as a standalone structure as well. The doors are hinged and fully functional.\nDimensions: 5 x 7 x \u00be in. (13 x 18 x 2 cm)\n Graveyard gate add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $24.\nWe designed a system of walls and fences that gives you endless possibilities! There are five types of pillars with different indentations and two types of walls with corresponding projections that allow you to assemble walls and fences in any shape you like! This system may be used in various ways, not only for graveyards. They are perfect for urban and rural settings.\nStraight Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $22.\nDimensions of one section: 2\u00bd x 1\u00bd x \u00bd in. (6 x 4 x 1 cm)\nCurved Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $22.\nDimensions of one section: 1\u00be x 1\u00bd x \u00bd in.

We will constantly work on new add-ons and present them to you during the campaign.\nUnlocked at $45,000\nWhat is a Graveyard without some menacing Gargoyles. Spice up your Graveyard and give it that Gothic feel with a Kickstarter exclusive set of these fantastical animals.\nGargoyles add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $10.\nUnlocked at $50,000\nIf you are making a smaller Graveyard and need an entrance that is not so grandiose, Small Gates are a perfect solution! Also, if your Graveyard is big in size, Small Gates are ideal for adding the secondary entrance in the back or the sides. The doors are hinged and fully functional. \nSmall Gates add-on consists of 4 parts and is valued at $17.\nUnlocked at $55,000\nRuined walls are perfect to make additional access points to your graveyard, or any other feature that is enclosed in walls and fences. They will also make your setting visually more interesting. You can combine them in various ways and use them as a part of Walls & Fences system. The possibilities are endless!\nRuined Walls add-on consists of 5 parts and is valued at $28.\nUnlocked at $60,000\nA Wayside Shrine is a religious image, usually in some sort of small shelter, placed by a road or pathway, sometimes in a settlement or at a crossroads, but often in the middle of an empty stretch of country road, or at the top of a hill or mountain. The Wayside Shrine is designed as a part of the Walls & Fences system. However, you can use it as standalone feature as well.\nWayside Shrine add-on consists of 3 parts and is valued at $22.\nUnlocked at $90,000\nThe Church can be featured in the Graveyard, but also as a part of a nearby village or a town. While the smaller Chapel is perfect to serve as a Chantry where the prayers for the dead are made, the Church, bigger in size, can accommodate more townsfolk for their daily worship.\nDimensions: 12 x 7 x 4 in. (30 x 18 x 10 cm)\nChurch add-on consists of 9 parts and is valued at $89\nUnlocked at $95,000\nChurch/Chapel Accessories add-on. A nice 7 part set to fill up your Chappel or Church. Note that this set is free to all who add the Church to their pledge. If you want this set, and don't want the Church, or you need more than one set, you can add it to your pledge at $14 a piece.\nChurch Accessories add-on consists of 7 parts and is valued at $14\nUnlocked at $100,000\nCorpse Cart add-on. Many Londoners from the 1665 and the Black Plague period would remember a lot of these roaming around the city. Bring out the dead, the undertaker would yell, while carrying the corpses to the outskirts of the town to be buried with no name.\nFor the 100,000 goal, we decided to treat you with a freebie. Note that Corpse Cart is a free gift  for all pledges above $100. For smaller pledges and those who want more than one Corpse Cart, you can always take more for $14 a piece.\nCorpse Cart add-on consists of 3 parts and is valued at $14\nThis grandiose and towering structure is a perfect centerpiece that will make your Graveyard truly spectacular! \nKing\u2019s Mausoleum will be priced at $92.

The discount will range from $0.5 (for Crow backers), up to a massive $3 (for heavy backers with $800 pledged or more) for every $1000 pledged above $100,000. So, for example, if we get to $130,000, heavy backers with $800+ pledged will get the King\u2019s Mausoleum for free!!!\nNote that the discount will be calculated when the Graveyard Kickstarter campaign ends. Each backer will be able to add the King\u2019s Mausoleum to his reward in the pledge manager after the campaign, at the according price.\nBe sure to spread the word about this deal, as it is up to you how much will the King\u2019s Mausoleum cost in the end!\nUnlocked at $115,000\nMake life easier for your Undertaker! This little beast helps him to pull the cart around and makes for a good company. :)\nDonkey add-on consists of 1 part and is valued at $10\nNote that this photo is for display purpose only.

Would you like a free game?  Scroll down to see our REFERRAL BONUS CONTEST.\nWe developed our game to entertain family and other visitors to our home.  What started as a card game grew into the board game we all love today.  We meant to introduce this game to like-minded tabletop fans at the last two Gary Cons but the pandemic halted the notion.  Recently, we decided to launch our game on Kickstarter.  We're a little company consisting of family and friends, but our ideas are big. Become a backer to help us get bigger and better with every project.  Thanks!\n\nThe primary reasons we are passionate about bringing this game to as many players as possible are:\n1.  We hope to pay our artist, Kristen Puckett of Ballyraven Studios, enough to secure her work and vision for other upcoming games, storybooks and adventure modules.  \n2.  We have over a dozen other projects waiting to be completed, tabletop games, storybooks, RPG adventure modules, and three Dial the Dice follow-up editions.  We hope this Kickstarter is our first step in a long journey.  \n3.   We have made many close and loving friends, from all over the world, at game conventions.  The sense of community and comradery we've felt from these wonderful people over the years is unmatched.  We hope our game will bring some of that feeling to your tabletop as well.  \n\n*NOTE: Though the estimated shipping date is for October, we believe we will be able to beat this deadline significantly.  Scroll down for more details.\n NOTE: Backers who are camera shy may consider their favorite pet's head for the Early Bird Reward instead of their own.  \nShown here is the concept example. The final \"floating head\" box top will be more refined to blend in with the box. Enhanced colors, possible gray as shown in the YOU BEASTIE! Reward. Specific style of the floating head will be determined by the quality of pictures provided by backers.\n\nBox contents are described below in both text and video.\n\nThis is a concept image. Text placement and font may vary.\n Some pawns do not have sufficient overhead space for text. Below is a list of the pawns suitable for your special name.  \"Give me a name, Bastian!\"\n3 Webbers, 2 Goblins, Ghosts, and Chiweenie-bats, 1 Bear, Boar, and Deer.  Named Beasties will have a unique special ability chosen just for them listed in the rulebook.\nExamples: Lost Caverns of the Dread Myra Scott, George's Hardy Apple Grove, Cassie Joe's Swamp of Slump.\n Prime Real Estate is limited so get yours before another nasty beastie inhabits the lair. We will keep track of available options on our DtD Facebook page.  We will work with you on the name of your real estate concerning flow and text space on the game board.\nUnlike the prototype above, your final Beastie will have a forest background on the pawn.\n YOU BEASTIE is a first come first serve reward.  Backers may choose to morph with the following Beasties: 3 zombies, 3 goblins, 2 dwarfs, 2 trolls, or 2 cuddly mole people. Due to space on the pawn, your beastie name will be in the rulebook next to your personalized special ability (chosen just for you by one of our fair and balanced DtD rules creators). Everyone loves a surprise!\nExtra and enhanced artwork will be provided by Ballyraven Studio, examples are shown below.\n\n\nWe can make this happen very quickly as we have already tested out multiple prototypes and revised artwork.  What you see in our promo videos is pretty close, if not exactly, to what most of the game pieces will look like.  Our beloved artist, from Ballyraven Studios, has agreed to enhance and add even more artwork if certain stretch goals are unlocked.  My quotes from manufacturers are approved and ready for mass production.  Only additions and upgrades from the STRETCH GOALS will add any more time to the process.  The video below shows what you can expect in the core game box when it arrives.  NOTE: The rulebook is spotlighted in another video.\nUse the unique Dice Dials (left) to move your Hero across the board OR use your favorite set of polyhedral dice (right)!\nCheck out our DtD Facebook page for details on alternative ways to play!\n Them: \"A modular board game? No way!\"          \n Us: \"Way.\"\nSome components may change due to stretch goal success and other beneficial additions such as art and design enhancements.\nGoblin and Saint Heroes Included in Every Box.\nWizard and Warrior Heroes Included in Every Box.\nUnlock the Trios of Heroes: Shrouds of Shadow and The Mighty Mythlanders.\n Shrouds of Shadow: Hunter, Thief, Bard           Mighty Mythlanders: Dwarf, Elf, Gnome\n\nEnjoy some videos below which spotlight certain aspects and components of \nDial the Dice: Fantasy Edition.\n How do we keep track of referrals? The old fashioned way. If you become a backer by referral, simply send us a PM of the name of your referral. Once a referral source is claimed by 3 backers, the name is added to our super-cool random drawing list!\nShipping information has been updated and is now included in the pledge process.\nTerms and Conditions:  By backing this Kickstarter, you are acknowledging and agreeing to the details of this page and that the final reward may have some slight changes such as, but not limited to, artwork enhancements, additions, or possible reformatting.  Note that any and all changes would be done with the benefit of the backers in mind.  Some of the process such as manufacturing and shipping, may be out of our control but we will endeavor and end up with the best possible outcome for our backers.  When the campaign ends we are responsible to ship the rewards to you after payments are secured.\n\nSome rewards require collaboration between game design team and backers. In such instances, backers are responsible to supply pictures, name spellings, and an email stating that their submitted name and/or image submissions are given freely and with permission from the name and/or image holder. Names and images which are suspect of social irresponsibility or in poor taste may be declined (in which case, alternate names and/or images may be submitted). As long as submissions are family friendly there should be no need for decline. P House Games and representatives are not responsible should a backer fail to submit required data for such rewards.  Images, spellings, and email should be submitted no later than 30 days from the last day of the campaign.  \n\nHOW TO PLAY: For a core rules game, players maneuver their hero pawns across the game board by dialing dice to specific numbers and number combinations. This allows players to call upon certain moves, abilities, skills, etc. for their hero. Event and item cards drive the hero's 12 tasks which must be accomplished to win the game.  The first player to complete 12 tasks wins.\nThere are multiple ways to play this very modular board game (refer to our Dice Dialers FB page for more details) including single player and co-op.  Official core game play rules are below and are referenced in videos above. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've done business with our manufacturers and our artists are friends and family members. Even though this is our first Kickstarter, we have personal friends who are independent game designers and have been in the business for decades. For these reasons we believe the only foreseeable risks and challenges are:\n\n 1. Any unforeseen delays from manufacturers or shipping companies.\n 2. Upper tier stretch goals will likely require a bit more time from our artist.\n 3. Social Media Presence is minimal so we will rely heavily on our backers to help us \n get the word out. The upside is that this helps keep the costs down for backers.\n\nWe already have several copies of the complete game. We will fine tune aesthetics as the Kickstarter progresses and should be ready to begin manufacturing very soon after the campaign ends (once custom data is collected from backers). Our Chief Artist, from Ballyraven Studios, will take necessary time needed to complete any additional art required by stretch goals before full production begins.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe only thing in a Dial the Dice: Fantasy Edition box that isn't made of paper is the plastic bases for the pawns.

In 2019 we visited the Desert of the Dead and manufactured its multiple armies. Now in 2021 we are expanding upon our range of fantasy miniatures once again. We have had two hugely successful Kickstarter campaigns with the most recent being well over 2000% funded after including late pledges. Now with your help we want to produce a whole load of new armies, characters and monsters. The original plan was for one big Kickstarter with a whole host of armies but in order to make each more digestible and to aid with delivery times we have adjusted to smaller campaigns.\nOur halfling campaign featured a pair of monsters designed by RJ Palmer and we got him back onboard for this one too! He drew up a total of 6 dragons for us to turn into miniatures.\nAs ever our Terrain Wizards at TTCombat have come up with some fantastic new designs to compliment the armies in this campaign!\nA 3D Render of the Halfling Mega Fortress and its interior buildings\n All of these models are 28mm scale resin figures produced in house at TTCombat HQ in the South West of England. If the project is successfully funded we are aiming to deliver the pledges in November 2021. While a huge amount of the work is already done we have learned from previous Kickstarter campaigns that it is better to overestimate the delivery date and be early than to have delays! Weekly updates to keep our backers informed have been key in our past campaigns and something we really enjoy doing after the project completes.\nA completed version of the gatehouse section\nThe majority of models come supplied with square bases to form regiments. Some items are on different bases which are noted on the add on image. Round bases are available as a bargain add on should you wish to use them differently.\nThe models are full of character and a delight to paint.\nMany of the miniatures in this Campaign are one piece however some of the more dynamic models are multi part and will require assembly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTTCOMBAT & TrollTrader employ a number of passionate gamers. We take great pride in our work and great pleasure in our gaming! We are based in Cornwall at the very bottom of the UK.\nWe handle all of our own shipping. We send thousands of orders each week so this kickstarter is in good hands.\nUK: \u00a32\nEU: \u00a34\nRest of the world: \u00a36\nThat's it! Put as many Add-ons as you like, because flat rate shipping is in!\nThere aren't any real risks! We already have almost all of the 3D files and multiple people who can produce more. We have pretty much everything else we need to complete this project in house. Previously we have had a huge number of stretch goals on our campaigns adding more and more as the projects goes on. While these are great they add a lot of extra work which have often delayed our shipping. For this campaign we have a set number and if we take them all out then thats it folks!

We are proud to be the original designers of this tray format, and though there are many knock-offs, nothing is quite like the original.  With this project, we are proud to announce our brand new Color Shift Dice Trays with some awesome new features.  With your support, we will be able to reach our launch goal, where 4 new base designs and 4 new color shift lid designs become available to our backers.  Additional stretch goals will also be added as this campaign progresses, along with some great add-on items.\n1.  New Base Designs - printed designs offer a new look to these trays.  Backers will be able to choose from 4 new designs for the base of the tray.  A non-printed grey base will also be available.\n2.  New Color Shift Transitional Foil - our new transitional foil changes with the light, offering really cool blue and purple tones to the lid designs.\n3.  New Emblem Designs - we are making several new emblems available, that have not previously been produced on our dice trays.  These emblem designs match our other dice bags and cases so you can add to your collections.\n4.  Fully Customized Project - you get to choose your base designs, and you pick your lid emblems.  Mix and match designs as you choose with no limitations.\n\n\nStep 1 - Choose Your Base Design\nBase Design 'A'\nBase Design - 'A'\nBase Design 'B'\nBase Design - 'B'\nBase Design 'C'\nBase Design - 'C'\nBase Design 'D' \nBase Design - 'D'\nSolid Grey Color - No Design Printing\nStep 2 - Choose Your Lid Design\nOuroboros Design\nPhoenix Design\nSword Design\nDragon's Breath Design\nRaven Design\nWolf Design\nDagger Design\nCleric Design\nSpell Book Design\nCeltic Knot Dragon Design\nCthulhu Design\nLion Design\nCOLOR SHIFT FOIL - COLOR VARIATIONS\nOur Color Shift foil is designed to reflect a variation of blue and purple colors as the light in the room hits changes.  By design, this foil can have more blue or more purple in it, depending on where the material is located on the roll.  Because of that, some minor color variations can exist from one tray to another.  Below is an example of this color variation.  As you can see, the color of the stamped foil changes from light blues to dark purples, but one is darker with more purple, and the other is lighter with more blue tones.  \nPLAY\n\nDice Tray Details\nThis style of dice tray was designed by Easy Roller Dice Company a couple of years ago.  As fans of this design already know, the base of the dice tray is divided into two areas - the raised dice staging area, and the center rolling area.\nThe dice staging area is perfect for keeping your dice out of the way of your rolling space.  This staging area can hold about 30 standard-sized polyhedral dice and helps to minimize your dice moving around in transport.\n\nThis tray design also features a tight-fitting lid that will keep the contents of the tray secure during transport and between gaming sessions.  With the lid on, you can throw this in a backpack, the trunk of your car, or put it right on the shelf knowing that your dice or miniatures inside will the secure.\nHere's a look at the dice staged around the rolling surface in the staging area.\nReward Details\nFor this project, backers will simply choose the number of dice trays they would like from the rewards column on the right.\nStretch Goals\n All of the dice & dice cup stretch goals will be able to be purchased as an add-on to your pledge when they become unlocked.  All of the trays listed below will become selectable once at the end of the campaign if they become unlocked when we reach the desired stretch goal dollar amount listed beside the items.\nThe Metal Dice of Ancient Dragons Silver 7 Piece Set With Purple Numbering is now unlocked!  You can now add one of these sets to your pledge by simply selecting your pledge tier and selecting this as an add-on.  This will add $25 to your pledge when you add it on! You can add as many sets to your pledge as you'd like.  If additional sets of dice in this campaign unlock you'll be able to select from any of them!\nMatching Color Shift Dice Cups\n This series of cups are now available to add to your pledge!  You can do that under any tier.  The system will ask you if you'd like a cup to add-on.

As promised, here are the two other great powers of Valerna, ancestral Nahuac and blessed Ysval, ready to enter the fray!\nValerna is a continent filled with magic, powerful nations, great heroes and dragons. These forces fight to exert their own ideals in a land with no gods, where only mortals, and how they use their power, can decide the world's fate.\nEach realm in Valerna espouses different moral values, wields different magic, and uses different weapons and tactics. The Winner of the War is not only the strongest force, but also the one that better knows how to turn their philosophy into power, and their character into weapons.\nThe greatest of these champions are the Dragonbonded - leaders of the mortal armies who have joined their lives with those dragons, and whose actions are destined to reshape history.\nYou can enjoy all of this magic in our original Wargame, where special effects, upgrading dice and bonding with dragons can give the upper hand. In it, players build armies and challenge each other, acting and reacting to the events that unfold on the battlefield.\nThe battlefield is represented by a gaming table where both armies are deployed. Each side has different units, and the armies are unique; the final objective is to beat your opponent. Players deploy their armies and strategies, however, luck plays an important role, as the dice will ultimately decide the success of an attack or action.\nEnter the world of Dragonbond, build an army like no other and use each unique part of your army to your advantage. Whether through decimation or the completion of special requirements, only one may be the victor.\n1: Players assemble an army with several units led by a Dragonbonded general, who can turn the tide of a battle.\n2: By using exchangeable cards, you can pair units with different captains. Dragons and generals are also coupled with archetypes of your choice.\n3: The dice system in the game allows you to upgrade your dice, giving some control over rolls and results, to match your strategy while retaining the thrill of chance.\n4: To achieve victory, you must complete particular objectives such as getting first blood, wiping out entire units, or reaching strategic locations, to score points at the end of each round.\n5: Players alternate activations for their units, after most actions, the units become fatigued. You must assess the risk and rewards of using your most powerful units in a single round; with too much fatigue, their dice rolls could be permanently downgraded.\n6: Your captains provide unique abilities to your units while they are alive. When your unit gets enough wounds, you must remove one of its models. If you choose to sacrifice the captain, a new special ability will be activated.\n7: Your General\u2019s abilities change the way your units and strategy feel and play. Dragons are powerful units that can wipe out entire enemy squads. Both of them can be customized with archetypes cards.\nExcept for the base one-dollar pledge, every pledge, regardless of its tier, includes not only the rules to our game, but a primer of our factions and the world of Valerna. Higher tiers involve from one to four STL packs of our armies. Terrains, additional game components, returning armies and RPG adventures  are not only available on higher tiers, they are also individually available as add-ons.\nThe base rewards for this campaign are the armies of Nahuac and Ysval, ready to join the ever-expanding world of Valerna; however, this is also a chance to build your own armies of Allaria and Tyveria if you were unable in our previous campaign.\nNahuac\nBuilt by the shape-shifting and humanoid animal peoples of Valerna, the Nahuinn coalition is a powerhouse made up of a vast array of cultures pulled together by their respect of the balance of nature. From the wise bendavee to the swift munkisoot and headstrong ocelinn, Nahuac and its people will prevail.\n\n\nYsval\nForged by the cold and a deep-rooted sense of collaboration and community, the Holy Ysvalian Alliance has made a fertile paradise of the unforgiving north of Valerna. Allied with the Hmyr giants and the good-life loving Pints, Ysvalians bring a strong, stern challenge to all on the battlefield.\nReturning favorites\nThe dream-shaping Allarian kingdom and the blood-centric Tyverian Empire return. This is one more chance to build your very own complete set of all armies of Valerna.\nDive into the fascinating world of Dragonbond. Explore the realms of Valerna as developed by veteran artists who have worked on projects at Wizards of the Coast, Blizzard and other such companies.

Keep in touch with us through our social media pages:\nBuilding a universe as vast and wild as Dragonbond is a constant push, pull and elbow bumping between writers, artists and the budding creativity that comes from working in games. We wanted to make a world that felt fresh in the saturated scheme of high fantasy, and we think we made it. Here are a few sketches and growth given to Erandi.\n\nWe created Nahuac and the Coatl brood to honor our legacy as Mexicans and explore the fun and thematic promise of a land shaped by cosmopolitan understanding and balance-focused collaboration. Erandi, our Ocelinn bonded, stands as a warrior leader who stands in high contrast to the endless political machinations of her neighbors. Tezcoatl, her bonded dragon, rises as an incredibly curious creature, forcing Erandi to understand or, at the very least, learn a bit.\nOur bearded, humble hammer, Oryan is a near undisputed favorite for Holy Duk of Ysval. His encounter with Rakzor, the stubborn and violent Exxor dragon will change his plans forever and force him to undergo a long inner journey of growth. A paragon of strength in the Alliance, Oryan will never falter at the face of danger, regardless of whether he fears it or not.\n\nWe wanted a balancing shape to the dark, looming presence of Tyveria and the Null. Despite  his own flaws and responsibility, Oryan\u2019s character had to be happy and boisterous to not only shed light into our world, but to challenge it.\nPlease enjoy this video of our beloved art director Tom Babbey, with concept artists Steve Prescott and Vinod Rams as they discuss the process of creating art as wonderful as theirs.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop , the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th campaign.

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works? Check out the preview of The Darkest House now for a look at a few of the rooms and features. Download it for either macOS or Windows (below). Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map? Click them, and the description will open to the right.\nSome items aren't tagged on the map. Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

These include such varied items as corebooks for Numenera and The Cypher System, super-complex boxed games such as Invisible Sun, leather-bound deluxe corebooks, dozens of hardcover supplements, signed bookplates, playtest access, special-access seminars, meetings and dinners with the creative team, online and in-person games, and so much more.\n\nThus, while there are always challenges that can arise, we've probably already faced them. We are extremely proud of our track record, and we're confident that this project will meet all its promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nThis campaign is funding digital rewards only.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "The Darkest House", "descp": "The house invites you in.\nThe house hates you.\nThe house relishes solitude.\nThe house is lonely.\nThe house is in pain.\nThe house wants your pain.\nThe house hates you.\nYou get a complete copy of The Darkest House, including any upgrades resulting from stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Darkest House", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["719 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "Exclusive: The Devoured Halls", "descp": "The House is not alone.\nYou get a complete copy of The Darkest House, including any upgrades resulting from stretch goals.

Here you will learn the secrets of the world's best miniature painters!\nWe have partnered up with 4 of the best painters in the industry. Each one will paint 12 different miniatures to their highest level of quality. Then you, the backers, will choose 24 miniatures for us to paint on camera (6 models from each painter). This gives you the opportunity to select only the very best work from each painter!\nNO EXPERIENCE REQUIRED! This series is perfect for beginners and professionals alike. Our goal is to help you quickly improve your skills by building upon each subsequent lesson. Each video will introduce new skills and techniques to help you quickly master the art of miniature painting. By end of the series - you will be a miniature painting GOD!\nAll 48 miniatures have been carefully selected to demonstrate a wide variety of learning techniques. We include male and female characters, humans and monsters, fantasy and sci-fi. \nThe following is a list of miniatures we've selected for each painter. (Disclaimer: This list may be subject to change. We do not claim ownership of any character or image used. Copyrights belong to their respective owners.)\nBelevor Ranger by RN Estudio (32mm)\nCrescendia - Greek Warrior by RN Estudio (54mm)\nWitch-Queen by ArtelW (45mm)\n Beast Slayer by ArtelW (83mm)**\nRuna - Dwarven Beauty by Artisan Guild (28mm)\nKuo-Toa Sage by Print'n Paint (45mm)\nHigh Lord by ArtelW (34mm)\nOrc Queen V1 by Yedharo Models (55mm)\nLantern Guard by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nDeath High Archivist by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nOgre Chieftan by Reaper (28mm)\nHalfdan, Giant slayer Dwarf by Print'n Paint (35mm)\n\nBronen The Barbarian by Joaquin Palacios (35mm)\nDrogor the Half Orc by Joaquin Palacios (35mm)\nNorse Blacksmith by Andrea Miniatures (54mm)\nLerta the Cursed by Signum Games (39mm)\nJarvis, Militia Sergeant by Signum Games (40mm)\nElite Ratman Commander by Punga Miniatures (28mm)\nHill Giant Lowland Warrior by Reaper Miniatures (40mm)\nKavorgh, Orc Warboss by Reaper Miniatures (30mm)\n Skawt`n`Rekkon Kammandah by ArtelW (38mm)**\nEinherjar`s Tank Commander by ArtelW (30mm)\nDeath High Lucy by Kingdom Death (28mm)\nHulk Minotaur Hero by Print'n Paint (28mm)\n Liath by Kimera Models (75mm)**\nMordwael, Dreaguth Warrior by Mierce Miniatures (28mm)\nSister Bloodshedda by ArtelW (35mm)\nWarlock of Crimson Legion by ArtelW (40mm)\nGreatblade Grey-Fur by Mierce Miniatures (55mm)\nOrc Marauder by First Legion (38mm)\nIorwerth, Teulu Warrior by Mierce Miniatures (28mm)\nMastermind Brute by ArtelW (33mm)\nBarthum the Mighty Dwarven Warrior by First Legion (28mm)\nBarbarian Dude - Definitive Edition (40mm)\nVampire Zombie by Titan Forge (28mm)\nJusticia,  Female monster hunter by RN Estudio (32mm)\nDisciple of Vidarr by Durgin Paint Forge (28mm)\nIron Crow Warrior by Durgin Paint Forge (28mm)\nAncient Barbarians by Print'n Paint (30mm)\n Leader of the Dread Squad by ArtelW (48mm)**\nGoblin King by Print'n Paint (40mm)\nMutant Ratmen by Print'n Paint (32mm)\nArtemisa Goddess by RN Estudio (32mm)\nTahnar by Titan-Forge (32mm)\nKobold by Manuel Boria (42mm)\nTroll by Manuel Boria (60mm)\nVampire Zombie by Titan Forge (28mm)\nThe Unspeakable by Print'n Paint (60mm)\n ** counts as two choices (due to size and number of small details).\nWe've partnered up with 4 of the MOST FAMOUS painters in the industry. Each one of them has won multiple awards for their work and each of them have over 15,000 followers across social media.\nIf you want to keep up to date with the painting progress follow them now! They will be posting their progress on their 12 miniatures here!\nRodrigo Cipres - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nRobert Karlsson - follow him on FACEBOOK\nArnau Lazaro - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nDavid Arroba - follow him on INSTAGRAM\nBelow are some examples of the INCREDIBLE WORK they have done over the years! And guess what... they are even better TODAY!!!\nOnce the Kickstarter is funded our painters will begin painting up their miniatures. Over the 60 days of the Kickstarter, each of them will paint 4-5 miniatures from their list of 12.\nAll 12 miniatures will be fully painted by the end of July 2021. Once all 48 miniatures are painted, backers will have 7 days to vote for their favorite 24 to see re-created on camera (6 miniatures from each painter).\nFilming with our first artist will begin in August 2021. Each Artist will film for 15-20 days. Once filming is done, the edited video bundle will be available within 3 weeks.\nThere are 4 video bundles - each video bundle will be released approximately 2 months apart. The first video bundle will be available in September 2021 (see schedule below).\nA two-month gap between video bundles gives us ample time to film and edit - and it gives you the backer time to watch each bundle.\nPROFESSIONALY FILMED in 8K\nTypical miniature painting videos (You-Tube/Patreon/Twitch) use consumer camcorders which highly compress the video files. Those files are compressed again when uploaded to platforms like YouTube, suffering a DOUBLE HIT to their quality.\nOur videos will be captured in super high quality 8K video using professional broadcast/film equipment. This allows us to retain 5 - 10 times more information per-frame than typical camcorders used on YouTube/Patreon/Twitch.\nDOWNLOADABLE FILES - That's right! Once the videos are edited you'll be given a link to download the files. That means NO DOUBLE HIT to the image quality - and no shipping delays!!!\nWhere are the 8K video samples you ask? \nUnfortunately, we don't have any - 8K is incredibly expensive to shoot in. So, it's an all or nothing deal. We can't justify purchasing the equipment simply to shoot a 20 second test video if the Kickstarter is unsuccessful.\nAside from a new camera, we need a ton of brand new equipment specially designed to handle the massive data from 8K. The high-speed hard drives alone will cost well over $10,000! (we have lots of footage to capture).\nWe have been making miniature painting videos with world's best artists for over 10 years - you are in good hands. We know this industry inside and out!\nYou can check out some cool videos shot in 8K on YouTube. This is the quality you can expect!\nHere is a sample of a painting video we have shot in past. It's 47 minutes long and will give you a good idea of our work. Click the image below to download the file - it's too big to post on Kickstarter (over 1.5 GB). If you see an \"ERROR', simply refresh/reload the page. Enjoy!\nTHIS IS NOT 8K - Our 8K videos will have 5 - 10 times better quality!\nAGAIN - THIS IS NOT 8K - Our 8K videos will have 5 - 10 times better quality!\nThe \"K\" in \"8K\" stands for \"thousand\". It refers to the number of horizonal pixels in one frame of video. 8K has approximately 8000 horizonal pixels! \nWhy shoot in 8K?\nBefore we explain why we are shooting in 8K, you need to understand how most people view their video content online. Most people own computer monitors with HD or less resolution (1920 x 1080 resolution). Only 2% of people own a 4K monitor - even less have an 8K monitor.\nLost yet? Don't worry - this concept can be a bit confusing to most people. You are probably wondering - \"If the majority of monitors can't support 8K or even 4K, then why shoot in these super-high resolution formats? Is it a gimmick?\"\nNo, it's not a gimmick! The millions of extra pixels in 8K give us 2 major advantages:\n#1 INCREDIBLE IMAGE QUALITY\n8K cameras produces INCREDIBLE VIDEO QUALITY - especially when viewed on a HD 1080p monitor. This is the format Hollywood movies are shot in. NOTHING comes close!\n#2 CLOSEUP ACTION WITHOUT PIXELIZATION\nFor miniature painting videos, the real advantage is what we can do with the footage AFTER we have recorded it. We have MILLIONS of extra pixels we can zoom-in or pan around without having to create \"new\" pixels that don't exist in the original image (viewed at 1080p).\nBasically, we can get closer to the miniature than ever before! No more craning your neck and squinting your eyes to see what the painter is doing!\nWe are the people behind Master Of Anatomy - a publishing company that creates art books with artists from Disney, Pixar, Sony Animation, Marvel and DC Comics.\nWe've worked with some of the world's best artists like Adam Hughes, Joe Madureira, J. Scott Campbell, Kim Jung Gi, Adam Hughes, Loish, Humberto Ramos, Pascal Campion and Derek Laufmann.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our seventh Kickstarter and we've learned a lot about communication and transparency with our backers.

Everdell is a game of dynamic tableau building and worker placement played over four seasons. Whoever makes the most impressive city wins! \n\nOn your turn, you can take one of three actions:\na) Place a Meeple: You have a collection of wooden Critter meeples. You can place these on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Critter meeples allow you to perform various actions to develop your city: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.\nb) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.\nc) Prepare for the next Season: Critter meeples are returned to your supply and you gain bonuses depending on the season. The game is played from one year\u2019s winter through to the end of autumn. Players add up the points from their cards and other bonuses and whoever has the highest total wins!\nNew content that will delight and surprise you for many more seasons to come!\nGolden Occupied Tokens\nThe new Critter and Construction cards in Newleaf are played like normal Critter and Construction cards from the base game, except that you use Golden Occupied tokens instead of normal occupied tokens. These Golden Occupied tokens are limited -- a player can never use more than 3 in a game! These new cards are very powerful, so choose wisely which you'll spend your Golden Occupied tokens on! \n\nThrough Every Season Cards\nSince the beginning of Everdell\u2019s history, farming has been a vital part of the valley\u2019s way of life. Farmers face a number of challenges through the four distinct seasons of the year and must adapt as the weather changes. Experience the story of an Everdell farm throughout the year!\nThe 8 new special Farm cards in Mistwood replace the basic Farms in your Everdell game. These often give you the choice of two abilities, and you choose which of these abilities to use each time the card activates.\n\nMore Legends\nLegendary cards represent unique Critters and Constructions that are powerful upgrades of other Critters and Constructions. Use them when you are familiar with the base game, and are looking forward to a twist on a regular game! The More Legends cards in Mistwood are added into a game of Everdell in the same manner as the Legends from Everdell: Collector's Edition.\nNew ideas are arriving every day!\nStation Cards\nFaceup Critter and Construction cards on the Station board work like Meadow cards and may be played on your turn, but whenever you play a card from the Station, also gain the reward listed on the Train Car tile beside the card! This reward is gained after you have fully resolved the played card and any additional cards that may have activated as a result. After you've gained the reward, replenish both the Train Car tile and the card played.\nRemember: cards on the Station board are not Meadow cards, and therefore any abilities that affect Meadow cards (such as the Inn) do not apply to Station cards!\n\nVisitors\nNewleaf is a bustling and growing city in Everdell, and now that the railway system is in full operation, many new critters and big ideas are coming into the Emerald Valley. The Visitor cards that come into play on the Station Board offer players a new end game scoring opportunity!\nTo gain a Visitor card on your turn:\nPlace a worker on the Station. The Station is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nChoose 1 of the faceup Visitor cards and discard it facedown on the Visitor discard pile.\nReveal 1 new Visitor card and choose 1 of the 2 faceup Visitor cards to take and place by your city. If you do not want either of the faceup Visitors, you may draw 1 from the top of the Visitor deck instead. If you selected one of the faceup Visitors, replace its card with another one from the Visitor deck.\nGain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles by the Station; set that tile aside and draw a replacement tile.\nVisitor cards will score their listed point values, if your city contains their requirements at the end of the game. Visitor cards that you have obtained and failed to please (by not meeting their requirements) are not worth any points at the end of the game.\n\nThe Knoll\nYou may place a worker on the Knoll to choose any 3 cards from the Meadow and/or the Station to discard. Replenish the discarded cards from the main deck, and draw any 3 cards into your hand from the Meadow and/or the Station. After drawing your cards, you may then gain the reward shown on 1 of the Train Car tiles. Set that Train Car tile aside and draw a replacement tile from the bag. Finally, replenish the 3 cards you drew into your hand.\nThe Knoll is a shared location, allowing several workers at once, but you may only have 1 of your workers on this location at a time.\nEverdell has a brand new villainess!\nNow while playing Everdell, you can pit your wits against Nightweave, our newest automated player for solitaire and two-player games. Nightweave is designed to function like a real player at your table: she has her own hand of cards, Prepares for Seasons on her own schedule, and, most importantly, she has her own agenda!\n\nNightweave has her own Big Critter meeple along with 8 spider meeples (not just 6!) that will move about the board to do her bidding -- blocking exclusive Locations, taking events away before you can get them, and even enacting Plots and Plans that will interfere with your options as a player, reminiscent of the Weather cards from Spirecrest.  She has eight different personalities that influence what she targets and focuses on, so there's lots of variety in gameplay!\n\nWhat Happens on Nightweave's Turn?\nTurn over the top card of Nightweave's Activity deck. These cards are the heart of her decision-making during the game, instructing her to play cards into her city, place spider meeples on previous, exclusive Locations, take a Basic or Special event, etc.\nNightweave will perform the first action listed for her current season, if possible. If she cannot perform this action for any reason, she will take the second action for her current season. If she cannot take that action either, she will perform as much of the Default action at the bottom of the card as she can. This could include discarding cards, collecting point tokens (yes, really!), and/or a number of other actions.\nIf Nightweave herself is in the Meadow and there are no spiderlings left in her lair when she draws an Activity card with a Spider or Nightweave icon, she will Prepare for Season. \nThe game ends when you run out of actions and when Nightwave Prepares for Season at the end of Autumn.\n\nCan you stop Nightweave from taking over Everdell? Check out the Rulebook for more in-depth information about this automated player! \nhttps://static1.squarespace.com/static/5eefaf5a2819042bf0d4099b/t/6047b72c79a2da41d1f2a50c/1615312716704/Prototype+Rulebook+%281%29.pdf\nAll items shown are available as add-ons in Kickstarter and will also be available to add to your pledge in the Pledge Manager after the campaign.

We are now able to offer shipping to all destinations outside of those listed above only if the backer accepts that we are unable to provide free reshipments for any packages lost in transit (We typically offer one reshipment at no additional shipping cost for areas listed on our Destination Summary.) \nWe plan to ship these packages worldwide from our fulfillment center in Germany (for best cost), so please take that into account when considering your import costs. Due to the reliability challenges for destinations not listed specifically in our destinations graphic above, if your package is lost in transit, we will only be able to provide you with a reshipment if you pay the shipping cost again.\n\nBy backing this campaign and asking us to ship your rewards to an address outside of the locations listed on our Destination Summary, you understand and agree that you are responsible for paying the cost for a reshipment in the event that your initial shipment is lost in transit. The reshipment cost for lost packages is the same cost as listed on the shipping table here. You also agree that you are responsible for paying any taxes, customs, and other local fees or charges associated with receiving your rewards. \nWe collect and remit taxes for each of these regions described below, as required by local law and our scope of business. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs. Taxes will be collected in the pledge manager after the campaign along with shipping. Remember, we are a US company registered in these territories, so rates may be different than you\u2019re used to seeing for local companies! Please see below for more information about the tax rates to be collected for each destination. The pledge manager will calculate and collect the appropriate tax based on the many requirements in place at the time the pledge manager runs. For all destinations outside of these specifically listed below, you may be required to remit local taxes yourself.\nClick here to see local tax rates in the U.S.\nWe collect and remit sales tax in all US states where we\u2019re required to by our scope of business and local laws. You can find your local sales tax rate here: https://taxify.co/state-resource-map/. Please note that in some states we may opt to use a single nexus point and collect the same rate for the whole state, as allowed by local law. \nClick here to see tax rates in Canada.\nWe collect and remit HST (which includes GST and PST), and QST as required by Canadian law. The amount will vary by province and territory, so please reference this guide for more details and to see your local rate: https://www.retailcouncil.org/resources/quick-facts/sales-tax-rates-by-province/ \nWe collect and remit VAT as required by UK law.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent.

You will choose the language of your rewards during the pledge manager phase [suivez ce lien pour toutes les infos en fran\u00e7ais !]\nEncyclopedia Standard Edition included in the $40 reward tier\nEncyclopedia in a Nutshell\nEncyclopedia is a 360-page lore book for your 5th Edition campaign, including dozens of ready-to-use cities, locations, NPCs, plot hooks, and magic items for your next game session.\n As a game master, you have a lot to do. Planning, writing, sometimes drawing, and much more!  We've been GMs for over 20 years and we are here to help. With this book, we wanted to offer you as much material as possible to make your job as a GM easier. Prepare your next game session or upgrade your worldbuilding by picking from the Encyclopedia\u2019s rich contents and cook up your own unforgettable stories!\nEncyclopedia Red Dragon Deluxe Edition included in the $70 reward tier and up\nDownload a 40-page Preview of the Encyclopedia\nTo download the 40-page preview of the Encyclopedia, click the following link. If you like what you see, back us to allow us to create more :)\nWork on the Encyclopedia started in France in 2016. It took our studio four years to put together the 360 pages and hundreds of artworks depicting the cities, places, magic items, and NPCs within. The book is now translated and in the very last steps of proofreading and formatting for PDF. We plan to deliver a final version of the Encyclopedia PDF at the end of the campaign.\nCities and Places of Adventure\nAcross this book, you will find 15 cities and many locations ready to serve as the settings of your next adventures. Each of these places has its own identity, featuring many adventure hooks and dozens of memorable figures, both friends and foes: a kobold mining village, a diabolist city, a necropolis-city, a hobgoblin pirate port, and more! The Free City, described over 40+ pages, is split into 15 districts, which you can use separately, as the locales of urban adventures, or as part of a teeming metropolis.\nThis toolbox is perfect for veteran game masters who want to level up their homebrew campaign, as well as for beginners seeking readily usable content to begin their first campaign. This book can also be used as a campaign setting to play in a universe steeped in Sword & Sorcery and portraying colorful civilizations.\n\nLevel-up Your Next Story\nEncyclopedia offers colorful and diverse game material spanning 4 civilizations, each highly distinct from the others. Every one has its own atmosphere, its own mysteries, and its own antagonists.\nA meditating orc of the Iruuls - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nOne of our main objectives was to step away from the tropes of classic fantasy, where orcs and other 'greenskins' are brutish and inherently evil. Here, orcs have cultures of their own, including pacifistic ones like the Iruul orcs, and hobgoblins have a thriving culture of trading.\n\nCoat of arms of the Garden City\nYou can draw inspiration from these civilizations or use them as-is in a campaign of your creation\u2026 or you can feature them in the setting of Eana, which gathers them all!\n Free City. Join the guilds and schemes of the Free City, a cosmopolitan metropolis filled with many mysteries!\n Drakenbergen. Discover legendary valleys with hidden ancient ruins, majestic fjords, dwarven mines, raging volcanoes, and the vampiric kingdom of Kentigern, all nestled in the sprawling mountains of the Drakenbergen!\n Septentrion. Sail for faraway Bore\u00efa, the gateway to the Septentrion, and explore these frozen northern lands, populated with fearsome frost giants and holding a portal to the frozen plane of Gemoniae!\n Kaan. Ride across the steppes of Kaan, venturing into baroque, contrasted, thriving, decadent city-states. Barter with the pirates of Tili\u2019s Gulf or the shrewd merchants of Lihy\u00e2n as you bear witness to past, present, and future empires!\nA traveling hobgoblin merchant - Available as a playable species in CREATURES\nEncyclopedia is your new cookbook for your next game sessions ^^\nMagic Items\nEncyclopedia includes more than fifty magic items. Each is tied to one of the locations or personalities described in the book, providing adventure hooks and springboards for new adventures.\nYou will also find 5 optional rules to customize the use of magic items in your campaign:\n Enchanted gems. Set magic gems in weapons and armor to grant them special, unique properties!\n Magic weapon sheaths. Keep the destructive power of your weapons under control with suitable sheaths.\n War paints. In preparation for battle, draw from the ancestral might of these magic Kaani war paints.\n Magic pearls. Discover the pearls of the stone giants, which enable them to go unnoticed!\n Progressive mirafaction. Under the influence of fate and the extreme energies they are subjected to, the personal belongings of adventurers can gradually become magic items. What used to be a fine sword, a family legacy, progressively turns into a more fearsome weapon, imbued with enchantments that will become manifest at key moments of the adventurer\u2019s tribulations!\nModular System\nEncyclopedia makes use of a modular system that lets each game leader define the atmosphere they wish to create for their stories. Each of the symbols listed below indicates related optional rules, adventures hooks, and setting elements that the leader can choose to make use of within a given campaign. Do you want your game to fit the canons of heroic fantasy? Use the rules labeled \u201cAction\u201d to make the adventurers all the more powerful and successful. Do you want to play a dark-fantasy, survival-oriented game? \u201cDark\u201d and \u201cGritty\u201d options have been designed for you and will give adventurers a hard time. \nModular System Icons\nHere are three examples: \n Action. This icon indicates all the rules, magic items, and situations that offer epic options and emphasize the characters\u2019 feats and achievements.\n Corruption. The Corruption icon shows situations and magic items that lead to corruption, or which are only relevant to a corrupted creature.\n Dark. The optional rules, magic items, and situations indicated by this icon are all related to horror, madness, or corruption.\nSpice up your next campaign!\nStretch Goals!\nThe base goal will support the book\u2019s printing. Beyond that, we have several bonuses and upgrades planned to thank you for your support. To ensure a reasonable delivery schedule, all the bonuses of this campaign have already been designed. Your support will enable us to manufacture them and, most of all, send them to backers at no extra charge!

This addition is primarily designed for 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons, but also functions as a huge collection of inspiring rooms, characters and more! \nEach of these taverns can be enjoyed by any adventurer, and can be scattered across any setting! Ranging from the grim and seedy dealings in the Bloated Bounty to the world shaping Wildaback Tavern, the diversity of each tavern and inn\u2019s culture is a spectacle of its own.\nThese taverns come populated with a slew of characters, some of which can be found at any location. In addition, these buildings house a wide array of monstrous foes, magic items of varying power, and new mechanics!\nThis book is more than it seems. These taverns are laced with their own secrets, hidden histories and locked doors. But more than internal stories, the book itself serves as a guide to the hidden lore of its most prevalent characters. If you\u2019re interested in code cracking, treasure hunting and deep lore, this book is for you!\nFor the most secrets included, it\u2019s suggested you get at least the Tavern Keeper tier, but the main puzzle can be unravelled by anyone with the hardcover! \nOne of our taverns simply can\u2019t be contained inside the pages. Because it changes shape every time you visit! Using dozens of room tiles and a table with descriptions, have your players run through a potentially endless maze of rooms. If you add the arcane haze variant, filling every guest's mind with rage, you can potentially use this tavern as a standalone roguelike board game! \nIf you grab our custom card deck, you can fully immerse yourself in a newly designed game for standard playing cards. Pick your character from the court members, or the joker, and race your opponents on your own trail to victory!\nAdd-ons are a great way to get an extra item or two from a higher pledge, or previous campaign at a Kickstarter rate! All backers will have access to addons, all you have to do is back a tier of this campaign to be invited. Once the Kickstarter is complete, we'll reach out to you and ask you to confirm through the survey which addons you would like to purchase. Shipping costs for addons will be determined after the Kickstarter along with the survey. Addons from this campaign will ship along with pledges. However, backers who select any addon from Stibbles\u2019 Codex (list below) will have the option to receive these select addons earlier - estimated delivery in April 2021. Specific information on this process will be available in post-Kickstarter project updates. \nThe Seeker\u2019s Guide to Twisted Taverns\nPDF     $25\n  Hardcover    $40\n  Tavern Maps    $18\n  Quest Board    $14\n  Deck of Cards    $20\n  Dice     $15\n  Stein     $20\n  Coaster Set    $15\n  Enamel Pin Set   $15\n  Modular Tavern   $35\n  Special Edition Dice & Case  $60\n  Special Edition Book   $120\n  The Seeker Fabric Plushie   $20\n  Goblin Conductor Plushie   $20\n  Tavern Style GM Screen   $18\n  Stibbles Codex of Companions\nPlushies (Each)   $25\n  Companion Cards     $17\n  Mimcat Deck & Box   $35\n  PDF     $25\n  Hardcover    $40\n  Miniatures    $30\nThe campaign is being completed in partnership with Ghostfire Gaming - a premier TTRPG publisher, designer, and manufacturer. Ghostfire is best known for their flagship setting Grim Hollow, as well as their involvement in creating Stibbles Codex of Companions. We are very excited to be working together again!\nEach backer of The Seekers' Guide to Twisted Taverns will have exclusive access to our playtest period. Playtests will be released in PDF form at a later date, after the Kickstarter. This is a great way to get your hands on early content, play through the various taverns, and shape how they develop via our feedback surveys. We will be providing more information about how to join in on playtests after the Kickstarter.\nThis campaign offers worldwide shipping and will be collected after the campaign via the pledge manager BackerKit.

The instant we cross that line, an adventure module by Troll Lord Games becomes unlocked for our backers! TLG is a company known for their fantastic modules, and we know you'll love this one, too.

Miniatures in the game will come unpainted.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons players control a band of Heroes exploring a treacherous dungeon in search of the fearsome Dungeon Boss.\nHeroes make their way through the dungeon one room at a time. Around every corner goblins and ferocious minions seek to block the Heroes\u2019 path.  Where there isn\u2019t an enemy, traps are set, ready to spring on even the most prepared Hero.\nTiny Epic Dungeons features a modular dungeon that is unique with each play.\nThe game is played over 2 ACTS: the Dungeon and the Dungeon Boss. In both acts the players are constantly struggling against the waning firelight of their torch which decreases each turn. When the torch goes out, the Heroes are forever lost in the darkness.\nAfter clearing the dungeon of all its minions and finding the entrance to the lair, players must engage in an epic battle against the Boss. Each boss has unique abilities and a lair with a unique environment that gives various advantages and disadvantages depending on the skill used and where the Hero attacks from.\nThese Epic Monsters cannot be slain by mere swords, axes, arrows, and the occasional spell. Ritual Rooms around the dungeon must be used to lower their magical bond to the dungeon. The Dungeon boss must be lured to these rooms to lower their defenses and allow the Heroes to strike the final blow!\nVictory in Tiny Epic Dungeons is achieved by defeating the Dungeon Boss!\nIn order to do that, the Heroes will need to collect Legendary Loot, and Supreme Spells. \nHeroes of old crafted loot to honor the ways of their clans. Bear, Lion, Phoenix, and Panther. Heroes can discover pieces from these ancient sets that grow more powerful the more you collect. \nWill you be the greatest warrior the Bear clan has ever seen? Or will you make the Panther clan proud by stalking your prey and striking with surprising force, unseen before the moment of impact.\nThe story is yours to tell in...\nWhen you pledge for a Deluxe copy of Tiny Epic Dungeons, you will receive the base game PLUS the Deluxe, Potions & Perils, components shown below.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nThe Potions & Perils mini expansion brings a whole new element to the game in the way of Potions and the perilous alchemists that concoct them... the Mixy Goblins!\nMixy Goblins are added directly to the goblin deck and are encountered like normal goblins. Except, they are not like normal goblins.  When you defeat a Mixy Goblin, something explodes! You'll draw a Potion Card to see what the effect is. Each Potion Card will describe a peril that occurs when you kill a Mixy Goblin and will also leave you with a handy potion for use later!\nAdditionally,  the mini expansion brings new Dungeon Bosses, Minions and Goblins to the game. Each presenting a unique challenge that will test even the best players! \n***Kickstarter-Limited Exclusivity - Deluxe content will not enter regular distribution. However, it will be available in limited supply at conventions, through contests, online at the BGG promo store, and directly from Gamelyn Games on our website or through our Amazon store.\nThis image updates with unlocked stretch goals.\nIn Tiny Epic Dungeons: Stories players dive deeper into the lore of Aughmoore. \nThe Stories expansion introduces a new Story Mode that has Heroes completing Side Quests and adventuring deeper into the dungeon, descending Multiple Floors and eventually fighting multiple Dungeons Bosses at once!\nIn addition, Stories offers a slew of new Heroes, Loot, Dungeon Rooms, Dungeon Bosses, Minions, and Goblins! \nThe Stories expansion will come in a box of the same thickness and quality of Tiny Epic Dungeons. It will share the same length and height as well.

VAT is not included in the shipping cost and will be a separate line item in CrowdOx. Some regions do require that taxes are remitted based on both the product cost and shipping cost, so keep that in mind as you plan for these costs.\nShipping Costs\nEvery backer is important to us, regardless of location, but the reality is that shipping is very expensive and is a cost we all need to share.

It can be prone to many mistakes and delays, even for experienced publishers.\n\nWe are proud to say that we're prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in successfully producing board games and fulfilling Kickstarter projects.\n\nHere are the steps we take to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the illustrations for the game complete and the graphic art over 95% complete. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated.\n\n2. We are working with an experienced manufacturing partner. We are familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements and costs for when it comes time for shipping. We will provide tracking information for the boat when the games leave China.\n\n3. We are working with an experienced fulfillment partner. We are confident that they can handle any amount of work we send their way. They have fulfilled many projects and have proven to be communicative, punctual and respectful when dealing with our customers.\n\nAbove all, I am 100% dedicated to backer communication. I will be transparent with our process and involve our backers as much as possible. I will be present daily during the project to answer any questions and I read every comment.

This Kickstarter is for our new product: Liquid Core Spindowns! These dice have a sequential number placement for tracking life/damage in games such as Magic: The Gathering.\nOur process includes 3D printing masters, making molds, pouring resin, hand painting numbers, and talking endlessly about dice. Our dice are 34mm in size. They are filled with a top secret mixture of liquid, coloring agents, & other high quality stuff.\nWe started creating these as a result of \u201cquarantine project syndrome\u201d in March of last year. Since then we\u2019ve been developing, experimenting, and honing our craft in our basements and garages. Now, our product has become high enough quality that we feel it can no longer be kept from the rest of the world but we need your help. We\u2019re passionate about hand crafting artisan dice. The reason behind the dedication? Because it\u2019s fun, and gamers need more sparkle in their lives. Supporting our project will allow us to source the highest quality sparkle at volume pricing and it will fund continued research into developing the best liquid core dice possible\n\n\n\nThe reward tiers are simple: all pledges are the same price, but each tier is for a different shipping month. Each $39 pledge includes one liquid-core spindown in your choice of color.  As is typical with handmade items, it takes time to craft dice that measure up to our quality standards. We inspect every dice thoroughly, in order to guarantee each shipment is the best of the lot. Choose one color from the below options. \n Color Options:\nRose Pearl \nCerulean \nTwilight \nBlaze \nEmerald\nBe on the lookout for our \"Color Feature Updates\" that we will be releasing every few days. Check out the updates section for more photos and video. \nMost Recent Color Feature:\n\nStretch Goals\nTwo stretch goals have been created and they are big! When the total pledge level has reached $4000 a new color option will be made available to all backers to choose from. Then again at $5000 another color will be added to the choices. These colors are truly some of our newest and most exciting!\nUPDATE: Since we've reached $4k and $5k stretch goals already, we have created two more at $8k and $10k. At each of those goals a new color will be unlocked.\nUPDATE UPDATE: We've hit our $8k goal! Only one left!\nLAST STRETCH GOAL UPDATE: \"10K\" Gold is revealed.

Add-ons make it easy to add items to your pledge during the Kickstarter campaign when you want to mix and match items from multiple reward tiers in an unusual way (or at least, in a way the Kobolds did not anticipate!). If you want a copy of the Limited Edition, you must select that as the base reward; it is not available as an add-on.\nFor example, if you want the Limited Edition hardcover + PDF, and you also want a copy of the regular edition and both a Shard license and a Roll20 license, you will have the option to add those as add-ons to your Limited Edition package after you select your pledge level.\nThe add-ons for this project are limited to the physical book produced as part of this project. Per Kickstarter policy, we will not be offering add-on items from prior Kobold Press Kickstarters.\nThe books, PDF, and VTTs will all release in late October per the current schedule. Given how far along we are with design, development, editing, and art, this is a reasonable schedule.\nAt the same time, we're going to take a serious risk with international shipping for this project. Despite the difficulties we encountered getting Tome of Beasts 2 to backers in a timely way and the increasing costs of international shipping, we're offering the printed books as part of the Kickstarter globally. Shipping costs will be calculated separately from the Kickstarter itself and charged in a pledge manager. \nThis project will use bulk shipments to Canada, the EU, the UK, and Australia to attempt to reduce shipping costs. Given the confusion around VAT in the EU and UK shipments right now, this is a serious risk. Overseas backers may be required to pay VAT or Customs fees, but the cost of postage itself is usually lower using bulk shipping. This form of shipping means overseas packages will arrive a month or two later than US shipments.\nAs is always the case with a Kobold Press project, if we exceed our initial funding goal, we will expand the contents of Vault of Magic through fun and value-added stretch goals. The greater your level of support, the better the book becomes. How many will we hit? The funnest part is finding out! Below, you can see the many, many goals reached with your support!\nFabled Items: We're introducing some new styles of items in Vault of Magic. More information is available on this in the \"What is a Fabled Item?\" update.\nGuest Designer Items: We'll reveal items by our guest designers to our backers as stretch goals, and some guest designers will discuss them on the Kobold Chat Twitch show. You will find 21 guest designers in all, with their item previews posted under Updates.\nOur final run of stretch goals is spelled out below. It's been a huge run, our single most successful project ever--even bigger than the Tome of Beasts!\nWe found one more goal: every great book needs a great bookmark!\n\nWe're incredibly proud of the creative team that has been working on Vault of Magic for 5th Edition the last year and more. Here are a few of the primary contributors:\nJeff Lee, Designer. Jeff has been a gamer for 39 years and a freelance game designer for the last seven years. He has produced material for Gun Metal Games, Legendary  Games, Louis Porter Jr. Design, and Rogue Genius Games, among many others. Jeff is the author of Demon Cults & Secret Societies and 12 Peculiar Towers from Kobold Press.\nPhillip Larwood, Designer. Phillip has been writing for Kobold Press on and off for more than a decade and has a deep, abiding love for all things magical and mysterious. He excelled at aberrations,  fiends, and horrors in his contributions to Tome of Beasts and Tome of Beasts 2, and he further expanded our knowledge of alkemancy and magical servitors in Deep Magic for 5th Edition. Many of the fantastic items in this book are a result of his great penmanship and warped imagination, and his hand-typed manuscripts always smell faintly of cinnamon and myrrh.\nMeagan Maricle, Lead Editor. Meagan was the lead editor on Kobold Press's upcoming City of Cats, Margreve Player\u2019s Guide, Underworld Player\u2019s Guide, Empire of the Ghouls, Tome of Beasts 2, and the ENnie award-winning Creature Codex. When not saving kobolds from their own word traps, she schemes the demise of her players\u2019 characters while petting her diabolical, furry companion (\u201cI\u2019ll get you next time, PCs!\u201d). She has been playing (Advanced) Dungeons and Dragons since the early 90s when her parents turned her into an emerald wyrmling.\nMarc Radle, Art Director. Marc has been the Art Director and lead graphic designer at Kobold Press  since 2012. He's done the art direction, layout, and graphic design on  hundreds of Kobold Press releases. Marc also occasionally squeezes in time to write\u2014he penned the Shadows of the Dusk Queen adventure and was the lead designer on the New Paths Compendium, both from Kobold Press. He's been playing D&D since the late 70s, along with plenty of other great RPGs\u2014Pathfinder,  Marvel Superheroes, Champions, Elfquest, FASA\u2019s Star Trek, Star  Frontiers . . . the list goes on and on.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKobold Press has shipped over 37 crowdfunded titles since 2006, both small and large, with 17 of them on Kickstarter (this is #19). The Kobolds have won Gold and Silver ENnie Awards for this work, most recently an ENnie for the Creature Codex for 5th Edition in 2019 as Best Monster/Adversary book. The creative team is experienced, and we keep leveling up!\n\nFor Vault of Magic, the item design is already done and with the editor. Likewise, we already have the cover and a portion of the interior art commissioned because of our confidence in this book. \n\nThe main challenges are layout and proofing of the books, and managing the uncertain landscape for printing and shipping.\n\nOther risks include the new ones: the health of the core team of kobolds (editor, art director, and publisher), as well as business-related risks from COVID-related printer delays plus the recent tampering with the US Post Office. We'll keep you informed on any delays if they arise. \n\nAnd if some dangerous magic is unleashed by our rash experiments in the wizard's chambers?

Cora, my eight-year-old daughter, and I both agreed that we were fed up of doing the same old maths worksheets. We decided we wanted to do something more exciting with our time instead - like design our own board game!  \nCora and I spent many enjoyable days working side by side on our game. Cora was having so much fun she never noticed me sneaking school work like maths, creative writing, art and computing into the project (shhh, don't tell her). As CoraQuest developed we both felt so pleased with it that we wanted to share it with other people too.\nWhile it started as a homemade project, CoraQuest has had massive amounts of support from a whole legion of playtesters. Although its roots are still true to the game Cora and I made together on our kitchen table, our playtesters have helped us develop CoraQuest from its rough and ready origins to a smooth-running, polished, and above all very fun game.\nThere's enough content in the CoraQuest box to keep you going for a very very long time. However, Cora and I had so much fun with the creative process of making the game that we wanted to provide the same exciting experience to others too. \n\n\nThe rulebook for CoraQuest includes guidance and encouragement on how to create and draw your own heroes, characters and adventures - making the game fully customisable.  \nWhat's more, we've even made a fantastic free web-based app that you can use to create your own heroes and print them out on \"official\" cards and matching standees. Just draw and upload your picture, choose your hero's stats and special abilities, and then print them out - it's as easy as that!\nCoraQuest is designed to be as accessible to children as possible without diluting any of the fun for adults. Here are three of the key features of the game:\nYou explore the dungeon by drawing cards from the dungeon deck and placing each card out into the layout.  This means every game you play will have its own unique dungeon map - providing a different experience each time. \nWhenever you venture into the dungeon there is a chance you will encounter some of the fearsome creatures that lurk there. Orcs, goblins and gremlins emerge from the shadows whenever a card with their symbol is added to the dungeon.  \nWhimsical and family-friendly narrative emerges during the game via the \"quest cards\" that are spaced out within the dungeon deck.  When a quest card is placed in the dungeon you read a short passage from the quest book and carry out any special instructions it gives you.   \nThe quest cards' illustrations include multiple elements that are open to interpretation, allowing you to use them as inspiration to design your own adventures.\nCombat is exciting, fun, and simple for even young children to understand. It's resolved using custom red and white dice. Your hero card and your weapon tell you what colour dice you need to roll, then you inflict one damage to your target for each success you get.  \nIf you're in combat and you completely miss your target your hero flips over to their \"determined\" side. This means you will get even more dice to roll for your next attack. This helps take the sting out of rolling badly for younger children (and for adults too).\nThe countdown track adds another level of decision making and tactical thinking to the game.\n\nEach hero has a special ability that is activated by putting a token on the countdown track. At the end of each round the tokens will move down one space on the track. You're unable to use your special ability again until your token has moved off the bottom of the track and has come back to you, so you need to think very carefully about when is the best time to use it. \nThe countdown track also has a second use - to add the threat of a spider attack! \nThis mechanism has received some of the highest praise from our playtesters, as it creates tension and ensures the game moves along at an exciting pace.\nEach time you complete a round without having explored further into the dungeon, the \"threat token\" moves down one space on the countdown track. If it ever moves off the bottom of the track then a swarm of spiders appear in the dungeon and start attacking the heroes. The ever-present threat of being swarmed by spiders really moves the action along! \nSharing creativity and fun is at the very heart of CoraQuest, and that is why we not only encourage you to make your own content for the game, but we also encourage you to share it with others too! \n\nWe have a special section on our website where we host community-created adventures, heroes and enemies that people can download and use for free. We already have lots of things on there. For example, acclaimed board game designer Jerry Hawthorne (Mice and Mystics, Stuffed Fables) stumbled across the print and play version of CoraQuest and liked the idea so much that he sent us this awesome band of brave rodent adventurers that he designed and drew.\nJerry's characters will not be included in the CoraQuest box, but they can be downloaded to print and play from the CoraQuest website.\n\nJerry isn't the only one who has sent in their work for us to share on the website though! Look at these fantastic adventurers from six-year-old Enydd Chadwick.\nBe aware that these are the prototype versions of the game. They do not feature the finished artwork and there may also be some small changes made to the rules before final production.\nWhy should I back CoraQuest on Kickstarter?\nIf CoraQuest doesn't get funded on Kickstarter it won't ever be made. This is very much a passion project for all involved and we do not have the resources to make and distribute the game without your support.\nWill CoraQuest be available at retail?\nWe don't have any plans at this time to put CoraQuest into retail distribution, however if the opportunity arises we would consider it.  \nIf the Kickstarter doesn't reach its target will I still be charged?\nNo. You will only be charged if we reach our target.\nWhen will I get my game?\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in late November 2021. We will keep all the backers regularly updated on each stage of the process until everyone gets their games.\nHow long after the campaign ends will you be charging for postage? \nWe will be sending out an email via our pledge manager (Gamefound) around two to three months after the campaign has ended. This is so we can minimise the risk of us charging either too much or too little for postage, as the rates for this can fluctuate.\nWill I have to pay customs charges or tax on my game?\nWe will absorb the costs of customs charges and taxes (including VAT) for games delivered to the US, Canada, UK, Australia, New Zealand and the EU so you should not have to pay any additional fees in these areas. Other regions may have additional customs charges as per local regulations.\nHow thick are the Dungeon Cards?\nThe Dungeon Cards are made out of 310gsm card (the same material that high quality playing cards are made out of).  We have found in our playtesting that using cards as opposed to \u201ctiles\u201d makes very little difference to the game, and it also enables us to keep manufacturing and shipping costs as low as possible as they are both cheaper and less heavy - allowing us to pass those savings onto the backers.\nShipping for CoraQuest will be charged after the campaign has ended in order to minimise any fluctuations in the cost of this between the campaign close and the date of delivery.\nThese are the current estimated charges based on quotes provided to us by our shipping partners. However these may be subject to change due to unforeseen international events or changes in law between now (February 1st, 2021) and the time of shipping.\n*There are a number of countries that we are unfortunately unable to deliver to.

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set. An advantage of this pledge is the brushes are at a great price, ready to be shipped and will be sent out right away!

Terrain Tinker has been developed with Printable Scenery over the last year to create a practical terrain building application that uses all of the Printable Scenery OpenLOCK collection. When you're finished designing, you can export your creation as a print-ready combined model or separate OpenLOCK parts.\nClick here try the beta version of Terrain Tinker. Free access to the beta will only be available for the duration of the kickstarter.\n\nThe most important aspect of any 3D builder is the quality of the models. Printable Scenery offers the best collection of OpenLOCK parts in all the worlds.\nDesign complex dungeons and buildings, then export as either combined high-quality & detail STL files or OpenLOCK parts.\nSort through your OpenLOCK tiles, then 'drag and drop' to quickly create layouts. Use the intuitive smart-tools to move, copy, paste and construct elaborate designs.\nDrag and drop full-colour building tiles so you can see how your 3D prints will look when painted.\nIt only takes a couple of minutes to learn how to use Terrain Tinker. Check out the videos to see how easy and fun it is to use.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n                Printed and Painted examples of builds with the full Clorehaven set\nSome examples of the models that can be made with the Clorehaven set.\nRampage Castle combined with Clorhaven\nGoblin Grotto parts combined into one printable file\nTerrain Tinker is a partnership project with Printable Scenery. You will soon be able to link to your Printable Scenery account and access your OpenLOCK files directly via the Terrain Tinker interface. Once the campaign closes we will send you a link so that you can link your Printable Scenery account to Terrain Tinker\nThe new OpenLOCK Digital format allows parts to be combined into a single object for 3D printing in Terrain Tinker. This will make it easy for the hundreds of OpenLOCK designers to import their own OpenLOCK tiles into Terrain Tinker.\nWe will be working in collaboration with other OpenLOCK and 3D scenery designers to offer the largest range we can.\nThe www.terraintinker.com Beta is running smoothly, but we want to add more features and more high-detailed tiles.\nWe have a few things already planned and underway including;\nCutting & grouping for 3D printing.\nSend your creation to licensed printers for printing and delivery to your door.\nWe have already unlocked a lot of crazy features. See the stretch goals below to track the progress:\n Unlocking all of the Printable Scenery's OpenLOCK tiles! CLORHAVEN, CASTLE, DUNGEON, GROTTO, and CATHEDRAL UNLOCKED \nScatter placement - the ability to place scatter terrain anywhere in the builder. UNLOCKED  \nImport your own STL files into the builder. UNLOCKED \nObject collision detection. UNLOCKED \nTop-down isometric renders, for printing on paper. UNLOCKED \nA sharing platform to share your designs with others who have the same collections.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

We are Plastic Dungeon, a new 3D printing company. Moreover, we're a group of avid tabletop role-playing gamers who have recently discovered the exciting possibilities available now that 3D printing is becoming more accessible to small businesses.\nA Stone Portal/Arch\nSince it's our goal to make gaming accessories that are, well, accessible, we're starting with a Make 100 project to fund production of a unique piece of fantasy TTRPG terrain. The archway pictured in the image above will be created with PLA filament, and is our own unique design. The archway can be easily incorporated into most other tabletop RPG map sets, and is 28-32mm (heroic) scale. The model can be used as-is, or can easily be primed and painted, as shown in the following images.\nPrinted Sample of \"Stone Portal\" (painted and unpainted)\nPlastic Dungeon\nTable top gaming has long been, and continues to be, an exercise in imagination, but the practical side of the hobby has resulted in the need for drawing endless maps to make our imagined realms a semi-reality. Premade manufactured pieces were costly and often a luxury the average gamer could not afford. Some players could craft their own items, but this required skill not every player possessed, and not everyone wanted to devote the time and effort for a piece which may only be used once or twice.\nEnter the world of 3D printing. Now, suddenly, it's possible to create entire modular maps for use with tabletop RPGs and strategy wargames in such a way that even a small company could inexpensively mass-produce map and terrain pieces. Imagine- custom 3D maps with personalized details that can affordably be created on-demand. This is what Plastic Dungeon is all about. We've had some amazing successes already building custom items for our own gaming group, as well as our Friendly Local Game Store, but now, we're hoping to begin reaching for that dream of mass-production of customizable gaming terrain.\n3D render of \"Stone Portal\"\nRune Detail (Updated)\nWe Need Your Help\nThat's where the Kickstarter comes in. We're creating our own unique designs, which can be modified upon request to suit a specific or unique purpose. The first piece we've designed, a stone archway with arcane markings, is being made ready for production. We're currently working on more designs for large maps sets and customizable gaming accessories, and we've love to hear suggestions from everyone about what they'd like to see. Certain types of pieces, specific settings, even features of the design. We're still new and open to anything!\n\n We're offering the stone arch at the cost of $3 per piece, and you can order up to five.  We also now have several Add-On options for purchase, including Painting at an additional $3 per arch, and Inserts at a cost of $1 per insert. The arch with Inserts is ideal for adapting to a variety of maps and games, and can be anything: a secret passageway, a mystical dimensional portal, or the entrance to an ancient fortress. We sincerely hope this will add that extra touch of interest and flair to your gaming maps!\n\nShipping - $3 to anywhere in the USA!\nWhen creating this Kickstarter we did not anticipate the interest in multiple arches, and so our shipping cost is based on a specific packaging. It's possible to pledge for far more than will fit in this package and multiple packages may need to be sent to fulfill such a pledge. While not required, we'd appreciate any pledges for 4 or more arches, or 10 or more inserts, to include an additional $3 to accommodate shipping a 2nd package. This is not required! We're thrilled for the enthusiastic interest and being able to provide you with our arches and inserts is payment enough, but the extra to accommodate shipping would still be very much appreciated.\nPainting - $3 Per Arch\nNot a pro at painting? We're happy to do it for you! Simply raise your pledge an additional $3 per arch, and we will send them to you fully primed and painted. Painting will consist of a dark basecoat, several layers of gray midtones, highlights and a finish coat. With our social stretch goals successful, we'll also paint in the detail of the runes at the top of the arch in a bright, contrasting color.\n\nAdditional Portal Inserts - $1 Per Insert\nSince we have developed a portal arch with insert capability, we're offering a few of our alternative portal inserts as Add-Ons.  These designs are different from the brightly-colored portal inserts, and are obtainable only by pledging for the Add-On. (Once unlocked, the magical portal inserts will be available at no extra cost, one per portal arch. After that goal has been reached, any of the portal insert designs, including the magical designs, can be purchased at the $1 Add-On price.) At this time, we are offering an option for heavy wooden doors, a lattice-style portcullis, a spiderweb, a magical tendril border effect, and burst of energy as if a portal were just opening or closing. You may pledge for one of each design per arch, at $1 each. Again, if you pledged for painting the original piece, the painting of one insert of your choice per painted arch will be covered at no additional cost. (Note: Some Inserts are not intended to be painted, such as the Ripple, Web, Tendril, and Burst designs.)\n\nPortcullis and Doors inserts, fully painted (mini not included)\nWeb and Burst Inserts\nTendril Insert\n Now that we're funded (and then some), we've added some stretch goals!\nMore details about each goal will be added as we approach them.\n\n $200 Painted Option- Unlocked!\nWe are so grateful for your response that we've decided to officially offer an add-on to paint your arches a dark stone grey, similar to how the sample images appear further up this page. Simply raise your pledge an additional $3 per arch, and we will send them to you fully primed and painted. You'll be able to tell us how many you paid to have painted in the survey at the end of the campaign, along with any other options that become unlocked in our Stretch Goals!\n $500 Portal Insert- Unlocked!\nWe are very exited for our next stretch goal: a portal piece that can be inserted into the arch to turn it into an active portal! Help us get to $500 funded and we will include this portal piece with every arch at no additional cost. Paid for painting? We'll paint this for you as well!\n$800 Another Portal Insert and Translucent Filament Option\nWe've decided to combine the next two stretch goals! At $800 pledged we will offer an alternate second design of portal insert for every arch you pledge for! You can select your portal design in the survey. The portal inserts will be printed in a random bright filament, but once we reach $800 we will offer the option to choose the color of your portal inserts, including translucent filament!\n\n$1200/$1600/$2000 Mystery Goals! \nReach these to find out what they are!\n\nSocial Goals\n\nWe also have some social network goals! Visit us on Facebook to like our page and share our post about this Kickstarter!\nAlternate Rune Designs- Unlocked!\nSince our Facebook page has 100 likes, we will open the option to choose between our original runes detailed above or the alternate runes featured in our second update \"Updated Runes\".\nContrasting Rune Colors- Unlocked!\nSince the post has 100 shares, the painting add-on will include painting the runes in a contrasting color! This includes the option to have the runes glow under black light, which looks very cool. Pictures of an arch under black light are available in our update \"Getting Closer!\".\n\nWe're excited about our first mass run, and hope to get the gaming community excited about our company, and good things to come!\nThanks in advance for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEstimated delivery is a rough estimate based on the time it will take to produce and ship.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nPLA plastic or polylactic acid is a vegetable-based plastic material, which commonly uses cornstarch as a raw material.

Leave the troubles of the road outside and have a seat by the fire. Welcome to a project that is certain to help you put the worries of the outside world at bay. Black Oak Workshop is proud to return to Kickstarter with our 2021 lineup of Advent-ure Calendars! The Holiday Tavern and the 2020 Calendars were well received and we have returned with new themes to ensure there is something for everyone. 2020 is GONE and we are excited to kick off 2021 with some polyhedral adventure!\nDue to the positive response last year, we are returning with three all new calendars this year. The goal with three is to allow choices for our backers. Not everyone celebrates the Christmas holiday that is associated with traditional Advent calendars, so we present an additional holiday themed calendar (Halloween) as well as offering a calendar that is not specifically tied to any holiday. This allows everyone a way to countdown with cool dice.\nWe've got some wonderful surprises for everyone included in each calendar. There are some new, extra large dice and an altogether custom shape which is very exciting! Our costs were impacted as a result, but we only had to increase prices marginally over previous calendars. In addition to the cool new sizes and shapes you will discover this year, we're including a bonus, thematic item in each of the calendars designed to match the theme. Read on adventurers!\nAdvent-ure Calendars are filled with custom polyhedral dice that follow a theme. Our calendars are inspired by traditional advent calendars and they help you count down your holidays or any other event while celebrating a love of dice. Each day, a new chamber is opened and inside you will find custom polyhedral dice that feature all new, never before seen designs. You will never find old overstock dice or standard mass produced sets in our calendars!\nOnce again, we have commissioned the Fraim Bros to do our box art and we feel they really brought the magic to this project - the artwork is gorgeous!! Check out these beautiful calendars!\nAdvent-ure Calendar 5: The Dragon's Lair The dark and foreboding cave entrance warns of terrible dangers within! Do you have the courage to draw your sword and press onward to discover untold treasures? Beware the dragon that lies within! Count down to any special date with these cool dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\nAdvent-ure Calendar 6: The Deathgale Galleon Storm clouds foretell the coming of the haunted galleon! The crew is said to be cursed and will forever sail the seas in search of new prey. Do you dare board the ship and discover dark mysteries inside the barnacled hull? Count down to Halloween with these not-so-terrifying dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 4\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 31\nDimensions: 15.5 x 11.2 x 1.75 (in)\nMSRP: $75\nAdvent-ure Calendar 7: Santa's Workshop The dream destination of children all around the world is certain to hold a great many magical surprises! Come inside and see what Santa has been working on with his elves! Count down to Christmas with these holiday themed dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\n We hope you think these themes are as exciting as we do!\nAs with our previous Advent-ure Calendars, we are steadfastly choosing not to reveal images of the dice inside to preserve the magic and fun of opening a countdown style calendar. However, we can tell you the following:\n Big! All the dice are larger Black Oak sized dice - these are big and fun to roll!\n Bigger! We are introducing some special over-sized (even for Black Oak) dice in two of the calendars this year.\n Exclusive! All the dice feature entirely new custom designs and they are not available anywhere else - these dice are exclusive to this project!\n More Exclusive! We have an entirely new dice shape for one of our calendars this year! Hint: Have you been naughty or nice this year?\n Variety! Each of the dice are unique. Other than the possibility of set pairs, there are no duplicates of the dice inside. Also, you will never find our old stock in these calendars - we don't use them to thin out stuff that isn't selling well.\n Style! All the dice feature either solid, swirl, transparent or glitter styles. And maybe even glow-in-the-dark!\n Thematic! The packaging for each calendar embraces a unique theme and features beautiful artwork to help bring this theme to life. This theme carries over to the dice designs as well.\n Collectible! Except for a few of the dice outlined below (see Special Singles), none of these will be available outside of this project. This is it!\nWe always strive to provide a fantastic product to our backers while also putting a focus on value. We are offering the same exceptional quality as our previous calendars while including a few specialty dice this year (larger and new shapes). As a result, the pricing for the new calendars is slightly higher than last year. Additional calendars in the pledge manager and those available post project on our website will be sold at the MSRP rate.\nWhile we are choosing not to reveal the dice in these calendars for obvious reasons, we can show you dice similar to what you will receive. Below are photos of some of the polyhedral sets from our earlier Advent-ure Calendars.\nAs you can see, the dice in a given calendar come in a mix of designs, but they follow a general theme. Our backers resoundingly loved these dice and we can promise you that the dice featured in the new calendars will be just as cool.\nNo project would be complete without something fun to look forward to. For this project, we are continuing with extras that match the themes we've selected. Please help us spread the word out there so these items can find their way into the world!\nBelow is a text only summary of the project goals:\n $40,000 Funded! **UNLOCKED** All three of the new Advent-ure Calendars are now unlocked. Additional calendars will be available for purchase in the pledge manager.\n $50,000 Dice Bags! **UNLOCKED** The three matching dice bags (one design matching each calendar) are unlocked. All backers will receive one of these dice bags of their choice per calendar backed for (LIMIT 3). These bags are made of the same quality materials as our standard dice bags and are 5.5\" X 8.5\" in size. Additional dice bags will be available for purchase in the pledge manager at a discounted rate.\n $60,000 Mystery Dice Level 1! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have an additional mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $69,000 Mystery Dice Level 2! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a SECOND mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $78,000 Mystery Dice Level 3! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a THIRD mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n ??? Additional mysterious stretch goals are possible.\nWe will be releasing a few of the dice from the calendars as singles available for a purchase outside of the project. This is because we know they will make cool gifts and our backers may very well want a few extras to throw in their dice bags.\nOut of the 79 dice included on the project, 7 will be available as add-on purchases. There are 2 dice from each calendar that we are revealing and an additional die from the Deathgale Galleon (total 3).\nBelow is a text only summary of the Special Singles:\n Sparky d4 (Dragon's Lair) Who doesn't love cute little dragons? You can use this one to roll or as a marker for your familiar! A tiny flying dragon means you've rolled a 4 on this purple swirl with silver ink d4.\n Dragonstone d20 (Dragon's Lair) The crown jewel of the Dragon's Hoard, this oversized crystal clear d20 (white ink) is a handful! Our standard d20s are scaled to match a 19mm d6, but these d20s are even chunkier. A crystal marks the 20 result.\n Rolling Bones pair of d6s (Deathgale Galleon) These two d6s are black with white ink and have an increasing number of bones to indicate the result with a cool skull as the 6 result. Pirates love them!\n Jib the Monkey d20 (Deathgale Galleon) He's a loyal companion, but you can bet he's looking forward to finding a new home on dry land! This beige swirl and brown ink d20 has a little monkey for the 20 result.\n Giant Christmas Tree d4 (Santa's Workshop) There is always a big Christmas tree standing in Santa's Workshop! This giant sized d4 is almost identical to our d4 in Advent-ure Calendar 1, but it's a LOT bigger!\n Naughty/Nice d2 (Santa's Workshop) This d2 comes in the shape of Santa's book of names. It is a beige swirl with brown ink and this shape is a first for us. Have you been naughty or nice this year?\nIn addition to the singles from the calendars, we have plenty of add-on items to choose from. You can see most of our available products on our website. Most products there as well as a few others will be available as part of the pledge manager process that will begin shortly after the campaign funding period ends.\nBelow is an overview list and general price breakdown of our products:\nAdditional Advent-ure Calendars 5-7 at MSRP\nSpecial Singles Calendar Dice $4 (reduced for backers)\n Rolling Bones pair of d6's (Deathgale Galleon) $8 (reduced for backers)\n Dragonstone Oversized d20 (Dragon's Lair) $11 (reduced for backers)\nCalendar Dice Bags (if unlocked) $10 (reduced for backers)\nBlack Oak Thematic Polyhedrals (singles) $5\nBlack Oak Thematic RPG Sets $15\nAdditional Dice Bags $12\nTotally Geek Pins $8\nYou can choose to add additional funds to your pledge now to cover add-on items or simply add them post project during the pledge manager process.\nFor those of you who have not seen or rolled our dice, we are sure you will be pleasantly surprised. Below is a size comparison of a Black Oak d20 and a standard d20. All of our dice are scaled to match a 19mm (3/4\") d6 instead of a standard 16mm d6. The result is that they have a better feel in your hand and look great when rolling. They are also much easier to read. Note that all of the calendars this year contain an even larger die than our standard size or a specialty shape we have not produced before.\nWe like to be creative and innovate! Last year we introduced a new take on the traditional d4 in some of our calendars. This allows additional design space for the theme while maintaining functionality. The Campfire d4 was one of these. We received an overwhelmingly positive response to this last year and are continuing with the concept this year on more of the d4s.\nYou can back our projects with confidence! Reviewing any of our past projects will reveal we go above and beyond to deliver a great experience to our backers who are the best backers on Kickstarter! We take our commitment to you seriously and you can trust us to deliver. We have shipped on time or early on virtually every one of our projects.\nWhat you see is what you get on this and all of our projects. Black Oak Workshop always strives to show you photo samples of the actual product. We carry an upfront investment to do this so that you can feel safe in helping produce a great product. Below are images of the actual calendars - the product you will receive will be exactly like what you see here!\nUPDATE: We will be shipping internationally for the project with the exception of the United Kingdom. All international shipping costs are to be determined and will be charged in the pledge manager post project.\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Please note that 2021 shipping rate changes have impacted the shipping estimates. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing Priority Mail. International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with Kickstarter upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nAll rewards will ship in the month of September 2021. Domestic USA orders should arrive by October 1, but we cannot guarantee that. We have seen some shipments take a few days or 2-3 weeks to reach the end destination due to staffing issues of the USPS. International orders are not guaranteed to arrive by any specific date.\nNOTE: All shipping fees will be collected post the campaign as part of the BackerKit pledge manager process. Please see the shipping matrix below for cost estimates. For the THREE CALENDAR SET (triple pack) and RETAILER ONLY reward levels, we are only shipping to the USA.\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: The delivery timeline and above cost estimates are subject to change based on the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, we feel confident in meeting the delivery schedule and staying close to these cost estimates. However, as the world learned in 2020, things can change quickly. We will always keep our backers updated as to any changes as they develop.\nAre you a verifiable brick and mortar retailer? Would you like to carry the Advent-ure Calendars or any of our other products in your store? We'd love to earn your business! Sales for our retailers on our previous Advent-ure Calendar projects were fantastic and we only had one complaint: they wanted more to be available than we were able to provide! This will not be an issue on this project! Note that online based retailers are not permitted. \nSimply back at the 'Retailer Only' level and, if this is your first time backing a Black Oak project, contact us through the creator contact area of the Kickstart page or through our website here so we can verify you as a brick and mortar retail store. Your pledge will serve as a credit towards your selections in the pledge manager. Qualified retailers receive a wholesale rate on all our products and all products will be available in the pledge manager for you at wholesale rates. The suggested MSRP for the Advent-ure Calendars are $65 (24 chambers/custom dice) and $75 (31 chambers/custom dice). Note that if additional 'mystery dice' are unlocked, they will be incorporated into the calendars, though the MSRP will not change.\nNOTE: Costs for shipping to retailers will be based on quantities ordered and will be determined at the time of shipment. Final shipping costs for retailers will not be handled in the pledge manager.\nThank you for checking out our latest project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

All card counts are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change. Rules are subject to change. \n\nAs the game has not been manufactured yet, all images and descriptions are what we are aiming to create. It is possible during the production process that some items might change in appearance, functionality, size, or quantity. We will attempt to keep such changes to a minimum. \n\nFULFILLMENT \nBezier Games, Inc. has been publishing boardgames for more than 10 years. Several factors can cause delays that are beyond our control, including manufacturing issues and shipping delays. The COVID-19 pandemic could be a factor in possible delays; in all cases, we've tried to incorporate a reasonable level of padding into shipping estimates. \n\nThe estimated fulfillment is December 2021, but keep in mind that this is just an estimate, this year more than ever before. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. \n\nRESTRICTED DELIVERY \nDue to increased frequency in Kickstarters failing to deliver to certain locations, Bezier Games, Inc. has decreased the amount of locations Kickstarter rewards may ship to. This is because of several reasons - the majority being issues of reward packages getting lost, stolen, being unable to clear customs. In addition to this, some countries have been removed due to heavily increased accounts of piracy. \n\nBezier Games, Inc. will only be shipping to the following locations: United States of America, Puerto Rico, Canada, United Kingdom, Europe (European Union, Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia & Herzegovina, Georgia, Iceland, Kosovo, Liechtenstein, Macao, Moldova, Monaco, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, San Marino, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine, Vatican City), Australia, New Zealand, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Philippines, and Military (APO)\n\nSHIPPING\nShipping is charged after the KS campaign concludes, based on the actual costs Bezier Games incurs to ship from distribution centers to your delivery address. All shipping & handling costs will be paid by backers through our BackerKit Pledge Manager. Links to this pledge manager will be sent roughly two weeks after the campaign ends. The BackerKit pledge manager is a 3rd party used to finalize orders and shipping outside of Kickstarter, Kickstarter has no responsibility in this regard. Shipping costs vary based on where you will have your reward delivered; we always do our very best to ensure backers the best price possible. \n\nAt the start of this campaign, we expect the box included with the Collector level and Royal level to be about 300 x 300 x 160mm (similar to the Suburbia Collector\u2019s Edition \u201cregular\u201d box) and weigh about 11 pounds. The Colossal level includes the same box, PLUS an additional box which we expect to be about 300 x 300 x 148mm, shipped together in a single carton weighing about 26 pounds. The shipping estimates below reflect these calculations.\n \nRegional applicable taxes will be calculated in the Pledge Manager as well. Our shipping is US, CA, EU, UK, AU friendly meaning rewards will ship from within these regions. Any VAT for EU and UK will be collected in the pledge manager.\n\nREFUNDS \nBezier Games, Inc. will do whatever they can to minimize the risks but, should a backer become uphappy, we are willing to refund pledges if issues should arise while the Pledge Manager is open. Refunds of 100% of collected funds are available within the first 14 days of a campaign's end. Past that, Kickstarter still needs to collect their portion of the pledge which we do not cover. This results in a 90% refund given if it is requested after the 14 day period. Once the Pledge Manager closes, refund requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. \n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Bezier Games, Inc. is not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange. \n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS \nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels will not be tolerated. Bezier Games, Inc. reserves the right to cancel any pledge. \n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you may be required to pay the full cost to ship your reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship your reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package tracking status shows as delivered to that address, but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again, you may be required to pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address in addition to the amount of the original reward including any add-ons and other upgrades on your order. \n\nIf we ship the reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is held in customs or by any other government agency, our ability to help may be limited. You may be required to contact your customs agency or government and arrange for the package to be cleared and released at your expense. We are not responsible for any fees levied against your pledge by customs or any government agency.

Reinhart (right) & Adrian Benson (left)\n\nHi, we're Jonathan and Adrian.  We are the hosts of Wargaming Recon.  Wargaming Recon is the longest-running tabletop wargaming podcast in existence.\n\nLast year we asked for your help to bring the 2020 season to life.  The COVID-19 global pandemic hit hard after our Kickstarter ended.  Convention after convention closed, game days postponed, businesses shut down, and many people were furloughed or lost their jobs.\n\nThose many months in 2020 were dark times for people across the globe.  We adapted to the unprecedented times by changing our plans for 2020.  Instead of giving you a year's worth of event coverage, we pivoted to help the community the best way we could.  \n\nWe doubled-down on addressing how tabletop gaming is a tool in the battle for good mental health.  We began a daily livestream show during the worst of the pandemic.  We co-created and co-sponsored the 2020 Let's Roll virtual gaming convention.\n\nLet's Roll 2020 brought together gamers and game companies from across the globe.  Using a multitude of online platforms to play, to communicate, to learn, and to hang out, we helped over 70 people to fight the sense of isolation and fear of uncertainty that pervaded society.\n\nThe challenges of 2020 forced us to be more adaptable, nimble, and responsive than ever before.  The 2021 season is shaping up to be unlike anything we've ever experienced in our more than 14 years of bringing you informative, recreational, and educational podcast episodes covering all aspects of our hobby.  We intend to use our experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic as we bring the 2021 season to you.\n\nWe wish to continue exploring the changing scene of tabletop games with a brighter spotlight on remote gaming, solo gaming, and using technology to play games with people anywhere on the planet.  Old favorites such as play by mail or e-mail are coming back all the way to using virtual meetings and virtual tabletops to game with one another.\n\nIn the past, we'd interview individuals in person like award winning filmmakers Steve Wollett about Word From a Gamer, talented game designers like GMT's Mark McLaughlin, Parsec finalist podcasters like Peter Bryant & Mike Kafes of the Mythwits, first-rate convention organizers like Steve & Angelia Parenteau of TotalCon, and internationally known minis painters like Tony Rieger & Dave Shuster of Iron Hammer Studio.\n\nAs we learned from COVID-19, that isn't always the best method.  We're putting more resources into online interviews using tools like Streamyard and Streamlabs OBS to blur the lines between audio recordings and web shows.  We began using Streamyard for our daily Pandemic Coffee Break shows.  It allows us to integrate audience feedback, feature web content, and showcase products in a better visual way to accompany our audio podcast.\nPandemic Coffee Break 6/5/2020\nOur 2020 season was, in part, the year of mental health.  Our openness has strongly resonated with people as evidenced by the numerous dialogues resulting from that change.  While we've always sought to help others, we are making mental health a core value moving forward.  In particular we will continue our mission to normalize mental health.  One way we're doing this is to use our social media presence to nurture and support one another.  We think of it as a safe space for members of the community to speak their truth without fear of ridicule.  From time to time we'll check in with a mental health professional to offer tips as to how tabletop gaming can be a helpful tool in your mental health first aid kit.\nDr. Allan Hunter spoke about how tabletop gaming can help one's mental health\nEveryone loves the excitement that comes from what the major companies are doing.  But, the smaller companies are often contributing to the hobby in innovative ways such as breathing life into more niche game settings or exploring unique ways to use 3D printing.  During COVID, many small businesses faced financial uncertainty or even went out of business..  A large percentage of the tabletop gaming industry consists of mom and pop shops.  For 2021, we want to give these smaller businesses a voice.  We will introduce you to companies and products with which you may not be entirely familiar.  There's often something exciting to encounter when one least expects it.\n\nWe also want to diversify our content to include under-represented populations.  This new season sees us seeking out those with unique points of view that may challenge expectation.  These voices are not always heard above the cacophony of daily life.  We hope to change that.\n\nTo complete a 2021 podcast season, we can't do it alone.  Wargaming Recon has grown into a multimedia organization featuring our popular podcast (sitting in the top 18-20% of podcasts globally), video content, and blog articles.  We have a variety of expenses from review products, equipment purchases, hosting, and even staff.\n\nWe've tried other funding methods. Even with those methods, we're still unable to cover our costs.  Many expenses come out of my (Jonathan's) pocket.  With two little girls at home, I can no longer afford to pay for these things on my own.\nJonathan vlogged with his daughters\nOur goal of $500 will allow us to produce a shorter 2021 season.  Reaching the stretch goal makes a full season a reality.\n\nFor the 2021 season we're offering a variety of pledge levels.  Some were popular last time around and some are new.  One of the new pledge levels helps backers to get new swag.  Ultimately, this is about you helping us to help you with great content. The Pandemic has everyone scrambling and dealing with the rough reality of life--our podcast is an escape from that, and we'd love for you to join us.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing an example of what you can expect from our podcast, check out what we do at Wargaming Recon's website. For now, onto what you can expect from our backer levels, and an idea of what tokens of appreciate you'll receive for supporting our work!\n Backer Levels\n\n New Merch\nMen's/Unisex black t-shirt in sizes Small-3XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nMen's/Unisex black polo shirt in sizes Small-5XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nWomen's black t-shirt in sizes Small-2XL with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nDuffel bag in black with the Wargaming Recon logo.\nIn 2021, we plan to have more of what you love such as product reviews, guests discussing game design, and evergreen content.  But, we're also going to update topics from the earliest days of the show by exposing them to this brave new world.  Most importantly we promise to continue giving you more video content, more social media interaction, and more time to bring YOU the content you love.  None of this is cheap.  But, we do it because we care about this hobby that we all love.  We do it because we care about the tabletop wargaming community.  We do it because we want to give back.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks, barring a worsening pandemic.

For over two years now at Reggie Games we have been dedicating our time, experience and passion to this project, both as a team and as individuals. \nA lot of work and effort has already been put into this project so far. The game relies on solid and tested mechanics and almost every piece of art for the project has already been realized by our artists team. \nThat being said, we know we still have a long road ahead to fully complete development and going through mass production and then worldwide shipping. We have great confidence in our manufacturing and fulfillment partners and we spent significant time planning every detail of the project in advance.\nFor these reasons we feel prepared to face and handle any eventual complications and challenges that may arise along the way. \n\nYou can trust that every choice our team makes is dictated by improving the quality of the final product to deliver the best version of Primal: The Awakening to our backers. \n\n\nSHIPPING & ESTIMATED DELIVERY\nWe have already handled freight and worldwide fulfillment as we successfully delivered ELO Darkness, our 1st project, to our backers all around the world.\nNonetheless we\u2019ve also learned production, quality control and shipping are delicate phases of the project. Indeed, unexpected issues could arise and they could take some time to be solved. For this reason the delivery date we are providing at this stage of the project is to be considered an estimate.\nWe will do everything possible to meet this date or even anticipate it, but we are aware that slight delays are possible for reasons outside of our control. \nAlso, please consider that exact delivery dates could vary depending on where you live. For example, your game may arrive earlier if you live in a region close to the factory.\n\nYou can be sure we will keep you informed about every step through the process and we will do our best to solve and overcome any issue that could arise in the fast and efficient way possible.\n\n\nCOVID-19\nThe Pandemic situation is a great challenge for us all. To minimize risks we are working with companies that have a stable position on the market and to the best of our knowledge will not endanger the production and fulfillment of this project. Also we are optimistic that by the time this project is delivered there will be no insurmountable issues with respect to Covid-19. However, these are unique times and we will keep our backers updated about any unexpected issues that may arise.\n\nREFUND\nAfter the end of the campaign, the order can still be canceled (receiving a full refund) within 14 days by sending us an email with your cancellation request. \nAfter that period, you can still receive a refund until we lock the production order for the Kickstarter campaign (within 3-4 weeks after the campaign ends).
