El primer paso fue el gui\u00f3n, en donde contamos la inspiradora historia de Tochtli, posteriormente creamos cuatro puppets, a partir de estructuras de ball&sucket, moldeamos sus cr\u00e1neos, los ojos e incluso injertamos su pelo. \nWe started creating Mara\u00f1a at the beginning of March 2018. We were aware that stop motion animation has meticulous processes and requires a lot of time and effort, so each process is carried out with commitment and dedication. The first step was the script, where we tell the inspiring story of Tochtli, later we created four puppets from ball & sucket structures, we molded their skulls, their eyes and even grafted their hair.\nProporcion del puppet/ Puppet proportion\nPuppet terminado/ Puppet finished\nEn la parte de sets creamos m\u00e1s de cinco escenarios distintos y tres fondos pintados a mano en los que se desarrolla la historia de Mara\u00f1a.

Finalmente, despu\u00e9s de tener todo listo para animar, empezamos con el rodaje el 7 de mayo animando 3.5 segundos por d\u00eda aproximadamente.  \nIn sets we created more than five different scenarios and three hand-painted backgrounds in which the Mara\u00f1a\u00b4s story unfolds. Each one was built with the necessary features so that the animators and puppets could move without any problem. Finally, after having everything ready to animate, we started with the shooting on May 7 animating 3.5 seconds per day approximately.\nProducci\u00f3n de sets\nSet escena final/ Final scene set\nWhy we need the money?\n Como pueden ver ya hemos realizado la mayor parte de la producci\u00f3n de Mara\u00f1a.

Lo actualizo de manera semanal y puede tratar de muchas cosas, realmente no tiene un tema en espec\u00edfico, aunque oscila entre un tono triste/melanc\u00f3lico/divertido/o simplemente raro. Son peque\u00f1as historias de tipo fant\u00e1stico, tiras c\u00f3micas, ocurrencias e ideas. En ellas deambulan fantasmas, hadas, esqueletos, cocodrilos, una ni\u00f1a cabra llamada Luc\u00eda, ni\u00f1os perdidos, gatitos, monstruos, mundos paralelos, y un mucho m\u00e1s. (http://mountainwithteeth.com/ , https://www.instagram.com/themountainwithteeth/)\nAqu\u00ed es donde entra \u201cThe mountain with teeth: Historias de piedra\u201d, que es la m\u00e1s reciente compilaci\u00f3n de estas peque\u00f1as historias en un bonito libro de pasta blanda de 120 p\u00e1ginas a color. Y si te gustan algunas de las historias que podr\u00e1s encontrar en la p\u00e1gina del webc\u00f3mic, esta es la oportunidad de darle tu apoyo al proyecto y conseguir a cambio el libro y otras recompensas.\nWhat is \u201cThe Mountain with Teeth\u201d? It\u2019s a webc\u00f3mic that has been in my life for more than four years now. I update weekly, and it can be about many things, it doesn\u2019t really have a theme, although it has a variable sad/melancholic/fun mood that can be just weird. They\u2019re small stories of the fantasy kind, comic strips, some shower thoughts and many ideas. In those we can find ghosts, faeries, skeletons, crocodiles, a goat girl named Lucia, lost boys, kittens, monsters, parallel worlds and much more.  \nHere is where we start with \u201cThe mountain with teeth: Stone Stories\u201d, that is the most recent compilation of these short stories, in a beautiful 120 pages, color paperback. And if you like some of the stories that you have read at the webcomic page this is your chance to support the proyect and get in exchange the book and other rewards.\nHay muchos detalles que pueden ser de su agrado en esta campa\u00f1a, estar\u00e1n a su disposici\u00f3n en distintos paquetes que pueden seleccionar, (algunas ser\u00e1n limitadas):\nThese are the rewards There are many details that you may like in this campaign, and you can get them in different packages to choose from. Just be careful, some are limited:\n  Algunos de los productos disponibles como recompensas.\n  As\u00ed se ven los peluches de Luc\u00eda.\nAhora y lo m\u00e1s importante...\n Me encantar\u00eda decir para comprarme un ri\u00f1\u00f3n nuevo con incrustaciones de diamante, pero 1) Creo que no existen, y m\u00e1s importante 2) El punto aqu\u00ed es el libro. \n De llegar a la meta el dinero ser\u00e1 en su mayor parte para cubrir los costos de producci\u00f3n e impresi\u00f3n del Libro que constar\u00e1 de un tiraje de 1000 ejemplares, pero tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1 para producir las recompensas y cubrir los gastos necesarios para que los paquetes lleguen a sus manos. En esta parte incluyo el costo de env\u00edo a todo M\u00e9xico que ser\u00e1 gratuito. En caso de que sea a otra parte del mundo s\u00f3lo hay que agregar lo del env\u00edo correspondiente (que se suma en autom\u00e1tico).\nWhat are we going to use the money for? I would love to say it\u2019s going to be used to buy a new kidney, incrusted with diamonds but 1) I think they don\u2019t exist, and more important, 2) this is about the book.  \nIf I get to fulfill the goal, the money will be in their most part to cover the production and printing costs for the book. We\u2019re planning to print 1000 copies, but it will also be used for the reward\u2019s production and to cover the shipping expenses so that all the packages arrive to your hands. We are including this so that the shipping to every part of Mexico. If you want me to send the books to other parts of the world, you need to pay the shipping difference.\nBueno, primero: llorar\u00e9 mucho de felicidad, pero eso a ustedes no les sirve de nada. As\u00ed que lo que puedo ofrecer son \u00a1M\u00c1S COSAS! \nConforme vayamos rebasando la meta podr\u00e9 sumar cosas a los paquetes que ir\u00e9 actualizando aqu\u00ed, como: - libreta a los paquetes f\u00edsicos que no tienen y dobles para todos los paquetes que ya tienen una si llegamos a los 125 000 $.  Entre otras que ir\u00e9 agregando, si es que pasamos la meta a\u00fan m\u00e1s.\nAnd if we surpass the goal? Well, first of all: I will cry from happyness, but that is not good for any of you. So I can offer MORE STUFF!  \nAs we surpass every goal, I can add more to the packages with stuff that I will be adding here as we reach them: - double notebooks for all the physical packages if we reach and surpass 125 000.\nStretch goals\n\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1Lo hicimos!!! Logramos pasar la meta con apenas 2 horas de haber iniciado la campa\u00f1a y ahora no s\u00f3lo ya es un hecho el nuevo libro y sus recompensas, si no que adem\u00e1s podemos ir desbloqueando \u00a1REGALOS! para todos por ir superando la meta (el pin misterioso ser\u00eda para los paquetes f\u00edsicos a partir de libro, los otros 2 s\u00ed son para todos :) ). \nA\u00fan pueden seguir ordenando en los d\u00edas que restan hasta el cierre de la campa\u00f1a, y adem\u00e1s ya hemos desbloqueado en s\u00f3lo un par de d\u00edas los primeros stretch goals! Aqu\u00ed ir\u00e9 actualiz\u00e1ndolos dependiendo de c\u00f3mo avance la campa\u00f1a: \nCosas desbloqueadas hasta el momento y la siguiente que permanecer\u00e1 en misterio.\n  Lo bonito de la plataforma de Kickstarter es que no les hace el cargo por la recompensa que seleccionen sino hasta que el proyecto llega a la meta, osea, cuando es seguro que \u00e9ste va a hacerse realidad, as\u00ed que no deben preocuparse por su dinero o por devoluciones. Lo \u00fanico es que deben considerar un periodo de espera luego de lograda la meta, porque recuerden, el dinero es para la producci\u00f3n del libro y las recompensas, as\u00ed que estas se realizar\u00e1n al terminar la campa\u00f1a, y entre eso y los procesos de env\u00edo, puede llevar un tiempo, sin embargo yo estar\u00e9 en contacto con todos ustedes informando siempre c\u00f3mo vamos y contestando sus dudas. No hay falla, tendr\u00e1n sus recompensas en sus manos.\nRisks and challenges: What is nice of Kickstarter is that you won\u2019t give up any money, no matter what reward you choose, until the project reaches the goal. This means: you won\u2019t give money unless the project will become a reality so you don\u2019t have to worry about your money or getting it back. What you have to consider is that it\u2019s important to wait a period of time because the money will be used to produce the book and the rewards. That means we\u2019re starting printing after the campaing ends, and between those and the shipping times, it can be long. However, I will be in contact with all of you, and will keep updates and answer your questions. There\u2019s no mistake here, you will get your rewards.\nSoy una ilustradora de la ciudad de M\u00e9xico. Empec\u00e9 con esto, y m\u00e1s espec\u00edfico con The Mountain With Teeth, hace m\u00e1s de 4 a\u00f1os por pura necesidad creativa, y continuo haci\u00e9ndolo por pura necedad creativa. Actualmente mi trabajo principal es este rollo de crear historias, gracias a lo cual me han surgido varias oportunidades que jam\u00e1s hubiera imaginado, pero la principal y que siempre ser\u00e1 la m\u00e1s importante: la de llegar a todos los que han decidido quedarse un ratito en la Monta\u00f1a. Esta labor s\u00f3lo es posible gracias a ustedes, pues \u00bfQu\u00e9 es de las historias si nadie las escucha?.\nSome about the artist. I\u2019m an illustrator from Mexico City, I started with this job, and with The Mountain with Teeth, about 4 years ago just because I needed a creative outlet. Right now my main job is to tell stories, and this has given me oportunities I could never imagine but the main one, the one that is more important for me, is to be able to reach everyone who has decided to stay a while in the Mountain. This wouldn\u2019t be possible if it wasn\u2019t for you, because, What\u2019s the fate of stories that no one hears?  \nPD: Agradecimientos especiales a Axur que se rif\u00f3 con el v\u00eddeo y a Mich que me ayud\u00f3 con las grabaciones. \nTexto en ingl\u00e9s: Ada Z\u00e1rate. \nThanks for you to make this possible!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEl Desaf\u00edo principal en la entrega de recompensas es que me den la mercanc\u00eda adquirida por ustedes lo m\u00e1s pronto posible, para esto y los env\u00edos requerir\u00e9 que estemos en constante comunicaci\u00f3n y sobre todo que haya paciencia.

Meet the WITCHDOCTOR, the overzealous protector of this mysterious archipelago. He\u2019s ready for action with his shiny cauldron, potent elixirs, and shrunken heads. There\u2019s only one problem\u2026 The Witchdoctor STINKS at magic. When he mixes a potion or casts a spell, watch out! \n\nWe\u2019ve had this guy in our head for a long time and are excited to bring him to life in his own stop-motion animated short.  Nobody knows exactly what the Witchdoctor is (automaton? demon? imp?) or where he came from.  But we think people will like him.\nThe Witchdoctor excited to mix a new potion!\nTECHNIQUE\nStop-motion animation, water puppetry, special effects\u2026 it\u2019s all going into the film. We\u2019ve assembled a close-knit group of artists to help us make The Witchdoctor. They bring all sorts of talents to the table top\u2026 painting, sculpting, sewing, digital effects, and even old school filmmaking. That\u2019s right, we\u2019re shooting portions of this story on super 8mm\u2014creating a cinematic brew of old and new. \nDARK RIDES\nOur film is inspired by theme park DARK-RIDE attractions. There\u2019s something haunting and elemental about those glow-in-the-dark environments that stokes the imagination. We are filming The Witchdoctor with a special black-light process so we can push the colors and highlights to the max. We've been experimenting with this technique for a while and can't wait to show you how it looks :)\nOur Tiki Idols bask in the cool glow of the black-light\nTIKI\nWe\u2019re longtime fans of all things Tiki, and have always hoped to make an animated film with a tiki vibe. We love traditional oceanic art and tribal carvings, as well as their modern, kitschy descendants.\nFrom Exotica music, to tropical d\u00e9cor, to ceramic mugs, Tiki culture is all about mystery and atmosphere, and that will permeate the animated world of the Witchdoctor.  We want the audience to sail into our exotic dioramas and lose themselves on a fantasy voyage. You\u2019ll even have the opportunity to bring home a souvenir from your travels\u2026  \nREWARDS\nWe are SUPER excited to offer a kickstarter-exclusive Witchdoctor tiki mug.  We're collaborating with Tiki Diablo on this mug, so it will be equal parts drinking vessel and art object.  No cheap trinkets, these will be handmade right here in SoCal.\nNEW REWARD!!!! \nPLAY\n\nWITCHDOCTOR SHRUNKEN HEAD KIT\nWhy let WitchDoctor have all the fun?  Now you can make your own unique shrunken heads at home.  Scare your neighbors! Wear them around your neck like a true head hunter!  \n\nThis kit includes all the materials you'll need, including a silicone mold of an original Screen Novelties sculpture.  Customize your head with different hair, eyes, and paint jobs.  We'll create an online gallery to showcase our backers' finished heads.\n*This reward can be added onto existing pledges.  See FAQ for details.\nOther physical rewards include a Witchdoctor T-Shirt and a view-master set with 3D stills from the short.  We also have some cool digital reward levels that include things like the finished short film, designs & storyboards, and time-lapse videos of the production.\nABOUT US\nScreen Novelties is a small animation studio founded by Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan. We share a love of classic cartoons and stop-motion animation.\nup on the studio roof\nAs students of stop-motion history, we've been inspired by the amazing work of George Pal, Karel Zeman, Rankin/Bass, Jim Henson, Lotte Reiniger, and Ray Harryhausen, among others. Those influences show through in our animation, but we also strive to push the art form forward with our own fresh spin on design and craft.  \nIn the last decade we\u2019ve had the the privilege to work on fun projects like SpongeBob Squarepants, Chowder, Flapjack, Robot Chicken, Adventure Time, and Elf: Buddy\u2019s Musical Christmas. We\u2019ve also done a bunch of TV commercials and even got to do a crazy sock puppet sequence with Seth MacFarlane for the Oscars.\n We\u2019ve had a blast on all these projects, but we\u2019ve been itching to get back to our roots, making short films. Before we started the company we made some oddball shorts like Graveyard Jamboree and collaborated with Ray Harryhausen on the Tortoise & the Hare.\n\nIndependent shorts are fertile ground for experimenting with design and technique, and we\u2019re using Witchdoctor to push our limits as animators and filmmakers. \nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nThe Witchdoctor is an experimental animated film. If we sought funding through traditional channels the project would likely veer in a direction that is not true to its spirit. Through Kickstarter, we hope to connect with supporters who value independent animation and see the potential of the Witchdoctor.\n\nWHERE THE MONEY WILL GO\nStop-motion animation is an intricate and laborious process. Everything seen on the screen is crafted by hand. Because of this, stop-motion is not cheap to execute. We have already invested significant time and money into making the initial puppets and the sets for the film. Unfortunately we don\u2019t have the resources to finish the film on our own. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reaching out to all of you through kickstarter. 100% of the funds raised will go into the production of the film. The graphic below shows how we plan to allocate the funds:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES\nEvery film carries a certain amount of risk, because each film has a unique set of challenges. But we are an experienced group with a long history of completing ambitious animated projects. We can\u2019t promise an exact completion date, but we will do our best to finish the film in as timely a manner as we can. We\u2019re excited about the rewards we are offering our backers, both digital and physical.

Someone else?\nIn The Devil You Say, Satan himself takes the stage in a one act puppet soliloquy to mount his defense and prove who\u2019s really to blame.\nWelcome to The Devil You Say\u2019s Kickstarter! This fundraiser is to help out with the show\u2019s production costs for this year\u2019s Hollywood Fringe Festival. I\u2019m Robin Walsh, puppet artist, creator of the show and your host for this Kickstarter.\n         Previous Videos for your information and viewing pleasure...\nPLAY\n\nFirst Update Video...\nPLAY\n\n First Pitch Video...\n                                             MORE ABOUT THE SHOW\nPuppets:\nYes - it's a show with puppets - but not a puppet show for the kids. If the word \u201cpuppet\u201d isn\u2019t part of your day to day vernacular, you might be surprised, or even confused by the description of this piece. But modern puppetry, when given the chance, can transcend the label of puppet theatre into what it really is - true theatre.\nThe Original Slapstick Comedy Duo\nIn order to do this, however, we need your support. With it, The Devil You Say can finally realize its full potential. This Fringe production is entirely self-produced and self funded. Which means we need any help we can get! Otherwise, Little Satan may have to get out his slap stick...\nHistory:\nThis piece began in the 1990\u2019s when the actress and playwright Yvonne Mitchell (best known for \u201cWoman in a Dressing Gown\u201d) created \u201cSpeak of the Devil,\u201d a solo piece for the wonderful British actor, Peter Dennis. Comprised of words, sayings, and dialogue attributed to Satan from the 1400\u2019s to the 1900\u2019s by some of History\u2019s greatest writers: Goethe, Marlowe, Byron and more. With these words Peter Dennis created an evening of eloquence, seduction and mystery.\nYears later I learned about this piece while working with Peter. I also became fascinated by a singular, plaster sculpture he owned, that of a Devil. This sculpture and the original script provided the inspiration for The Devil You Say, a 45 minute puppet soliloquy.\nThe Inspiration\nBut the 90\u2019s were a very different time than our own. Gone is the time of soft seduction, now is a time of stark differences and blame, where Evil feels closer, seems more real. With puppet governments rising and falling before our eyes \u2013 what better time for a puppet Satan? I reworked the text from original piece, creating a completely different Satan, one perhaps more in line with our times. I even added a cameo by Punch and Judy as Adam and Eve. The Devil You Say had its original workshop production at the Atlanta Shakespeare Tavern in 2012, and was the opening night of last year\u2019s LA Puppet Festival.\nBut now it's our chance to hit the big time at the Hollywood Fringe Festival - made possible with your help!\nBudget:\nCast:\nBut who are we and what have we done? The cast is made up of myself as creator, director and lead puppeteer. Adrian Rose Leonard as puppeteer, and Kila Packett is the Voice of the Devil.\nRobin Walsh has a long history of performing cabaret style pieces around the world, from here in L.A. to New York City, Germany and China. She has built, designed and performed everything from sock puppets for the Oscars to Hollywood movie monsters, as well as several successful, large scale stage shows. Stanford University\u2019s Lively Arts program commissioned her to create two puppet ballets: Stravinsky\u2019s The Firebird and Prokofiev\u2019s Romeo and Juliet and most recently, she collaborated with the Baroque Chamber Orchestra of Colorado on Jean Frery Rebel\u2019s The Elements. She\u2019s worked with her hero Ray Harryhausen on his last film and got to decapitate the real Rudolph puppet from the Rankin/Bass classic (in order to restore him...)\nAdrian Rose Leonard began exploring professional puppetry in 2007 when she joined the team at Wishing Chair Productions in Nashville, Tennessee. Not only did she discover that she had a knack for manipulating marionettes, but she found the opportunity to indulge her aspirations to design and build puppets of various styles. After moving to Los Angeles in 2011, Adrian had the honor of working at the legendary Bob Baker Marionette Theater, and her puppetry experience began to extend into the realm of television and film. Adrian continues to add to her skill set and looks forward to the discovery and excitement that the world puppetry has to offer.\n Kila Packett made his Off-Broadway debut in Sir Peter Hall\u2019s production of As You Like It at BAM. Other Off-Broadway: Classic Stage Co., The Pearl Theatre Co., Mabou Mines, and LaMaMa etc. L.A. Theatre: Theatricum Botanicum, Upright Citizens Brigade, Colony Theatre, Studio C Artists, New Musicals Inc., and NoHo Arts Center.

During World War II, my father was one of one hundred Jews in Berezne, Poland (now Ukraine), who narrowly escaped a murderous invasion by Nazi soldiers where thousands were executed, including my grandparents. Ben fled to the surrounding forests. There he fought as a partisan against the Nazis for over four years, until finally returning to his hometown to avenge his family's death by killing the men responsible. Arrested and sentenced to die himself, Ben thwarted death a second time by miraculously escaping from a Ukrainian prison. Soonafter, he met his future wife, my mother Naomi Baseman. In 1948, the two moved to North America to start a new life. Ben became an electrician and Naomi worked at the famous Canter's Deli Bakery for 35 years. My parents had four children and home became Fairfax Village, Los Angeles.\nToby walking the grounds in Auschwitz.\nI met with my long-time collaborator David Charles and revealed to him these family secrets. We both immediately understood the need to share this story with the world and the many other stories we\u2019ve discovered along the way. The odyssey will unveil intriguing secrets, myths, and stories of the Holocaust told through animation, theater, and other fantastical storytelling devices. In remembrance of all who suffered from the war, we also hope to work with Ukrainian artists to build an art installation in the very same forest my father fought as a partisan.\nToby at Canter's in honor of Gary's Mother Naomi Baseman who's worked there for 35 years.\nWe received tremendous support from Sundance Institute's New Frontier Story Lab that helped bring our film to a whole new level, and from the LA Museum of the Holocaust who is assisting with research and turning this into an educational platform, as well.\nWe\u2019ve been prepping, shooting, and researching this film for two years, and now the time has come to shoot the most important part \u2013 our journey to Ukraine, the land where it all happened.\nWe need your help to get there, to make this movie by following our creative instincts. We won\u2019t compromise this dream for anything. By supporting us, you are allowing us to share this story in its purest, most beautiful state. In return, I will share my art with you, so you can keep a piece of this story and hopefully be inspired by the many tales of resilience, love, and sacrifice and share them with your loved ones.\nPlease join us on this personal journey as we make Mythical Creatures together.\nThank you,\nGary\nTake home a part of our story.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nMemories and stories of survivors of genocide and war are quickly fading as the generations that experienced it pass away. Younger generations are not as connected to the Holocaust due to a lack of content and context. Myths have been created to cover up the atrocities from only 70 years ago. With the Kickstarter community, Gary will be able to independently tell the truth through his artistic vision and family story, ensuring tales of resilience, love, and sacrifice are remembered forever. \nFilmmakers\nDirector, David Charles is a Sundance Fellow filmmaker, writer, and graphic novelist, and has created interactive and non-traditional storytelling experiences for brands and properties worldwide. In 2011, Charles became Baseman\u2019s creative partner. They are currently in development on their first live action feature film, and have recently released a short animation commissioned by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, amongst other projects. David lost his mother at a young age and believes that we can keep the spirits of our lost loved ones alive through our positive actions in the world.\nGary Baseman is one of America\u02bcs most prominent living artists, whose work crosses fine art, \ufb01lm, illustration, toy design, and animation. Deemed one of the 100 Most Creative People by Entertainment Weekly, he is the creator of the three-time Emmy-winning ABC/Disney cartoon series, Teacher\u02bcs Pet, and the artistic designer of the popular board game Cranium.  In 2014, the Skirball Cultural Center showcased a retrospective of his work from the past 25 years, and Summer 2014 heralds an exhibition at MOCA Taipei.

We send filmmakers and media educators overseas to teach filmmaking and media literacy to underserved students for 1 full year. Our mission is to provide opportunities for cultural exchange and to empower students to tell their own stories. \nOUR STORY // After years of teaching media to students across the US, our team decided it was time to help filmmakers and art educators share their skills with overseas communities. First we founded a nonprofit organization. Then, we assembled a team of educators, artists, and international development specialists to help send volunteer filmmakers abroad for 1 full year. \nOUR TEAM // Our collective work experience includes the Tribeca Film Institute, Educational Video Center, VH1, Frank Sinatra School of the Arts, Global Potential, Charlotte Street Films, Results 4 Development (R4D) Institute, and the NYC Department of Education. \nNYC COLLABORATORS // The Young Women's Leadership Network, Global Potential, Global Kids\nOVERSEAS PARTNERS & SCHOOLS // The Bhutan Foundation, Children For Change Cambodia (CCC), Honduras Child Alliance, Volunteer Initiative Nepal, The Modern Story, Y-FI Africa, The Craig Bellamy Foundation. \nWe send filmmakers to teach students in underserved communities across Bhutan, Cambodia, Honduras, India, Kenya, Nepal, and Sierra Leone.\nHOW WE DO IT // We partner directly with schools and community organizations in developing countries. FWB educators work directly with youth in overseas classrooms 6 hours/day, 4 days/week for 1 year. We provide participants with curriculum, cameras, and equipment and we cover the cost of flights, housing, food, and insurance. \nOur curriculum uses all aspects of the filmmaking process as a means for promoting cross cultural exchange, creative empowerment, and digital storytelling. All projects are student-centered and aligned with Common Core, ISTE, and NYC Moving Image Blueprint curriculum standards. \nStudents learn the following skills:\nStorytelling Techniques\nCreative Writing\nPhotography & Storyboarding\nFilm Production (Shooting/Framing)\nAudio & Sound Design\nEditing & Post-Production\nInterviewing Techniques\nLeadership/Communication\nExamples of student projects include...\nFilm Scripts\nShort Documentary Films\nShort Narrative Films\nExperimental Films\nPhotography Projects\nAudio Projects\nMultimedia Projects\nStudent Film Festival & Community Screenings\nAt the end of each year-long overseas program, students organize a large-scale community screening/film festival of their own short films.  Local friends, family, and neighbors all have an opportunity to see FWB students' hard work and to engage with students' ideas. Additionally, FWB organizes a film festival back in NYC to showcase student work to an international audience. \n\nOur team works directly with overseas partner communities to ensure the promotion of culturally specific and sustainable educational practices. Additionally, our Director of Cultural Sustainability works closely with students' families, neighbors, and local community leaders to infuse local knowledge into all FWB curriculum and identifies opportunities for community empowerment. \nUsing Skype, Google Docs, and other digital tools, our team connects NYC students with youth in overseas communities. Students work together to make short film projects and learn about each others' culture. Check out this collaboration produced by students in the Bronx & Nairobi. \nFWB works with partner organizations across 7 different countries and fully-funds filmmakers to travel, live, and teach overseas for 1 year. Your donation will help cover the cost of roundtrip international flights, housing and food (12 months), local transportation, evacuation insurance, cameras, laptops, and additional equipment.\nFWB is 100% donor supported.\nFrom seeing their ideas up on the big screen to learning from passionate and engaging educators (who traveled half way around the world just for them), your contribution will make a meaningful impact in the lives of underserved students.

FWB is extremely sensitive to the challenges associated with bringing new technologies into communities as well as issues relating to cultural immersion and overall culture shock. Vivianne's core responsibilities include meeting and working with students' families, neighbors, and community leaders to integrate their cultural knowledge and expectations into the FWB curriculum, handbooks, etc. \n\nAdditionally, the FWB Education staff is devoted to ensuring educational sustainability. While we plan to send filmmakers back to the same community year after year after year, our film educators also train local educators how to sustain such a film program on their own.\n\nFinally, we are very aware of the historic lack of consideration sometimes given to local communities by well-intentioned international organizations and have specific measures in place to ensure that local communities have a voice and are empowered to shape their own future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Academy Award-nominated documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock supports FWB!", "update_content": "Guess what!\nAcademy Award-nominated documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock (Dir: Super Size Me) just tweeted about our new IndieGoGo campaign!

THANK YOU ALL!  \n                      \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 Estimated release date: November 2014 \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\nStay in touch and receive updates by joining my personal Email List. You can also follow the film's progress and see behind-the-scenes content on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Vine, and EatPES (my official site). \nHi I\u2019m PES! I want to talk to you about my new film\u2026  Submarine Sandwich!\nIt\u2019s the third installment of my stop-motion cooking series.  The first, Western Spaghetti, was voted Time Magazine's #2 Internet Video of 2008.  The second, Fresh Guacamole, is the shortest film ever nominated for an Oscar. Now it's time for Submarine Sandwich and I need your help to make it a reality!\n27.5 million of you have seen them\u2026 but if you haven't please take a minute to see what this is all about:\nWatch Western Spaghetti                                          Watch Fresh Guacamole\nMY FIRST TASTE\nI\u2019ve been thinking and preparing Submarine Sandwich for three years. It\u2019s the largest film I\u2019ve ever done. We\u2019ll be creating our own old school deli inspired from the New York classics of the 1920\u2019s\u2026 where the submarine sandwich was born.\nThis film has been a labor of love that began with a single image: A boxing glove in a deli slicer\u2026 knuckles to the blade.This idea stuck with me and I knew I had to bring it to life.\nI have been searching for and photographing objects, researching, sketching, writing, painting, shopping and collecting in preparation since then. \nFirst, by chance, I found the perfect deli slicer in a design exhibit at MoMa. I hunted down one of these exact models, The Streamliner, and I have been restoring it for the film. Then, I tracked down the truly classic, one-of-a-kind deli display case and shipped it to my studio. I have already begun to stock it with tasty morsels from the finest purveyors of meats and cheeses\u2026 except my meats and cheeses are vintage sporting equipment and the purveyors are junk shops, garage sales and eBay!\nI\u2019ve always loved taking something mundane and transforming it into the unexpected through the animation process. It\u2019s pure magic. In Submarine Sandwich, I'm taking all the stuff I\u2019ve collected \u2014 scarred boxing gloves, time-worn footballs, hockey gloves, and chunky baseball mitts \u2014 and slicing them up in order to build the tastiest sandwich ever\u2026 though it might be a bit hard to eat!\nA NEW RECIPE\nI\u2019ve never done anything like this before. I\u2019ve always been a bit of a one-man band but I\u2019m incredibly excited for the opportunity to invite all of you to participate in this process!\nI'll be sending out updates as everything progresses, asking for your thoughts, ideas and opinions as I go along. Filmmaking is a collaborative process and I am really psyched to have all of you as collaborators.\nLet\u2019s kick it off right now! Question #1:  Should I use Bicycle Reflectors or Air Hockey Pucks as the Tomato Slices in my Sub?  Please let me know what you think in the comments section.\nWHAT WE NEED MONEY FOR\nI believe that short films should be free and I have never charged for my films. Previously, I have had to find the funding myself, but this is definitely the biggest film I have ever made and that\u2019s why I need your help to bring it to life.\nMy films may be short\u2026 but they\u2019re not cheap. Even though they\u2019re animated, my films share more in common with live-action productions. I need sets, props, fabrication, cameras, lights, space \u2014 everything that live-action productions need \u2014 except that I need them for months at a time.\nNikon has already come on board as my lead sponsor, so I've been able to get a jump-start on the purchasing of some of this expensive equipment and props... but there\u2019s still a ton of stuff to do.  From fabricating the half-cut footballs to hiring the incredibly talented team of model-makers and animators I have lined up, we\u2019re ready for the next steps. I'm thrilled to finally put this film into production and that\u2019s why I am coming to you. With your help, we can make this film a reality!\nHAVE A SUB\nOf course, we\u2019re all in this to support cool projects, but one of the best parts of Kickstarter is nifty rewards.  While the main goal is to raise funds for the film, I really want everyone who supports get some Grade-A swag! I\u2019ve had a lot of fun thinking up different ideas and designing a few limited edition pieces myself. \nHere are a few of the exclusive limited Kickstarter edition rewards available to backers of Submarine Sandwich. They feature a special Kickstarter-only Submarine Sandwich design\u2026 if you like it, please back the project as it won\u2019t be available ever again.\nThe Submarine Sandwich T-Shirt Concept:\nThe Submarine Sandwich Screen Print. 18 x 24\" Signed and numbered:\nThe Film Still:\nYou\u2019ll select an image from either Submarine Sandwich, Fresh Guacamole, or Western Spaghetti. We\u2019ll have it printed as a Single Edition art print. Only ONE of each frame will ever be made.\nWe\u2019ll be doing this through Frame Factor, an innovative new platform that allows creators to sell individual frames as unique prints. We\u2019re doing this for the first time ever as part of this Kickstarter campaign! Backers will be able to choose first before we open it up to the general public. The early bird gets the worm....\nThe Submarine Sandwich Toy:\nDragonframe Software:\nNIKON\nNikon has generously stepped in as my lead sponsor on this film. This is exciting for a number or reasons. First, it\u2019s Nikon! I\u2019m mean\u2026 c\u2019mon!\nWhy that\u2019s great for me: they\u2019re providing a portion of the production funds as well as all of my camera gear and lenses. Even cooler, I\u2019m going to be shooting the film with their brand new D810 camera, just launched 2 weeks ago - which means Submarine Sandwich will likely be the first 8K stop-motion film ever.  \nWhy that\u2019s great for one lucky backer: Nikon is allowing us to include the new Nikon Animator's Kit as one of the rewards!\nYou will get the same hot-off-the presses Nikon D810 DSLR camera that I\u2019m going to use to shoot Sub Sandwich + the AF-S VR Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8G IF-ED lens + a copy of Dragonframe Software, the best stop-motion frame capture software out there. This camera is STUNNING. In addition to this AMAZING PACKAGE, you will also receive the EH-5b AC Adapter + the EP-5B power supply connect, both of which are very hard to find in stock.\nNikon Animator's Kit: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Digital-SLR-Cameras/D810-Animators-kit.page\nFrame Factor: http://www.frame-factor.com\nDragonframe: http://www.dragonframe.com\nAND NOW\u2026 THE FUN STUFF!\nThanks for reading and thanks in advance for all your help.

Passwords expire in 1 week.\n#BringAmbulante2CA\nFor two weeks, from September 21 to October 4, Ambulante will embark on its first major U.S. tour throughout the Greater Los Angeles area to create unique exhibition spaces and program free documentary cinema happenings. \nOur mission is simple: Democratize documentary culture. Since 2005, Ambulante.Org has annually organized an epic three-month tour across Mexico presenting remarkable international documentary cinema in areas with limited access to film. Thanks to a grant from the Ford Foundation, our efforts of adapting the successful model in the United States are underway! \nBUT WE NEED YOU TO MAKE IT HAPPEN: \nWe are less than three months away from our festival tour and we still need to secure supplemental funding to realize the large scale of the touring festival.  We are asking our new public to be principal supporters and join the Ambulante movement at this vital stage.\nOUR PROJECT GOAL:\nWe like to occupy alternative, outdoor and makeshift spaces while offering the best quality screen and sound for a truly cinematic experience. The funds we raise on Kickstarter will go towards investing in state of the art projection, transportation costs, as well as providing meals and gas mileage to our awesome volunteers.  The more backers and funds we raise, the more terrain we can cover to #BringAmbulante2CA\nThere is no other organization that travels as far and wide to exhibit DOCUMENTARY cinema outdoors and for free to the general public! Join us in bringing Ambulante to the diverse communties of Los Angeles this year!\n WHAT IS AT STAKE:\nAmbulante in California is a pilot program. How successful we are this first year will determine if we can activate Ambulante tours across the United States. Here's a trailer of the 2014 Spring tour in Mexico which gives a glimpse to the wide scope of programming Ambulante offers.\nPLAY\n\nWHAT IS OUR PLAN IN CALIFORNIA:\nEach day, in partnership with local organizations, the festival will program one free screening event and invite the filmmakers, subjects and other special guests to engage in conversation with audiences after the film. Naturally, we also want to organize some happening after screening parties and musical performances that will be free and open to the public.\nWHAT KIND OF FILMS DO WE PLAY?\nJust a few of the documentaries that Ambulante has toured in the past. Click on image to go to archive.\nOur programming vision is to promote the discovery of the most innovative filmmaking and inspired storytelling art of non-fiction film. We are excited to announce our freshly curated and eclectic Ambulante California lineup of films from all around the world, while also highlighting vibrant Mexican documentaries.\nIT'S NOT ALL ABOUT THE BENJAMINS\nHonestly!  Your help in spreading the word on social media is priceless. You can help us shape the festival.  Like our founding members, Diego and Gael say, \"The cool thing about Ambulante's design is that it's a platform the public owns and self-determines as their space for cultural and social exchange without outside restrictions.\"\nWE ARE LOOKING FOR A RELATIONSHIP\nThe ladies of Ambulante; Managing Director, Marie-\u00c8ve Parenteau., Executive Director, Elena Fortes, and Ambulante California Director, Christine Davila\nIt takes a passionate collective of people with relentless energy to produce the growing global reach of this festival.  We want to introduce and welcome you to the Ambulante Global community.

For nine years Ambulante has focused on supporting and promoting documentary film as a tool for social and cultural transformation. The tour travels across 12 states in Mexico over the course of three months to areas with limited access to film to diversify and democratize documentary culture. The objective is to reach a broader audience by screening films in a wide array of venues and offering most of its programming for free. For more information visit our website www.ambulante.com.mx\n\n\nEN ESPA\u00d1OL\nAmbulante es una organizaci\u00f3n sin fines de lucro dedicada a apoyar y difundir el cine documental como una herramienta de transformaci\u00f3n cultural y social. Ambulante viaja a lugares que cuentan con poca oferta de exhibici\u00f3n y formaci\u00f3n en cine documental, con el fin de crear una audiencia participativa, cr\u00edtica e informada, y abrir nuevos canales de expresi\u00f3n y reflexi\u00f3n en M\u00e9xico y en el extranjero. Desde su fundaci\u00f3n en el a\u00f1o 2005, Ambulante A.C. realiza cada a\u00f1o un festival de cine documental que recorre varios estados de M\u00e9xico durante 3 meses. \n\nGracias a la beca de la Ford Foundation, ya est\u00e1 en marcha en Estados Unidos nuestro esfuerzo para adaptar este exitoso modelo de festival itinerante de cine documental impulsado por la comunidad. Sin embargo, para poder realizar nuestra primera gira en Los \u00c1ngeles, California, del 21 de Septiembre al 4 de Octubre, a\u00fan necesitamos completar nuestro presupuesto de producci\u00f3n. Ya que probablemente no nos ser\u00e1 posible confirmar un patrocinio tradicional antes de nuestro lanzamiento, estamos pidi\u00e9ndole a nuestro p\u00fablico que se una y apoye el movimiento Ambulante en esta etapa cr\u00edtica.\n\nNUESTRA META:\nComo meta de financiamiento, nos hemos propuesto alcanzar el presupuesto m\u00ednimo necesario para hacer realidad esta primera edici\u00f3n del festival. Queremos organizar funciones y actividades en lugares alternativos, improvisados y al aire libre, en los que podamos ofrecer proyecciones de calidad para lograr una experiencia comunitaria extraordinaria. Los fondos que recaudemos en Kickstarter ser\u00e1n invertidos en la log\u00edstica de las proyecciones. Como planeamos desplazarnos por el \u00e1rea metropolitana de Los \u00c1ngeles con el objetivo de llegar hasta los barrios m\u00e1s desfavorecidos que cuentan con poca oferta de exhibici\u00f3n, los fondos tambi\u00e9n cubrir\u00e1n gastos de transporte, comida y gasolina para nuestros voluntarios. Conforme m\u00e1s backers tengamos y m\u00e1s fondos recaudemos, m\u00e1s territorio podremos recorrer en #BringAmbulante2CA.\n\nQU\u00c9 EST\u00c1 EN JUEGO: \nAmbulante en California es un programa piloto. Nuestro \u00e9xito en Los \u00c1ngeles este primer a\u00f1o determinar\u00e1 hasta qu\u00e9 punto podremos expandir la plataforma a diferentes estados y localidades de Estados Unidos en el futuro. \n\nAqu\u00ed est\u00e1 el tr\u00e1iler de la Gira 2014 en M\u00e9xico, en el que puedes comprobar el nivel de la programaci\u00f3n que ofrece Ambulante.\n\nCU\u00c1L ES NUESTRO PLAN EN CALIFORNIA: \nLa edici\u00f3n inaugural de Ambulante California 2014 viajar\u00e1 a los vecindarios m\u00e1s multiculturales de Los \u00c1ngeles para capturar y activar audiencias. En colaboraci\u00f3n con distintas organizaciones, el objetivo es incentivar intervenciones art\u00edsticas de car\u00e1cter social, presentar historias que reflejen la diversa herencia de las comunidades y promover la apreciaci\u00f3n intercultural desde diferentes perspectivas. Ambulante en el contexto de Los \u00c1ngeles favorecer\u00e1 la vinculaci\u00f3n cultural comunitaria a trav\u00e9s del documental, generando un di\u00e1logo de inter\u00e9s local y global en el marco del vasto y din\u00e1mico ecosistema de las subculturas de la ciudad.\n\nTodos los d\u00edas, en colaboraci\u00f3n con organizaciones locales, el festival programar\u00e1 al menos una funci\u00f3n, e invitaremos a los cineastas y otros invitados especiales a entablar un di\u00e1logo con el p\u00fablico despu\u00e9s de la pel\u00edcula. Tambi\u00e9n organizaremos actividades diversas tras las proyecciones y presentaciones musicales, que ser\u00e1n gratuitas y abiertas al p\u00fablico.\n\nNO S\u00d3LO SE TRATA DE RECAUDAR FONDOS \n\u00a1Lo decimos en serio! Tu ayuda para correr la voz en tus redes sociales es imprescindible. Como a los fundadores de Ambulante Diego Luna y Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal les gusta decir, una de las misiones de Ambulante es proporcionar una plataforma que le pertenezca al p\u00fablico y en la que exista un intercambio cultural sin restricciones. Con esto en mente, dependemos de la participaci\u00f3n de nuestro nuevo p\u00fablico para ayudarnos a moldear Ambulante en los Estados Unidos.\n\nQUEREMOS ESTABLECER UNA RELACI\u00d3N CON NUESTROS BACKERS: \nSe necesita un colectivo de gente apasionada con mucha energ\u00eda para hacer posible el festival. Queremos que llegues a conocer a nuestros fundadores y al staff a trav\u00e9s de las actualizaciones del proyecto. A cada backer se le mandar\u00e1 una serie de videos exclusivos: detr\u00e1s de c\u00e1maras y an\u00e9cdotas que revelen la historia de Ambulante contadas por cineastas y voluntarios. Tambi\u00e9n capturamos conversaciones con Diego y Gael, rescatados de nuestro video de Kickstarter, que no te puedes perder.\n\nAmbulante Global surge a partir de 9 a\u00f1os de experiencia en la planeaci\u00f3n y producci\u00f3n de la Gira de Documentales en M\u00e9xico, y representa el primer intento oficial de establecer, a largo plazo, la presencia de Ambulante fuera del pa\u00eds. Con el paso de los a\u00f1os, Ambulante ha acumulado una valiosa experiencia en la producci\u00f3n de festivales de cine en una variedad de contextos geogr\u00e1ficos y sociales. En un esfuerzo por alcanzar nuevos p\u00fablicos, Ambulante ha logrado involucrar a una gran variedad de socios y colaboradores en la organizaci\u00f3n del festival (complejos cinematogr\u00e1ficos, organizaciones de la industria del cine, instituciones, organizaciones no gubernamentales, universidades, etc.). El festival ha conseguido establecer una trayectoria impecable y prestigiosa, respaldada por los testimonios de invitados de ediciones pasadas, m\u00faltiples invitaciones a participar en festivales de cine internacionales, y por diversos reconocimientos como el Premio WOLA de Derechos Humanos 2011 por la promoci\u00f3n del documental como una herramienta de cambio. \n\nDurante esta edici\u00f3n, Ambulante Global buscar\u00e1 extender su red de colaboradores, trabajar con distintos socios locales y crear un contexto adecuado para la recepci\u00f3n del cine documental, adem\u00e1s de potenciar el impacto y la visibilidad de este importante g\u00e9nero.\n\nDesde 2007, Ambulante ha presentado selecciones de documentales en m\u00e1s de 33 ciudades en 17 pa\u00edses en colaboraci\u00f3n con distintos festivales, organizaciones, exhibidoras e instituciones. Ambulante ha viajado a Argentina, Australia, Canad\u00e1, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador, Espa\u00f1a, Estados Unidos, Guatemala, Inglaterra, Nicaragua, Noruega, Sud\u00e1frica, Suecia, Tanzania y Kosovo.\n\nEn todos los lugares a los que Ambulante ha viajado, la raz\u00f3n fundamental por la cual ha tenido \u00e9xito es porque el p\u00fablico ha adoptado, acogido y transformado Ambulante para que encaje dentro de sus deseos y necesidades. Nos hemos unido a la comunidad de Kickstarter en busca de colaboradores, socios, aliados y amigos para emprender esta aventura juntos.\n\nMuchas gracias por ser parte de este proyecto tan especial.\n-\u00a1Gael, Diego, Pablo, Elena, Christine, y el resto de la familia Ambulante y CANANA!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Party details, film schedule and LA2050 Vote", "update_content": "We are planning something special to thank you in a BIG WAY, but for right now, we needed to simply say THANK YOU SO MUCH.
