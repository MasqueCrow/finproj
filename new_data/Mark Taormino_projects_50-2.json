These are one of a kind, and only one for each demon will be made.  See below for scroll details.\n BUCKSKIN SCROLLS NOW UNLOCKED!!! See below for description.  THESE ARE AN ADD ON OPTION. \n As of the creation of this campaign, the page count is well over 200 pages. \nBUCKSKIN SUMMONING SCROLLS ARE NOW UNLOCKED!\nPLEASE KEEP READING, ALL WILL BE EXPLAINED...\nPLAY\n\n\n\nI started gaming in the early 80's, and I'm pretty sure I started at a way too early age. By the time my friends and I got a handle on how to actually play the game of D&D, the Satanic Panic had hit.  And so like a lot of young players, into a box in the basement my books went, for fear that I might make a pact with the devil with just a simple roll of a D20.\nThe fan-art based books that I create are the types of tomes that I would have loved to have had as peripherals as a young player, and even now more than ever.  I want to create something that makes the game more immersive and cater to the individual player, such as the illustrated spellbooks that are almost at completion for the 8 schools of magic.  (Back issues can be found here -  PhilStoneIllustrations )\nWhich brings me to The Demonology of Lire Goest. \nArtistically, this grimoire is modeled after several books from the past, most notably, The Demonology of King James the 1st (who actually coined the term Demonology), The Grand Grimoire, and The Lesser Keys of Solomon.\nThere are 3 to 5 pages for each named demon or creature complete with stats from either 3.5 or 5e.  There is also a summoning spell and sigil should the Dungeon Master or player decide to make things more interesting during the game.  A personal grimoire is added at the back for your own inscriptions and conversions.\nLire Goest was evil to the point of insanity.  His personal recordings while travelling through the abyss have been recorded on the living skins of the residents of Eastbourne, only to be flayed off the carcass to be used as summoning scrolls for later use.  Lire Goest desired power and infamy.  This is the one and only recorded tome of his existence, his interplanar travels, and his diabolical magic.  It has been so extensive, that two volumes had to be created.\nWHAT IS THIS BOOK, AND WHY IS THERE NO PDF??????\nNo, there is no PDF version of this book.  It is not formatted as a quick reference piece.  It is a grimoire to haunt your bookshelf.  Although there are stats and what not for each summoned demon,  it is not like my spellbooks (which will always have a PDF) where one can pull up something on the fly.  No, I want you to be able to touch it, peruse it, experience it.  This is how I always wanted a Necromantic tome to be.  I want you to hold it, show it off.  I started these projects as immersive peripheral props to be the character that you play.  There are summoning circles, protection wards for those who are summoned, and one hell of a backstory to the most infamous necromancer who started this grimoire.  \nThe Demon List for Vol. 1\nAdaru, Alkilith, Armanite, Babau, Balor, Baphomet, Barlgura, Bebilith, Bulezau, Carnage, Charon, Chasme, Demogorgon, Demonthorn Mandrake, Destrachan, Draegloth, Draudnu, Dretch, Evistro, Fraz-urb'luu, Gadaacro, Glabrezu, Goristro, Graz'zt, Hezrou\n\nSUMMONING SCROLLS\nAt 5k I will unlock the ability to pledge for the one of a kind buckskin scrolls.  These are one of a kind and only ONE will be made by CaveGeekArt for each demon.\nAbout CaveGeekArt work:\n            Cave Geek Art creates unique, handmade artwork using ancient materials and techniques combined with pyrography. By burning designs into traditional brain-tanned buckskin, he sculpts the leather into a three-dimensional relief that brings the images to life! Any color added is done with natural pigments, applied with bone tools.\nScrolls:\nSize- The scrolls are roughly 11x17\u201d in size, but may vary depending on the specific design. Each is one-of-a-kind, and some may have additional pieces attached to them.\nWeight- Roughly 4oz\nTurnaround- Assuming all materials are on hand (quality buckskin can be difficult to acquire), a scroll can take many hours to create, and probably up to 2 weeks per scroll.\nPrice- Each scroll is a 450.00 pledge plus shipping.\nThe scrolls WILL NOT go into production until the money has been collected from Kickstarter. Regular updates will be given as scroll production is ongoing.\nPLAY\n\nAt 10k, we will unlock PRINTS of the scrolls.\nScroll prints are 11 x 17\nEach print is a 20.00 pledge plus shipping\nExample of scroll print", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is not being funded\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 45 or more", "title": "Hardcover Leatherette copy of the book", "descp": "Get a hardcover, leatherette bound, and foil stamped cover version of the Demonology Grimoire.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["138 backers", "Add-ons"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Enchantment spellbook is live and more!", "update_content": "The feedback through messages and comments for this book have been amazing, and for that I want to thank you all!

They can easily be adapted to most fantasy role-playing games, including the Advanced 2nd edition game, the Original game, the B/X or BECMI (\u201cBasic\u201d) games, old-school renaissance (OSR) role-playing systems, and most other FRPG game systems. All DGG products are designed to evoke the look and feel of the classic D&D modules of the early and mid-1980s. These adventures have minimal plots that allows you to easily fit them into any campaign world.\n\nBoth modules will be available in print and eBook PDF versions. The print versions feature the classic module format with stapled booklet and a removable two- or three-panel cardstock cover. The maps are printed in classic dungeon blue on cover's inside for that genuine old-school gaming feel. As with all DDG products, creating a module of quality production, artwork, and printing is the paramount goal of this project. \n\nYour support of this Kickstarter ensures the production of more fantastic classic-style adventures from Dungeoneers Guild Games in the future, and helps keep old-school dungeoneering alive and vibrant for years to come.\nRumors speak of a mysterious silver tower that shines like a polished mirror that has recently appeared out of thin air. Bizarre creatures believed to have emerged from the tower roam the land. The few learned sages that know of it suggest that the tower is really a dimension-hopping fortress. Possibly some adventurers could go to the tower to find out why it has come here?\n\nDD4 Secret of the Silver Spire is a 52-page module for characters levels 3 to 7. In this adventure, the player characters explore an outlandish citadel inhabited by strange creatures, such as the barzani ape-men, modrons of many types, and three-faced golden sentinels. The enigmatic overlords are the \"silver masters\" \u2014 alien beings  made of pure energy. The tower is a maze of rooms stuffed with strange equipment and curious items these creatures have collected from all over the multiverse.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains eighteen original black-and-white illustrations by Ryan Jack Allred, Jonathan Bingham, Jeff Laubenstein, Bradley K. McDevitt, Stefan Poag, and Peter Saga. Russ Nicholson (of Fiend Folio fame) created the outstanding and colorful cover art featuring the Spire and its alien inhabitants.\n\nFeatures\nA 52-page saddle-stitched booklet printed in black-and-white.\nA removable, two-panel cardstock cover printed in color.\nEight level maps.\n153 numbered encounter areas, adventure background for the GM, and scenario hook suggestions.\nSix new monsters: barzani, flame harlequin, flying bloodworm, golden sentinel, silver master, and tselmoi.\nSixteen new magi-tech items.\n\nStefan Poag's illustration of some of the inhabitants of the Spire.\nSome rogue modrons undergoing \"reeducation\".

No one knows what exactly lies behind its mudbrick walls. Surely vast treasures fill its fresco-lined chambers, and doubtlessly terrible guardians keep the unworthy from claiming them.\n\nDDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu is a 36-page module with a world-generic setting for characters levels 7 to 10. In this adventure, inspired by the mythology and culture of the ancient Sumerians, the players explore a ziggurat located in marshy river delta. The characters must survive the four deadly levels of the temple to escape its mudbrick walls. This adventure contains background notes, a cutaway map of the temple, five new monsters, and six variable endings. Additionally, this special module contains original thirteen illustrations to show the players. The referee can opt to play this module one of two ways \u2014 as a \u2018Living\u2019 or, \u2018Lost\u2019 temple.\n\nArtwork\nThe module contains twenty-two original black-and-white illustrations by Jonathan Bingham, Darlene (ex-TSR), Earl Geier, Jeff Laubenstein, Mark Lyons, and Frank Scacalossi.

All that is needed is a group of inquisitive adventurers to investigate the veracity of these claims. Foul sorcery, evil doings, and horrid beings from the blackest pits stand to thwart the meddlesome heroes. An adventure for characters levels 5-8.\n\nDD2: DUNGEONS OF THE DREAD WYRM: No one has seen the wicked red dragon, Felmurnuzza, ravager of the northlands, for decades. Some believe that she has perished, while others believe that she sleeps away the years ensconced in her fortress-like lair. Rumors suggest that over the centuries she has amassed a vast hoard of treasure that is second to none. Cunning traps, devious tricks, and powerful guardians defend the dragon\u2019s dungeons from would-be looters. This challenging adventure is for characters levels 10-15.\n\nDD3: THE MISTY HALLS OF KAL\u00c1VORKA: A lost vale located in a high mountain range is home to a clan of mysterious giants. Sages believe the giants have strange powers that no other of their kind possesses. Yet, no one has heard anything from these giants in decades. Do they still dwell in their misty fastness? Do they really possess these reputed powers, and if they do, what are they? Crafty giants, evil gnomes, and a weird guardian await any adventurers who go seeking the lost halls. An adventure for characters levels 5-7.\nDUNGEON DELVE SIDE QUEST 1: SHIPWRECK AT HAR\u2019S POINT: Nothing much usually happens in the sleepy fishing hamlet of Har\u2019s Point. Recently, however, a ship has crashed on the rocks outside of town. Now rumors concerning treasure it supposedly carried are running rife amongst the fisherfolk. Some of these rumors hint that dead sailors from the ship are now walking the nearby beaches at night. Even more concerning, a mysterious stranger has been spotted around town. A few inquisitive adventurers might be able to discover what exactly is going on in Har\u2019s Point. An adventure for characters levels 1-3.\nAbout the Project Designer\nMy name is R. Nelson Bailey. My start with playing role-playing games began with Advanced Dungeons & Dragons in 1983 and has never stopped. For the last 18 years, I have run a weekly AD&D game with a group of dedicated players. As with many kids of the day, I dreamed of having TSR publish one of my modules. Now I am doing that with Dungeoneers Guild Games. DD4 Secret of the Silver Spire and DDS1 The Sacred Temple of Erwadu are part line of classic-style adventure modules. The fifth Dungeoneers Guild Games project will come out later in 2021.

Every other Monday night we got together at Garret's house and had a ball role-playing into the early hours of the morning.  After COVID, the group dispersed.  We tried to transition online but couldn\u2019t recreate the in-person magic.  Meanwhile, I was DMing a game for my family online.  It was a great way to spend time with my brother and cousins who live in another state, but the role-playing wasn't as engaging as Garret's in-person campaign.  So during this last year of social distancing I've thought a lot about using digital tools to create great role-playing experiences online.  This project implements ways to engage players online including beautiful battle maps, short videos and narrated box text.  \nELEMENTS OF A 5E NATIONAL PARK\nBelow are the elements of a 5E national park.  These come as a coherent pdf.  For example, there is a picture of the battle map that has \"room numbers\" overlaid on it. Then there is \"box text\" that describes those \"rooms\".  Finally, the box text has an embedded audio file so that when you click on it the pdf reads the box text.  \n\nAdditionally, all the digital files also come separate from the pdf so that you can easily upload the maps, monsters, video and audio into your favorite virtual table top or creatively incorporate them as separate elements into your in-person campaign.\nBattle Map\nA 40 x 30 battle map that is 162 pixels per square.  It comes in a simple sketch version (great for a player handout), detailed black and white version, full color gridded (square), full color gridded (hex) and full color ungridded (clean) versions.  \nPhotos \nFive real world photographs of the national park.  These photos are used by the cartographer and point of view artist to inspire their work.  Specific features from the photos are incorporated into the battle map.  For example, look at the dark crevices in the photograph of the cliff below (no, they are not caves in the real world).   These feature prominently on the battle map and in the point of view art.  In your campaign they might be caves!  The pictures are fun for general inspiration and as player handouts.   \nPoint of View Art\nThe point of view art corresponds to a specific location on the battle map.  It is drawn to represent the field of view of a character standing at that point.  \nMonsters\nEach monster comes with a picture, token, and 5E stat block.  The monsters may be 5E OGL or custom monsters. Regardless of origin, they fit thematically with the national park, and may be inspired by real world animals, such as the Dire Big Horn Sheep that TPK\u2019d my test party in the Badlands. \nVoice Acting\nThe box text from each national park is read by a professional voice actor.  DMs can click on the box text in the pdf to play the audio.  Each national park comes with 200 words of voice acting.  Click on \"Play\" below to check it out!\nPLAY\n\nMovie\nThe movie introduces the 5E national park.  It incorporates some of the voice acting, photography and potentially the point of view art.  It is one minute long. \nPLAY\n\nSHARD TABLETOP\nAll Rewards (minus the $1 fan & map only) come with the 5E National Park also delivered as a Shard Package.   This is in addition to the pdf and other digital files. \nSOCIAL GOALS\nThe 5E Inspired by The National Parks Facebook Group is this project's social media focal point.  Social goals are unlocked when people join the facebook group - so please join it and invite your friends who would enjoy this digital content to join it! \nIn the facebook group you can vote on which national parks should inspire this content, provide feedback on concept art and enjoy a fun community!\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$4,500:  Overland Map\nOne overland map for each park based on the real world topography and scaled to 1 hex = 1 mile.\n$6,000:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!  Along with the overland map, this second battle map allows each park to become a mini-adventure.\n$7,500:  Battle Map\nAn additional Battle Map for every 5E National Park!\n$9,000:  Additional National Park!\nThe base Park Package plus all unlocked social and stretch goals.\n$10,500:  GIFs!\nEach 5E National Park will include a monster GIF!  These are fun to play when a monster makes a critical hit or does its signature attack.  \nADD ONS", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main risk is that I am the driving force behind The Basement War Room.

Perhaps I should be saying this to my Kickstarters Anonymous group, but whatever.  We're here, we love games, let's do this!\nBefore I forget, here's my blog:  Venger's Old School Gaming Blog. \nSince creating Cha'alt and Cha'alt: Fuchsia Malaise (I'll put some review links in the FAQ area), I've been writing adventures for my eldritch, gonzo, science-fantasy, post-apocalyptic campaign setting.  Before releasing Book III in the trilogy (hopefully 2022), I want to get these short scenarios out there.\nAlso, I need to sell more luxury hardcovers of the first two books before embarking on the third.  A lot of my money is tied up in inventory. More on that later.\nBelow are some WIP maps I've drawn during my pandemic downtime...\nWhat kind of adventures are we talking about here?  Low to mid-level, sword & sorcery with lasers.  These will be 10-page one-shot scenarios that both expand the world and drill deeper into what makes a Venger Satanis adventure - weird, grindhouse, pop-culture, mash-up that's both humorous and deadly!\nIf that sounds like your cup of tea, please back this project.  And tell others - that's important.\nThe first adventure is titled Six Hours To Save Cha'alt.  It's about a meteor on a collision course with the planet.  Only the PCs can avert disaster.  They have to venture inside a sleeping spawn of an Old One in order to find the tech that can save Cha'alt.\nThe second adventure is about a man with a crazy scarf whose death leads the PCs to guarding the Federation President before their starship plummets into Sanz Egra'as - a maximum security prison zone on Cha'alt.  Yeah, that's going to be fun for the whole family!\nWe're talking eccentric NPCs, new monsters, awesome locations, weird artifacts, maps, artwork, strange and familiar ties to this campaign world (along with various other things I've written along the way... Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Liberation of the Demon Slayer, Alpha Blue, Dead God Excavation, etc.), and your favorite - RANDOM TABLES.  It's going to be insane.\nI've got ideas for the third adventure (coming up with stuff has never been a problem for me), but let's not get ahead of ourselves.  This thing has to fund before we get into stretch goals...\n\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$2,000 - Two Adventures\n$3,000 - Three Adventures\n$4,000 - Four Adventures\n$5,000 - Five Adventures\n$6,000 - Six Adventures\n$7,000 - Seven Adventures [7 sweet-ass scenarios for $5?  Are you for serious?  That's better than the party's assassin murdering the party's bard before reaching the dungeon!]\nOk, you may be wondering why I'm selling more Cha'alt books when it's already sold out.  Last year, a friend of mine bought up 500 of the initial print run at a discount to both help me out (I was in debt) and sell them at a future date at a much higher price. \nHe's agreed to sell me back (for what he paid) as many Cha'alt hardcovers as I need to successfully fulfill this Kickstarter.  \nI know a lot of Cha'alt fans wish they could still get the first printing hardcover, so now you can!\nThe PDFs will be fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.

Complete list of announced Stretch Goals can be found below.\nAre you a gamemaster looking for a fun and challenging adventure to add to your ongoing campaign? Or maybe you just want a scenario you can run for your players that can be completed in one or two sessions? In either case, I have just what you want\u2026 Wyrmkeep Dungeons TZ3: The Forbidden Isle is a fantasy role-playing-game adventure module designed for a band of 4-8 5e DnD characters of 4th to 6th level.\nA renown rogue has stolen an heirloom from a powerful family and fled to a little-visited island. There he waits for news from those who have offered to fence the item. A party of adventurers is being sought to both hunt the criminal down before he can escape the island, and return the treasure to its rightful owners. Unfortunately, there are complications.\nThe Forbidden Isle is surrounded by foreboding magic, has some very strange geography, and is inhabited by dangerous creatures including the mysterious humanoids known as \"Icylanders.\" A final concern is that more than one group may be competing to win the bounty being offered! Can the adventurers beat the clock and their opponents?\nThe author of this module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. This is his seventh fantasy RPG funding drive, the first six being the successfully funded and shipped Temple of the Dragon Kin, Befouled Maze of the Demi-Lich, The Beast Below, Raiders of the Cloud Castle, Curse of the Desert Outpost and Maps #1: Buildings, Castles and Dungeons. Joe is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nAn abridged version of The Forbidden Isle was run at Gateway 2019, and all that is needed to complete the module is to fill-in a few additional encounters, write final monster stat blocks, and commission some more illustrations. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by the late Summer 2020.\nThere are some of the artists that will appear in the module (based on availability): Jacob Blackmon, Brian Brinlee, Joshua LH Burnett , Ed Lacabanne, Mark Lyons, Brian McCranie, and Phil Stone\nThe module will have the following features as a base goal:\n20-24 pages in length\nOver two dozen encounter areas\n4 black & white interior illustrations\nColor cover artwork\nAt least one new monster available as Open Game Content\nMaps of the island and all significant locations\nAlthough written for 5th Edition, the module should be easily adaptable to other fantasy RPG systems!\n Once the base goal is reached, I would like to make The Forbidden Isle even better by adding more content! You must back at a $6 or above pledge level to receive Stretch Goal rewards.\nShe's falling for you!\n You can include additional items in your rewards by increasing your pledge total above the base for the tier you selected. Just include the additional amount(s) listed below.

If you would like to purchase a copy of the module, please visit http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin for production status and ordering information.\nThank you again backers!\nThe Project\nAre you a game master looking for an interesting and challenging adventure for your players that can be completed in one session? Well, I believe I have just what you want: Temple of the Dragon Kin is a mini-adventure module designed for a band of 5-8 5e DnD characters of 6th to 8th level.\nA party of stalwart adventurers is being sought by the learned sage, Gaspar Uberbellum. He wishes to hire the group to find and explore a lost temple dedicated to the veneration of dragons and their humanoid children, the dragon born. Within this temple is supposedly a powerful magic item that Gaspar covets: the Helm of the Dragon Lord.\nThe party will be paid handsomely for successfully locating, extracting, and returning the Helm to the sage. And unusual for agreements of this kind, the party\u2019s employer does not desire a cut of any other valuables discovered \u2014 the party can keep random loot they acquire along the way!\nSounds like a great deal! Simple really.\nWell, one should expect to encounter deadly traps, inscrutable puzzles, and powerful guardians along the way. Nothing a strong and resourceful group of adventurers can\u2019t overcome!\nAlthough they might want to worry about the dragons.\nThe Details\nThis project is a special All in 1 Kickstarter, which among other things means that the funding drive only has a duration of one week. Back it now because there is not much time for procrastination!\nThe author of the module is Joe Pearce, who has been running and writing RPG adventures for over 20 years. He is also a video game developer and writes a webcomic.\nThe module has a complete design and only needs expanded descriptions of the encounters, playtesting, and artwork for it to be finished. I expect it should be available for delivery to backers by May of this year (2017).\nThe module will have the following features:\n12-16 pages in length\n10-14 encounter areas\n4 original, to-be-commissioned, black & white illustrations\n2 new monsters available as Open Gaming Content\nMap of the Temple of the Dragon Kin\nAn adventurer encounters something shocking!\nRewards\nThis is a nice, short Kickstarter and has a corresponding small set of rewards.\n$3 / PDF Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$10 / Printed Module: You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in both printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module.\n$30 / Name an NPC: You will get the opportunity to name an NPC! (Name must be approved by Joe.) You receive Temple of the Dragon Kin in printed and PDF format, and your name will appear in the Special Thanks section of the module. The reward has a limited number of backers!\n$100 / \u201cI Funded This\u201d: A singular backer will earn the right to claim they truly funded this Kickstarter -- you will be listed as Executive Producer in the main credits! You also get to add a message to one plot-significant item. (Message must be approved by Joe.) You receive two printed copies of Temple of the Dragon Kin (one signed by Joe if you wish) and a copy of the module in PDF format. The reward is limited to one backer!\nAdd-On\n$10 / Extra Printed Copy of Module: If you are backing at the Printed Module reward level or higher, you can purchase an additional copy of the module for $10. Just add this amount to your pledge. Joe will sign the extra copy too!\nStretch Goals\nOnce the base goal is reached, I would like to make Temple of the Dragon Kin even better by adding more content!\n$250: Splash of Color! The module gets a color illustration for the cover. UNLOCKED.\n$500: Bigger Is Better! A full-page illustration is added to the module. UNLOCKED.\n$1000: Invitation from the Past! You receive a facsimile of an invitation to join the secret society behind the Temple of the Dragon Kin, just like one that appears in the module! The document features a new piece of artwork and is provided as a printed letter (on parchment-like paper) for those backers receiving a printed copy of the module, while others receive a PDF of the letter. Show it to your players during the game for extra realism! LOCKED.\n$1500: To be revealed once previous stretch goal unlocked. The goal will include Kickstarter exclusive content! LOCKED.\nFinal Words\nThanks for your interest in this project. I hope you will become a backer and help make Temple of the Dragon Kin a reality for gamers to enjoy. Regardless if you can donate, please share a link to this project with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any other forum that you think people would like the module.\nLink to this project: http://wyrmkeep.com/dragonkin\nOne final note: As a backer of Kickstarter projects myself, I have one request for you: even if you don\u2019t support this project, please find another project today and donate at least $1 to them. That way they will be excited, you will feel great, and it will help us further everyone's creative and artistic goals on this site.\n-- Joe Pearce", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe project risks are pretty minimal for such a basic RPG module.

Incidentally, the main picture above is from a previous blue map of his.  \nThis one is going to be in the \"middle ground\" between standard dungeon and mega-dungeon.  Not too busy, but lots going on... and huge!  Each quadrant of this map will be created by Glynn so they can be printed out as one big map or used separately as 4 smaller maps (individual dropbox links will be provided for everything), arranged as you like.  And if this goes well, it's possible we'll immediately have bonus quadrants or giant maps available to us.  See stretch goals below.\nYou may have a reservation about using a map big enough for all the players to see what's going on.  Well, if it's a trade off, I suppose.  If the GM presents the entire map all at once, a fraction of the mystery is gone.  However, it saves everyone at the table the trouble of taking time out to map what the GM sees in his book.  I don't know about you, but my spur of the moment mapping sucks compared to what's in my module.  \nWhat about the secret stuff GM maps contain?  All that's being left out of the map... but not left out of the adventure!\nThe map will also come with a 5 - 7 page PDF.  This document will contain a brief history of the dungeon, as well as, various random tables for helping the GM spontaneously come up with content, description, rumors, factions, and encounters (including traps, monsters, NPCs, weird stuff, etc.) so that each adventure into the S'rulyan Vault can be unique.  \nThis map, in conjunction with the PDF, is perfect for sparking the imagination and fostering improvisation - something the O5R needs more of, in my opinion.  Although, there's nothing to stop a GM from creating his own room key ahead of time, either based on my notes and suggestions or as developed from his own imagination or published modules.\nWhen finished, the entire map can be printed out at 34\" x 44\" from your local copy/print shop without any loss in clarity, as Glynn is making it high-resolution 600dpi (similar to the Alpha Blue space station map). Although, the maps could just as easily be printed off yourself at 8.5\" x 11\".  The files will look just like the inside cover of a module from 1983... or (see stretch goals) like the example below, also by Glynn Seal.\nFor those curious, The S'rulyan Vault random tables will contain minimum gonzo and science-fantasy... but those aspects shall be present to some degree.\nStretch Goals\n$1,000  :::  If this project reaches $1,000, then the map files will not only be available in blue and white but a bloody, stained, and wrinkled extremely realistic parchment and black ink (see example above).\n$1,500 ::: I'm going to have James V West illustrate a custom-made fantasy RPG character sheet attached to the PDF.  Scroll down below for a sample of James' work.  It will be similar aesthetically to his \"demon idol\" character sheet... yet generic enough for compatibility with most O5R fantasy roleplaying games (such as Crimson Dragon Slayer).\n$2,000  :::   If the project reaches this mark, Glynn will create a whole set of additional four quadrants that can be used separately or together to form a second mega-map!  These new dropbox files will also be in blue/white and virtual parchment and black ink.\n$3,000  :::  If this project reaches $3,000 (tentacles crossed), then all files (including the corresponding PDF will be available to the entire world... for FREE!!!\n ________\nWhat else have I done?\nWell, as High Priest of Kort'thalis Publishing, I've created the following: Liberation of the Demon Slayer, The Islands of Purple-Haunted Putrescence, Revelry in Torth, How to Game Master like a Fucking Boss, Crimson Dragon Slayer, The Outer Presence, Alpha Blue, and Girls Gone Rogue.\nClick on the DTRPG button below to see everything available for purchase (usually PDF and print).\nClick me!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt will take Glynn approximately 3 weeks to finish the map files and I should have the PDF finished by then, as well. \n\nThe completion date of \"July 2016\" is for the stretch goals and just in case one or both of us are delayed by illness or some other catastrophe (Dread Cthulhu forbid!)... however, as of today (4/19/16), it looks like everything will be done and in backers' hands by June 1st.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Gamma Turquoise Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Volume II is finally starting!", "update_content": "Yes, after an awful long wait...

Do you like the idea of mixing things up by confronting your players with villains none will expect? Is a fun and challenging encounter something your gaming friends will appreciate? Would you like to glean game-mastering knowledge from someone who has been running super-powered battles for decades?\nAh, I see you answered, \"YES PLEASE!\" Well then, you are ready for Heroic Havoc\u2122 #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You!\u2122\nThe circus has come to town, but it's not the kind anyone should attend! A troop of super-powered villains have been hired to put on a show as a cover to test a powerful new crowd-control agent. Unfortunately, the citizens of your fair city are the guineas pigs. Maybe they'll literally become guineas pigs -- you never know with foes like these!\nThe questions is, will this instant circus get you too?!\nHeroic Havoc #1: Instant Circus Is Going to Get You! is a scenario for 4-6 novice super-powered heroes. This 12-16 page module will include write-ups of the villains (with illustrations), maps of the encounter areas, introductory material to assist in getting the heroes to the site of the circus, and suggestions for follow-up adventures. There will even be a section explaining the motivations of the villains! (Hey, you may want some of them to show-up again to annoy and confound your players!)\nThe module will be written for D20 Hero system (the Open Game License version of Mutants and Masterminds) but can be easily adapted for ICON, FATE\u2122 or other game systems.\nThe number of pages in the module will increase as various stretch goals are achieved!\nThey are here to entertain -- mainly themselves!!\nThe heroes opponents include:\nMaster of Ceremonies - the charismatic and literal ringmaster of the group. He has light control powers with some technological augmentation.\nIvan the Strongman - a super-strong and resilient bruiser who like to wield a barbell as a weapon.\nThe Flying Winona - graceful and acrobatic, she is a experienced unarmed combatant with wind powers. Her trapeze act is partially a cheat as she can really fly!\nCalamity Clown - the leader of the clown henchmen. He is a devotee of chaos gods who, he says, have granted him powers both funny and fundamentally annoying.\nJorge - a former human cannonball, he now has the ability to being unnoticed. Which can be more dangerous then you might think!\nHello, all! My name is Joe Pearce, and I am a professional computer game designer and programmer. Although that is important information, it is not as critical as knowing that I have been creating and game-mastering original RPG adventures since the '80s!\nAlthough it is great to have friends who enjoy my games, once a scenario is run, that is the last that anyone sees of it-- until now. Via the power of Kickstarter, I can spread the fun to every GM and player who wants to get in on the action.

The Folio\u2019s goal is to insure that, and always give folks the very best quality \u2018lean and mean\u2019 adventures we can.\nSo my hope is this, that you will all share this project with others and help us create a continuing line that can be easily played and remembered fondly just like the modules of old.\nOld School 'wrap' removable cover design to double as DM Screen!\nMy Project: The Folio will be a bi-monthly [every two months] adventure module subscription that will hit on all genres of gaming using 5th Edition mechanics and expanding on them as we move from genre to genre.It will be produced as an 8x11\u201d, removable cover [11x17\" once removed], module with mostly b/w interior artwork and typically come in around thirty pages in length.\nWho\u2019s it for? ALL gamers, both new gamers and old gamers as it is easily expandable or playable as is.The concept is to allow gamers a starting point for adventure that can be modified to their liking while providing excellent reference content and frameworks.The base mechanic will be for 5th Edition, but I\u2019ve designed it to be readily modified to any fantasy game.\nWhat\u2019s in it? All original content.It has been written by Scott Taylor and Mark Timm, with incredible cover art from old school masters and interior artwork by skilled black and white illustrators Travis Hanson and Michael Wilson, and even a bit of Jim Holloway because I can never get enough Holloway.We are intent on providing what we refer to as neo-retro, a polished and modern design with creatively nostalgic content that transcends a particular age.All modules in The Folio series will contain 3-D maps, a Gazetteer, a monster section, a new monster unique to the setting, DM\u2019s notes and guides, and a full adventure.  And don't forget, for all you AotG readers out there, each Folio will come with an illustrated short story in PDF form to continue our tradition of fleshing out the Nameless Realm's world!\nIncredible interior artwork that comes in two stand alone booklets!\nWhy? Because I\u2019ve played and written about these games for more than thirty years at companies like TSR, Wizards of the Coast, White Wolf, and Privateer Press. After so many licensed projects, I feel it is time I put out something that is unique to my own creativity under my Art of the Genre brand. The corporate mentality and \u2018the man\u2019 often modify inspirations so fundamentally that the finished product is never what the author originally dreamed.In this case, The Folio is exactly the product I\u2019ve been looking to release for years.\nWhen? The initial module is complete, we only need to be funding so we can begin the full printing process.  This means that PDFs of the the first Folio will go out after the campaign wraps, and the physical copies should be to you no later than December! Also, concerning the later modules, we've already begun work on them, as you can see from the various previews of already secured cover artwork.\nI can\u2019t do this without you: Art of the Genre needs your help, that is why we are here.$15,000 is our goal.This covers the printing, shipping, design, writing, mapping, and the incredible story telling artwork we\u2019ll be using in these adventures.We have already devoted countless hours to seeing this product come together, but to make it \u2018real\u2019 and available to all players, we need your help.We believe in this dream, and we hope you do too!\nWhat happens if we pass the goal? If we pass the goal, it will allow us to begin production of the next adventure in the series, and our hope is to find enough support along the way to complete the entire six part campaign.Bottom line, our goal is to make a truly fantastic and age-defying piece of gaming history, each penny we receive goes toward that.This \u2018put everything into the product\u2019 mentality is why this Kickstarter is so think on \u2018rewards\u2019, as SWAG steals from everyone, the project, the product, and the backers.I firmly believe that backers want great product, not coins, bookmarks, post cards, prints, or T-shirts, and so this Kickstarter campaign is designed to put everything into The Folio to make sure everyone gets a product they will never forget and be proud to own.\nFull Campaign Modules featuring artwork by Daniel Horne, Jim Holloway, Jeff Laubenstein, Jeff Dee, and David Martin!\nCan this be easily played without using the 5th Edition mechanic? Yes, I\u2019ve gone to great lengths to set the story, the pacing, and the place, but I\u2019ve also separated the monsters into a bestiary so that ANY system \u2018monster book\u2019 may be employed with the proper use of monsters supplements to that system.The only other in depth change needed would be the dungeon master\u2019s understanding of the mechanics of invisibility, stealth, and traps.\n3-D mapping as well as standard hex maps!\nBacker Levels\nStretch Goals!\n*Trademark Disclaimer\n\"Dungeons & Dragons\" and \"3E\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

The best parts of a bad decade.\nSpirit of 77 is an over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal, nitro-burning, action adventure role playing game about an alternate history 1977. Richard Nixon has made a deal with aliens, and is still in the White House; renegade rock gods from another galaxy have shared with us the power of Glam; kung-fu bad-asses wander the city streets righting wrongs, and everyone is trying to stick it to The Man.\nSpirit of 77 is about recreating all the classic action and adventure TV shows, movies, and comic books of the 1970's. It draws inspiration from movies like Shaft, Smokey and the Bandit, The Warriors, Barbarella, Rocky, and Enter the Dragon; TV shows like The Dukes of Hazzard, The Six Million Dollar Man, The Rockford Files, and Charlie's Angels; and music like James Brown, KISS, David Bowie, Jerry Reed, and Isaac Hayes. \nPowered by the Apocalypse\nSpirit of 77 uses the Apocalypse World engine created by D. Vincent Baker, like a classic hot-rod we've made a number of modifications to amp up the horsepower. The basic mechanics consist of rolling two six sided dice adding a modifier and then narrating the success or failure.\nEasy to pick up for novice role players, and with plenty of options for the experienced, the rules of Spirit of 77 are geared towards encouraging over-the-top, pedal-to-the-metal action. You know the type: leaping cars, swinging from rooftops, blowing up tanker trucks, and punching bigfoot right in his hairy face.\nLook at him, he's totally asking for it.\nStory, Role, and Buzz\nCharacters in Spirit of 77 are made up of three basic components: Story, Role, and Buzz.\nYour Story describes where you're from. It's the source of your abilities. Stories can include things like being a War Vet, a Former Badge, or having a touch of the Glam.\nYour Role describes what you do. It covers how you interact with the world around you. Roles include things like hard hitting Tough Guys, funky Rockers, and fast driving Good Old Boys. \nYour Buzz describes your motivation. It's why you're out fighting the good fight. Buzz includes things like seeking Vengeance, looking for Love, or just being out for the Thrills\nThis system lets you describe nearly every classic character from 70's cinema and TV, such as:\nBilly Jack is a Tough Guy and Former Vet, looking for Peace of Mind.\nFoxy Brown is a Vigilante who's One Bad Mother, looking for Payback.\nThe Baseball Furies are Boppers with Glam, looking for Respect.\nJim Rockford is a Sleuth who's an Ex-Con, looking for Cold, Hard Cash.\nThe Bandit is a Good Old Boy with Humble Beginnings, looking for Fame and Glory.\nMock ups of the Core Book and the Expansion - Subject to change.\nThe Core Book and the Expansion\nThis Kickstarter is to fund the printing of our core rulebook and first expansion.\nThe Core book will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, 250-300 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Core book will cover everything you need to play the game, rules, character creation, and setting information. Post Kickstarter the core book will retail for $30.\nThe Expansion (final name to be determined) will be a digest sized (6in x 9in) softcover, approximately 120 pages, with full color cover and black and white interiors.  The Expansion will include additional character stories, character roles, custom moves, and three complete adventures. Post Kickstarter the expansion book will retail for $20.\nStill not convinced?

Fortunately, between us, we've got a lot of experience delivering professional projects, and we've got a lot of friends who have experience with successful Kickstarters who've offered their help and advice. We've left ourselves reasonable margins of error in our budget, and have planned out every detail possible.\n\nCompletion - The writing for the core book is finished and ready to go to our editor. The expansion book is currently being written. Additional stretch goals will require additional writing. We're confident that we'll be able to complete all of these by our shipping date.\n\nShipping - Shipping prices have skyrocketed in the last few years. While we have a good idea as to how much it'll cost in the near future, there's always a chance that things will change drastically. To account for any unforeseen price changes, we have intentionally over-estimated our shipping costs.\n\nCommunication - We realize that post-funding communication to our backers is very important. We will be committing to providing bi-monthly updates both here on Kickstarter and through our social media presence (Facebook, Twitter).\n\nEvents Outside Our Control - Monkeyfun is a two-man operation. If one of us gets hit by a bus, the other will be able to carry on and complete the project (after seeking street vengeance against the bus). If both of us get hit by a bus, things might be in trouble, and this is why we only ever meet in secret locations at unannounced times under heavy guard.

This particular Kickstarter project is not the current funding drive for the game. Please visit the funding status page for up-to-date information!\nInherit the Earth\u2122 is a point-and-click adventure game and webcomic series set on a future Earth where humans have mysteriously disappeared and the dominate inhabitants are tribes of anthropomorphic animals or Morph, as they call themselves.\nThe primary hero of Inherit the Earth is Rif, a young Fox, who is a quick-witted, puzzle solver. Such skills come in handy as Rif tends to be thrust into dangerous missions involving righting wrongs and saving his friends.\nThe project being funded by this Kickstarter is Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows, a video game sequel to the original Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb. The game will be available for Windows, Mac, and other platforms.\nLike the original game, the sequel's story can be enjoyed by adults, teens and pre-teens. It will be an enchanting and thrilling adventure for all to enjoy, with subtleties and hidden depths that can be appreciated by older players.\nWhat's an Adventure Game? An adventure game is best described as a story-based puzzle-solving entertainment experience. The game\u2019s protagonist attempts to complete a series of goals by talking with characters encountered in different locations and using the clues learned to resolve problems blocking the path to success. In many situations this involves collecting items to trade or use.\nWhat about Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb? In the first game Rif the Fox is accused of stealing an ancient human relic, but is able to convince the authorities that he has the skills to find the actual thief of the Orb of Storms. Two guards are assigned to accompany Rif on his quest to ensure it is completed. There is the added incentive of rescuing his friend Rhene who is being held hostage by the Boar Tribe. Rif is eventually able to prove his innocence, but at the apparent loss of the Orb.\nA free trial version of the first game is available for desktop platforms. You can view a video of the game's intro below:\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows takes place after both the original game and the webcomic story Little Wolf Lost. The Morph Tribes of the Known Lands continue their efforts to live with the loss of the Orb, which they used to predict the weather. There are rumors of the artifact\u2019s survival, but none are credible. Even Rif, who feels some regret in not being able to retrieve the Orb, discounts these rumors. The arrival of a chieftess\u2019 daughter, with a startling revelation, leads to Rif embarking on a new adventure to learn the truth \u2013 assuming he can avoid the doubts of friends, threats of foes, and the ravages of a great drought.\nYou can view a video of some scenes from the game prototype below.\nPLAY\n\nAs the developers on Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows know, funding an adventure game through the usual channels is extremely difficult at this time. Adventure games are not the type of game most big companies are looking to publish or even know how to market.\nThere is an alternate in the 21st Century: crowd-funding through Kickstarter gives a game like ours a chance to find its own players and supporters. Honestly, we would prefer this method of funding as it allows us the freedom to create the game we believe our segment of the gaming world is seeking.\nHelp us make this game a reality!\nAnd now what many of you have been waiting to know the answer to: \"What do I receive as a backer of this funding drive?\" The rewards you can receive are listed below and include such goodies as a copy of the game, a book of artwork, credit for your sponsorship, your avatar appearing in-game, and even a trip to the launch party.\nSome reward artwork may be preliminary or placeholders for final art.\nInherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows is being developed by The Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. and produced by a team of experienced professionals, including excellent artists, writers, voice actors, audio techs and programmers. Many of these individuals were involved in the creation of the original game. Key developers include:\nJoe Pearce - Designer, programmer, and company owner. Joe has been a professional game developer for 28 years with over 20 game and application titles to his credit. He was one the original designers of Inherit the Earth: Quest for the Orb and the primary force in making the sequel possible by acquiring the rights to the original game.\nEd Lacabanne - Artist. Ed was one of the background artists for the original game. He has worked on a dozen other projects including titles based on Star Wars, Dungeons and Dragons, and Fallout.\nJulie Butler- Artist. Julie Butler has been the illustrator for the Inherit the Earth webcomic for the last couple of years.\nAllison Hershey - Additional design. Allison, a designer and art director for the original game, has provided assistance in the design for the new game. She was also the first illustrator for the webcomic.\nWe expect development will take approximately nine months from the date the project is successfully funded. The game will be released in English plus other languages based on Stretch Goals met (see below).\nDifferent tribes of the Morph\nYou can stay in touch with the folks involved in this project through the following:\nOfficial Inherit the Earth: Sand and Shadows website\nThe Wyrmkeep Entertainment Co. website\nOfficial Wyrmkeep Entertainment Twitter\nOfficial Inherit the Earth Facebook group\nInherit the Earth webcomic site\nInherit the Earth webcomic tumblr\nI hope you are ready to join us in the process of making a great sequel to a classic game.

WE DIDN'T REACH OUR GOAL, BUT IF YOU'RE STILL INTERESTED IN SEEING THIS FILM GET MADE, AND IF YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE IT, GO TO http://cassavafilms.com/contact AND LET'S TALK!\nThis funny, fast-paced 2-minute animated pitch will give you a taste of this (live action) film's dark humor, and it lays out the first half of the story as well:\nWHAT IS THIS MOVIE?\nIt's a feature-length thriller - with black comedy and horror elements - about a smart young woman named Robin who accepts an under-the-table temporary position at a tech company in suburban California. She has just days to find out that the charming man who runs the company likes to hunt down and murder his temps - and that she's the next target on his list.\n\"Office Space meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" is not a bad jumping-off point for describing this film.\nWHY DOES IT NEED TO BE MADE?\nBecause I love suspense. I love the tension in shows like Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Hannibal, and yet I don't find this tension in many feature films today. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT will be one of those rare films.\nThere also aren't enough thrillers out there with truly interesting characters - especially female characters - and I want this to be one of those too.\nBut mostly I just want to glue you to the edge of your seat for an hour and a half. When you watch this movie, I want you to be able to say, \"Well, that was awesome.\"\nDIAL 9 TO GET OUT is funny, scary, smart, unpredictable, a little thought-provoking, and definitely popcorn-friendly. I want it to do for working late at the office what Jaws did for going to the beach.\nSO IS THIS OR IS THIS NOT A HORROR FLICK?\nOkay, yes, there's a maniac in a mask who goes around stabbing people. But it's about the tension, not the gore, so DIAL 9 TO GET OUT is more for the Breaking Bad crowd than for the You're Next crowd (though I hope the You're Next crowd likes it too). The emphasis is on a tight story, crisp dialogue, and rich suspense.\nIf I do sell this movie to a distributor, they might market it as horror, which is what happened when Lionsgate released my second feature Claustrophobia (which they retitled \"Serial Slayer\" for the English language market).\nBut between you and me and the blood-spattered water cooler, this is a thriller.\nStory is everything, and DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a great one. Now that we're at the end of the campaign, I've posted pages 1-67 of the full 105 page screenplay for all to read. You can read it here.\nIf you want to know how the movie ends, you'll have to get it funded!\nFrom left: Mark, Meta, Scott, Christopher, William\nMARK TAPIO KINES, Writer/Director. I've made two feature films. Foreign Correspondents (1999) was the first movie to be crowdfunded online. It starred Melanie Lynskey (Heavenly Creatures, Up in the Air), Wil Wheaton (Big Bang Theory, Star Trek: TNG), Corin Nemec (Stargate SG-1, Parker Lewis Can't Lose), Lisa LoCicero (General Hospital), and other fine folks. Claustrophobia (2003) also starred Ms. Lynskey, as well as Mary Lynn Rajskub (24), Sheeri Rappaport (NYPD Blue), and Judy O'Dea (the original Night of the Living Dead). I've also made a number of short films, I authored a screenwriting course on Lynda.com, and I sometimes write for Indiewire. More about me here.\nMETA VALENTIC, Producer. Meta has produced a number of independent features, including Sundance favorite Urbania, Hunting of Man, Ladr\u00f3n que roba a ladr\u00f3n, and several shorts. In her TV life, she's worked on hit shows such as Castle (we shot my talking head in the DIAL 9 intro video on the Castle set), Bones, and Lost.\nSCOTT SPEARS, Director of Photography. Scott's got more than 45 credits as DP and cameraman. Among his accomplishments: winning an Emmy for the short film The Birthmark and shooting Richard Hatch's 1999 Battlestar Galactica trailer, which revived interest in the show and led to the reboot. Scott was the DP for Foreign Correspondents and I'm happy to work with him again. He shot the creepy office building footage in the DIAL 9 intro video.\nCHRISTOPHER FARRELL, Composer. The extremely gifted Mr. Farrell wrote the scores for my first two features Foreign Correspondents and Claustrophobia (as well as several of my shorts, including A Trophy). He's also scored a ton of genre pictures with great titles such as Dead Scared, Nightmare Man, and House of the Witchdoctor. That's his music you hear in the intro video.\nWILLIAM LEBEDA, Titles Designer/Visual Effects Supervisor. William did the amazing title work on the intro video as well as my first two features. As Creative Director of Picture Mill, William has designed the title sequences for a slew of major Hollywood releases, most famously for David Fincher's Panic Room, but also for Sam Raimi's Drag Me to Hell, Jason Bateman's Bad Words, War of the Worlds, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Signs, Anchorman, and many others.\nWHAT ABOUT THE CAST? ANY CELEBRITIES?\nWe're casting this movie the old-fashioned way: by holding auditions and hiring the very best actor for each role.\nBack when Meta and I were trying to raise a million bucks from Hollywood types, they kept saying, \"You need to cast bankable names so we can sell the picture to foreign territories.\" Yes, even if an actor is not right for the part or is impossible to work with. And of course, said actor's salary would eat up half the budget. A gloomy proposition.\nOne of the great things about crowdfunding this film is that there's no pressure to be \"bankable\". We can cast who we want. So if a complete unknown is better for a particular part than someone who was on a semi-popular TV show 15 years ago, we're going to cast that unknown.\n\nThat said, we're not dumb. If Jennifer Lawrence wants to star in this movie, she's gonna star in this movie. And in fact I have a good track record with casting well-known actors: I got Wil Wheaton and Mary Lynn Rajskub to star in my first two features, with little money and no industry connections. DIAL 9 will be a SAG-AFTRA signatory production, allowing us access to the best talent, so I will do everything in my power to land some recognizable actors.\nMARK, ARE YOU REALLY THE FIRST PERSON TO EVER CROWDFUND A MOVIE?\nYes! I earned this claim to fame in 1998, when I raised $150,000 in finishing funds for Foreign Correspondents through my website for it. (Warning: ancient site.)\n1999 newspaper articles, from left: The Boston Globe, The Chicago Tribune, The San Jose Mercury\nAnd here's an interview I did for a PBS show called \"Net Cafe\" in the summer of 1999. Dig that long hair! Ah, the '90s.\nIf you need further proof, you can read scans of all the newspaper articles on this page. Or check out the 1999 Chicago Tribune article, which is still online in digital format.\nHOW DOES THAT $120,000 GET SPENT?\nWe're all about transparency here at the DIAL 9 Kickstarter page. So here are preliminary figures, based on a 12-day shooting schedule, with 3-4 weeks of pre-production and 2-3 months of post-production.\n$12,000 goes back to Kickstarter and Amazon for their commissions.\n$8,000 goes back to YOU - in the form of all those DVDs, Blu-rays, T-shirts, flash drives, shipping, etc.\n$5,000 for pre-production (office space for auditions and meetings, salaries for casting director, production staff, etc.).\n$30,000 for production crew salaries (based on 20 full-time crew members).\n$8,000 for cast salaries (based on the SAG-AFTRA Ultra-Low Budget rate of $100 a day per actor, plus agency commissions and SAG-AFTRA pension & health fees).\n$3,000 for 2 weeks digital camera package rental.\n$20,000 for lighting/grip/electric rentals, costumes, props, and set dressing.\n$3,000 for production insurance (required).\n$10,000 for main location rental (suburban office building) for 10 shooting days. The other 2 shooting days will be at (hopefully free) private homes.\n$7,000 for meals and craft services.\n$10,000 for post-production (editing, sound editing, music composition, titles).\n$4,000 for final sound mix and digital mastering.\nIf we can score any deals and use some of that money for higher production values, we will. (Anybody got an office building that we can shoot in?)\nHere's a trailer for my newest short A Trophy. Everybody who backs the DIAL 9 campaign at $9 or more gets to see this short in its entirety. While I am exceedingly proud of this dark little film, its visual style is completely different from DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.\nBelow are the two different T-shirt designs that you can choose from. After the end of the campaign, we will contact you about your preference and size.\n THIS COULD BE YOU:\nI am modeling both shirts. These are mockups; nothing's been printed yet.\nIf enough people ask nicely at the end of the campaign, we will also print style #2 (the shirt on the right) as a white graphic on a black T-shirt.\nAside from making movies, I'm also the author and host of Screenwriting Fundamentals, a tutorial on Lynda.com. Here's a sample:\nI've gotten a lot of requests from people who want me to critique their screenplays. I have always told them no. But for 10 screenwriters who back DIAL 9 TO GET OUT at the $450 level, I will say yes! This won't be just a perfunctory glance, either. I will really spend time with your script, pointing out what works and suggesting fixes for what doesn't.\nThese make great holiday cards, \"save the date\" announcements, direct mailers for your business, etc. You send me the background artwork, and I'll do the magic. I spend hours making these things, so it's worth your pledge.\nHere are two examples, using graphics from the DIAL 9 Kickstarter campaign. (They're heavily Photoshopped: the hallways were in Columbus, Ohio, and I was in my bathroom in L.A.!) Your cards don't need to be this creepy. Unless you want them to be.\n(Please note: I may ham it up in these photos, but I am NOT an actor, and I will NOT be starring in DIAL 9 TO GET OUT.)\nA lot of filmmakers offer speaking parts as a reward, but isn't it weird that they won't tell you up front what you're going to say? If you're going to cough up $1,100, you should know what you're in for.\nBelow are the lines for \"GARY\" (the male character) and \"MELISSA\" (the female character). They're not Shakespearean monologues. But you will come off well, and the audience will enjoy your little moment. I promise.\nYes, Melissa has a little more dialogue than Gary. But whoever plays Gary gets to work with the movie's leading lady, which will make up for it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is where I have to say that there are plenty of things that could derail this production. An earthquake could hit us in the middle of the shoot, or our leading lady could run off with the Hare Krishnas.\n\nBut I have already written and directed two independent features. Each production had its share of challenges (my favorite might be the Claustrophobia production sound recordist having to get his wisdom teeth removed on the first day of the shoot), but there was nothing that couldn't be overcome. In the end, I finished both films and I sold them. The fact that I'm coming back for a third feature tells you how committed I am to making movies. It's hard work, but I finish every film I start.\n\nForeign Correspondents was shot on 35mm, filmed all over California, and cost $500,000 to make. Claustrophobia was shot on SD consumer video, mostly in one house, and cost $60,000 to make. DIAL 9 TO GET OUT has a budget, scope, and shooting schedule right in between those two. We do have some particular challenges: There will be tricky stuntwork. There will be messy practical effects (blood). We're going to have to make every penny of our budget count. But with a solid cast and crew - and lots and lots and lots of planning - I know we can handle it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Mark Tapio Kines\nFirst created \u00b7 27 backed\nI'm the first person to ever crowdfund a film.

By using a sophisticated parts system and web UI, we're bringing the flexibility, ease, and control of a robust video game character creator to the tabletop. \nAs we add new parts, the number of potential combinations will grow exponentially! We can't wait to see what people create!\nChoose your race, your gender, your build, and your facial expression. Select and swap individual armor pieces, weapons, adventuring equipment, hairstyles, and faces. Choose your pose and watch all of the dynamically rigged parts and attributes conform to fit your selection. Choose the scale of your mini, and even the material it's printed in. We're bringing a high-tech update to a classic analog hobby and giving you the opportunity to breathe your vision and creativity into your miniature.\nYour equipment selections are dynamically rigged to conform to your choice in pose and character. These three 30mm scale minis have the same equipment but are in different poses. Click for video!\nAnd a close-up. 3D printing allows us to capture incredibly fine detail, even at 30mm scale, like the engraving on the chest piece.\nWhether you want to create stranger fare (good luck finding a dual-wielding halfling barbarian mini), capture key details (no one should be forced to make compromises on their dwarf\u2019s beard style), or simply have more say in your mini than just the paint job, Hero Forge is for you! \nWe've built a team uniquely qualified to bring this project to life. We invite you to get to know us:\nThere are many advantages to using 3D printing and digital models over the more traditional injection mold and sculpting techniques. Printing from digital models means we can easily scale our models up or down. Want 6 inch display versions of your party to immortalize their heroic deeds? Can do. Playing a niche tabletop game that uses a larger or smaller scale? No problem. And that's not all: our character builder will let you save high resolution screenshots of your model for your character sheet and overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. You can even save your mini and edit it later so it can grow and change as your character does!\nPrint on demand means you're not limited to what big companies think have the broadest appeal, and we don't have to exclude poses, equipment, or designs simply because they can't be made with injection molds. This means more freedom for you. Interior or recessed detail, which is notoriously difficult for injection molds, is easy with 3D printing. We can also offers certain novel options like printing segmented chains or swinging lanterns with articulated parts, no assembly required.\nSomething as simple as a mini with swords crossed in front of him would be impossible with injection molds.\nWe believe that this is the next step in miniatures and a fantastic application of new, exciting technologies. We'd love to be another example that tabletop gaming is alive, well, and just getting started!\n3D printed plastics are easy to paint, too! Here are a few minis we designed, 3D printed, and painted ourselves. Click for video!\n                                                                                               We've come as far as we can on our own, but it is your support that will allow us to see this project through. Backing will go towards turning our concept art into one of the coolest, most diverse digital armories on the internet, and further developing/polishing our web UI to provide the smoothest experience possible. We can't wait to start our next campaign where every player is using a custom, bespoke mini that they designed themselves. We invite you to help make that happen!\nWe need the funding and support of backers to help us turn our library of concept art into a library of fully rigged, 3D parts. Backer's funding will also go towards developing our web UI so we can give you unparalleled flexibility and control while building your character. With a wide range of 3D parts and a perfected web app, users will have the tools to build truly unique, distinctive, interesting minis.\nAdditionally, Kickstarter offers the ability to go beyond basic funding, to reach exciting stretch goals so we can implement some of our big plans even earlier! In short, the more funding we receive, the more we can offer at launch!\nBeyond giving us the ability to fully fund this project, Kickstarter lets us connect with you. Many of our limited reward tiers offer you the opportunity to make your voice heard, working with our artists and modelers to make armor, weapons, items, and poses YOU want to see included. We wanted to give the community a voice in our product\u2019s creation, and Kickstarter seemed like the perfect way to do that.\nOur concept artists have earned their stripes in the tabletop and video game industries, and they know what makes a character truly exciting. We can't wait to see what they come up with next! Here are some of the designs they've turned out already.\nBy breaking all of our armor down into multiple parts we can generate an incredible amount of variety. Even with the limited pool of parts and poses we have now, our in-depth parts system can generate millions of variations, each with subtle differences. But that isn't enough for us.\nWe want enough variety that one could randomize our parts for years and still never arrive at the same mini! To that end, we are focusing on designing armor sets that have distinctive motifs, themes, and profiles, that will really come to life when you log in and combine the parts in exciting ways to create a truly unique look, distinctive to your character.\nArmor pieces will automatically fit your race, gender, and pose!\nWe've highlighted the customizability of our armor, but we aren't neglecting weapons and adventuring equipment either. Not only do we want everyone to be able select exactly the weapons they have listed on their character sheet, but to also be able to choose from multiple motifs, looks, and styles. When your character upgrades from a regular long sword to a masterfully crafted +3 long sword we want you to be able to have that reflected in your miniature. Hero Forge will make that a simple proposition.\nWith our initial funding goal, we'll be starting with fantasy-themed figures with an eye on expanding. Sci-fi, steampunk, cyberpunk, Victorian era, historical military outfits and weaponry, pulp, western, superheroes--the possibilities are endless, and some may even be revealed as stretch goals. Our in-depth parts system makes mixing and matching genres easy! As new parts are released you will be able to add a robotic arm to your knight, or give your cowboy a samurai sword. \nAfter setting aside the manufacturing costs of our physical rewards, the majority of the funding will go towards building 3D models and finishing the development of our web UI. When we reach base funding, we plan to have five races available at launch: Human, Elf, Dwarf, Halfling, and Half-Orc, and we will expand over time! With a successful funding campaign from Kickstarter we aim to have our full-featured mini-builder off the ground this year with new batches of parts hot on the heels of release.\nOur initial five fantasy races, with more coming as our first stretch goal!\nIf we exceed our base funding goal, we will have more resources to produce more parts and features faster. For example, here are a couple features we hope to add. You can help us add them sooner by helping us meet our stretch goals!\nWe've got many other big things in mind, including more genres, nudity options, color, wings/horns/tails, multi-figure poses, and more!\nMeet our All-Star team:\nBuilding the right team takes careful planning, an eye for talent, and a guiding passion. Joshua Bennett is that jack-of-all-trades. Having worked as a freelance artist, writer, editor, and project coordinator from L.A. to Hong Kong, he has been embedded in the tabletop RPG community for years. His work has appeared in Wayfinder Magazine, on paizo.com, and in dozens of online shops and indie RPG releases.\nCreating a character customizing UI is a complex endeavor. There are website limitations to work within, quality and quantity of art to consider, not to mention making sure that all parts are compatible with each other. As Technical Art Director for the video game studio Naughty Dog, Teagan Morrison has been dealing with digital resource management and character customizers for critically acclaimed games like the Uncharted series for years.\nThe fantasy genre is rich with traditions, tropes, and distinctive styles. Freelance artist Nicole Cardiff lives and breathes fantasy art and provides an insider\u2019s understanding of what people want when it comes to their fantastic heroes. Her work has appeared in Dungeons and Dragons 4th edition materials and the reboot of Tomb of Horrors, in Warhammer, Call of Cthulhu, and Game of Thrones cards for Fantasy Flight Games, and on the covers of fantasy novels.\nCreating designs that are iconic and integrate well into a parts system is no easy task, but expert concept artist Molly Maloney is uniquely suited for it. Currently working as a concept artist for Telltale Games, Molly is skilled at creating gorgeous concept art with an eye on its future digitalization.\nModeling characters for miniature, 3D printing, and a parts system requires a number of considerations that would make some 3D artists balk. With a masterful understanding of proportion, and a keen understanding of the medium, Margaret Dost is the perfect artist for the job. An expert 3D modeler who has worked on everything from blockbuster films like Pacific Rim, videogames like Mortal Kombat vs. DC, commercials, and cinematics, Margaret has the skills to guide our transition from concept art to 3D models.\nWith Hero Forge, customization is king. This is built on a complex and in-depth part system which requires extremely clever, dynamic rigging, and a balance between creativity, efficiency, and a keen artistic eye. Beverly Sage excels at all of these things and has earned her stripes working as a freelance rigger and technical artist in the videogame industry on games like The Last of Us. She currently works for Nickelodeon Animation Studios as a technical character artist.\nMaking a part system that just works, plug-in free, in your web browser involves a lot of pipeline challenges, as does getting a customized 3D model into a data format that can then be 3D printed. David Lenna has been dealing with pipeline as South Park studio's Chief Technical Officer for years and is uniquely equipped to make the right decisions.\nAll that to say: We have an amazing team with passion, big ideas, and the technical chops and experience to back it up. We can't wait to make Hero Forge a reality!\nThere are technologies available now that would have made this project impossible even a year ago, and further improvements in this already groundbreaking tech are right around the corner.\n3D printing\nWhile injection mold minis are not likely to see any revolutions in their production process any time soon, 3D printing is evolving at a blistering pace. While current printing technology allows us to capture detail comparable to current minis, our character and object models are sculpted at remarkably high detail, so you can look forward to fidelity improving as printing technology does!\nWe've chosen to use Shapeways for our 3D printing needs. They recently released a developer API which allows small businesses, independent sculptors, and start-ups like us to take advantage of the latest in commercial 3D printing technology. By using the Shapeways developer API, we can evolve and grow as new materials and printing options are added.  As new features like color printing or improved materials are released, upgrading will be easy. This frees us to focus on what we're really excited about: making high-quality models. We're happy to have manufacturing handled by one of the leading names in the 3D printing industry.\nAt the moment, there are two main materials that we are interested in releasing at launch. The first is an 'ultra-detail plastic' material which is slightly translucent (before priming), highly detailed, and is fantastic for painting--very suitable as a high quality display piece. The majority of the miniatures we show here are printed in this material. The second is a lower cost, albeit lower detail material which is very durable and flexible. This 'strong plastic' It is opaque white, and has a rougher finish that makes it less suitable for painting. As in all other aspects of Hero Forge, We wanted to offer users as many choices as possible, so a cheaper, but still entirely customizable option just made sense. Note that the \"patron\" and \"novice party\" tiers are both available only in the latter 'strong plastic' material. Keep in mind that, by the time we launch, there may be exciting new material options available!\nWebGL\nWebGL, the new web standard for 3D, allows video game-quality graphics right in your web browser. This has allowed us to build an interactive 3D interface that lets you easily and quickly design miniatures without downloading plugins. See beautiful, interactive models as you design, pose, and build them. Gone are the days of browsing low-rez photo galleries or rooting through poorly stocked shelves. You'll be able to see your mini in crisp 3D long before it arrives in your hands. \nWebGL also allows us to add fun, free features that we believe people will enjoy: whether you're buying our minis or not, you will be able to export high resolution screenshots of your unique character. Use it for your character sheet, as a keepsake, or for a 'wanted sign' player handout. Export an overhead views for your favorite virtual tabletop program. Save a character to edit later, or get a head start designing your next one. Here is a video highlighting some of the features that we will be including!\nWe believe our WebGL character builder will be a fun and amazingly useful tool. We just can't stop thinking of new uses for this technology, and we're sure you'll have some great ideas too! \nPledge tiers $20 and up may add individual miniatures and statuettes to their order!\nClick for instructions!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n---While we want to offer as many options as possible, we also want to ensure that we have the absolute best base product we can before sticking baseball cards in the spokes and painting flames on it. Some of the more ambitious customization options may have to be prioritized or wait for things like print technology to catch up.\n\n----3D printing tech is rapidly improving, but just as the injection mold production process has its challenges and problems (flash or mold lines, limited shapes, etc.) so does 3D printing. Current print technology still has some disadvantages that it is working to address. For example, the strong material is not especially detailed, and the detailed material is not very strong. Another example: we've pointed out that the sandpapery texture of the 'strong plastic' material is not especially suitable for painting (paint sticks just fine, it just is harder to layer on). And the ultra-detail plastic is not as durable as most plastic miniatures. Much like a resin model or miniature, if you drop one from high up, it very well may break.\n\n---The ultra detail material can also come with some visual artifacts in the plastic's consistency. This is different than the \"stair-stepping\" effect of earlier 3D printing. In most cases it is a primarily a visual quirk rather than a physical one--and will be undetectable once a figure is sprayed with primer.\n\nOf course, these are challenges that are actively being researched and addressed. We are especially excited about new material offerings that are stronger, more detailed, and even allow for fine color application. These are advances we hope, and expect, to see in the very near future.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Your Alpha Access to Color Tools and \u201cSuper Backer\u201d Rewards", "update_content": "Hello again, Hero Forge Fans!

Experience 30 years of gaming evolution, from the early pong days to the modern games of today. Attend midnight game launches or test your skills in competitive in-game tournaments. Read in-game magazines for tips, tricks and reviews, or for the latest rumors about the new Gametron 9000 XZ.\n\nMy childhood consisted of a pure diet of EGM, Nintendo Power and every video game I could get my hands on. Weekends meant all night gaming marathons with friends and swapping NES games with kids on your street was part of daily life. You never had to worry about DRM, constant online connections or bricking your console with a firmware update. Things were wonderfully simple. It was a time when a new console generation meant taking a giant leap into the future of gaming. You never could have mistaken an SNES/Genesis game for an NES title, even if your parents thought it all looked the same. We didn't have E3, we had CES and gaming publications would trickle out screen shots from the event for months. Release dates were ambiguous at best, which meant you had to call your local store every single day throughout the summer to see if Zelda II was available (sorry store guy). This was growing up with video games in the 80's and this is where Retro World comes from.\n\nRetro World will be available on Windows,Mac and Linux platforms.\n You've just moved to a new town where the video game craze has taken the town folks by storm. Unfortunately this newly favored past time comes with more than the people of Frankton had bargained for. Extended periods of play have resulted in strange phenomenon from disappearing children to sightings of spooky creatures. It's up to you and your newly found friends to get to the bottom of this bizarre mystery.\nA few of the characters you'll meet.\n You basically play the part of a young boy who's just moved to a new town where video games have just starter to become a popular past time. You eventually realize that some of these games are not what they seem. Some games will actually leak some of their characters and themes into the real world or even absorb some of your friends right into the TV. It's up to you to use your knowledge acquired from the retro game play and gaming magazines to solve their problems and push the game worlds back where they belong. The main overarching goal is solving why these games are coming to life.\nThe game segments can be broken down into four phases:\n1) The Hype - In anticipation of a release the town folks will talk about the upcoming titles expressing their likes or dislikes. You'll see prominent billboards advertising each game using various colorful marketing strategies as well as special features in magazines. After properly researching your game you'll make your choice determining how much cash you'll need to earn. \n2) Earning some cash - Games don't come cheap. It's up to you to gather enough money before the game's release. For this you'll do all sorts of chores for your parents, neighbors and even strangers you meet. Cutting the lawn and making deliveries are just typical things you'll do to earn your money. There's still always a chance a distant relative will send you a gift through the mail. \n3) Getting the game - Getting the hottest new game can sometimes be difficult. Stores having limited stock was a common occurrence back in the day and in Retro World things are no different. You'll have to track down your games by calling specialty shops, department stores and then get there before it sells out. In some cases finding a game can be a quest in itself taking you to some of the more seedy parts of Frankton.\n4) Playing the game - Now that you've got your game it's time to play it. Finishing games to 100% completion advances the story to the next Hype phase. \nBeing just a kid means you won't be able to buy everything available on release day. You'll have to rely on your friends to play everything. But once a game gets old you can always find it in a bargain bin or a second hand store.\nWe've teamed up with members of one of the biggest names in adventure games, LucasArts!\n\"Unfortunately for LucasArts, the company was shut down back in April by Disney. Thankfully for Francois, however, since the shutdown the members of the LucasArts audio team - one of the most highly regarded and awarded audio teams in the game industry - have all gone freelance and we've talked about bringing the same sparkle of AAA quality adventure game audio to the world of Retro World. With team members who have worked on the Special Edition Monkey Island titles, as well as The Dig and Grim Fandango, we know adventure games and we know that we will do a great job with audio for Retro World.\" -Jesse Harlin former Staff Composer for LucasArts currently wielding his talents from dunderpatemusic.com.\nIf you've played a LucasArts game in the last ten years chances are you've heard Jesse's incredible work. \nWe also have on board the great musical talents of Clark Aboud (responsible for the trailer's soundtrack) who will also be contributing to the game's soundtrack.\nYou can sample Clark's previous works on his SoundCloud page.      \n\nWe have Mathieu Galarneau as our resident web master & graphic designer. Mathieu has done some incredible character pixel art and animation for us.\n\nAnd finally myself Francois Grenier, lead designer and developer, responsible for the environment art as well as character art and animations.  \nsome games might be too controversial and result in protests from the town folk.\nMany of our features are still in the early stages of development and are simply too raw to show. Here's what we can tell you. You'll take on game challenges on and off screen as the game worlds and main world collide. You'll use your wit as well as retro play styles from inner games to solve real world problem situations. At it's core Retro World is an Action/Adventure/RPG but you'll find just about every type of game available throughout the four console generations.\nExperience a wacky retelling of the video game industry while uncovering the mystery of why games are coming to life.\nExplore a 3D stylized open world with various seasons, weather effects as well as night and day transitions.\nInteract with colorful characters from gamers to folks simply enjoying small town life.\nPlay arcade and console games with your friends. (Some games feature real life multi-player options for up to 4 players.)\nSome later gen games feature real Stereoscopic 3D, permitting you have the necessary hardware in your home. (3D types supported include Side by Side and Top and Bottom). Note that 3D viewing is not required to play these titles and is simply used for show.\nDefend yourself using real-time combat in the over world using a variety of weapons taken from the environment as well a from the video games you play.\nSome game worlds will collide with the real world making town life a little difficult.\nI've always enjoyed the tongue and cheekiness of discovering games within games. But what if the idea could be pushed to the point where the player begins to question what is real and what is game? So I decided to take the concept to the next level , while telling a relatable story to gamers like myself and yet interesting enough for new gamers that weren't around in the 80's. I've never seen anything of this scale before, so this presented a great opportunity to create something different.\nPlay classic shooters like Planet Defence.\nExperience the zany adventures of Suitman through a series of games.\nWe have a few interesting game mechanics we have yet to reveal as doing so would spoil some of the fun.\nDreaming big comes at a price. There is no way a single person could deliver a fully flushed out game of this magnitude without additional help. Kickstarter can supply me with the needed additional resources required to deliver this vision without sacrificing anything that makes this game special. The $175k will allow me and my artist to take this on full time as well as pay for an additional developer and animator to join our efforts. This also has to pay for our talented sound guys and any additional cost incurred by legal fees, Kickstarter fees etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking on a project of this scale can be quite daunting. But not all is grim as we have three elements working in our favor: \n\nThe first is the target platforms. We are only shipping on Windows, Mac and Linux, on which the game already runs without any issues. \n\nThe second is the fact that we already have a head start on the project. The main framework of the game is almost complete with a little over a year's worth of coding already done (weekends and evenings). The in-game games are running on smaller modularized engines that can easily be morphed into any retro game style imaginable. We already have side scrollers, shooters, adventure and puzzle games in various stages of development representing every gaming era within our 30 year scope. \n\nThe third is our completely digital reward tiers. This ensures that every penny is strictly spent on the game development. We're not printing T-shirts or full sized posters that must be shipped around the world. All funds are strictly to going to towards the completion of this project.\n \nEven with all of these elements already in place there is still much to be done . We still need to fully complete and polish the world map, interior spaces, code additional features as well as animate our full cast of characters. It's not going to be easy but nothing worthwhile ever is.\n\n\n\nShould we exceed our funding goal, I ensure you that the surplus amount will be completely reinvested into the project to improve the the quality of the product beyond your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Francois Grenier\nFirst created \u00b7 3 backed\nA gamer since the age of four, I first toyed with the idea of making games during my first programming class in high school at the age of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Thank you for all of your generosity and support.", "update_content": "I would like to thank all of the backers for believing in our project.

BUT...\nIf you missed the Kickstarter campaign, you can still help get to the next stretch goal (and get Obduction and more) at obductiongame.com! \n Ob`duc\u00b4tion, n.1. The act of drawing or laying over, as a covering. \nObduction is an all-new, real-time, first-person adventure that harkens back to the spirit of Cyan\u2019s earlier games Myst and Riven. Obduction resurrects that incredible feeling of suddenly finding yourself in the middle of a new world to explore, discover, solve, and become part of.\nThis year marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of Myst, one of the best-selling computer games in history. Myst was an exploration through a landscape of dramatically realistic images (rendered in Strata - check out the new Strata reward tier!) tied together to create an experience that was described as \u201cbecoming your world.\u201d The Myst name is widely recognized as uniquely defining a new kind of gaming - amazingly immersive worlds where the point is to understand your environment rather than test your reflexes. The Obduction project will take what Cyan knows about creating deeply immersive worlds and apply it to an entirely new game with fantastic scenery, incredible architecture, compelling story, and exceptional challenges.\nObduction will be built with the same framework that made Cyan's earlier games such a wonderful experience: stunning landscapes, deep storyline, engaging characters, dramatic soundscapes, and challenging yet intuitive puzzles. Obduction is an entirely new property, delivered using one of the most powerful game development technologies available today. Obduction is an adventure game for the new millennium that stays true to the concepts that made the genre great.\nAt the base funding level, Obduction will be developed for both Windows and MacOS, with a targeted release of mid-to-late 2015.\nThe game is being designed with a flexible scope in mind, so that as the budget grows, the game grows. More places; more puzzles; more mystery; more complexity; more adventure!\nWith the generalities out of the way, it's time to dig a bit deeper into specifics. If you know anything about Cyan's worlds, you know that you don't want to know too much ahead of time. We'll try our best to whet your appetite, without giving away too many spoilers.\nStory\nObduction's experience supplies what every good storyteller does: a very personal window into a much larger world. Obduction begins with... well\u2026 an abduction - your abduction. On a crystal clear, moon-lit night, a curious, organic artifact drops from the sky and inexplicably whisks you away across the universes to who-knows-where (or when, or why).\nAnd, as anyone who ever played Myst or Riven knows, exploring everything around you allows you to read between the lines and to begin to answer your questions. Why is there an old, abandoned farmhouse - complete with white picket fence - in the middle of an alien landscape? You'll find out. From this point on the story becomes your story. \nGame Design\nObduction has a few game design elements in common with Myst and Riven, and it skews into new areas as well. Cyan's basic design philosophy is simple:\nBuild every element of the experience to make you, the player, feel like this virtual world has become your world.\nThe interface should be intuitive and transparent.\nThe story should be revealed through exploration and not necessarily shoveled out in cinematic form.\nThe puzzles should range from easy to difficult, but even the toughest puzzles should be designed so that you know that all the pieces to solve it are there in front of you.\nThe sound and music should be balanced; they should add emotion but not become distracting or annoying.\nEnvironmental Immersion\nCyan has a proven history of delivering visually stunning environments that immerse players in our games. We plan to continue that tradition, leveraging Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4. Today's modern realtime engines have plenty of horse-power to produce zillions of bullets per second, but they can also be used to make remarkable landscapes and architecture that approach and even surpass the pre-rendered days of Riven. Unreal 4 is an amazing resource that enables us to build a world that you can lose yourself in.\nClick here for more info regarding the Unreal Engine 4...\nWe\u2019ve got add-ons. Three to be precise - add on a digital game, a boxed game, or a t-shirt. Here\u2019s how it works: Increase your pledge by the cost of the desired add-on(s) without changing your selected reward tier. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign, you\u2019ll receive a survey where you can confirm which add-on(s) you wanted. (Note that shipping is included in the amount of the add-on.)\nWe'll be excited to reach our target goal and make an amazing experience. But we're also anticipating what it means to move beyond that goal. Kickstarter funding over the base level would be used to make Obduction bigger and better - adding such stretch goals as new places to explore, additional platforms, localization, technological bells and whistles, and more.\nVery simple: It's what we love!\nWe love the wonder of having an entirely new world at our fingertips. We love the twisted unraveling of an unexpected storyline. We love the satisfying \"Aha! moment\" of solving a particularly perplexing puzzle. We love the rush of revelation when we find out what's around the next corner. We love the twinge of emotion entering a dimly lit room because we feel like this place has become our world.\nAnd we hear from more and more people who love all of those things, too. We'd love to make it for you!\nCyan has done it all. We started with self-publishing, hand-stuffing 3.5-inch floppies into boxes. We've done full-blown publisher models, where they get 88%. And we've even done all kinds of hybrid publishing models between the two. \nCurrently, we are independent, and it feels right. It's not the Myst heyday - money has come and gone, but we've managed to stay alive as a small, independent studio through times when indie studios were falling by the wayside. And now it seems that times have changed, and indie studios are making a comeback thanks to some interesting new publishing platforms and models - including Kickstarter.\n\nSimply put, Kickstarter is a way for us to deliver a stunning experience that doesn't empty your pocketbook, while keeping us independent enough to make choices that a publisher might not understand. (Like we did with Myst 20 years ago.)\n\nInstead of a detached, corporate marketing department guaranteeing to upper management how many units they will sell to justify a budget, we'll be relying on excited fans, family, friends, and even strangers who love what we're doing and want to be part of it. The funding and the budget become part of the development process instead of being coldly handed down from an accounting officer who doesn't even know the name of the product - let alone the names of any of the real people who will be making it.\nIn addition to regular Kickstarter updates, we will be making our development process transparent and accessible to our supporters in the form of exclusive backer forums. You'll be able to interact directly with the creators, read behind-the-scenes blog posts about the ins and outs of the game's development, and stay current with our overall progress. Don't worry, we'll do our best to keep the information spoiler-free, so that you still have a rich and surprising game to explore, even if you are an avid process junkie!\nThe funding will be spent solely on Obduction. It's very straightforward: we'll spend the funds that you invest on making Obduction the best possible experience.\nWe already have a team here - a few who've been here since the Myst days, and some who are more recent. We'll be adding to the team after we get funding, so we can flesh out our design and then get started on all the new art, modeling, texturing, sounds, music, lighting, characters, interface, technology, and more.\nWe don't want that team to be too large. One thing we've learned over the years is that it can be much more efficient and satisfying to have a smaller team that works closely together. We want everyone on the team to have ownership as we design and build this experience together. And we'll make sure you know who is on the team and how things are going. \nWe've done quite a few updates since we started. Here's a list that summarizes and links to a few of the more important updates.

Learn more!\nCyan was started in 1987 by brothers Rand and Robyn Miller. They released a new kind of children\u2019s software they called The Manhole. It was a simple, whimsical, black & white world to explore with very little to get in the way of the journey. It was well received by children of all ages. The brothers followed up with Cosmic Osmo and Spelunx - two more rich, non-threatening worlds for children to explore. \n\nIn 1991, Cyan began work on Myst, a project that would take everything they had learned about making worlds and use it to create a truly unique experience for an older, more sophisticated audience. Myst was about finding yourself lost in a world and simply exploring, understanding and becoming part of the story - and the public response was nothing short of phenomenal. Sales for Myst and its sequel Riven have exceeded 12 million units worldwide - which made them the best-selling computer games of the 20th century. \nAfter five products in the Myst series, Cyan turned its attention to making an ambitious, new kind of Myst game, a never-ending world that would allow players to explore together. Uru: Ages Beyond Myst (Myst Online). It spawned a thriving, dedicated community and is still available to explore for free.\nCyan continues to draw on our past as we dream into the future. We are looking forward to creating more exciting worlds that move yet again away from the standard fare - to something unexpected.\n\nCyan is located on the northern outskirts of Spokane, Washington, about 119 trillion miles from the nearest habitable planet.\n ...And a team of other amazing and talented individuals.\n                                     *Special thanks to Strata for their generous support of the Obduction Kickstarter campaign. \n*Special thanks to Robyn Miller for use of the Myst Soundtrack music used in our video.

ColecoVision is Back.\nColecoVision is a classic retro games console from the early 1980s. And we're trying to bring it back! We're planning on creating an app - as a starter on iOS, but if we get the backing also on Android, Mac, PC and Vita. Way more than just 'an emulator' we want to create something that showcases the ColecoVision, including:\nBeautiful, graphical, intuitive user interface (see some ideas below)\nCompetitive scoring \nChallenges \nAchievements \nBox art & instructions \nHistory of ColecoVision \nAround 20 original fully licensed games and now homebrew titles too.\n$250,000!! What are you spending the money on?!?\nWe hear you internet! Lots of you have been asking for a breakdown of where the money is going - so here we go!:\n- Licensing costs \nYes, there are free emulators out there which work to varying degrees, and that is GREAT! But we are delivering a fully branded (It's a proper 'ColecoVision'!), fully licensed set of original games. That means it is 100% legal, totally official, no grey areas. This is the ONLY way you are going to see a collection like this for sale.\n- Rewards costs and other fees (Kickstarter/Amazon). \nUnlike some Kickstarter campaigns where the 'physical' rewards kick in at $100+, we start ours at just $45 for a custom T-shirt or poster. We feel strongly that we want our backers to get a LOT for their money. We deliberately pitched our 'core' reward at a super-low $10 so that as many retro fans as possible could get something without breaking the bank. Of course, by pitching physical rewards at a lower price, that means our margin on those pledges is reduced - and the amount that goes into the actual delivery is lower too.\n- The remainder\nIn total (it's impossible to be precise because we get different margins on different rewards) we are going to be left with around $130-140k after the licensing, rewards and fees. This money is all going to go on actually executing the project. This means paying for: \nGraphics Designer \nUser Interface & User Experience Specialist \n3D Modeller \nDevelopers\nRemember we are absolutely not just building \"an emulator\" here. It's going to take about 5 months to complete the project, and we're creating a beautiful, unique, graphical, intuitive user-interface including competitive scoring, challenges, achievements, box art, instructions and history of ColecoVision.\nPress Coverage\nWe've received some great press coverage so far from some of the biggest gaming and tech websites around!\n\"Rantmedia Games has a knack for rekindling childhood gaming memories -- see its uncannily accurate Vectrex Regeneration as proof.\" - Engadget\nWe've got some great ideas and would love to find out what you think. It's going to be slick, polished and beautiful. You can check out the concept art below too, and see where we're heading with it.\nWe really like the idea of re-creating a living or family room with a ColecoVision console right in the center. We want people to be reminded of the original system, to see what it looked like. We're thinking atmospheric lighting - the glow of the TV, lighting the room and then to the left, we're imagining your stack of games.\nSwipe or tap, and the games all fly up and assemble in a line so you can swipe left and right through your library - accessing box-art, instructions and the ROM cartridge. Choosing to play a game will drop the cartridge into the console, and then zoom you into the TV and you'll be playing full screen.\nTo the right, we're thinking it would be cool to have a trophy cabinet. Only, instead of it containing football or athletics trophies, this one will slowly fill up as you get scores and achievements in the games. You'll be able to send challenges to friends, and see how you shape up on global leader boards.\nUltimately, it's all about the details, the little touches, the polish and the delivery of the most authentic experience possible.\nUpdate 10th October: Some fresh new renders!\nWe've got the rights to a huge list of games that we're going to include in the initial release including:\nAntarctic Adventure \u2022 BlackJack/Poker \u2022 Bump 'n' Jump \u2022 Brain Strainers \u2022 Destructor \u2022 Fortune Builder \u2022 Frenzy \u2022 Jumpman \u2022 Jumpman Junior \u2022 Jungle Hunt \u2022 Ms. Space Fury \u2022 Pepper II \u2022 Space Fury \u2022 Super Action Boxing \u2022 Super Action Football \u2022 Super Action Baseball \u2022 Super Action Soccer \u2022 Zaxxon\nWe're hoping that more can be added later on and we're also hoping to support homebrew games. That's a lot of games!\nInitially we're planning to launch on iOS, but we're also very keen to get this onto other platforms too. So it really depends on your enthusiasm - hopefully you can help us make this happen.\nWe know that everyone has their favorite platform, and we have ambitions to also launch onto Android, Mac, PC and even hardware like PS Vita. But we wanted to start simple, and then get feedback on what you'd like us to support.\nWe are excited to announce our first stretch goal!\n\n $300,000 = Android\nSomething for everyone hopefully! Depending on the amount you pledge you will get a selection of amazing rewards that include:\nWe're a small team, but we're experienced and we know what we're doing. We're the guys who bought you 'Vectrex Regeneration' - launched onto the App Store at the end of last year - bringing back the classic Vectrex experience to a whole new audience.\nIt got some great reviews from people who really know what they are talking about - like Classic Game Room, Kotaku, TUAW, Joystiq, ArsTechnica, Engadget and Touch Arcade. Lots of people called it the best emulator on the App Store, where we got featured by Apple in 141 countries!\nIt's pretty much like this: we love those classic games of the 80's and early 90's which are SO addictive and yet so simple. I guess that means you could call us 'retro enthusiasts'!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wouldn't be pitching this if we weren't supremely confident we could deliver big time on our vision. We believe we've covered just about everything to nail this, from the design, development and delivery of the game to the logistics (and costs) of shipping the T-Shirts! We've got the rights and licenses already in place, and we've got track record of delivering this kind of thing successfully.\n\nThat of course doesn't mean it's going to be plain sailing - any game that is meaningful has the tendency to cause you pain when you least expect it, but we're confident we can deal with just about anything that comes our way.

We\u2019ve added over 200 new models to the Bones range, and we\u2019ve discovered that these products are monstrously popular. You wanted more! More monsters! More Demons! More Dragons! More characters! More variety and more amazing new models!\nYou're in luck! We haven\u2019t even scratched the surface. We have many more models that we think deserve to be added to Bones - new sculpts and classic favorites from our metal lines! We\u2019d like to see if you think so, too!\nBones are still really expensive to produce, and we still need your help to expand the line. Your support makes the molds that we need to produce the figures, and in exchange you get the first crack at these figures for a fantastic deal!\nWhat's in it for me?\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot since we fulfilled our first Bones Kickstarter project, so you won\u2019t find as many pledge levels. Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters. After we hit our goal, we have plans to make the value of your pledge grow.\nAll we need is your support.\nWhat Are Bones Gaming Miniatures?\nWhat?! You're a gamer, right? Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Scavenge for supplies, find survivors, and deal with massive hordes of classic-style zombies. Recruit up to five survivors with their own random names, appearances, personalities, and quirks that can both help and hinder your journey to safety. This unique blend is wrapped in a colorful game world that doesn't take itself dark-and-gritty seriously.\nTons of replay value. Every game is different. Randomized cities, different survivors to recruit, different events. We will have a big focus on rare events and Easter Eggs.\nVaried and robust Interactive Fiction style decision making. The traits, personalities, and status of your group members influence the choices you can make and their results.\nSurvivors keep track of how they feel about other members of the group. It's up to you to keep your everyone together or at least mostly alive in the middle of bickering, personality conflicts, despair, rage, and/or insanity.\nWe have the rarely seen classic \"death metaphor\" style of zombie. They're slow, they're stupid, there's up to 200 onscreen at once, and they'll never stop chasing you. They form a shambling wall of inevitable death that will drag you down.\nRarer survivors called Uniques, that have their own special events, appearance, and dialogue.\nFind a dog, teach it to drive. Have all the humans in your party die. Make the dog recruit other dogs until your band of survivors consists of 5 dogs driving a muscle car.\nDeath Road to Canada is coming out around the end of Fall 2013. We want it have as much content as possible, and we want it our PC/Mac/Linux launch to go smoothly. Your support means we can put extra resources into accomplishing these goals, especially the \"more content\" part.\nFunds are specifically going to:\nMORE ART: We throw more money at our artist and he magically converts it to new graphics. Even more survivor and zombie variety! More city variety! New special locations! More dog types!\nMORE RARE EVENTS: Paul, our programmer, has four kids to feed. Some extra money to feed his five kids would give him the peace of mind he needs to work on extra fun stuff. Rare events! Rare weapons! Rare characters! Easter Eggs!\nMORE PROMOTION: I want to show the game off at festivals, as doing so really helps getting the word out. Travel costs, much less booth costs, are really expensive. A small portion of your support will go towards this, but not much because I don't want to be responsible for taking food from Paul's six kids.\nMORE FLEXIBILITY: Funding would give us the option of hiring a part-time programmer to help out. Or a part-time writer/designer to help make more Interactive Fiction scenarios and decisions. Your support would help us hire any extra help we end up needing.\n(IF WE GO OVER) MORE FREE UPDATES: If we exceed $25,000, we want to avoid Stretch Goals that will increase the complexity of the project and the time it takes to make the game. This is known to game developers as Kickstarter's Folly. Instead, we will put extra money into providing post-release content. This will be a mixture of extra content and feature requests from the community!\nHere's some details on what you can get for backing Death Road to Canada. All rewards are cumulative, you get all the lower tier rewards if you pledge to a higher tier.\nThe Game ($10) - A copy of the game when it releases, on PC, Linux, and Mac! Mobile versions aren't included, as the Android port will take longer and iOS codes are generally limited to 50 or so. You'll also get access to news updates exclusive to Kickstarter, including exclusive polls about game content!\nSoundtrack and Manual PDF ($25) - We'll be making a cool instruction manual in PDF format. It'll have tips, art, a strategy section, and various fun stuff. You'll also get all the music used in the game.\nEarly Access ($30) - Play the PC, Mac, or Linux version of the game about a month before it's out to the public! You'll be given access to a forum where you can send feedback directly to the developers of the game. Help us make the game even better.\nStarter Pet Option ($50) - Only available to Kickstarter backers of this tier or higher, you get the option to start the game with a kitten or puppy. They take extra food, but provide a morale boost and grow into a full sized cat or dog.\nSpecial Thanks ($75) - Everyone who pledges at this tier or above will have their names put in a Special Thanks section of the game's credits. Your first name will also be added to the big list of names that randomly generated survivors may use.\nOfficial Death Road to Canada T-Shirt ($100) - Designed by the game's artist. May or may not unlock hidden secrets if you play the game while wearing the shirt.\nGraffiti Message ($250) - Write a short message and we'll put it in the game for other players to find at random. We'll work with you so it fits within the game. Size would be about 200 characters big, maximum. $150 if you get it through the limited Early Bird tier.\nPut Your Pet in the Game ($500) - Take a picture or video of your pet, write a description of it along with its name. We'll make it so that other players can randomly find and recruit your pet into their party. Unusual pets are ok, put your ferret in the game. We'll work with you so it fits within the game design.\nAbandoned Journal ($1000) - Players can find small, abandoned journals to read that tells the story about the person that wrote them. Write a story, write poetry, write crazy top 10 lists. We'll work with you on having it fit the tone of the game. Size would be about 1200 characters big, maximum.\nDesign a Recruitable Character ($2000) - The big one! Put a version of yourself in the game, or dream up an all new character. Other players may rarely find and recruit your character into their groups. You specify your character's appearance and possible special traits. We'll work with you on having it be a good fit in the game world, and also include your character in some of the dialogue and events.\nKepa Auwae is the lead designer of Rocketcat Games, makers of Mage Gauntlet, Hook Champ, Punch Quest (a collaboration with Madgarden), and more.

With future ports to iOS, Android and Blackberry planned.\nThe story revolves around Reemus, a medieval exterminator and his loyal sidekick Liam the purple bear as they battle giant insects in a quest to legitimize \"extermination\" as a heroic career path.\n\nSound ridiculous? Well it is, but don't take my word for it. You can try the earlier games for yourself right now, for free! Just click this link, don't worry I'll be here when you get back.\n UPDATE** We're 100% Funded and we've hit every stretch goal!! Take a bow everyone, we did it!

To celebrate their arrival into the Reemus universe I've been drawing them early, click here to see all the \"Zeebarfed\" characters.\nThis new game will be the 7th outing for Reemus and Liam and the 2nd in the \"Ballads of Reemus\" series. If there's one thing I'm good at, it's milking an idea for all it's worth!\nThe original \"The Several Journeys of Reemus\" series of point and click adventure games have floated around the internet as free to play browser games since 2008. With five chapters in the series, each garnering an award nomination, they've been played millions of time on sites like Kongregate.com and Newgrounds.com. If you still haven't clicked the link to try them, click and play now! Seriously, they're free to play! \nIn 2012, Reemus made the leap into a full commercial game with a new title called \"The Ballads of Reemus\". Featuring a new, longer story, more puzzles and full voice acting. It received an award for \"Best Story\" at the Casual Connect Indie Prize 2013 last month and just because I like you, I'll let you sample that game for free too, here's a link. Click and enjoy, you can thank me later.\nSo now that you've experienced what the world of Reemus has to offer, I know what you're thinking.\n\"Jay, that Death Slug storyline was nutty. When are you going to finish it?\".\n\nWell my friends, you are in luck! That's what this Kickstarter is all about. I want to finally finish what I started in 2008 and tell the complete saga of the Death Slugs. My plan is to take the first five chapters from the \"Several Journeys\" series and reboot them, touching on some of the major story elements but with all new puzzles, full voice acting and longer gameplay. The final game will be a shiny stand alone commercial version that tells the full story from beginning to end. \n\nTHE STORY SO FAR...\nWhen Reemus the Exterminator\u2019s main competitor Pest-Go reduces pest control to a skill anyone can do with a squirt bottle, Reemus fears his chances of having a truly heroic ballad written about him are over.That is until he stumbles upon an invasion of killer Death Slugs that has all the makings of the greatest quest of all time, one that can not only restore extermination to its former glory but finally put Reemus on the map as a true hero. Now the only question remains, will Reemus and his sidekick Liam defeat the insidious Death Slugs, or will they be the ones exterminated?\nWILL THIS BE A FLASH GAME? \nNo, this time around I'm using a brand new engine. The VISIONAIRE adventure engine is tailor made for creating adventure games. The team at Daedalic games used it for \"Deponia\" and \"Whispered World\" among others and if it's good enough for them, it's good enough for me! \nHOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO THIS BY YOURSELF?\nCan I really juggle that many balls at once? Well I was worried at first, so to set my mind at ease I created a prototype just to make sure the engine could do what I wanted and that I could actually handle programming it. \nTurns out it's really intuitive and because it's focused on adventure games it really has all the tools I need to create the game I want. \nIf you're interested in checking out what I made, click the link below. It's super short and missing a lot of key elements, like voice acting and Liam! Hopefully it's enough to whet your appetite for a full game and showcase a bit of what you'll be in store for.\n\nPLAY THE PROTOTYPE!\nPLEASE NOTE *This build is PC Only, the Mac and Linux version will have to wait a bit longer until Visionaire officially releases their porting tools. Don't worry, the full game will be available for all three! \n\nLets keep this free train rolling, click for another free shot of Reemus. This one is just a tiny morsel. Don't worry it won't ruin your appetite.\nReemus will have to deal with such quests as breaking up a Stag Beetle stag party\n$15k you say? That's barely enough for groceries, never mind padding the budget to go on an extravagant trip! Well, that's how I roll. My passion runs deep for this project, so I'm not looking to retire on kickstarter money. I just want enough to cover my living expenses so I can focus all my energy into the game.\n\nI've also managed to guilt some of my friends into investing into the project, with that I've been able to lay the ground work for the game. Writing, design and art have already begun. So I just need another hot cash injection to pull it over the finish line.\nOkay, we both knew this rain of freebies would end. It's time to ask for some money but to ease the pain I've created a bunch of cool rewards for you. Check them out...\nIf I manage to exceed my goal, all money will be re-invested back into the game in the form of:\nAdded Production Value (Extra music & animation)\nIncreased Marketing Budget\nFRIGS language translation\nPizza\n\n\nIf I completely shatter my goal, I would like to expand on the content by including some new, optional side quests. \nI have some ideas for small Reemus quests that could be expanded into optional bonus stories that don't affect the main storyline.  I've also always wanted to create new content by telling stories with secondary characters. \nFor instance if Reemus visits a honey bee in the main storyline, I'd like to add content that involves controlling that same honey bee and telling a bit of the story from his perspective. By doing this I can add new puzzles and story without having to create a whole new set of art assets which, because of the time consuming nature of art production, is what would cause delays in the schedule. Also by telling other stories within the game, the main story line doesn't get padded with filler and the original vision stays intact. \nBut for now I'd rather just promise to make the best game I possibly can with my current design document. \nWHAT PLATFORMS WILL IT BE FOR?\nVisionaire will support PC, Mac and Linux. I also have plans to port the game to all mobile devices. \nWHEN CAN WE PLAY IT?\nI'd like to launch the game by June 2014.\nWILL IT BE ON STEAM?\nI'm actively working on getting the first \"Ballads of Reemus\" game on Steam. So we'll see what happens but I'm definitely trying to get it on there. In the meantime you can vote for the first game on Steam Greenlight right now!\n\nWhile you're there, show some love for The Ballads of Reemus 2 concept page!\nHOW WILL IT BE DISTRIBUTED?\nIt will be available as a DRM-Free digital download from my site, www.Zeebarf.com.\nMy name is Jay Ziebarth aka \"Zeebarf\".

The risk is always one aspect of the game will be much harder than anticipated to complete and as such requires more than the allotted time to finish. This usually starts a chain reaction and before you know it your deadline whizzes past you.\n\nHaving already tackled a full commercial game as well as a large scale iOS project, I feel I've gained enough experience to accurately predict how long each step of the process is going to take and have allocated the appropriate amount of time for each stage.\n\nUsing an existing engine will dramatically cut down on development time as most of the heavy lifting has already been worked out.

The kickstarter funding has successfully concluded ... but the journey of our game is only beginning! Come visit our website and see how you can become part of Sojourner Tales!\nIf they combined the power of tablets, smart phones and ebook readers...with the joy of storytelling and board games.\nWelcome to Sojourner! I'm Tracy Hickman. I'm an International and New York Times Best Selling author and game designer. For over thirty years, my wife Laura and I have been writing novels and designing games ('Dragonlance', 'Wayne of Gotham', 'Ravenloft', 'Dragon's Bard'). Now we're thrilled to invite you on our latest adventure: to bring interactive adventure storytelling to families and hobbyists alike. \nIn Sojourner Tales, you will use strategy and wits as you discover and collect the pieces of your mysterious story as you strive to be the first to complete the epic adventure. The tale is different every time you play ... or you can download new Sojourner Tales to explore from our website!\nNumber of Players: 2-6\nPlaying Time: 60-90 minutes\nAge of Players: 12+ (requires minimum reading skills)\nSetup time: 5-7 minutes\nTeach the rules: 3-5 minutes\nAlmost everything you need to know in order to play the game is contained in our basic game play video right here. \nCan I play without electricity?\nAbsolutely! The Sojourner Story books are designed so that you can use either a print version of the adventures or the e-book version although the electronic versions make the game faster and easier to play.\nWINNING\nThe first person to collect all five of their Chapter Disks and fulfill the final win condition of the story wins that game!\nThere are other rules clarifying the random setup of the board and when you turn over a face-down Chapter Disk but you already know enough rules right here to play the game.\nWe've created a board game like no other: the first to integrate download content for tablets such as iPads, smart phones and e-reader devices such as Kindles, Nooks and Kobos.\nUnique Ebook Story Modules: The story told in every Sojourner Tale is designed to be contained entirely in the electronic mobi or epub files. You also have the option to download the adventure in PDF format to print out and use with the game if you do not have a tablet or other device that supports the electronic book formats. However, the use of any touch-screen device provides a magical experience in storytelling and helps the game move faster.\nAdaptable Design: The game components that come in the box and the rules of the game itself are specifically designed to be adaptive to a broad spectrum of storytelling. Each Sojourner Story Module contains information on which location tiles are to be used on the board with that particular story, thereby changing the look of the game board depending on the story being told. All of the flavor, setting, characters and narrative of the adventure are contained in the downloaded module ... meaning the game can adapt to any story you want to live.\nInnovative Storytelling System: The board keeps track of your location in the epic story, making certain that the game flows back and forth between the board and the ebook with the story continuity left intact. For random encounters, an innovative 'Twisted Tales' system lets the players draw two twisted cards and one tales card and then 'stack' them in such a way as to make a phrase -- a phrase which takes them to a specific adventure entry for that combination of cards. \nGrass-roots Licensing: We want YOU to write adventures for our game and so we are even providing you with a 'grass-roots licensing option whereby you can not only create your own Sojourner Tales games but (with our license) also sell those adventures on our official website.\n\nAnything is possible! Since the story and complexity of the game is designed to be contained entirely in the Sojourner Story Module, it is entirely up to the module designer.\nThe book contains our 'secret recipe': a matrix of entries designed specifically to interface with the game. You play the game under the same basic rules but once you enter the book, whatever the story's author creates will plunge you into that story.  Some stories are simple and created for quick play and families. Others may be complex, intended for more serious hobby gamers.\nOur stretch goals list two additional modes of play: Improv and Theater play. Improv is a way of using the game to make up the story collectively as you play.  Sojourner Theater  play has each person at the table downloading the same book ... but with each player taking a different speaking part as the game progresses.\nIn our initial release of the game, we will include components for six genres of story:\nFantasy\nScience-fiction\nHorror\nRomance/Steampunk\nMystery\nHoliday\nAdditional themed components representing further genres are certainly possible. What would you like to see?\nWe're packing a lot of awesome in every box.\n1 Gameboard\n50 'Twisted' Cards\n50 'Tales' Cards\n36 'Destiny' Cards\n6 Player Tokens\n6 Six-sided Dice\n1 'Lead Player' Marker\n1 'Chapter' Marker\n1 'Scene' Marker\n32 Story Disks (6 each in 6 colors)\n6 Journal Display Boards\n15 Location Tiles (creates 6 unique board configurations supporting fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, romance/steampunk, superhero and holiday themes)\n1 Sojourner Story Module (print edition with additional access instructions for downloading PDF, Kindle Mobi or iPad epub files)\n1 Rules Book\nOriginal Cover Design\nCould you write a game just for your son's birthday? Maybe a game specifically for your parent's anniversary?  What if you want to write fan-fiction Sojourner Story Modules of your own?\nGreat! We want to help you!\nWe will be providing through our website tools to help you create your own Sojourner Tales adventures for your own, personal -- as in non-commercial -- use.\nBut what if you want to SELL that amazing Sojourner Story Module that you polished to perfection?\nGreat! We want to help you do that, too!\nWe will sell you a license to produce official and sanctioned Sojourner Tales adventures which you can sell with our blessing. The license initially will be for from one to two years. Anything you produce during the period of the license that meets our standards, is licensed for five years after the end of the license. You should notice that there are Backer levels which include this license. You'll need to adhere to our standards policies regarding content and quality.

The campaign is now over, which means Kickstarter has frozen this page and it can never be updated.  Which means that everything here is absolutely, 100% guaranteed to be hopelessly and comically out of date.  The actual Robot Turtles activity is now happening at www.RobotTurtles.com, where you should proceed immediately (after watching my adorable children in the video above). \nThank you so very, very much for your support.\n-- Dan Shapiro\nRobot Turtles Forever!\nAnd now, the campaign that started it all...\nRobot Turtles is a board game for kids ages 3-8. It takes seconds to learn, minutes to play, and will keep them learning for hours. Kids won't know it but while they're playing, they're learning the fundamentals of programming.\nI'm a father of four year old twins.  Teaching them to program a computer is the single greatest superpower I can give them. I made Robot Turtles so that my kids could learn programming basics without needing a computer. In fact, they don't even need to be able to read!\nI've been told that this would never sell in the toy aisle.  I've shown it to board game designers and manufacturers; they told me this would never work on store shelves. Learning programming just sounds too complicated.\nBut I disagree.  I think programming can be as simple as playing with these four turtles.\nThat's why I'm here on Kickstarter.  If there are a thousand of us, we can do this.  I don\u2019t think I\u2019m alone in believing that programming literacy is going to be key to our children\u2019s future. How many of us are there?\nI\u2019m a software guy who\u2019s been programming since I was 7 years old.  I invented Robot Turtles as I pondered these questions in the shower one morning:\n1) Why are kid games either pure luck (Candyland) or a frustrating exercise in trying to lose on purpose, without the child noticing (Tic-Tac-Toe)?\n2) How old does a child need to be to learn to program? (Do they even need to read?)\n3) What's something cool I can do with my kids this afternoon?\nI got out of the shower, printed out some generic robot clip art, and told my 4-year-old twins that I had a new game for us to play.  We started experimenting with the rules, and the kids couldn't get enough of it.\nI got so excited about this game that I took a leave of absence from my job at Google and spent the summer working full time to develop it.\nNow I just need to find homes for 1,000 copies so I can meet the factory minimum order!\nOne of the unique things about Robot Turtles is that only one person (the \u201cTurtle Mover\u201d) needs to read the rules. That means the kids can just start playing!  Here\u2019s how it unfolds.\nFirst, put away the Laser and Function Frog cards.  They'll get to unlock these later!\nEvery player (\u201cTurtle Master\u201d) gets to pick a turtle and gets a matching deck of cards.  \nStack the cards on the table, in piles, face up, and build a maze for each player out of walls and a jewel.\nThen read these three rules out loud to your turtle masters:\nThe youngest turtle master goes first.  They put their first card down and you move the turtle accordingly.\nIt might help to point out that the purple card turns the turtle toward the purple flower, the yellow card toward the yellow flower, etc.\nAs they progress, they build their program up on the table. If they make a mistake, they can shout \"Bug!\" and debug it.\nPretty soon your kids will figure out the secret of Robot Turtles: it lets the kids control the grownups!  The little programmers put instruction cards down, driving the turtles through the maze, but the grownup is the computer, executing commands on the board.  At its heart, Robot Turtles is a game about bossing around adults. Just like programming is about bossing around computers.\nKids love unlocking new features of Robot Turtles, like powerups in a video game.  Each unlockable changes the game to make it more challenging, so Robot Turtles can grow with your children.\nIt may not look like it, but Robot Turtles is a very simple programming language.  It drew its inspiration from Logo, the first programming language I learned as a kid (and the first programming language to prominently feature a turtle).  \nWhile the Robot Turtles programming language isn\u2019t Turing complete, it prepares kids with the skills they\u2019ll need to learn to love programming as they grow up:\nExperiential learning. Kids start the game the same way they start programming \u2013 at the command line. Every instruction they issue is executed immediately. They quickly discover that they can learn by trying things out.\nDebugging. The \u201cBug\u201d undo feature offers the simple confidence that they can try anything. If it doesn\u2019t work out, they know they can back up and try again. For new computer learners, discovering that there\u2019s no cost for being wrong is essential to their growth.\nLimited syntax. Computer programming is about expressing complicated ideas with just a few simple building blocks. The first time they play, kids will want to tell you what to do, or point the cards sideways to make them do something different. Learning Robot Turtles is a process of learning to use a new, simple language to express complicated thoughts.\nOrder of operations. It\u2019s quickly apparent that \u201cforward, forward, right\u201d is very different from \u201cright, forward, forward\u201d.\nPlanning a program. There\u2019s nothing more cool then when kids graduate to \u201cPlay 3\u201d and \u201cWrite Program\u201d and you see them planning out the whole course in their heads. Just like real programmers, they mentally run their code and debug it. Then they get frustrated and just try it to see what happens\u2026 also like real programmers.\nFunctions and optimizations. Although the youngest turtle masters may not be old enough for Write Program and Function Frog, this offers slightly older kids a level of abstraction and challenge on par with \u201creal\u201d programming. Yes, kindergartners can refactor code!\nComputers work for you. Somewhere along the line, programmers learn that writing code isn\u2019t like doing your homework \u2013 it\u2019s like ordering around a devoted (if not very bright) servant. Guess what? You are the computer and they get to order you around. (That\u2019s why kids love this game!)\nMade in America\nI spent a lot of time figuring out the best manufacturer for Robot Turtles, but in the end the decision was easy.  Delano Service is based in Battle Creek, Michigan.  They're over a century old and manufacture fantastic games like Anomia and Fluxx. Their CEO, Kim Drayer, is wicked sharp and a pleasure to work with.  And while we live in an international economy, I'm particularly proud to be able to send your family something that was made entirely in the country in which I live.  No matter where you may be! Which takes us to...\nInternational Backers\nRobot Turtles has the most amazing backers imaginable. 47 volunteer translators have already offered their services to help localize the Robot Turtles instructions in to 21 languages.  The game has no text except the instructions and the box art, so it's perfect for audiences around the world.  So far, backers plan to have the instructions available in the following languages:\nAfrikaans , Catalan, Chinese (Simplified) , Danish, Dutch, Australian English, UK English, Finnish, French , German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian , Polish, Portuguese , Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.\nIf you would like to help, please sign up!\nRobot Turtles is available internationally for a single, fixed shipping price. All tiers except the early bird pricing tier (read why) are available to international backers, including the 3-pack and 10-pack discount tiers.\nI can't believe you made it this far.\nBut if you did, you must be terribly interested in what kind of turtle experiences are available!  I will try not to disappoint.  If anything's unclear, let me know and I will clarify.  It's frustrating when you can't figure out what's in a pledge level and what isn't, so I tried to summarize each one below for you.\nThank you ($1)\nThank you for your support! Every dollar helps bring these adorable robotic terrapins in to existence. \nSummary:\nMy thanks, transmitted psychically and through email\nEarly Turtle: Full Game with Discount ($29) \nSmall print runs of games are extremely expensive - most of the cost comes from set up, so the first thousand copies are the most expensive. Still, I want to get Robot Turtles in as many hands as possible. So the first people to pledge get robot turtles for just $29, including free shipping in the US. Unfortunately this tier is not available internationally (read why). \nIncluded in the box, you get:\n1 quad fold game board (20\" x 20\" heavy duty chipboard)\n1 full-color set of rules\n4 robot turtle tiles (all tiles are 2\" x 2\" heavy chipboard)\n4 decks of cards (one for each turtle player) - 36 poker-sized cards each\n14 stone wall tiles and 10 ice wall tiles\n4 robot gem tiles\nand an incomparably good time with the kids!\nUpdate: the incredible backers of this project have enabled me to make the game even better! More cards, more tiles, and more fun.  See the updates section for details.\nSummary:\n1 game\nRobot Turtle: Full Game ($40)\nIf you pledge at this level, you'll get the same as the Early Turtle tier. Unlike the Early Turtle tier, this one can be shipped internationally (and so can all the tiers below).\nSummary:\n1 game\nThank-you Turtle: Letter & Game ($60) \nYour kid is going to be very happy: in addition to the full game, your child(ren) get a full-color letter, addressed to them by name, with an inked turtle-foot signature on the bottom. You get to choose which turtle sends it, too. And inside the game box? Their name is in the credits in the manual! This tier includes one letter with up to four children's names on it.  Note that an email will be sent asking for your children's names on Sept 27, and you must reply within three days of the project's closing (by midnight PST on September 30th) in order for them to be included in the manual.  You also get a digital printable version of award-winning illustrator Matthew Cordell's \"Turtles Playing Turtles\".\nUpdate: Because of your incredible support, a full color pick-your-own-path 32-page ebook will be included at this tier!  It's a fantastic tale where kids make decisions at each page that guide the story. It tells how Beep the turtle learns how to work with his new friend the Function Frog.  \nHere's a draft of the first of the 16 amazing illustrations in the book.  It's going to be something else. \nSummary:\n1 game\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\nTriple Turtles: Holiday Shopping 3-pack ($80) \nNot one, not two, but three teams of turtles will march their way to your door.

This level doesn't include the letter or the recognition in the manual.\nSummary:\nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook\nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n3 games\nLaser Turtles: Extraordinary 3D Edition ($200)\nAs terrific as Robot Turtles is, I have been itching to make something truly unique. Something gorgeous. Something 3D.\nSomething that gave me an excuse to spend some quality time with a 100-watt CO2 laser cutter.\nAfter evaluating miniatures (big minimum order), 3D printing (ugly plastic and too expensive), and various handmade options (I have no artistic skill whatsoever), I settled on laser turtles - a special edition where all the tiles are upgraded to pure laser-made awesomeness.  \nEach one of these is made by hand, probably by me although I'm still entertaining fantasies of recruiting someone's teenager to babysit the lasercutter. They are labeled for ages 12+ (not for little ones) because they absolutely cannot go in little mouths.  But damn, do these make the game amazing!  (This tier also comes with the standard game, which you'll need for the board and cards, plus you can play it with younger ones). And you get the Thank-You Turtle.\nHere are the current prototypes. I'm going to keep experimenting with methods and materials to make this as fantastic as it can possibly be!\nIt is awesome.\nIf you want the laser turtles AND another tier, see the FAQ entry for \"How do I get two rewards?\"  \nSummary:  \nFull color pick-your-own-path ebook  \nPrintable version of \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" by Matthew Cordell\n1 thank-you letter\nThank-you in the manual\n1 game\n1 Laser Turtles upgrade pack\nTen Turtles: School-size Deca-pack ($240) \nA very noble cause.

Your support was spectacular. We did it. Production art is starting; the game is going to go to press. WOOHOO!\nMore early birds.  My $40 price was based around a 1,000 unit minimum order.  I had no idea there was going to be this kind of excitement. That means I get to place a bigger order, which means I get to make more units available at a discount!  (Note that, because international shipping is already discounted, I can't offer it as an option for Early Bird, so the best value for international backers is the 3- and 10-packs). \nInstant coloring sheets thank-you. For hitting (and then blasting through) the $60k stretch goal, Backers at the $1 level and up can go here and download a PDF of six coloring sheets. This is completely free, with no DRM, and available immediately.  \nRobot Turtles in the news. You can read about the project all over the tech news.  Here's the list of articles. \nRobot Turtles: Galapagos Rules.  Us old codgers can enjoy Robot Turtles too!  Raising $150,000 has unlocked a new set of rules that allows older kids (8+) and grownups to play after the kids go to sleep.  It's incredibly fun!\nCommunity website. Raising $200,000 has unlocked a community site to collaborate on new game ideas, translations of the manual, share pictures, and more.\nDouble-sided tiles. Raising $250,000 has unlocked tiles printed on both sides, so when your kid melts ice walls, you flip them over to reveal puddles!\nMulticolor jewels.  Instead of just having green robot jewel tiles, the four jewels will come in four colors: sapphire, amathyst, ruby, and emerald.  \nLimited edition print. Award-winning children's artist Matthew Cordell has created a limited edition of 25 prints, \"Turtles playing turtles\", that are available at two pledge levels, signed and personalized by the artist. \nPrintable \"Turtles Playing Turtles\" For those of you who don't get the collectible limited edition print, all pledges at $60 or higher will get a digital, printable version of the print. \nPick your own path book. All backers at the $1 level and up get the text; backers at the \"Thank-you Turtle ($60)\" and up levels get a full-color ebook! This is shaping up to be an amazing 32-page book, illustrated in a style similar to the box cover, where kids get to decide at each page what to do next.\n50% more tiles. The original design had 32 tiles, which was plenty for basic play but could run a little shy if you really wanted to build something incredible. Every copy of the game now comes with extra walls for a total of a ridiculous 48 tiles, enough for mazes that would make a minotaur marvel. \nWe found a bug. Every game now comes with four unique bug cards, one in each deck, that kids can point to when they find a problem with their program.\nMore cards. Each deck has been upgraded from 36 to 45 cards, for bigger mazes and more turtle goodness!\nThanks so much for making it all the way to the bottom.  This project has been amazing because of people like you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first time delivering a board game. I've spent months learning everything I can about the process and interviewing some of the greatest game developers around. I've been cataloging a huge litany of problems and mistakes, and making plans to avoid them. Here's what I've come up with.\n\nI'm working with Delano Services, a major game publisher in Battle Creek, MI, that's been in business for over a century. I've quoted every aspect of the process so I know the costs and materials used. I've talked to the CEO, who fully supports the project, and has agreed to let me fly in for the initial print run to inspect the results (and to package up the collector's edition boxes and ship them immediately). \n\nBecause Delano is in the US, I can and will hop on a plane if something goes wrong. Since Robot Turtles uses standard cardboard parts, the risks of unforeseen production difficulties are minimal (but not zero). \n\nShipping is something that trips up many Kickstarters, so I've been working on that for a while. It's insanely expensive. If I took delivery of a pallet of games to my basement and shipped them out to you via UPS ground, it would cost me more to ship the game than it would to manufacture it! So instead, I'm shipping the games to Amazon and using their third party fulfillment services, which saves cost (and my basement, and my sanity). \n\nBut that adds another level of complexity. So I've spent some time working with an ex-Amazon consultant to do my best to ensure that everything goes smoothly. \n\nMy biggest concern isn't actually getting you the game. It's getting you the game in time for Christmas. I've reviewed the schedule with Delano, and everyone's confident that they can do it. But in the unlikely event that something holds up production of the game - natural disaster, turtle rebellion - I will get all the backers a print-and-play PDF version, then ship the games ASAP. I don't think it'll come to that, but that's the backup plan.\n\nInternational backers have additional uncertainty. It is more likely that shipments may miss the holidays because of shipping delays, customs holdups, or border gremlins. I don't know the taxes, duties, or tariffs you may owe when the game arrives. \n\nIt's possible that, if problems occur, I may not be able to fix them to your liking. My options to make things better will be limited to refunds and, if extra inventory is still available, replacements. If extra inventory isn't available (or if there's a problem that can't be fixed, like a special reward that can't be delivered), then you're going to be stuck with a refund instead of a game.\n\nBut I'm deeply committed to getting this product in to your hands, and the hands of your kids, as quickly as possible. Whatever comes up, I will keep you posted, step by step.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Robot Turtles latest: Target in Fargo, and why that matters", "update_content": "I can't believe it's been more than a year since the crazy Robot Turtles adventure started. All sorts of amazing things have been happening, but let me tell you the part I'm most excited about.\nWhen I was two years old, our family moved to Fargo, North Dakota. I lived there until I was 12. I've been asked, \"What brings a family to Fargo, ND?\" It's the answer to this riddle: \"Where can two newly-minted professors (my parents) get a decent job at the same place and same time?\" NDSU was hiring. \nSo I grew up in the midwest, the land of the Frozen Chosen. Wonderful people, winters that would send a polar bear looking for a space heater. There weren't many options for things: ethnic food meant the chinese place on the overpass. \"The Mall\" meant West Acres, a place where people occasionally died of hypothermia in the parking lot in the winter.

Completely synchronized cutting-edge video screen visuals, state-of-the-art lighting and special fx, stage show production and special on-stage interactive segments with the audience dazzle crowds of all ages \u2013 gamers and non-gamers alike.\nThe Kickstarter campaign will help us raise the funds to create and produce our third album which we have titled \"Level 3\". This will be a studio recording (not a live recording).  Our hope is to be able to obtain funding for our stretch goals so we can produce a full length live concert motion picture as well.  Over the past decade Video Games Live has helped to legitimize video game music and has shown the world the creative, cultural and artistic side of gaming. Although VGL has obtained a lot of accolades and success, the music industry and record companies are VERY different and no music or record company is willing to invest the budget needed to accomplish our goals and put out a top quality product that we and the entire game industry can be proud of. They don't believe in the culturally artistic significance of video game music and they don't believe that people are interested in listening after the game is turned off.  And that's where YOU come in!\n\nThis project is open for funding for EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE in the world!  We will ship anywhere and there will be absolutely no region coding, etc.  PAL versions of the DVD/Blu-Ray will be made.\nVideo Games Live: Level 3 will be the 3rd album of symphonic & rock video game music from the award winning 10 year+ world touring Video Games Live concert series.\n\nThe album will be recorded in a world famous recording studio with a 60 - 72+ piece orchestra, 60+ person choir and full rock band consisting of world famous game composers from around the world.\n\nEach music segment in Video Games Live is personally arranged and orchestrated by the original composers and also uses input from the actual game designers & producers and game developers & publishers.\n\nThe album track list will consist of NEVER BEFORE RELEASED Video Games Live music arrangements from potential game franchises such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim, Journey, Monkey Island, Destiny, DOTA, Assassin's Creed, Earthworm Jim, Silent Hill, Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Mass Effect, Katamari Damacy, World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, BioShock, Beyond Good & Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Street Fighter II, Uncharted, Portal, Tetris, Red Dead Redemption, Devil May Cry, Megaman, Soul Calibur, Resident Evil, Pac-Man AND MORE! (final setlist to be contingent on game publisher approval). The goal is to have between 15 - 18 tracks on the album.

Here is just a small sampling of some of the people whose work will be featured on VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3!\n\nWe want to film the new Blu-Ray/DVD/motion picture in Latin America during our big tour beginning at the end of September (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico City).  The fans in Latin America are VERY loud, VERY excited and VERY passionate about Video Games Live.  Here is just a small taste of what it is like at a Video Games Live show in Latin America!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe album will take at least 2 full studio days to record.  An orchestral recording of this nature is based on 3 hour sessions.  We will need a total of FOUR 3 hour sessions (12 hours total).  Salary costs for top of the line highly skilled orchestra musicians range between $350 - $500 per person per 3 hour session.  For a 72 piece orchestra the cost for a 2 day session (just for the musicians) can easily reach $125,000 - $150,000.  Choir is another big consideration and choir budgets can widely vary anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $20,000.  A top-of-the-line recording studio (including ALL costs) will be approximately $5,000 per day ($10,000 total).  Mixing with a top Hollywood film (& game) audio engineer (one week including studio and assistants) = approximately $15,000.  Mastering will take place at the most famous Mastering Studio in Hollywood (Bernie Grundman's) by one of the most highly regarded mastering engineers in the business... Patricia Sullivan. Patricia has personally worked with and mastered films by John Williams (including Star Wars & Indiana Jones films), James Newton Howard, James Horner, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Mark Isham.  Mastering budget for this type of project could go upwards to $7,500.  Other parts of the budget will include things like Album Art ($5,000), CD manufacturing based on 7,500 initial units ($5,000), Music Licensing/Mechanical Licensing to the Game Publishers, composers, right holders, etc. based on 7,500 initial units ($15,000), Kickstarter & Amazon fees (10% = $25,000), hiring of a PR firm in both North America and Europe, Shipping & Handling of goods, added physical products at certain tier levels, etc.\n\nMusicians (symphony & choir) = $130,000 - $160,000\nRecording Studio = $10,000\nMixing = $15,000\nMastering = $7,500\nAlbum Art/Liner Notes = $5,000\nCD Manufacturing = $5,000\nMusic Licensing/Publishing/Mechanicals = $15,000\nKickstarter/Amazon fees = $25,000\nProject PR (Worldwide) & Marketing (Advertising) = $15,000\nDomestic U.S. Shipping & Handling of Rewards = $5,000\nPhysical Reward products (hats, print-outs, keychains, etc.) = $12,500\nLocation Rental & Celebration Events = $5,000\nTOTAL = Approximately $275,000\n\nVideo Games Live is not making any money from this project.  Our goal is to continue doing what we love and bringing it to the people who care (as well as introducing game music to people who don't!)  In fact, Video Games Live and Tommy Tallarico will be personally helping to fund the project outside of the Kickstarter campaign.  The initial $250,000 does NOT cover all of the expenses associated with the project.\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray.  Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994 with Capitol Records) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since.  This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\nThe main idea behind our project is to give back as much as possible to donors by AT LEAST QUADRUPLING THE VALUE of the amount pledged!  You can also view our epically long REWARDS VIDEO below that details, shows and explains all of the different Tiers (Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers as they were not available when the video was created).\n\nRewards Video:\nNOTE: Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers or the STAGE 1-3 tier or WARP ZONE 2 as they were not available when the video was created.\n\nHere's a handy text based matrix for all the Reward Tiers!

Upon funding of this goal, EVERYONE who pledges will get a special and exclusive digital version of this documentary (we ask our fans to please NOT publish this publicly out of respect for the people who backed the project).\n  $750,000 - A live full length feature film and documentary of the music, making-of, interviews with composers/designers, history of game music, etc. to be recorded during the upcoming Video Games Live Latin America tour taking place this fall.  If we hit the $750,000 stretch goal then all tiers from $25 and up will receive a digital version of the film and all tiers from $40 and up will include a physical Blu-Ray/DVD combo of the movie!\n\nTO BE CLEAR... The VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3 album will be a studio recording and NOT a live recording.  The movie on the other hand WILL be a live video recording (and documentary) of a number of shows filmed in Latin America.  Depending on funding and stretch goals, we may include a special download album of the live recordings from the film as well.\nThe main goal of Tommy Tallarico (23 year video game composer veteran and creator/producer of Video Games Live\u2122) has always been to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become as well as helping to usher in a whole new generation of people to appreciate the arts.\n\nPlease watch this very informative and important video that will give you incredible insight as to what goes on in creating such an event and the passion behind it (courtesy of Game Informer).\nIncorporated in 2002, Video Games Live\u2122 is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having already performed over 275 shows in 27 countries on 5 continents. Over 1 million people have experienced the show live. Video Games Live\u2122 has previously released 2 albums worldwide (both of which debuted in the Billboard Top 10) as well as an award winning full length feature DVD/Blu-Ray. In 2010 the show aired nationally on PBS and quickly became one of the top rated PBS Specials of all time. Video Games Live\u2122 continues to break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\nPress Quotes\n\"Captivating!

As one of the most successful video game composers in history, he has helped revolutionize the gaming world, creating unique audio landscapes that enhance the video gaming experience.  He is considered the person most instrumental in changing the game industry from bleeps & bloops to real music now appreciated worldwide by tens of millions of fans.  As a well-recognized on-air television personality, live performer and composer, Tommy brings his in-depth knowledge, years of experience, and love of cutting edge multimedia and video games to the masses.  Tommy has worked in the gaming industry as a designer, product manager, producer, writer, games tester and heads of both music and video departments.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Tallarico has been writing music for video games for more than 23 years.  He has won over 50 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles; to date, they total sales of more than 100 million units and over four billion dollars in revenue.  No one in the history of the video game industry has ever worked on more titles and projects.  In 2008, he was enshrined in the Guinness Book of World Records with a two page feature article and interview and currently holds 3 Guinness World Records including the person who has worked on the most commercially released video games.  In 2012 during the Game Developers Conference he received a Lifetime Achievement Award and is also in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for his contributions to the game industry.  In 1994, he founded Tommy Tallarico Studios, the multimedia industry's largest audio production house.    Tommy is a cousin of rock star legend Steven Tyler (nee Tallarico) and in 2002 Tallarico\u2019s music was used as the opening song for Aerosmiths' \u201cGirls of Summer\u201d world tour.  His top titles include Earthworm Jim, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Disney\u2019s Aladdin, Spider-Man and Metroid Prime as well as top selling popular game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Madden Football, Mortal Kombat, Time Crisis, Unreal, Lineage, James Bond, Blitz Football, Knockout Kings, Test Drive, Scooby Doo, WWE & Twisted Metal. His score for Advent Rising has been noted as \"one of the greatest musical scores of all time\" by websites such as Yahoo, Gamespot and others.\n\nTallarico has been featured on numerous national and international television shows, appearing repeatedly on CNN, FOX and MTV.  Tommy hosted, wrote and co-produced the top rated and very popular Reviews on the Run/Judgment Day television show as well as the longest running award-winning video game television show, The Electric Playground (www.elecplay.com), which has been on the air since 1997.  The show is syndicated worldwide and airs daily in prime-time.  The Electric Playground won the 2001 Telly Award for \u201cBest Entertainment Cable Program\u201d.  In 2006, Tommy hosted and helped to launch the worldwide Championship Gaming Series for DirecTV.  His national television debut came in 1994 when he was featured and asked to guest host ABC's \"In Concert\" television program which included artists Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren.  From 1991 to 1994, he headed Virgin Interactive\u2019s music and video division, and executive produced numerous video game green screen shoots for films including \u201cDemolition Man\u201d where he worked with Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Hollywood producer Joel Silver.\n\nIn 2002, Tallarico created the critically acclaimed Video Games Live (www.videogameslive.com), an immersive, audio and video concert experience celebrating video games.  Video Games Live features music from the greatest video games performed by top orchestras and choirs around the world combined with synchronized video footage, lasers, lights, special effects, interactivity and live action to create an explosive and unique one-of-a-kind entertainment experience.  Video Games Live is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having performed over 250 shows in 25 countries on 5 continents.  The debut performance was launched on July 6th, 2005 at the world famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic.  Over 11,000 people attended making it the biggest video game concert in the world at that time (since then they have performed to over 40,000 people in places like Taiwan and China).  Most of the game music played during the initial launch of the show (Halo, Sonic, Warcraft, Tomb Raider, Myst, Kingdom Hearts, Tron, Advent Rising, etc.) had never been performed live anywhere in the world.  Since then over 1 million people have experienced the show live.  On October 30, 2005 they broke new ground once again by putting on the very first video game concert in Canada (Vancouver).  They followed with groundbreaking first ever game concert performances in countries such as Brazil, New Zealand, Spain, Mexico, England, Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Wales, United Arab Emirates & France.  Video Games Live was also the very first American video game concert to perform in Asia (Korea) and the first non-Japanese game concert to perform in Japan.  In 2007 they were recipients of a major industry award in Brazil for \"Special Breakthrough Achievement\" following their performances in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the year before.  Also in 2007 they helped to launch the $1.8 billion LA Live Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles and had their national television debut on Spike TV.  In 2008 they released the highly anticipated album entitled Video Games Live - Volume One, recorded at the world famous Abbey Road Studios in London, the album debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts.  It was the first video game compilation album to ever be released worldwide and won BEST SOUNDTRACK ALBUM awards from IGN.com and the Game Audio Network Guild.  In 2010 a 90 minute national PBS Special was aired in over 90 million households across America.  A Blu-Ray, DVD and album were released.  It was the first time that music from franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Sonic and Megaman were released outside of Japan.  The second album (entitled Video Games Live - Level Two) debuted at #8 on the Billboard Charts.  With literally 100\u2019s of ticket buyer reviews on Ticketmaster.com, Video Games Live boasts an impressive and outstanding 4.6 (out of 5) rating.   There are currently over 30,000 unique videos of Video Games Live performances on YouTube which total over 100 million views.  Sponsored and endorsed by some of the top corporations in the world, the Video Games Live concert event continues to tour the world, break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\n\nTallarico was the first musician to release a video game soundtrack worldwide (Tommy Tallarico\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. 1 \u2013 Capitol Records).  He has released over ten video game soundtrack albums since, including the highly acclaimed James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies, MDK and award-winning Advent Rising and Earthworm Jim Anthology.  Tommy was one of the first musicians to ever use live guitar and 3-D audio in a video game (The Terminator), and was instrumental in bringing true digital interactive multi-channel 5.1 surround to the gaming world.  He has performed and sold out shows on the biggest and most prestigious stages in the world including London's Royal Festival Hall and Hammersmith Apollo, the Olympic Park Stadium in Korea, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., WolfTrap, Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Pan-Chiao Stadium in Taipei, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and multiple shows at the Hollywood Bowl attended by tens of thousands of fans.  In 2004 he performed the grand finale music act on national and worldwide television (E! Entertainment, G4TV) with BT & Mobius 8 for the G-Phoria awards show.  In 2007 he performed along with Kid Rock and the Foo Fighters during the nationally televised Spike TV Video Game Awards show.\n\nTommy is the founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), which is a non-profit organization educating and heightening the awareness of audio for the interactive world (www.audiogang.org).  With over 2,500 members representing over 35 countries since its inception in 2002, G.A.N.G. has quickly become known as one of the strongest and best examples of helping the game industry community.  Tommy is an Advisory Board member for the Game Developers Conference, a Governor for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS/GRAMMY's), a spokesperson for the Entertainment Consumers Association, a proud member of the International Game Developers Association and a nominating peer panel leader for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nTommy is involved in many community, non-profit, scholastic and charitable organizations which include the Hollywood Arts and GRAMMY In The Schools.  In 2007, Tommy's many charitable works were recognized by the Hollywood Arts organization when they chose him as the first honoree and recipient for their now annual Dream Awards.  The IDG video game industry white paper mentions Tommy (along with Bill Gates) as one of the people who contributed the most to the advancement and growth of the industry in 2003.  In 2009, he received the prestigious \"Ambassador Award\" during the Game Developers Choice Awards which was only the 2nd time the award had ever been bestowed.  That same year he was chosen as one of the Top 50 Game Industry People by Game Developers Magazine.\n\nBorn February 18, 1968 and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, he moved to Southern California on his own at age 21 to pursue a career in entertainment.  Homeless with no means of financial support, Tommy was discovered in a music store and started working in the video game industry within 3 days of arriving in California.  All 4 of his grandparents came to America from Italy in the early 1900's and instilled a great sense of hard work, compassion, appreciation, passion, dreaming, creativity, sense of accomplishment and love for others that he has carried with him his entire life.  Tommy is a proud vegan and has been a spokesperson, supporter and contributor for many animal rights organizations.  In his spare time he enjoys nature, photography, traveling, cooking, video games, comic books, backgammon, being a kid and meeting new people.  His popular website www.tallarico.com has received over 250 million hits by more than 10 million unique users.\nHere is the video of Tommy's recent TED talk explaining the cultural significance of video games and they're importance as art.\nTommy playing Intellivision circa 1982", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released award winning PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray. Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since. This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\n\nBecause we have done this same kind of project multiple times in the past, we know exactly what the challenges for this project are (and how to overcome them). The toughest part in doing the project will be to get the game publishers approvals for the project. That being said, Video Games Live was the FIRST in the world to officially perform music from game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Warcraft, Sonic, Myst, Tron, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, StarCraft, Diablo, Civilization, God of War, Skyrim, BioShock, Mass Effect, Silent Hill, Shadow of the Colossus, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Tetris, Earthworm Jim, Journey, DOTA, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny, Monkey Island and MANY MORE! Video Games Live was also the FIRST to license music and synchronized video for an album and DVD/Blu-Ray release outside of Japan from companies such as Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami and Sega!\n \nVideo Games Live creator/producer Tommy Tallarico has been in the industry for over 23 years and has worked on over 300 video games (a Guinness World Record!). He has worked with and created games with every major publisher and game developer over the years. This is one of the main reasons why Video Games Live is able to get so many approvals and why it is the only show in the world with so many different games by so many different publishers and developers. But it is still a long process that has many time challenges. In order to get the album/motion picture out within the targeted time-frame (February 18, 2014) sacrifices to the preferred setlist may need to be made. This is part of the reason why ALL of the tracks listed in the description section will be sought after.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "LEVEL 6 Album finished!

Strongman is my all-new creator-owned adventure series that tells two-fisted tales of an original pulp hero, whose exploits stretch from the Gilded Age of Teddy Roosevelt and Nikola Tesla, through the Roaring 20s, into the Dust-Bowl 30s, and beyond. This project will take the form of an anthology of legends, each revolving around circus athlete and adventurer Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2014 a Depression-era strongman who doubles as a pulp hero. Bron travels the world with his companions in the Strange Bros. Circus, righting wrongs, and defending the downtrodden against all sorts of foes \u2014 from the criminal, to the supernatural. Tonally, Strongman draws on some of our favorite stories and characters for inspiration. It blends light-hearted action and globe-trotting adventure with vintage pulp crime drama, and gothic, mystical horror. Fans of H.P. Lovecraft, Lester Dent\u2019s Doc Savage, Jack Kirby\u2019s In The Days Of The Mob, Windsor McKay\u2019s Little Nemo, Todd Browning\u2019s Freaks, and Siegel and Shuster\u2019s Superman, will all find something new to love in Strongman.\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es Strongman?\n\u00a1Hola, soy Jon Bogdanove! Strongman es mi propia serie totalmente nueva que cuenta las aventuras a pu\u00f1o limpio de un original h\u00e9roe sensacionalista, cuyas haza\u00f1as van desde la Edad Dorada de Teddy Roosevelt y Nikola Tesla, a trav\u00e9s de los fabulosos 20\u2019s, pasando por los \u00e1ridos 30\u2019s, y m\u00e1s all\u00e1. Este proyecto tendr\u00e1 la forma de una antolog\u00eda de leyendas, cada una girando en torno al atleta y aventurero de circo, Bronislav \u201cBron\u201d Bellman \u2013 un fortach\u00f3n de la era de la Depresi\u00f3n que tiene una doble vida como h\u00e9roe sensacionalista. Bron viaja alrededor del mundo con sus compa\u00f1eros en el Circo \u201cHermanos Bizarro\u201d, defendiendo a los oprimidos ante todo tipo de enemigos/maleantes \u2013 desde los criminales hasta los supernaturales. Tem\u00e1ticamente, Strongman recuerda algunas de nuestras historias favoritas y personajes que nos han inspirado. Mezcla acci\u00f3n ligera, con aventuras errantes, drama criminal cl\u00e1sico, y horror m\u00edstico y g\u00f3tico. Los fans de H.P. Lovecraft, Doc Savage de Lester Dent, En Los D\u00edas De La Mafia de Jack Kirby, El peque\u00f1o Nemo en el Pa\u00eds de los sue\u00f1os de Windsor McKay, Fen\u00f3menos de Todd Browning, y el Superman de Siegel y Shuster; encontrar\u00e1n algo nuevo que amar en Strongman. \nA sample page in various stages: from thumbnail to ink wash before color and lettering is applied.\nI\u2019m very grateful for DC and Marvel. It was an immense honor and my lifelong dream to contribute to Superman. I was also blessed to work at Marvel in a time of tremendous freedom and creativity. But the stakes were low in the comics business when I first started. It still felt like it did when I was a kid. There was a closer connection between fans and creators. It felt like we were all in it together. I want to bring this new project to Kickstarter because I believe in the direct relationship between readers and authors. That's what Kickstarter offers and that's what appeals to me the most. There's total creative freedom to explore and experiment with new ideas, but the comics won\u2019t happen unless fans want it to. The readers are literally invested in the creativity. It is the purest, most democratic hope for new concepts and enterprises. We can go right to the readers and fans, and say 'Hey guys, this is what we want to do.' And if people are excited, they can make it a reality in a very direct way \u2014 person to person.\n\u00bfPorqu\u00e9 Kickstarter?\nKickstarter es una forma segura de financiamiento para que los artistas saquen adelante sus proyectos. Sabemos que muchas personas tienen miedo de comprar por internet o s\u00f3lo quieren saber que pasa si el proyecto no llega a la meta. Aqu\u00ed entra el encanto de Kickstarter. Si el proyecto alcanza la cantidad deseada para hacerse realidad, se cobra la cantidad exacta que donaste a trav\u00e9s de Amazon Payments (\u00a1Totalmente seguro!). Si desafortunadamente no se llega a esto, a ti no se te cobra ni un centavo, es decir, \u00a1no hay manera de perder!\nLe estoy muy agradecido a DC y a Marvel. Fue un inmenso honor y el sue\u00f1o de toda mi vida contribuir en Superman. Tambi\u00e9n fui bendecido al trabajar para Marvel en una \u00e9poca de tremenda libertad y creatividad. Pero hab\u00eda poco en riesgo cuando yo estaba empezando, todav\u00eda se sent\u00eda como cuando yo era ni\u00f1o. Hab\u00eda una conexi\u00f3n m\u00e1s cercana entre fans y creadores, se sent\u00eda como si estuvi\u00e9ramos juntos en esto. Quiero traer este nuevo proyecto a Kickstarter porque creo en la relaci\u00f3n directa entre lectores y autores. Eso es lo que ofrece Kickstarter y lo que m\u00e1s me atrae. Hay una total libertad creativa para explorar y experimentar con nuevas ideas, pero los comics no van a existir a menos que lo quieran los fans. Los lectores est\u00e1n literalmente invirtiendo en la creatividad. Es la esperanza m\u00e1s pura y democr\u00e1tica para nuevos conceptos e iniciativas. Podemos ir directo con los lectores y fans y decir \u201cHola chicos, esto es lo que queremos hacer\u201d. Y si a la gente le emociona, pueden hacerlo realidad de manera directa, de persona a persona.\nLa meta final es tener 200,000 d\u00f3lares para poder cumplir este proyecto de principio a fin. Para poder llegar a esto, necesitamos aproximadamente a 4000 personas alrededor del mundo. Necesitamos toda la ayuda que sea posible. Incluso si no puedes cooperar, \u00a1corre la voz! \u00a1Tal vez alguien que t\u00fa conozcas pueda!\nThe Characters of Strongman: (from left to right) \u2014 Bella \"The Ball\" Akiyama / Rolly \"Tynamo\" Beaudine / Luminitsa \"The Flaming Angel\" Angelo / Adelita \"The Wolf Girl\" Aceves / Woolcott \"The Mammoth\" / and Bronislav \"Kettle\" Bellman - A.K.A Strongman\nIt is very important for us to be able to pay our awesome colorist, letterer, and background assistants a professional living wage, comparable with what Marvel or DC would pay them for their time \u2014 to help support livable rates for working artists everywhere. Plus, we want to create 150 entirely new pages of comics \u2014 which include all new characters based on the likenesses of our backers!  From start to finish, Strongman will take about a year to complete, with everyone working full time. We are relying on your support to raise enough money to keep us employed for the time it will take to produce this amazing collection. Plus, a large portion will go towards the costly printing and distribution of the final graphic novel, and the other awesome rewards! Strongman will take everything we've got!\n\u00bfA d\u00f3nde ir\u00e1 el financiamiento?\nEs muy importante para nosotros el poder pagarle a nuestro asombroso colorista, al letrista, y a los asistentes de fondo un pago profesional decente, comparable con lo que DC o Marvel les pagar\u00eda por su tiempo; para apoyar un sueldo justo para artistas trabajando en cualquier parte. Adem\u00e1s, queremos crear 150 p\u00e1ginas de comic completamente nuevas \u2013 \u00a1que incluyen personajes nuevos basados en la imagen de nuestros patrocinadores!

Unlike our work on Superman and other similar franchises, this project does not come with a rich existing canon, or ready fan recognition to fall back on. Instead we're creating a mythos and a cast of characters whole-cloth. Each creative decision will have far-reaching implications to the characters and the world. The consequences of taking a misstep are greater. However, if we communicate frequently with our backers throughout the process, we can get direct feedback from readers in a way that is not possible in mainstream comics.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Fancif Arts\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nFancif Arts is a creative collaboration between comic book artist/writer Jon Bogdanove, writer/producer Chris Faiella, and writer/director...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Results of The La Mole Promotional Are In!", "update_content": "Swing on over to www.facebook.com/StrongmanComic to find out who gets a custom figure!\nBest,\nJ,C, and K"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Thanks and Next Steps", "update_content": "Hello Stalwart Backers!\nFirst off, thank you to everyone who has supported this project so far!

Personally, my introduction was from the classic Disney animated movie.  Most of us have seen the Kevin Costner or Russell Crowe versions as well, but I realized that I have never seen an updated version: a modern-day Robin Hood, where he doesn't exactly \"rob from the rich to give to the poor,\" as the saying goes, but he instead steals medical supplies and gives them to those in need, or those who can't afford them or have no health insurance.  I am sure a lot of people can identify with how expensive health care is in the U.S. these days, and this comic book is a commentary on this, and other, issues.  But don't be fooled, it's also a straight-up adventure story that, hopefully, captures the spirit of the Robin of old.\nCreating comics is a costly venture these days. I wrote the words, but the true masters bring it to life; the artists, letterers, colorists, and cover artists (industry stalwarts Jason Baroody and Mark McKenna) all did amazing work on the book, and should be paid accordingly.  In fact, here's a tasty preview of the cover to issue #1, done by Baroody and McKenna and colored by John Hunt:\nCover art for issue #1\nThere are also printing, distribution, production and other assorted costs  That is where you come in!  If this Kickstarter project is funded, I will pay the creators, and hopefully earn enough to create future issues.  If that happens, then the next goal is a four-issue series which can be collected into a trade paperback edition.  Beyond that?  Hopefully many, many more adventures for Robin Hood and his modern-day merry men.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I said above, I wrote the words to the comic, but that is just step one. There are many cogs in the wheel, and not just involving the creative process. There are printing delays, production issues, promoting the book, and many more obstacles that can get in the way. If issues do arise, the simple thing would be to say, \"Stick with it.\" But that goes without saying, as I have been working on this for four years now. But there real solution is to find another way. Use the web to promote your book (I have a comic book podcast that may come in handy!), find another printer, or another colorist, whatever it takes.

For those who are unaware (and until last week, I could count myself in that group), a black & white comic, which this is, still needs a colorist to add grey tones to it, to give it body.

For every pledge, share and simple video watch you have helped us reach our goal.\nChaos Hour is a non-profit Geek Lifestyle e-zine based out of South Wales in the United Kingdom. \nWe specialize in Video Game, Film, Comic Book, Sci-Fi & Fantasy Literature and Hardware News, Reviews and Articles. Conceptualized by Padraig Balch in 2010, Chaos Hour has gone from strength to strength since its launch in March of 2011 at Cardiff Comic and Animation Expo.\nReaching a worldwide audience of 1500 - 5000 unique visitors every day, Chaos Hour is committed to bringing unique content, entertainment and informative articles to its loyal fan base.\nHowever, in order to continue to grow as both an online community and centre for geek related entertainment and information, Chaos Hour need to improve their website. \nAnd this is where we need you...\nWith your help and financial support we will be able to advance Chaos Hour into a much more user friendly website; advancing our search system, tagging and organization as well as fixing numerous issues from image uploading and site customization to additional pages and formatting. The advanced site structure will allow us more time to focus on gaining unique content, supporting our writing team and of course creating more of those competitions our fans have learned to love so much.\nSo where would your money go?\nTaking Care Of Business\nWhen Chaos Hour began it was very much a bedroom project and while it may look professional at the moment, much of the back end of the website is still very much unfinished making even the simplest of tasks such as tagging, editing, image uploading and formatting, very difficult if not impossible. With your support we will be able to improve the website to an organized and structured professional standard making it much more user friendly for the staff and audience alike.\nPromoting Independent Projects\nChaos Hour are avid supporters of independent film, publishing and video game projects; championing crowd funded campaigns such as Afterlife Inc, Melksham Comic Con and Stiffs among many others; having written detailed features on their projects at the time of fundraising, theming the site around their project and creating banner ads for them.\nWith an improved layout and image uploading system we will be better able to advertise and promote fellow independent projects through graphics, banner ads, illustrated articles and even a \u2018Supporting\u2019 feature - showing a project Chaos Hour are currently supporting via crowd funding who we believe you should support in turn.\nEntertainment\nSince founding our Twitch project earlier in the year, Chaos Hour have finally found an outlet for their need to entertain. While the website has been host to many competitions and giveaways, we would like to advance our entertaining reach to YouTube videos and programming, Podcasts and online comics. With your support we will be able to integrate more advanced image uploading onto our site allowing us the ability to publish online comic strips and fan art competitions. If we reach an amount over our target goal, we will be able to afford better audio and video recording equipment and editing software so that we can better improve our YouTube channel branching out into weekly talk shows, live interviews and even sketch shows.\nSocial Media Integration\nWhile we have managed to create a thriving Facebook, Twitter and Twitch community, it is hardly evident on our site. With your help we will be able to better intergrate our social media accounts into our website making us able to better promote our writers, articles, competitions and giveaways.\nTwitch Stream\nAs well as the website itself, Chaos Hour have recently branched out into Live Streaming on Twitch.TV and, since launching the CH Stream in April of this year, have grown a loyal fan base of over 1,800 followers, over 200,000 page views, and an average viewership of 100 people per night. If we go over our target goal, subsequent funding will go towards improving our Twitch stream with better audio and visual equipment as well as editing programs to make better video adverts which you can utilize in our advertisers packages to help promote your business; and we can use to help promote the content on the website.\nCompetitions\nFor the last two years Chaos Hour has been funding all of its competitions out of its own pocket without any income for the site itself. This has included giving away free video games, DVDs, tickets to events, DLC codes, Exclusive Game Content and even Riot Points and In Game currency for MMORPGs. Overall this has cost Chaos Hour over \u00a32500 With your support we will be able to boost our website Search Engine Optimization as well as offering banner advertisements and advertising packages to our audience, which will help the website fund itself. This money would be able to go straight back into funding our competitions and giveaways, benefiting you - the Chaos Hour audience.\nA Site Built By Writers For Writers\nWorking with new and emerging writers, Chaos Hour gives budding journalists the chance to see their work published on a professional site while reaching a high viewership. With your help we will be able to implement a better search and tagging system allowing our writers to better show off their work via their own personal \u2018Writer\u2019s Page\u2019 or portfolio of work. Writers for the site will also be given \u2018achievement\u2019 style rewards for writing a certain amount of articles/on a certain day of the year, etc... While the site remains a voluntary project for our writers, this will make it much more fun and rewarding for them.\nFINAL HOURS EXCLUSIVE REWARDS\nGENERAL REWARDS & PERKS\nThis project was helped by www.kickingitforward.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re confident that should our Kickstarter project get funded, we\u2019ll be able to significantly improve our website almost immediately.

As Chaos Hour is already live, any changes that will be made to the site will be visible to the backers almost immediately. We will also be communicating heavily with our funders to let them know exactly where their contributions are being spent.\n\nIn regards to rewards featuring the work of artists, crafters and independent business (such as comic books, films etc) and items which need to be signed, we will endeavor to get these out to backers as soon as they are available to us from the various individuals. However, we will be attempting to collect all items at least a week before the funding deadline (if it looks like we will be successful, of course) so that we can try to get them out to our backers ASAP.\n\nIf your reward package calls for a custom made item, i.e. an art commission or sketch card, these will take a little bit longer to get to you as we will be waiting on the artist. However, we plan to get these out as quickly as we can.\n\nAdvertising packages will be available as soon as the new and improved website is up and running and we have communicated with the backers to discuss their objectives and received their graphics. If they wish to use their packages at a later date (E.g. If some one has purchased a month\u2019s worth of the site theme and wish to use it the month that their book/film/comic/game is coming out, we will be happy to delay your request until that time.)

Sixcess Core was previously kickstarted and is debuting at Gen Con this year. (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1299187159/sixcess-core-rulebook) Promised Sands utilizes the Sixcess rules, but is easily converted to other game systems.\n\u201cA lot of fun. Interesting settings and this was my first D6 based game. I enjoyed it immensely.\u201d Glen Elliott, GenCon 2012\nThe World at a Glance: Promised Sands\nPromised Sands is a dark, desert fantasy with post-apocalyptic overtones. The world is called \"T'nah\" by the peoples who live there. T\u2019nah is a harsh, intense place. It is not for the faint of heart.\nHundreds of years ago, the great, globe spanning Renizant empire faded into obscurity. It endured for over 2500 years. Nearly all living memory of the Renizant empire has faded, yet there are still vestiges of its power and peoples in the wastelands. Their Trade Guild holds tenaciously to the fading power of the Renizant.\nSince the fading of the Renizant, many have attempted to fill the vacuum of power, managing some regional success. The Ch'ak - fierce warriors who carved out an empire - have receded back to their Citadel since they fell into the worship of the Troog. The religion of the Troog has blunted their advancement, but has not dulled their ferocity.\nThe Skulae, passive \"rulers\" of the wasteland, have a trading \"empire\" that rivals the Trade Guild. Where the Guild exerts force and domination to achive their ends, the Skulae exercise freedom and anarchy - where no law constrains trade or social expression.\nThe Andw'ahr farmers and field workers, toiling in the shadow of the mighty Drachen-riders, whose famed beasts appear as both creature and machine. The Jaan and Aij'ak, locked in their perpetual dance in the skies keep to the glacial wastes, yet they, too, feel the calling of the vacuum of power.\nSylvan in their rumored forests surrounding vast water riches and the Ebon Syl in their caves yearn to expand and control. While the ubiquitous Rolen build, wander and entertain for any who have the 'quid.\nAnd the Dry Denizens, who have colonized the western shores, explore the lands \u2013 reporting back their findings (but to whom?). They have an insatiable desire to collect otec from every corner of the world \u2013 and they understrand it! But strangest of all their tales are those of the people in the domed cities under the sea, whom they call the \"Wet Denizens\".\nThe Troog are a peaceful, peace-loving, diminutive race, distantly related to the fierce and ferocious Sylvan.\nIt is not just the racial divides that exist in Promised Sands, but the cultural diversity within each of the races that defines a character.\nWhether a wandering Skulae who accepts everyone - or a determined and bigotted Ch'ak who refuses any who are not of their breed - or a Sylvan who would just as soon run an arrow through a non-Sylvan as she would a maridh.\nInto this mix, toss in ancient technologies, blood feuds between the horse-like Loshad and the cat-like Myrlihk and the rise of the supposed and presumptuous \"ancient ones\" who have established colonies on the western shores.\nThere are two types of magic and technology that spans the stone-age to firearms (though centered firmly in the archaic iron-age). It is a world in need of rebuilding.  The crumbling glory of ancient cultures who survived the Scourge, who rose form the ashes fo the Maroc Wars, who tamed the devastated globe - and then faded away.\nThis is a world where alliances shift with the sands and if you have access to water, you guard it jealously.\nThere is also a secret to the world - a history that is long forgotten. A time before even the great Renizant empire.\nBefore the Maroc wars...\nBefore the Scourge...\nPromised Sands is a rich tableau of cultural, racial, technological diversity upon which to feast. It is foreign and unique, a world unlike any you have ever seen. A place where the familiar blends with the unfamiliar and the alien to produce a unique setting.\nPromised Sands uses the Sixcess system as it's gaming core - but is easily adapted to other game systems.\nBased on the Sixcess Core System\nPromised Sands is a gameworld, not a system. It showcases the might and majesty, the beauty and darkness, the societies and the cultures \u2013 and the dark, shadowy underbelly \u2013 of T'nah. The world is rich and full of life, and all the things that prey upon that life. T'nah is a place of warring cultures, vying for control in the vacuum of an ancient empire that spanned thousands of years.  Yet beneath that civilization are the remnants of even older cultures lost in the ancient histories and legends.\nWe used the Sixcess system to bring this world to life. Although stats and mechanical references tie it to the Sixcess system, it is easily converted to any system. The system does not define the world. Rather, Promised Sands breathes life into whatever game system is used.\nWe offer the Sixcess system as an option in the Tiers if you would like to play Promised Sands in its native system. \nOur intent is to provide online support allowing Promised Sands to be used by whatever system you prefer. Just remember that we are not experts in every system and are not intent on perfectly emulating Sixcess in conversions. Each system that uses Promised Sands should have its own flavor in how the world is experienced.\nIf you want to try Promised Sands in its native mechanic, however, we\u2019re more than happy to help you out!\nHow does Sixcess play?\nThe Sixcess (6S) is a universal system for role playing games of any genre. It is a d6 dice-pool system. Typically dice-pools range from 4-10 dice\u2014it is rare for more than 10 dice to be tossed in a single roll. It is easy to learn for all ages, for new and experienced role-players. Sixcess plays quickly to allow for maximum role-playing story elements, and yet is nuanced enough to satisfy the crunchiest of dice crunchers out there.\nSixcess is based around a pairing of Attribute and Skill ranks to provide the dice-pool. Each die that meets or beats a defined Target Number is considered a \u201cSixcess\u201d. Sixcesses are broken into two types: Ticks and Marks. Marks are the best results and provide an extra (or \u201cexploding\u201d) die to be added to the test. This allows for even the lowest skills and weakest attributes to have a chance for glorious success. It also means that pushover opponents can become lethal assailants with the toss of a die!\nSixcess also incorporates a system for the players to take over the action from the GM to craft and mold the world in their own way. This is called \u201cDissonance\u201d and every player has a \u201cDISk\u201d to activate this capability. Some of the Tiers provide official DISks for you and your players to use.\n\u201cExtremely easy to pick up and play.\u201d Gregory S. Stines, GenCon 2012\n\u201cIt was really simple to learn, so we could jump right into things.\u201d Jeremiah Heady, GenCon 2012\n\"Sixcess is the most fun game I've ever played!\" Vera Moore, GenCon 2012\nIs it better for small or large groups?\nSixcess scales nicely to any size group. Smaller groups that stick together tend to play a little faster\u2014but this is true of nearly any gaming experience. Larger groups can accomplish more and give a larger, more \u201cepic\u201d feel, but they don\u2019t hamper gameplay at all nor overbalance the mechanic.\nFlexibility\nOne of the hallmarks of the Promised Sands (and the Sixcess system) is the flexibility. Players can use and manipulate the world (and the rules of the mechanic) to give their characters bonuses. You are not constrained to a narrowly defined corridor of character development. You can grow and enhance your character in any way that you choose.\nCharacters can be made in any combination of abilities that are desired. There are no classes and no levels. Gameworld-specific details may provide Backgrounds, Edges, Flaws or Qualities that nuance your choices, but there are no mechanical restrictions. If you want to play a Sylvan raised by Dry Denizens, you can. Exotic backgrounds are entirely feasible.\nSixcess provides a plethora of Backgrounds, Edges, Flaws and Qualities to breathe life into the character. Some have a mechanical effect; some simply enhance the roleplaying of the character. It\u2019s completely open-ended and up to the GM and players to use as they see fit.\nFormats\nWe\u2019re targeting the 8.5x11 inch \u201ctraditional\u201d book size \u2013 however, there was a lot of interest in a 6x9 version of Sixcess and we\u2019re working toward making all our books available in this format (which seems to work a little better on e-readers and mobile devices).\nPromised Sands is initially targeted as a 160-200 page gameworld with beautiful illustration. As additional stretch goals are reached, the page count grows\u2014so does the number and quality of the illustrations.\nWhat are the Backer Levels?\nNOTE: All levels from Comrade and higher receive an electronic copy of the Promised Sands GM Screen.\nA NOTE ABOUT COVER ART\nThere are four covers for two different products available.\n1) The Softback Promised Sands cover -- A painted cover that shows an action scene from the world of Promised Sands. (We have some character sketches of some of the figures who appear on this cover and a general idea of what it needs to look like, but it hasn't been commissioned, yet.)\n2) The Limited Edition Hardback Promised Sands Cover -- A minimalist cover that uses iconic imagery to capture the essence of the world. We have only a sketch of the cover at this point. *THIS IS A KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COVER.*\n3) The Gen Con Participant Limited Edition Hardback Promised Sands Cover -- Also a minimalist cover, but thematically designed to compliment the Gen Con Participant Limited Edition Hardback Sixcess Core (below).

You are specifically credited in the book for your creation.\nAre you considering this as a gift for Christmas/Hannukah/Yule/Saturnalia/Kwanzaa/Festivus/Holiday?\nWe had originally intended to fulfill this project by early December, so we could have it available for the holiday gift-giving season. However, due to unexpected delays in our previous project, we thought to extend the deadline by a couple months. \nWith this in mind, we are focusing on delivering by Christmas \u2013 but that is a \"stretch goal\" in itself. \nWe shall provide a certificate to anyone who would like to give Promised Sands as a holiday gift.  Just message us and let us know and we'll send out a certificate to you detailing the Backer level and Add-Ons that you selected for your gift.  Since this is a custom process, we can customize the message of the certificate. \nJust be sure to send us a message so we can get the process rolling with enough time for you to receive the certificate and wrap it up. \nWhat are the Stretch Goals?\nWe plan to reveal the stretch goals as we get closer and closer to the goal. \nThe first few stretch goals include new adventures, new characters and fiction by some familiar names in the gaming industry. As we get higher in the goals, we're planning to expand the game system to include a life-path character creation method, additional rules for Qai (one of the forms of magic) and an Otec Compendium. Other stretch goals include upgrading all printed copies to color, all printed copies to hardback and other niceties.\nHere are the first few planned Stretch Goals: \nFunding  Stretch Goal Unlocked\n4500       New characters and fiction by Todd Liukart\n5000       Adventure by Joseph Wolf\n5300       New Djezinti tribes by Brian Engard\n5500       Adventure by Cynthia Celeste Miller\n6000       Scorchlands expanded by Eddy Webb\n6500       Additional color artwork\n7000       Zombies by John Goff\nWe're also working on some stretch goals for the number of backers, but we'll announce those as we get closer to the goals. \nHow Far Along is Promised Sands?\nPromised Sands is coming out. That\u2019s all there is to it. It was extremely well-received in demos at various conventions. We ran 46 events at Gen Con 2012 \u2013 and are running 75 events at Gen Con 2013 for Sixcess (in various gameworlds, of which Promised Sands is featured).\nPromised Sands, as a world, was complete 10 years ago (2003).  You can find quite a few reviews for it online. Most of the reviews were extremely positive about the rich, interesting world and any issues centered on the complexities of the original game system.  Those are easily fixed with the new game system.  We're also taking to heart the points brought up about some of the complexities of the lingo for items in the world.\nThe writing for Promised Sands is completed except for some stretch goal material.  It was converted to Sixcess and playtested over the last year. We need to flesh out a few details, smoothe over the rough spots, re-edit the manuscript and include the artwork that brings it to life.\nWe've already engaged several artists to commission some new artwork for the book, but would like to expand in order to offer even more visually stunning images to bring Promised Sands alive. You can see some of the examples here, on our website and on our Facebook page. These are just the tip of the sand dune! We\u2019ve already talked to the artists who are on board and some others. As the stretch goals are reached, we shall commission more artwork (and more detailed artwork) to bring Promised Sands alive visually.\nThere are many unexplored places in Promised Sands \u2013 ancient civilizations that have faded long ago, seas that have yet to be sailed, coasts that have yet to be mapped.\nHow Can You Help?\nObviously, support the Kickstarter. If you want to do more, then spread the word. Share your interest in this vibrant world with others. Get them involved and supporting it. You can even talk to the developers about becoming a playtester, freelance writer or freelance artist.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur last project suffered delays because we didn't understand all the ramifications of the layout and design stage, nor the printing requirements of our printer. These delays can certainly be shortened, if not completely averted, with Promised Sands. \n\nThe manuscript is complete, but needs a re-edit -- which is in progress. \n\nThe project *will* happen -- it's only a question of time. We originally thought we could fulfill by December 2013 -- and we are striving toward that end.

We hope you find our new, improved, retooled campaign worthy of your support once again. \nIf you're new to The Last West, here's the deal in a nutshell:\nEvan Young and Lou Iovino, guys who write stories and love comic books, want to create a new comic. It's called The Last West and it's about all technological and social advancement having stopped in 1945, and one man's quest to discover why.\nIt's what would happen if you put Chinatown and Lost together and made the result into a Vertigo-type comic book. It's a smart and fun bit of alternate history noir, and we need your support to finish it.\nWant more details about the story?\nWatch the video, we explain it all!\nWant a sneak peek of the opening scene?\nKeep scrolling!\nWant to know our STRETCH GOALS?\nKeep scrolling! They're under the rewards!\nThis Kickstarter campaign will help us get the funds we need to wrap up Volume One, which encompasses the first 5 issues of this planned 10-issue series. Your funding will go to the art team for their roughs, pencils, inks, colors, and letters.\nYou may have noticed that this is indeed our second go-around on Kickstarter since we canceled our first drive a few months ago. So, what's new and what's different?\n- We've got a publisher now! We didn't when we started our first campaign, which is why we canceled it and restarted this one. It's Alterna Comics.\n- We have a schedule now! We didn't before. We start with the digital release of issue 1 in November.\nLike last time, we've got rewards that let you join in the fun of our project. The rewards are described on the right and below, so find one you like and please consider lending us your support. You can contribute $5 for a print copy of the first issue, or $35 for the Absolute Last West Volume One, or $350 for an original board, or... really, it's whatever you choose!\nFor more details about the art team, the rewards, and a sneak peek at the story, read on.\nAnd if you'd like even more details, check out our previous Kickstarter campaign here.

Rest assured that every one of us is fully committed to this project, and it's only the most dramatic unforeseen acts of nature that will get in our way.\n\nComics take work, and one of the risks of creating comics with a team of specialists is that delays at any one step in the process have a knock-on affect downstream. A delay in roughs will push back the pencils, which pushes back the inks, then the colors, and so on. Delays happen throughout the world of comics, and we will do everything we can to try to avoid them.

Ehart, Mile High Comics\nGreetings!\nI am so grateful for all the support for Mythica! The adventure that is Mythica is coming to life and everyone who supports this project isn\u2019t just helping to create the first 6-issues, but is helping me get to the ultimate goal of 36 to 40 books! Supporting Mythica means your helping create more books, greater distribution, increasing the fan base, creating more merchandise, and of course, increasing the speed that I can get the books into your waiting hands!\nThanks for being a part of my dream!\nMatt Campbell\nMythica issue 2\n\nStretch Reward!!-If we make it to $3500 everyone who pledged $40 or more will receive a copy of Mythica issue 4!!\nMythica is a comic book that I started brainstorming about ten years ago.  I had an idea for the story line, the characters, and the look I wanted for the book.  However, doing the pencils, colors, and writing is too much for one person so three years ago I partnered with writer, William Tooker.  William's descriptive horror writing has helped Mythica to become the more intricate story it is today, and has allowed me to focus more on what I truly love; the art.  I have been consistently working on Mythica ever since, and we have just completed our third issue.\n\nThere is so much more to getting a comic out there than writing it and drawing pictures and that's where my good friend McLain McGuire stepped in. McLain is the Editor in Chief of CCP comics in Austin, TX. I have worked on various projects with CCP over the last few years and when I told McLain what i was working on he was more than eager to help. Although CCP is still a young publishing company they have over a dozen different titles and now they are publishing Mythica. McLain also does the lettering (aka the word bubbles) for Mythica so you will see his name on the credits. Lastly, he is an awesome musician and, along with drummer Jason Boiling, created the music for the above video.\n So what is Mythica about you say?\nMythica follows the journeys of an eclectic group of strangers, who find themselves facing a demonic invasion during WWI; doubling the horrors of war.  At the heart of the story is how these individuals come together, become a family, and face incredible odds to save mankind.\n\nLike HBO or Showtime shows such as Spartacus or Game of Thrones, Mythica is rated for mature audiences due to not only the horrors of war but the even greater horrors that come with a demon invasion.\n\n\nKimberly Bradshaw\n\nThe story begins with a young Belgian girl named Kimberly Bradshaw.  As her country is being invaded, and her fiancee volunteers for the Red Cross, she finds herself dreaming of a golden-haired, Scottish warrior; Magnus MacDracken.  In Kim's dreams, Magnus and his Black Watch team find themselves facing terrible nightmarish creatures that have Kim screaming, and shaken when she awakes.  Her nightmares soon begin to invade her reality when people in her small town of Jabekke, are found mysteriously, and gruesomely murdered.\n\nMagnus MacDracken, is the captain of the Scottish Black Watch regiment.  In sneaking behind enemy lines, Captain MacDracken, and his crew suddenly come across a demonic beast that is unbelievably strong, and seemingly impossible to kill.  Magnus, determined to save his men, is finally able to slay the beast, but not before his entire regiment is slaughtered.  Distraught and alone, Magnus is left wondering why he survived unscathed; as if on cue an angelic being appears to answer his questions.\n\nLittle is known about Soradees, other than he is seen in Kimberly's dreams, coming to Magnus and telling him that he is the key to stopping the demonic invasion.  Soradees, needing Magnus to see the bigger picture, presents Magnus with a vision of a possible future, should he refuse the call. \n\nWWI wasn't just fought on the front lines; there was espionage, intrigue and spies. One of the first MI6 agents, Riley Scott; feisty, red-headed, and Irish, is among the best.  She's on a mission to find a genealogist named Gerbstad; who is believed to have been captured by the Germans.  Working with her partner, Rutherford, they soon find themselves in a Transylvanian castle, and discover an evil much more threatening than Germans.\nRiley Scott of Mythica\nWHAT THE MONEY WILL BE USED FOR?\nWe've been working on this project now for several years, and so far everything we've done has been out of our pocket, from sitting down and working out scripts to making the art.\nNow it's time to take it to the next level.

For now we are focusing on the production of the first six issues.\nWe're working to raise money to print the first three issues and help start the production of the next three. \nOur ultimate goal is to see Mythica nationally distributed and in stores all across the country and then around the world!

PLEASE READ THIS ARTICLE!\nhttp://mobile.thewrap.com/thewrap/db_/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=F6UyWtws&full=true#display\nSections: WINNER: Horror & WINNER: China\nChina film market is not the next big thing\u2026it's already big! Last years box office was close to $3 Billion! Pledges to our project will join us as we first go to Taiwan, then try to get our film distributed in China. If the Hollywood studios are bending over backwards to get into China, then independent filmmakers also need to start thinking about China. Join us and learn!\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION\n\"Dolls\" is similar in style and feel to \"The Shining\", which is arguably one of the scariest films ever made. Yes, there was blood\u2026a lot of it, but the scenes that really made your skin crawl, were like when Danny (the kid) is playing with his toys in the middle of the hallway, and the ball rolls into view. That was creepy\u2026but then he slowly walks down the hallway to Room 237\u2026music builds as he slowly reaches for the door handle, then suddenly, BANG! He changes his mind, and walks away. The build up in that scene keeps you right at the edge of your seat the whole time. This is \"Dolls\" in a nut shell. A terrifying horror film, that will keep you on the edge of your seat\u2026with a touch of evil.\nThe money we're asking for is the minimum amount we need to shoot the whole film in Taiwan. If we get more, we're just going to make it all that much better, with more dolly and special effects shots. Everything will be shot on the ARRI ALEXA in 4k. Just because it's a low budget film, doesn't mean we're going to skimp on the quality.\nRob Lee worked in entertainment advertising for 15 years in Hollywood, on print campaigns for over 100 feature films\u2026mainly on movie posters. His clients included Warner Bros, Columbia Pictures, Disney, Fox, and Universal Pictures. He's lived in China for the past 10 years working as an independent in the film industry. Rob has been in the film industry for a total of 25 years, so you can count on him as a professional, to get the project done.\nSHORT SYNOPSIS \nYang Yang, a new graduate, and her boyfriend Jin, move to the city from a small town, so that Jin can pursue his dream of being an actor. They quickly move into an unbelievably cheap, furnished apartment, which comes with only one catch\u2026nothing can be moved out. Jin finds two other tenants for the other rooms to help with the rent, Yin, a college student, and Xiao Liu, a young, hot girl, who's out drinking most nights. Soon after they move in, strange things begin to happen...all centered around a weird looking doll that Yang Yang discovers in the living room cabinet. The situation gets worse, as Yang Yang and Yin realize that the tattoo on the landlord's arm resembles an ancient Satanic symbol...\nCURRENT CAST\nVIVY YU\nOn July 14, 2013 Vivy Yu won first place in the Ms China World contest! She will represent China, in a major beauty contest later this year! Vivy is from Ankang in Shanxi Province, China. Ankang is near Xian, where the famous Terracotta soldiers were discovered. She began modeling at age 24, after attending college. Vivy just finished shooting scenes for her very first film, which was shot in Beijing, China. Before that, Vivy had also appeared in plays in China. She plays the drums, piano and flute, and paints in her spare time. She super talented!\nAt this time, Vivy is still confirmed to play one of the lead roles in \"Dolls\", but she may have to cancel later due to obligations for a major beauty contest in September, where she will represent China. We'll keep you posted!\nWHY SHOOT IN TAIWAN?\nThe goal of most filmmakers is to see their film on the big screen, but this is rarely the case. Many films go straight to video, or nowhere at all, and with HD cameras getting cheaper to rent and buy, the U.S. market is flooded with independent films.\n\nBy filming in Taiwan, we are almost assured of getting the film distributed, because of the director's distribution connections there, but it also opens up the opportunity to get into China. In recent years, China has become the second largest market in the world, but because of it's quota system, it's largely inaccessible to foreign films. As of now, only 34 foreign films are allowed into the market, unless the foreign company has a co-production deal with a local Chinese production company, which means they actually have to shoot part of their film in China. The exception to this rule is Taiwan. Taiwan production companies have no limit on the amount of films they export into China. Rob Lee also has distribution connections in Korea and Hong Kong. Our Kickstarter pledges will see the whole process! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks in making a film, even on the big budget films. The way that we plan to minimize our risks, is to keep our production simple and straight forward. A lot of mistakes happen because of location changes and set-ups. 90% of our film will be shot in just two apartments, very similar to the \"Paranormal Activity\" series. We'll also take approx. 28 days for the shoot, which is far more time than we need, so that we can stay well-organized.\n\nThe director has been a professional in the industry for 25 yrs, and is passionate about his work\u2026he's reliable and knows how to get the job done. His dream is to make a film, just like many others on Kickstarter\u2026so you can believe that he'll do whatever it takes to make it happen.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Robert A.

It also toppled Universal's Fast & Furious 6 from the top spot at the Chinese box office and boasted the second-highest opening day of the year for a Hollywood title after Iron Man 3.

It also has to open in Japan, Brazil and Spain. Pacific Rim has grossed roughly $240 million to date worldwide, a soft number considering its $200 production budget and likely $175 million global marketing spend. Legendary Pictures took the lead on the project, including putting up much of the money, and is still considering a sequel, although sources say WB won't be involved with a follow-up. (Legendary leaves the studio at the end of the year for its new co-financing and co-producing deal with Universal.)

We still have the freedom to make the film we want. And make the film that you guys want as well. \n\nOur goal is get back into pre-production mode, shoot the film in October, so we can have the film ready for distribution and in a theater near you in 2014. \n\nI've been working on this project for the pass two years, we've encounter a lot of obstacles along the way. But through out each of these hurdles that we've come across the cast, crew and Production team have not faltered. We have an amazing and talented team of Professionals on this film, a group of men and woman that I'm very honored to be working with. \n\nIf there are any delays in our schedule, because of scheduling of actors, permits to shoot in Austin - or the slightest little thing that may arise. We PROMISE from the bottom of our BLOODY HEARTS that YOU will be the FIRST to know. \n\nAll of your BLOODY goodies will be out to you by the dates that we have posted. If there was something that comes up that we couldn't meet a deadline that is listed, then we will let you know in advance on the delay. Which we hope doesn't happen. \n\nIf you're coming to visit us on set, we will keep you up to date on the schedule of the film, and coordinate a date and time for you to be there with us. If you're coming to an advance screening, we'll keep you in the loop for the actual date that it will happen.

Every layer of our production, from the music to the artwork, is held in accountability to one word: WONDER.\nWho We Are\nOur innovative team of artists and filmmakers includes animator Greg Peters who has worked on classics for Disney, Warner Bros., and Hannah-Barbera for nearly three decades. Writer/Director Jonathan Hal Reynolds is helming the team, and has invited longtime collaborator J.R. Fleming to create the background art for the film. British composer, Andy Dollerson, has scored the project, and voice artist Terry Anderson is serving as narrator.\nPre-Production Meeting for IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE? - Greg Peters, J.R. Fleming, and Jonathan Hal Reynolds (left to right)\nProject Status\nThe score for Is There Anyone Out There? has already been recorded by British composer Andy Dollerson and the Tosca String quartet, and the narration has been completed by voice artist Terry Anderson who has invented a wonderful narrator for our tale. You can listen to the entire narration and score here:\nTosca String Quartet recording the score for IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?\nWe are currently polishing up character designs and storyboards, and are revving up to begin work on the background art and character animation. Because we are using traditional 2D animation at 24 frames per second (e.g., Disney's Pinnochio, Don Bluth's Secret Of Nimh), our film will require over 4,300 frames of hand-drawn artwork. This will take our team an entire year to complete. \nPreliminary character design - IS THERE ANYONE OUT THERE?\nInvitation To Join Our Team\nWe invite you to be a part of our adventure in animation by supporting our project.

MORE COOL STUFF! As the final hour nears, here are some brand new prizes you might want to grab before it's too late:\nBehind the scenes documentary on Super 8 film! My creative collaborator Ross Meckfessel will be capturing the production of Uzi's Party in the most thematically appropriate way possible - experimentally, on small gauge film! Donors who pledge $5 will get a private link to stream the documentary.\nPossession Scenes risograph prints! I have a small run of 11x17 blow-up prints of the original drawings from Possession Scenes issues 1-3! Donors who pledge $20 may receive a set of three in the mail, hand-numbered and extra disturbing.\nRoommate's Guilty Rainbow LP with Plastic Crimewave screen print! I have been granted a few copies of one of my favorite albums to pass on to lucky donors! People who pledge $30 will receive this full-length LP, complete with a limited-edition silkscreened print by Steve Krakow (AKA Plastic Crimewave) and a link to digitally download the album in the format of your choice.\nUzi's Party is a film about a sleepover, a s\u00e9ance, and the singular aesthetic capabilities of 16mm film.\nFive girls gather to hang out and commune with a Ouija board. The host, Uzi (short for Fairuza) tries to keep things in order while her party goes awry. After a short session with the Ouija board, one of the girls is no longer herself - or is she?\nThe girls in Uzi's Party will all be played by the same actress. And the footage will be shot in-camera, via matting, multiple exposure, and body doubles. What will begin as a stylized, strange (and funny) teen drama will eventually become a disturbing, complex inquiry into possession, identity, and the psychology of young women. As the story progresses, the visual logic will slowly fall apart until you, like the girls in the film, are no longer sure what's real and what's not.\nI want to shoot Uzi's Party on 16mm because I love film, I am comfortable working with film, and because the restrictions inherent to shooting film are key in creating the right atmosphere. The unavoidable imprecision of in-camera techniques (not to mention natural grain and sensitivity to color) give film footage a vitality impossible to achieve in a digital environment, where everything is under control.\nMy sister, Johanna Hill, an experienced stage actress, has been my co-writer for this project and will star in all five roles. We've been talking about this movie for three years, and now is our chance to make it happen.\nTo get a better idea of my previous work and personal aesthetic, check out these clips from my films House Fuck and The Mystic, and the entirety of this intensive in-camera Super8 film: Untitled (Times For).\nWHAT'S THE MONEY FOR?\nA lot people are working on this movie for free: the actress, crew members, and the wonderful family whose home, for three weeks, will double as the film's location. I'd also like to thank Jeff Perlman, Ryan Gleeson, and Aren Zolninger for shooting my Kickstarter video, Tyson Torstensen for mixing sound, and Christy LeMaster along with everyone at the Nightingale for the generous use of their space.\nBut film is expensive! By far the largest slice of the handy pie chart below goes towards film stock, film processing, film printing, and film shipping. I'll be cutting and conforming Uzi's Party myself, but there are some steps that require a laboratory touch for best results.\nThe second largest slice will go towards feeding my cast and crew during production. They might be working for free, but I'm not going to let them starve. I know from experience that a well stocked, quality kitchen is the best way to keep a team upbeat and in good form.\nThe rest of the pie chart is split between costumes and props, transportation, Kickstarter fees, donor incentives, and air fare to fly Jojo, the star of Uzi's Party, from California to Chicago.\nWHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU?\nAside from the satisfaction of supporting really, really independent cinema, a donation to Uzi's Party can get you any number of comics, prints, movies, music, and magical objects. (If you're into living free from material possessions, you can also donate without reciprocation.)\nThe film, of course, is also included! Starting at the $25 level, donors will receive a private link to stream Uzi's Party, and donors at the $50 level and above will receive a DVD in the mail. Especially generous supporters may sign up to receive a film print of the finished product. Additional awards include:\n$20: Possession Scenes, issues 1-3\nThis is a series of mini-comics I started as research for Uzi's Party. Each issue encapsulates a possession scene from a different film or television series. Issues 1-3 are, in order: The Excorcist, Twin Peaks, and Possession. At the same donation level, you may instead receive a self-published, instructional zine on pinhole motion photography by experimental documentarian Thomas Comerford.\n$30: Limited edition prints by Lyra Hill and Krystal DiFronzo\nYou may receive one of three limited edition prints: a three-color offset print called Motion Sickness, a one-color screen print called Mr. Square at the Pit of Despair (not pictured, graphic content), or one of two Wile E. Coyote prints by cartoonist Krystal DiFronzo.\n$35: Self-published books, comics, and cassettes\nYou can choose between a cassette recording and accompanying booklet of Halle Butler's The Restaurant Business, donated by Dikarya Productions and Jenna Caravello; a book of short stories and illustrations by Chicago artist Mike Lopez; or Compiled, a collection of my short comics from 2008-2010.\n$40: Independent feature films on DVD\nYou may choose between a DVD of The Indian Boundary Line, an experimental documentary about the border between Chicago and Evanston by Thomas Comerford, or a DVD of the first feature film by Jerzy Rose, Some Girls Never Learn, an adventure comedy about a psychic veterinarian who follows his girlfriend to the Underworld.\n$45: Here Come the Wild Waves LP + booster pack\nTyson Torstensen, who will be scoring Uzi's Party, has generously donated several full-length LPs of Here Come the Wild Waves, by his band Magical Beautiful. This perk comes with a poster, pin, MP3 download and an EP CD release of earlier work.\n$60: 2012 CUFF poster, 3D glasses, and pin\nAt this level you will receive a limited-edition, four-color, giant screen print of the poster I designed for the 2012 Chicago Underground Film Festival. This perk comes with a homemade pair of 3D glasses and a pin featuring the design. When you look through the glasses, the cave pops out and the crystal confounds your vision.\n$80: Year pass to Brain Frame + any two posters\nBrain Frame is a performative comix reading series that happens every two months in Chicago. It's really fun. If you donate at this level you'll receive free admission to Brain Frame from this September to July 2014 (in the coming year, I'll be touring around the country - so even if you don't live in Chicago you may be able to redeem your entry!) as well as any two screen printed posters from BF5 to BF12. Each of these posters is a limited-edition, high-quality, three-color screen print designed by myself and a different artist.\n$200: Sacred objects made by Pagan priestesses\nI am blessed to have grown up in a tradition that worships the Earth and the Divine Feminine, and even luckier to have this community donate artwork to Uzi's Party, my own mystical project. You may choose either a necklace featuring a silver Hand of Fatima protection charm, surrounded by amethyst, aquamarine, pearls, and laboradite, created in sacred space by a Pagan priestess skilled in the art of spellwork for protection, or one of two mosaic candleholders, meant to focus intention, call in allies and elements to manifest our greatest hopes and desires, and to strengthen our affirmations and resolve.\n$300: I will draw you something\nI used to work as a fine portrait artist at conventions. This is a portrait I drew of my sister Jojo (star of Uzi's Party) in 2008. If you donate at this level, I will draw a black and white 8x10 portrait of you, or anything else for which you have a photo reference.\nAND BEYOND\nIf this campaign succeeds beyond my goal, the funds will help make this project even better. With extra resources, I'll be able to design and print a poster for Uzi's Party. I'll have more time to spend on the edit, color, and sound. I will be able to print multiple distribution copies and apply to film festivals (see below). I might even be able to treat my crew to a wrap party.\nA film print is a physical object, and like any thing often handled, it suffers wear and tear. I've budgeted to produce three prints (not including the prints for donors) - one for myself, one to distribute, and one back up in case of damage. If I raise enough funds, I will be able to produce more, which means:\nI can send the film out to different locations at similar times. (This is huge.)\nI can apply for my film to be included in print libraries, like Canyon Cinema.\nI can apply to festivals including the Images Festival, the Ann Arbor Film Festival, and the Rotterdam International Film Festival.\nI have shown films before at Antimatter, the Alchemy Film and Moving Image Festival, and the Milwaukee Underground Film Festival, so application to these festivals will cost nothing - but I'll still need resources to ship my prints, should Uzi's Party be accepted.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery film production is prone to setbacks. And there are unique challenges that come with making a 16mm film. Film stock is expensive and I will have a limited quantity. Equipment is cumbersome, and I'm borrowing mine from a lot of different places. I won't be able to view my footage until I send the negative to the lab and wait for a return print, so reshoots, if necessary, will be delayed.\n\nI have taken these factors into consideration while preparing the budget and schedule for my film. I have enough footage for a 4:1 shooting ratio. I will send my negative out as I shoot the film, so I'll be able to view the results before production wraps and Jojo flies back to California. I have reached out to multiple resources for similar equipment, so I will have back up if something fails or is unavailable.\n\nMore than anything, I trust myself as an organizer. I orchestrate complicated productions involving myriad technologies and lots of people all the time. I have an eagle's eye for details and a strong, orderly mind. I am not afraid of double- and triple-checking enormous lists. I can do this, and I will - with your help.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Prizes on their way // Behind-the-scenes footage", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nI am proud and relieved to confirm that prizes are on their way!

Art Fans! Story Fans! ... THANK YOU SO MUCH for helping us fully fund this project. We're a team now... you're in, you signed up, welcome!!! We are going to make a great film, and we're so glad you're a part of it. -- Chuck & Aaron\n\nPlease check out The Art Story website at:  www.artstoryfilm.com\n******************************************************\nWhat is Art Story?\n... the start of a very special, unique animated film.  Aaron and I saw all the exciting things happening online through crowd funding and thought, we've got a great film that SHOULD BE MADE and we could use some help -- so dang it, let's try Kickstarter\nSo, what's the story?  \nIt's a story about an 11-year-old, meticulous boy, WALT, and his crazy, loopy GRANDPA -- two complete opposites -- who get stuck in a vast, imaginative WORLD OF PAINTINGS.  Inside, they cross paths with a ruthless painted character determined to make it into our world.  In order to get home and stop the villain, Walt and Grandpa have to set aside their differences, work together and navigate worlds where the rules can change around every corner.  \nWalt being pulled into a painting! (concept painting)\nIt's structured like a hilarious, character-driven, buddy picture (\"Planes, Trains & Automobiles,\" \"I Love You, Man\" etc.), but takes place INSIDE THE WORLD OF SOME OF THE GREAT MASTER PAINTINGS OF ALL TIME ... where the characters change their appearance to match the style of each painting -- and meet lots of wildly entertaining characters.  It also explores and was inspired by that special relationship between a grandchild and their grandparent -- not something you see often in films nowadays.\nWalt and Grandpa photo bomb \"American Gothic.\" (Concept painting only)\nYeaahhh... paintings? Sounds sort of \"high brow\"\nOH CONTRAIRE mon frere!  Our number-one focus is to make an entertaining, compelling story with characters you love and who propel you through the film.  This one is for the whole family -- funny, emotional, and thrilling.  AND, believe me, we'll stay away from the low hanging fruit of crass gastronomical jokes and sexual innuendo (not our style).  \nAnd, BONUS, YES!! the film is set in some of the greatest master paintings of all time!  We believe this is an AMAZING WORLD to explore in a story, AND ALSO what a fantastic way to expose young kids (and some adults) to some of the most famous works of art of all time!!!  There's a reason these paintings and painters are so celebrated -- they're imaginative, engaging, spiritual, and, well, just astounding images and worlds.  \nLook, Aaron and I both have kids AND we love art of all sorts.  But how do we get our kids interested in this type of art?  \"It's boring dad.\"  We believe if you FIRST, TELL A GREAT, FUNNY, COMPELLING STORY; and second, set it in this world -- kids will be head over heels for it all.   We've all seen the success of fish, toys, bugs, dragons and monsters -- well, how about art?  The worlds of paintings are endless -- and the technology is available now to take us all into them and explore them in this unique way.  \nWalt chatting with Christina in Andrew Wyeth's \"Christina's World\" (concept painting only)\nWho are you guys? \nAaron and I are two passionate, experienced animation filmmakers who created this project and want to see it made.  We're both Disney feature animation film veterans, working at Disney for 21 years each on many of the recent classics -- Lion King, Beauty & the Beast, Aladdin, Pocahontas. We also produced and co-directed the Academy Award nominated Brother Bear.  (See more the in the biography section.)  \nGrandpa and Walt sneak by Degas's strict dance instructor (concept painting)\nAbove all, Aaron and I want to make films that stick with you.  Stories that are wildly entertaining, but also enrich the lives of their audiences -- films that have something to say.  We've helped create these kind of films in the past and are ready to do it again. \nWhat will you do with the money?\nWe'll use the money to create a script, a children's book ready for publication, killer artwork and a video presentation of the whole film.  It takes teams of people working 5 or 6 months to ready a film like this for production.  Along with a A LOT OF BACKERS  (really critical to show there's an audience for a film like this) and these items, we think we'll have a slam-dunk to get the film fully funded.  \nWill this film get made? \nNot without YOU.  Seriously, you, the person reading this right now.  This is a grassroots approach to making a film.  Help us send a message. YOU pledging now means there's another person who wants to see this film.  The money we raise here will get us started and is only a fraction of what the whole effort will take.  Any studio, any company or individual who wants to fund it will want to know there's an audience for this kind of film.  You backing us now, with whatever you can give, means there is someone else who wants to see it.  We need lots of backers.  It takes many raindrops to fill up a bucket.  \nWalt with Grandpa freaking out in a Picasso-esque cubist world.\nWhy not wait and just see the movie when it comes out?\nYes, we want you to see the movie when it comes out, take the whole famly.  But it may not come out at all without your help.  The studios are interested in BIG sequels, films from books or fairy tales that already have a following.   It's very hard to get an original film made unless you're already in a studio OR there's a proven, existing audience.  \nWe're 1000% confident this will be a sure-fire hit -- but we need YOU to support it and to show that it can have a big following!  With lots of backers and the entire package we'll create with the money, we're sure we'll have the momentum we'll need to get the film made.  \nOK, looks fun... how can I help?\nTo become one of our backers, just click on the big green button to the right of our video.  Kickstarter will ask you for your pledge, which reward you want, and how you want to sign up.  Signing up is easy -- you can even do it on Facebook.   And PLEASE pass on the info to your friends -- the more backers, the more we can show the studios films like this can have a following.\nBehind the scenes look at our process:\nArt Fans of the World Unite!\nIf you're an art teacher, work at a museum or are just a big fan of paintings or the arts -- this project is for you.  We'll treat this world right -- with respect -- honoring and celebrating these paintings.  An animated film is a great way to excite the next generation of artists, museum-goers and fans of the arts.  We hope you see the potential in the story and will become a backer.  \nWant More?\nConnect with us at:                              https://www.facebook.com/ArtStoryFilm & https://twitter.com/artstoryfilm\nCheck out Aaron's awesome range of paintings and work at: http://aaronblaiseart.blogspot.com & http://creatureartteacher.com\nMore Visual Development Artwork (Concept Art)\n\nWalt and Grandpa argue in Hopper's \"Nighthawks\" (concept art)\nWalt and Grandpa corned in an Escher!

The $350k will give us a great start, but animation is expensive -- in the 10s of millions, especially considering all the location and character design changes in this film. \n\nBut we know there's nothing out there quite like it and we think this can be a VERY SPECIAL FILM: a moving, entertaining story set in a world that will fascinate and one which you'll want to expose your kids to. \n\nTHE FINE PRINT (Stuff we gotta say)\n\u2022 Please understand, we are a creative team -- directors, writers, artists, producers -- we are not a production facility. At the appropriate time in the future we will look for 3rd party production partnership to complete the film. At this stage it's too early to pick a partner. However, this a technically challenging, reel-worthy project. We're 100% confident that when fully funded, we can find a great production facility to make this film -- there are a handful of really top-quality houses ready for animation.\n\n\u2022 If we can't get the funding for the film, we won't be able to fulfill some of the items. The pitch book, T-shirts, blog site, digital artwork and apprenticeship will all be funded by this campaign and we'll get them to you asap. We'll also create a CHILDREN'S BOOK ready for publication, but we can't guarantee you or your painting can be in the film or that we'll have a private screening if we can't get the film made. This is the same for the DVD. We're confident, but we've got a lot of big wig studio execs to convince -- THAT'S WHY YOUR BACKING IS SO IMPORTANT. \n\n\u2022 The APPRENTICESHIP is an unpaid position and is NOT a guarantee of employment on the film. We'll make it a worthwhile, rich experience -- you'll be right at the core of the film. Great for a resume and a unique peak into the pre-production process. \n\n\u2022 You must be over 18 or accompanied by a parent or legal guardian to tour the studio or be a voice in the film. \n\n\u2022 The usage of a character likeness or a voice in the film will be ultimately determined by the filmmakers. You will be in the final cut, but we'll have to figure out where and how. We know we're asking for a lot of money for it, so we want you to have a good meaningful appearance, but we can't determine it until the storyboarding and editing begin in earnest. \n\n\u2022This fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules and regulations, movie guild rules and applicable laws. If any of this conflicts, we will work with you in good faith to give you a substitute reward.\n\nTo wrap it up -- filmmaking on this scale is a long and winding journey and we're not sure where all the bumps in the road may come. We know how important your contribution will be to this project and will do EVERYTHING POSSIBLE to: 1) make a great film you can enjoy for years, and 2) get you your rewards. Anything you can give, any recommendation you can pass on to your friends and family is very important to us.

If you look at his cartoons and they don\u2019t make you laugh, you\u2019ve got to go back to the very beginning as a person and start with \u201cknock-Knock\u201d jokes and then work your way back.\u201d \u2013 Lewis Black (The Daily Show)\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\u201d is comic anarchy on a splendid level. Great imagery. Let\u2019s face it, Gahan Wilson is a genius. I loved it!\u201d -- Mel Brooks\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWHO IS GAHAN WILSON?\nPeople have seen and heard the name, but most recognize Gahan Wilson\u2019s work by his unique style of drawing and his unmistakable signature. His cartoons are strange, twisted, gross, weird, darkly humorous, completely developed universes, populated with monsters, vampires, maniacal generals, politicians, ordinary people, and of course - atomic and ecologically contaminated mutants. Wilson has been called \u201cthe Master of the Macabre,\u201d and is proudly eccentric; a champion of oddball individuals.\nHis legions of fans know him from his special guest star appearances at Comic-Con, over fifty years of monthly cartoons in Playboy, weekly cartoons in The New Yorker, and the years of off-the-wall, insanely funny covers and spreads in National Lampoon, where Gahan\u2019s ever popular NUTS series captured the paranoia and frustrations of being a little kid just trying to survive. He has received more lifetime awards than any living cartoonist, including the World Fantasy Award, and the National Cartoonists Society\u2019s prestigious Milton Caniff Lifetime achievement award.\nGAHAN WILSON: BORN DEAD, STILL WEIRD \u2013 The title originated with the fact that Gahan was indeed born dead, and fortunately revived by the family doctor. He is very much, still weird and proud of it!.\nWHY I MADE THE MOVIE? \nI was ten years old when I saw my first Gahan Wilson cartoon. It rocked my pre-pubescent brain. It was eye candy for the demented. I became obsessed with his cartoons; the lurid colors, the dark and twisted point of view, and the asymmetrical way he drew people and the world they inhabited. I had no idea who this Wilson fellow was, or how to pronounce his first name, but I felt I had discovered a kindred spirit. Over the years, my love of Gahan\u2019s work only increased.\nAfter becoming a producer, I was obsessed with trying to meet the mysterious cartoonist to see if there was some way of bringing his work to the big screen. I finally met Gahan Wilson and we struck up a friendship that continues to this day. After seeing the documentary on cartoonist Robert Crumb, I decided I had to make a documentary about Gahan so that the rest of the world would realize what a national treasure and a truly inspiring artist he is.\nI took an unpaid sabbatical from producing Hollywood movies. I thought it might take six months, maybe a year tops- I was willing to take the financial risk. As soon as I realized the responsibility I had undertaken to tell Gahan\u2019s story, there was no turning back. Six years later, having shot over 175 hours of footage, I completed the film.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cGahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird is brilliant. You held us, informed us, and moved us. The sequence with the cartoonists waiting for a thumbs-up or thumbs-down at The New Yorker is one of the most powerful slices of real life that I've ever seen in a documentary, and the final scene of Wilson skipping lightly away from the camera is a stroke of filmatic genius. Suddenly the viewer knows it's not just a film about Wilson, it's about how to live one's life with the sword of fate always above your neck.\u201d -- Bill Moyers, Moyers & Company, PBS.\n\u201cJaffe\u2019s film is a lively and entertaining portrait of the man whom director, Guillermo del Toro honors with the title, \u201cthe poster child of disenfranchised children.\u201d -- Andrew Farago, The Comics Reporter\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGahan and his custom Carver Edition skateboard (one of our rewards) --->\nHOW I MADE THE MOVIE\nIn addition to documenting Gahan\u2019s mysterious life and work, I fantasized who I\u2019d like to see as guest stars. So I made a wish list of todays\u2019 iconic cultural visionaries, including Stephen Colbert, Neil Gaiman, Stan Lee, Guillermo del Toro, Randy Newman, Bill Maher\u2026 to my delight and surprise most of the people on the list enthusiastically embraced the idea of participating in the film. Gahan not only influenced but also played a pivotal role in the childhood of many of today\u2019s leading artists, thinkers, politicians, humorists, and thousands of fans around the world.\nUnlike other documentaries with big budgets and large resources at their disposal, the fact that I was operating the camera insured that the interviews were intimate and personal. I was at times challenged and anxious about the unknown aspects of the documentary, but I had encouragement from fellow filmmakers, and became excited about getting to the truth of Gahan\u2019s story. Once you\u2019ve seen the documentary, you\u2019ll realize and appreciate how complex and personal Gahan Wilson\u2019s work is. Trust me, you will laugh, be amazed and inspired by the film. There is something for everyone in Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\"A fascinating portrait of the great cartoonist who's delighted fans of all ages for the past fifty years: funny, poignant, and revealing. I've always enjoyed Gahan Wilson's work but now I appreciate him all the more.\" -- Leonard Maltin, Author and Film Critic\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\" is a marvelously humanizing portrait of one of the great cartoonists. It would make a great companion piece to \"Crumb.\" -- Peter Rainer, Film Critic, The Christian Science Monitor\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCURRENT STATUS AND WHY WE NEED YOU\nThe filming and editing are complete. I took the financial risk of investing my money and over six years to produce the documentary.  This does not include salaries for the other producers, my editor, and myself. We have not been paid for anything. The guest stars were not paid, they did it out of sheer admiration and enthusiasm for Gahan Wilson.\nIn that spirit, we are turning to you to help us raise money to launch an official campaign to submit the documentary for ACADEMY AWARD\u00ae consideration before this year\u2019s deadline is closed. What this means is that we have to rent a theater in New York and Los Angeles to screen the movie in each city for one week with advertising in the major newspapers.\nThe money we raise with your help will not go towards paying my producers or myself.  It will be used to book the theaters, pay for advertising, hire a publicist, do a technical finish to the sound and picture, pay for final music and stock footage licensing. There are other documentaries entering the competition, which have big studios or networks behind them, and unlimited resources with lots of money to pay for budgets exceeding a million dollars. Many have newsworthy topics that certainly are headline grabbers, and are produced by professional documentarians who have very polished films that include expensive animation, title sequences, reenactments, helicopter shots, large crews\u2026 \nThe Value of an ACADEMY AWARD\u00ae\nIt is of course a great honor to be recognized for ones work by your peers. The ACADEMY AWARDS\u00aeare one of the most fiercely competitive cinematic races and the odds of winning are very slim. However, It\u2019s widely accepted that with the right marketing, an Oscar\u00ae nomination and of course a WIN, can propel a documentary at the box office. Realistically, I don\u2019t expect to win an Oscar\u00ae but this is the best opportunity to get the documentary exposed to the WIDEST AUDIENCE POSSIBLE and launch its release.\nRemember, the big goal here is to introduce Gahan\u2019s work to people everywhere. Let me state bluntly, this is not going to be easy! GAHAN WILSON: BORN DEAD, STILL WEIRD is personally financed and a sincere labor of love- WE ARE THE UNDERDOGS. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u201cWeird is Good, particularly when you\u2019re legendary cartoonist Gahan Wilson.\u201d -- The Hollywood Reporter\n\"Gahan Wilson: Born Dead, Still Weird\u201d is a deeply moving, uniquely honest portrait of an American treasure. It's a stunning film that succeeds in capturing the creative process--in this case how a gifted man transforms great pain into the stuff of great art.\" -- Daniel Kupper, Ph.D., Associate Clinical Professor, Department of Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine UCLA\nSOME OF OUR REWARDS :) \nOur GWBDSW Tee Shirt!!\nSpecial Screening Invitation\nNear Dark Movie Poster\nGHOST- We Believe in Talent- Movie Poster\nThe Wind and the Lion Movie Poster\nWeight of Water Movie Poster\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTHANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT ! :) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLEGAL DISCLOSURES \n\n-If you are a minor, you must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian (who will count as your plus one) to attend the screenings.\n\n-This fundraising campaign is subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations, and applicable law.

Normally, I might not have paid much attention to this, except I found my passenger, Mr. Wilson, the master of the macabre, staring at the sign. I slowed down as we approached it. Neither of us said a word, but I imagined a cartoon bubble exploding above Gahan\u2019s head with a dark and disturbing image of being inside the bar with all manner of clams; Ipswitch, Cherry Stones, Middle Necks, Little Necks, Steamers, and of course, my favorite \u2013 Razor clams, all seated on bar stools. But big, the size of people. The bar tender, a peculiar looking, large Quahog, smiling happily as he watched his customers devouring what appeared to be people, or parts of people\u2026 I looked over at Gahan as we passed the clam bar, a slight smile appeared on his face. \u201cWhat kind of people are they eating in there?\u201d I asked.

Producers, casting directors, and studios spend endless hours, searching high and wide for a seductive glance, a courageous swagger, or a sway of the hips unlike any other. No one knows quite what the right combination is, until they see it. But when it hits... when it truly hits... it\u2019s a look that launches ships, a look that utterly seduces, a look that erupts into belly laughs, or tears. There is no formula, no recipe, no road map \u2013 Only this is true: When they find it, when the look works, its stupendous. Witness please:\nThe eyes (Hepburn, Newman)\nThe smile (Roberts, Cruise)\nThe curves (Monroe, Vergara, Jolie)\nAnd think how these looks changed them \u2013 and us.\nThe chance to be one of these rare creatures is the stuff of legend. Its promise has attracted legions to Hollywood, all in hopes that their look \u2013 their particular physical charms \u2013 will be the one that sticks out.\nPhoto by Bobby Quillard\n\nThis documentary is the story of one such face -- highly unlikely one at that. A passionate writer, after having landed in Los Angeles at the age of 21 -- but after losing his first job -- took advice from his roommate: sign up for background extra work.\nThis advice changed his life.\nJesse Heiman, an unlikely star, has since worked steadily, on hundreds of films and television series alongside some of the most prominent names in the business. Directors from Spielberg to Fincher have placed him in the center of the frame for their highest profile projects \u2013 albeit as a wholly anonymous presence. From Old School to The Social Network, Catch Me If You Can and Spiderman -- Jesse has offered up the face dreammakers sought: homely, earnest, innocent, and brave. Over time, Jesse\u2019s pure determination has made him an unlikely, irresistible worldwide face.\nThis utterly heart-rending portrait film exploring the courage, risks, fun and the truly wild leaps Hollywood culture demands in order for Jesse to achieve his ambitions -- it is also about the fascinating things one distinctive look can do. A young man in search of dreams can inspire a public that seeks out a face to mirror their own desires.\nComic-Con 2013\nTHE CREW\nJason Connell (Executive Producer)\nConnell is the president and founder of Connell Creations, a Los Angeles-based production company. He has produced numerous award-winning films, including STRICTLY BACKGROUND, THE ROCK-AFIRE EXPLOSION, GABI ON THE ROOF IN JULY, HOLY ROLLERS: THE TRUE STORY OF CARD COUNTING CHRISTIANS, and GLOW: THE STORY OF THE GORGEOUS LADIES OF WRESTLING. Connell is also the founder and director of the United Film Festival, which began in his hometown of Tulsa, OK ten years ago and has grown to Los Angeles, New York, London, San Francisco, and Chicago. Connell's distribution division, the appropriately named United Films, has grown rapidly and now represents an impressive and constantly expanding library of independent films.\nNick Weis (Director/Producer/Editor)\nWeis is a self-taught filmmaker from Louisville, KY. Through trial and error, he's created powerful, heart-wrenching documentaries, like his most recent editorial work in The Potter's Field. His innate passion and naturally creative eye is a true gift. He is a co-owner in Magic Happens Productions, established for the purpose of making WORLD'S GREATEST EXTRA. Weis' approach to filmmaking is fearless and playful.\nEmily Carroll (Producer)\nCarroll is a Louisville, KY transplant now living in Los Angeles, and working for well-known film/TV production companies. A lifelong fascination with how movies are created led her to switch careers, from advertising to film production, in 2011. Upon her move to LA, Carroll became enamored with the business side of film/TV. She's worked on films such as 2nd Serve, The Wedding Pact and Dracano, and TV/web series Hell's Kitchen, Sandra Lee's Taverns, Lounges, and Clubs, and Up Close with Carrie Keagan. Carroll is co-owner of Magic Happens Productions. Carroll's approach to filmmaking is meticulous and well-organized.\nEdward Heavrin (AD/Cinematographer)\nHeavrin is an artist from Louisville, KY, working in film, performing arts and music. He recently spent several years in New York City working in theatre and film, and co-wrote an original play, \"Letters From India,\" which received an Off-Broadway staged-reading, at Urban Stages, in 2008. His first documentary film, The Potter's Field, screened to a sold-out theater of over 500 people, at the 2013 Flyover Film Festival. Heavrin's approach to filmmaking is straightforward and unapologetic.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTime is a challenge on this project. We've filmed periodically throughout the last four months but we need to follow his story for at least a full year. Eight additional months of filming will ensure a cohesive story, involving all the people, places, and things that are important to Jesse and to shaping the outcome of his career.\n\nPart of the expense is having the equipment needed to capture the magic of a beautiful shot or pick-up audio on an important conversation... the other part of the expense is affording the people who can use the equipment to make magic happen. Luckily, the core team on this production is incredibly hard-working, budget-conscious, and committed to seeing the project completed and given back to the audiences who made the film possible.\n\nJesse risks a lot by doing this film. Giving us access to his private life would be difficult for anyone to do. Full disclosure can be a scary thing, but as we've seen through documentaries like \"Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work\" and \"The Kid Stays in the Picture,\" it is also liberating and captivating. Hollywood is a volatile place and we don't get to see the real-time rollercoaster ride of how people attempt to build their careers in the madness of it all. As Producers, our relationship with Jesse is one of trust and understanding, which has been cultivated by dedicating our time and attention to sharing his story.\n\nFor Producers, we risk a lot, too. Our reputations as filmmakers, however short they may be at this time, are on the line.\n\nLastly, YOU are sharing risk, as well.

Every year, thousands of residents of all ages visit the Balboa to relax and enjoy the magic of the movies in a classic neighborhood setting.  We want this tradition to continue, but we need your help. \nAfter 100 years of movies being screened from film, Hollywood is converting to digital. Every theatre must upgrade it's projectors and associated equipment and it must be done by the end of this year. Upgrading the projection and sound equipment in both of the Balboa's auditoriums will cost close to $150,000. This goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise the funds to cover the cost of the digital upgrade for one of the Balboa's two auditoriums. Any funds raised above the goal will be put towards upgrading the second auditorium. \nBalboa Theatre, 1969\nUnfortunately, classic cinemas like the Balboa are rarely able to compete against modern multiplexes.  The Balboa is able to survive only because the non-profit San Francisco Neighborhood Theater Foundation holds the lease for the Balboa and covers many expenses so that the Balboa's operator, CinemaSF, can afford to keep the theatre going.  To date, the Theater Foundation has enabled numerous improvements including new paint, new floors, a new heating system and new seats.  The expense of the digital upgrade, however, requires this Kickstarter campaign. \nIf the campaign is successful we will immediately upgrade the Balboa's auditorium 1 to digital and hopefully we'll be able to get work on auditorium 2 going as well.  With digital projectors in place we'll be able to keep the Balboa alive offering a modern, first-class movie experience in a classic neighborhood theatre.  Once the digital conversion is complete, we plan to work on other upgrades including expanding the concesssion operation to include beer, wine and food.  We also hope to rehab the Balboa's aging restrooms. \nAnd if we're not successful?  Without digital the Balboa Theatre can't continue to screen new films and the theatre will likely go dark.  We don't want that to happen and we know you don't want it to happen either.  So please give what you can and for that we'll give you great opportunities to experience the new and improved Balboa for many years to come. \nBalboa Theatre, 2012", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately we just installed a brand new digital projector at the Vogue Theatre so we know what we're doing.

The film takes a personal and holistic look at this international creative community who are disrupting the traditional video games industry.\nGameLoading is about game developers, specifically indie game developers. Without them the games we love would not exist. Our film explores the lives of developers around the globe and we strongly feel this is a story that needs to be told in detail. We want to demystify their craft and how they are working on the cutting edge of entertainment. We want to show their infectious passion for making games. Right now there is a global renaissance in indie game development and GameLoading aims to capture this moment time.\nVideo gaming is still a young medium, ready to explode in ways we are yet to imagine. The democratisation of game development has enabled independent developers to express themselves like never before. \nLike DIY musicians and film-makers, indie game developers are working without the big budgets and huge teams of mainstream studios, giving life to their own visions, on their own terms.  In the process they are pushing the limits, challenging the status quo of what games are and bringing a new language to the medium. \nGameLoading aims to take a snapshot of the worldwide indie game subculture, by following the pioneers of indie development to see how they are changing the industry and even our views on what video games can be. \nWe will get a personal glimpse of the endless hard work, risks faced and sacrifices indie developers make to bring their creations into the world.  What drives them?  What does it mean to succeed?  Will they make it?\nWe are gamers ourselves, excited by the creativity and innovation of the indie gaming subculture. We want to make our film personal and holistic; indie developers at all stages of the process telling their own stories, in their own words.\nWe have been working, planning and researching for a year and have shot over a dozen interviews with developers from different parts of the globe at different stages in their careers.  We are closely following a handful of development teams in Australia.\nRight now we are now ready to travel to film the next round of interviews we have lined up. Firstly to the USA for PAXPrime and IndieCade, and then to Europe to do interviews in Stockholm, Belgium, France, Italy and Romania.\nAfter Europe we will explore the burgeoning indie game scene in Japan. Finally we will come home to Australia and continue filming the teams we have been following for the last year.\nSo far we have spent our own money on the film and now we are reaching out to you to help us with the next phase of filming.\nLike the developers we are following, we are also totally independent and running off our own passion and commitment in getting inspiring people to tell their stories.\nWe have done a huge amount of work already but we can\u2019t do it all alone! So we are asking for support to help us get to the finish. If you share our passion for the world of indie games and filmmaking, please pledge towards the project and help make it happen. If you are a game developer at any level and you want to see the culture of game development nurture and grow then please show your support.\nWe are excited to have a bunch of great games included in the rewards. This selection will grow throughout the campaign. \nHere is a trailer of all the current games:\nFree Games Bundle\nOPENCLONK - Beautifully nuanced side-scrolling adventurer and builder. Full of antiquity, rich landscapes and flowing weather patterns. \n\nQBEH - A gorgeous first-person puzzler with a lovely minimalist aesthetic - this one's incredibly addictive.\n\nA.R.C.S. - Super retro tower defense game with a modern polish. Big guns. Big bombs. Big old-school arcade destruction!\n\nZombie Grinder - Bust some block-headed zombie brains to the sounds of an awesome analogue soundtrack. Very cool and cute pixel-art multiplayer zombie survival with heaps of fun mods. \nPremium Games Bundle\nLivalink - Solid, wave-defense FPS with tons of atmosphere and a more than few nods to the pioneers of the genre. The deadly Progeny are eerie and terrifying!\n\nSpyleaks - Sophisticated, brain bending puzzle game. Fully retro-fit spy saga that swings effortlessly between beat-the-clock covert conundrums and trenchcoat shootouts. \n\nUbinota - A wistful, cloud-born wonder. These French auteurs' deceptively simple tale of a colourful painter thinly veils a deeper tragedy of complex gravity. \n\nUnderrail - Gritty post-apocalyptic isometric RPG that feels like an obscure forgotten gem from the shadowed shelves of a 90's wargaming store. It's dark, complex and awesome.  \n\nRecruits - Gung-ho top-down shooter with a full swag of firepower and explosives. Bred from hardened Cannon Fodder stock, the environments are beautifully natural and the gameplay kicks some serious ass.\nThese stretch goals will help make the best film we can. We have been relying on friends donating their film gear but we would love to start paying people and using our own equipment. \nWe have been borrowing sound equipment and lenses from friends throughout the production. We would love to buy our own equipment for the shoot - sound gear, lenses, a camera bag, tripod and a light panel. \nSo far we have been shooting the film mostly on our own. We would like to hire talented camera people for some of the shoots so the film looks amazing. \nOur friends have supported us immensely during production, lending us their time, talents and equipment.

He was 113 years old. A year later, Hunter Weeks and Sarah Hall set out to tell his story along with that of several living Supercentenarians by exploring their major contributions to the world and their personal philosophies on how they were able to make it past the 110 mark. Their journey helps capture the stories of the last few people born in the late 1800s. This movie celebrates life and will help people think differently about their personal timeline differently.

Because of this we've decided at Team Zombie upon a new reward.  Our 100th backer, and then our 200th and then our 300th (and onwards as far as this campaign goes) shall be automatically eligible to be depicted in the background of one of the cards care of our great illustrators, this is otherwise only available with the Chuck Norris level of support. While you wont be the focus of the card (our lovely zombie ladies are of course), you will be clearly depicted as a zombie in one of our cards. This reward is not something that will be on the sidebar, but will be something we will contact each person who hits our 100th, 200th, 300th backer mark. Stay safe, board the windows and stock up on canned goods my friends.\n\nAbout estimated delivery date: Please note that while most of our rewards state that the delivery will be in September, this is an error, they will actually be in October (unless we're able to finish the art on the cards and have them printed sooner, in which case we will).  Our apologies for this error (once rewards are claimed, it is too late to change the dates on them).\nAbout the cards: The cards material will be of high quality, German Black core paper (310gsm. 63*88mm)\nWhat is it?\n100% custom Zombie Pinup Girl poker playing cards.  Because what's better than zombies? Beautiful zombies...duh! Henceforth they shall be known as \"Zom-B-girls\".\n\nWhy Pinup Girl Zombies?\n\nWe believe many will love a unique deck incorporating humour, playful sexiness and of course that current staple of pop culture, the ever lovin' Zombie! Just because humanity has perished from this alternate post apocalyptic zombie world doesn't mean they have to miss out on cute girls when they play cards! And neither should you.\n\nHow we found the deck.\n\nIn a world much like our own, in a time, in a place...it was/is (dimension hopping is confusing) 2015 and the pandemic has/had (ok I'll stop) reached its natural conclusion...humanity has pretty much snuffed it.  The zombies unlive everywhere, but after a while of chasing the few survivors around, they just kind of went back to their normal unlives, just at a much slower pace with a lot less chit chat. Card games still got played, albeit very slowly, the occasional finger falling into the chip bowl and pinup zombgirls still needed to show off, before their looks completely fade (in a day or two usually).  And so a world went \"rraouggha\" and \"brains!\" and \"uhhhg?\" in response to the most beautiful deck of pinup Zom-B-girls ever unleashed upon an unthinking and pungent populace.\n\nFortunately for us we've only got a portal into their world and we pop in now and then to nick stuff.  In this case we've come back with a deck so profound, so beautiful that we had to share it.\n\nWhere you come in...\n\nBut here's the thing, we've only managed to find a few of the cards before we had to run (we lost Gary, but nobody really liked Gary anyway). But we need your help!\n\nWith your funding we'll be able to launch a full expedition into this world to recover the missing cards (and maybe some other goodies).  We'll keep you updated on our progress, we'll let you get to know the team (and mourn the occasional one we'll probably lose).\nZombie Queen of Hearts\nZombie King of Aces\n5 of Hearts\nBackcover of ZOM-B-GIRLS cards\n7 of Hearts\nRewards\nFor clarification: all those who back this project above \u00a36 will ALSO get 2 HD Zombie Pin-Up wallpapers for their desktop.

So far, we have successfully funded two titles; Data Hacker Initiation and Fantasyche. The ability to be part of this community is an honour to behold, and the community's reaction to our previous titles has both awed and humbled us.\nIf you need to pledge via Paypal, rather than Kickstarter, that is indeed possible. Just head over to the Official Website!\nA word from the chief 'game guy' : I'm SO SO SOOOO excited and passionate about the Data Hacker series, and Corruption in particular! Hopefully, my enthusiasm shows through, and you guys see fit to want to play this game of ours. I say this with no ego at all- This game is going to be badass. Or, as one fan put it; this game's going to be off the hook! Enjoy.\nThe Data Hacker Series comprises of three titles: Initiation, Corruption and Reboot.\nInitiation \n(Corruption's prequel) was also Kickstarter-funded, and response from fans was amazing, both during funding and after release (suggesting that it did not disappoint!). The game currently has a rating on Desura of 8.6 / 10 (at the time of writing), which is a massive compliment to the game, and a testament to the sheer amount of love and craftsmanship that went into creating it. \nPlayers begin their journey as Jay- a retired hacker. After an ironic case of mistaken identity, Jay is banished from Online World; an online game that serves as a respite from a broken society. Jay\u2019s quest involves a dark narrative, many characters and unexpected twists, but there is much more to come\u2026 \nThe main feature of Initiation was a massive fork in the storyline, dictated by the player\u2019s actions. And now, it is time to continue your chosen path in Corruption. \nDon't take our word for it, here's some feedback we received after the game was released:\n\"I highly recommend! Well done to the developers.\" - Aldorlea user blitzen\n\"...far better than a lot of other cut'n'paste - expensive - commercial RM titles, that's for sure. The custom soundtrack is especially enjoyable\" - Desura user Sabin1981\n\"The best thing was that the combat never got boring\" - Desura user Lordmalakar\n\"rich, intelligent and terribly addictive! Do not hesitate\" - Desura user Danteros\nCorruption \nallows you to load your old save file, complete with your chosen team and choices made, which actually makes Corruption two complete games in one package!\nIt is your previous decisions that will determine which story, alas, on which side you will stand in the coming war. It is YOUR choices that will decide the fate of the worlds and characters that you have encountered, and will encounter as your journey progresses.\nJay's Avatar (left), Leader of the Virulea (right)\nThe game's main features include:\nTwo COMPLETE stories in one package, with an amassed 40-hours of estimated core play time,\nA much more diverse graphical spectrum, new characters sheets and customised tilesets!\nA well-thought out, darkly twisting narrative,\nHack monsters and players!\nDynamic recruitment system,\nRecruit Mission System - Send party members on their own missions while you continue the main story,\nMature your recruits into more powerful allies!\nCraft hundreds of unique items & equipment, new recruits, evolution items and more...\nInteract with any one of the scores of in-game characters on a dynamic level. Chat, trade, challenge, or even hack them!\nTons of sidequests to undertake, from 'official game quests' to special player-initiated quests!\nUnique Dungeons! No copy-paste shortcuts.\nChallenging puzzles within each dungeon,\nPlenty of optional content\nOver 100 in-game Achievements,\nTrioarch! An addictive trading-card game\n\nDon't be fooled into thinking that you HAVE to play Initiation. Corruption will stand on its own as a game in itself, although it is recommended that you do play Initiation beforehand.\nDoing so will provide you with a great foundation-level knowledge of the events that have led up to this point- the choices made by various parties, and the consequences wrought upon the worlds.\nThat being said, you're free to begin your journey with Corruption as your starting point, since all game systems will be explained to you (should you require it), and brief recaps of the series' story will also be mentioned during your travels. \nAnd finally, Data Hacker: Reboot. \nThis game will have an expansive feature list, and will most likely be built on the Unity3D engine. \nDue to the nature of  distinction between the two engines, Reboot will not feature a save file import system, but will instead introduce a new set of characters following the aftermath of Corruption's climax.\nThere's little point going into the expansive feature list planned for Reboot, so just rest assured, it's going to be EPIC. And so much fun.\nWhilst the narrative is definitely a strong selling point of the game, story alone cannot make a great game. That is why Corruption is crammed full of features and optional content.\nInitiation and Corruption share a time-tested turn-based yet somewhat frantic battle system, during which you will find yourself thinking tactically about how to defeat each and every foe you find yourself trading blows with! \nExploration takes place both through dungeon-crawling and town hubs in Online World, and through field exploration in the DigiPlane.This brings the best of both worlds to your gaming experience.\nHacking monsters and other players has a direct influence on how the game plays too. The prolific hacker will find themselves armed with an assortment of 'hacked' recruits; entities that will obey your every command and often 'mature' into even more powerful allies. On the other end of the scale, the less hack-happy player will likely find themselves with a small army of loyal 'player' followers.\nHacking when monsters are on full health can have detrimental effects...\nWhile hacking provides a method of recruiting players, it can also be used to 'farm' for unique items and provide a means to unlock hidden areas (much to the chagrin of Online World's administrators!).\nCrafting items from materials that have been gathered provides an exploratory method of acquiring not only new items and equipment, but methods of upgrading your teammates. You can either find recipes for crafting, or simply combine random items to see the effects!\nSelect up to five materials to create something unique!\nThe crafting system implemented into Corruption allows you to access hundreds of unique weapons, armour, accessories, restorative items, evolution items and more. Recipes are available for 'base' items, which can then be modified with rarer materials with special effects.\nGathering materials for use in crafting also forms another level of depth and immersion within the game world. Players can shop, hunt monsters, farm seeds, fish and mine for the materials they need to craft any of the hundreds of unique items featured in-game.\nThere are plans to release two differing versions of Corruption. The Hacker\u2019s Paradise edition will feature exclusive additional content including equipment, characters, locations and battles.\nThis extended version will not be publically released. Featuring at least two exclusive dungeons, new monsters, challenging bosses and unique equipment, the 'Hacker's Paradise Edition' of Corruption is our way of saying a massive \u2018Thank you!\u2019 to those who saw fit to back the campaign, and really help us to grow this game into the best product it can be!\nSo, to reiterate; this edition is exclusive to Kickstarter!\nThe Physical Realm\nThe tangible world in which you and I live (most of the time). \nRavaged by war, the world is in tatters. Though there could be hope, the world is populated primarily by a defeated shadow of a society.\nOnline World\nThe game world which exists primarily in the servers of 'EPT Corp.' This online video game provides a respite for those living in a post-war shattered shadow of a world.\nThe 'beginner' dungeon- Jurassica\nAt the beginning of Initiation, the player is presented with information about players going missing while logged into the game, however most shrug it off as urban legend. \nThe RedPlanet Dungeon holds many secrets...\nBut as the story progresses, it becomes clear that there is something great, and terrible at work behind this addictive game, leading Jay to make tough choices about the path he treads. \nOptional caves and tombs aplenty within each dungeon\nOnline World (the game world) itself centres around central town hubs, and a series of dungeons and disjointed locations, which are accessed through town Gatestones, inventory Crystones and other kinds of 'keys.'\nA zoomed-out image of the City of Angelus under construction\nThe City of Angelus is taking on shape\nWith our stretch goal, players will be able to buy a plot of land to call their own, build a house and furnish it as they see fit\nThis provides a semi-linear method of play: Players can choose which dungeons they wish to play next, while being subtly nudged towards the next major plot point.\nOnline Realm / DigiPlane\nA subtle, intangible world which is home to the SilicAI (digital people). It is not clear whether this world existed before the creation of Online World, or whether it sprang to life as a result of it.\nOverlooking the city of Processon\nThe DigiPlane consists of one main metropolis, around which there are colour-coded zones that have been 'tamed.' \nDespite having teleport abilities, Jay still chooses to use a more 'traditional' means of conveyance\nThere are however, many 'Wild' Zones that have not yet been fully integrated into the world order. The player can work to 'tame' these lands by completing dungeons and puzzles, and defeating the most challenging of foes.\n'Tamed' fields provide monsters and traps aplenty.\nWhen not engaging in combat in the field, players will find themselves in one of the many towers that form the city of Processon. Each level contains shops, residential and military zones, and just a few secrets...\nTower 3 (Lower Level) - Jay's home in the DigiPlane\nDo not be fooled! A digital realm such as this follows rules, just like our world. It is just as real, if not more so, than the Physical Realm. You will come to see in time.\nThe Datastream\nA sub-ethyric river of power. To those who know how, this force can be tapped to create, destroy and to link. \nThe NetherLand\nA non-place devoid of life as we know it, which exists outside the domain of known worlds. The normal rules do not apply here.\nVERY Early concept art of the NetherLand\nThroughout your journey you will encounter a wide variety of people and other life forms, all of which you can interact with on some level. This could be through the art of combat, chatting, trading, challenging to a card game or even hacking the person to steal their data, there are a myriad ways you can affect the worlds within Corruption.\nThe Justica/Hunters\nThe Justica were originally a fanatic group of Hacker-haters within the confines of Online World. However, things have progressed somewhat. The Justica have since been rebranded the hunters on account of their new agreement- kill all SilicAI on sight.\nSome old faces from Jay's squad may return, plus a host of new ones\nSilicAI\nDefenders, builders and artists of Online Realm, or the DigiPlane. The SilicAI are borne of the data of players, their physical bodies, and power from the Datastream. They are the culmination of everything that is good about humans; passionate, loyal, obedient, and with few of the frailties such as vengefulness, jealousy, mind degradation and ageing.\nThe SilicAI live in great domes that look futuristic to us. But it could all come crashing down in an instant\nUnfortunately, as the skirmishes grow into a full-scale war, less emphasis has been placed on the lives and arts of this people. Hundreds of SilicAI are being lost on the battlefield, and their leader thus (albeit reluctantly) has announced the conscripting of any able fighters. \nA world, and a people destined to greatness; reduced to desperation.\nThe Virulea\nThought to have originated from the NetherLand- a void in which horrors lurk- the Virulea were not a particularly formidable force... until now. They have formed an army, and march with seemingly single objective: to destroy all life.\nThat being said, the apparent leader of the Virulea is thought to be of a different origin.\nPlayers\nPlayers still log into Online World, despite the apparent risks. With nothing else to go back to (only a broken physical world), players find purpose in the game, especially if they are shortlisted for the defence against malevolent otherworldly forces.\nImagine scores of players roaming the streets, looking for help, challenges and trades!\nAdministrators\nFormer keepers of Online World turned rogue. They seek out the truths behind the strange occurrences within Online World and beyond, while answering to EPT Corp; the game's creator.\nRuling from up high, the Administrator's higher purpose is no longer clear\nThe barriers that once separated the worlds are breaking down. The Datastream is fluctuating, and areas of all worlds are becoming corrupt. Something is eating at them, but what?\nA malevolent force, seemingly hellbent on the destruction of all life on all worlds has risen in power and rank.\nPlayers from Online World, and the SilicAI from the DigiPlane lock horns in an epic struggle. With neither side letting up, will this conflict end with the destruction of both sides?\nWhere do your loyalties lie; do you seek to protect the human players of this world, or do you help the SilicAI stave off the attacks on their homeland?\nHow do you go about solving your own problems; do you seek ultimate power for yourself, or do you build an army to lead?\nThe fate of all worlds lies in your hands.\nThis funding will be spread over several main areas that include (but is not limited to):\nAn Original, epic Soundtrack from Allen Elezeid\nTilesets and Background Artwork Licensing\nCharacter Sprite Sheets\nProfessionally-produced SFX\nGame systems programming\nAnimations\nRewards and Shipping\nKickstarter and Amazon's 10% slice of the pie\n\nShould we hit our initial goal, we'd like to thank you all for your amazing support! Let's move on to adding even more content:\n\u00a31,250 - Initial Goal - MET - This goal will cover everything we hope to include in the main game. Your Hacker's Paradise edition will come complete with exclusive content that ONLY YOU will have access to, and will not be included in the retail release.\n\u00a31,500 - Zombies! - MET - How innovative!

Having a certain party member in your team may yield unexpected events...\n\u00a31,800 - MET - The Tower of Shadows - A 100-level tower comprising of challenges such as complex puzzles and combat.\n\u00a32,300 - MET - New Game + - Featuring more story content, additional challenging dungeons, and even more characters and loot, new game + is for those players who just are not happy with a single play-through!\n\u00a33,000 - A little Piece of You! - MET - As a massive thank you to you all, when the surveys go out, you'll be asked to name either an in-game character or guild!\n\u00a33,300 - Welcome Home - MET - You'll be able to purchase a house in some of the game's towns, and even dungeons. Some will come complete with their own mini-quest and loot!\n\u00a33,500 - Bonus Soundtrack - MET - In addition to the already awesome original soundtrack, I'll coerce (gently) Allen into producing a small 8/16-bit MIDI soundtrack from some of the game's more popular tracks!\n\u00a33,700 - Bonus Sticker Set - MET - Featuring the main character's sprite and text that says 'HACKED!' I had a few of these made up for fun, and started sticking them all over people's computers for laughs! Eveybody with a package on the way will receive one of these sticker sets.\n\u00a34,000 - Voice Acting 1 - MET - If we can manage to stretch all the way to \u00a34,000, we can hire professional voice actors/actresses to voice-over both the beginning and ending sequences, elevating this game into a new class of awesomeness.\n\u00a34,500 - Pandora's Box - MET - A complete quest line to find the elusive Pandora's box, complete with an unexpected team-up.

We can answer any questions you might have!\n22CREDIT Shirts - \nAll garments we provide are 'Fruit of the Loom;' very high quality fabric\n35CREDIT Hoodies\n10CREDIT Mousepads\nAvailable with or without the obscuring grey bar\n35CREDIT (Each) Corrupted Art Book and Full Colour Game Guides - An estimated 15 page+ art book containing sketches, scribbles, screenshots and professional artwork, complete with annotations and notes all the way from concept to production. This will be signed off with a personal message of thanks from yours truly. \nAs well as the Art Book, we're offering exclusive printed copies of the game guides to both Initiation and Corruption!\nPreview of Initiation's 75+ page guide\n10CREDIT Conference Ticket - a 1-hour session with myself and other ticket-holders to discuss the development of this game, and future ideas. Those that attend this exclusive Kickstarter-backer conference will have an insight into precisely what is planned for the future.\n50CREDIT Statue & Game Lore - Immortalise yourself by erecting a statue in your honour in one of the game's towns. This statue will come complete with consistent game lore, raising you above the mere mortals.\n10CREDIT Design a basic character - \nDesign a character, pick his location, provide a description of his/her appearance (don't worry, we'll do the artwork) and give him/her some dialogue.\n25CREDIT Design a recruitable character - As above, but the character will have a class, equipment and will be able to join your party and engage in combat alongside the main character.\n50CREDIT Design a deep character - As above, but you can give this character a unique quest that the player can opt into following for unique loot. You can also give your character a backstory and home in one of the game's town hubs.\n100CREDIT The Works! - As above with the 'deep character', but you can also submit a dungeon/area design for implementation into the game, complete with traps, puzzles, monsters and a complete questline.\nAll design rewards are subject to approval, but we're pretty lax. Your submission must be consistent with the game's settings and backstory, and there are of course limitations to what we can do with your design. For example, an incredibly complex boss-fight design just might not be possible with this engine.\nAt the moment, Initiation is available for PC on the Official Studio 69 website, Desura, Aldorlea, Shiny Loot and Indie City. We are also in talks with Indiegamestand, Green Man Gaming, Gamersgate and GoG.\nWill the game be ported onto other systems? Sadly, at this point, no. Due to engine restrictions, we can only support PC, though the game does run smoothly in Wine for Linux.\nThis is likely the LAST game Studio 69 will release on Enterbrain's RM engine! We\u2019ll be making to jump from 2D into Unity3D to begin work on Reboot, as soon as Corruption is finished. After that, who knows?\n'\nSo, there's me, Ross Tunney. I suppose I'm the 'game guy.' It's really surprising how much I can achieve through hard work and an obsessively-creative mind. I work on pretty much every aspect of the game, from the characters and narrative, to level design, and then over to marketing and PR. I don't sleep much. \nAllen Elezeid. While not technically 'tied' to the company, Allen and I have a strong rapport and find each other incredibly good professional company. This guy is an aural genius; he produced Initiation's soundtrack in its entirety, and the vast majority of Fantasyche's musical repertoire.\nWant to hear some of his amazing work? TAKE THIS:\nDayna Gibson\nOur very own talented artist; Dayna is responsible for overhauling all of the character portraits, and is also working on some cool concept art which will feature in the art book. \nTom Clifford - A very talented pixel artist, Tom is working on many custom assets for the game, mainly environment-related, and others character-related. Some examples of his work can be found on this update.\nErica V. Szalkowski\nThe latest addition to our humble team, Erica is assisting in the development of the game's many sidequests. Having two writers on the project will pay dividends, allowing for more variety and a fresh approach to many aspects of the characters themselves and the many problems they will face.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWow. There are so many challenges that developers face with a project like this, especially with a small team like this. I'll try to address as many as possible:\n\nKeeping a Consistent Art Style: Any custom game assets will be created with a consistent art style in mind. I know what to look for in good freelancers, from experience, and will settle for no less than perfect.\n\nTimescale: This is the main challenge. To deliver a product on time, you need a keen awareness of how long each phase will take. Freelancer schedules, illness, global catastrophes, and lots of other things can affect a project's deadline. Allow me to be frank (you can still be you) - if the game release date gets pushed back a month, or two, you can rest assured that it's because we're working DAMN hard to bring you the best game that we can.\n \nRunning out of Funds: A none-issue with this project. Everything that is pledged will be used to advance the project. We have quotes from freelancers on the areas that we would like to have them work on, and have a contingency margin, just in case. My skills in project management leave little to be desired.\n\nDelivering the Promised Product: Also a none-issue. Those of you who have dealt with myself before now will agree that I will lose sleep, go without eating, and ignore my family if that's what it takes to deliver. And we WILL deliver.

And when the required period of exclusivity ends, Gridiron Thunder will be available for all Android and iOS devices. And now that final NFL rosters are set and the NFL regular season is about to start, our good friends in the NFL are getting involved. Here is what Dezman Moses of the Kansas City Chiefs just said:\n\"I'm feeling this new football game @kickstarter. @gridironthunder http://bit.ly/gridironthunder\" \u2014 Dezman Moses (@DezmanM) September 2, 2013\nWe have only shown you a very small portion of what Gridiron Thunder is about so far. There is so much more coming!!! We will update you as other elements become ready to unveil. We just might let you play Gridiron Football against some of our NFL players and personalities when we launch our online play!\nUpdate #3\nA few days ago, we posted a short video and explained that the foundation of the game was in place and that we would start to clean up the rough edges. Here are some things that show the progress we have made since our last post. We are very proud of our developers and the progress they are making. You are going to get an awesome football game!\nUpdate #2\nHere's a short video and some UI elements from where the game was last week. While the visuals are still rough, a significant amount of the groundwork for the game, such as the AI, UI, mechanics, physics, data loading and controls, is already done and in place. While most of this stuff is not visible (as any game developer knows), the key to a great game is a great foundation and this is where we focused our efforts.\nDuring the next few weeks, we will clean up the rough edges that you now see and add local multiplayer, fantasy teams, and online multiplayer.\nUpdate #1\nHey Friends,\nHere's a Shout-out from Scott Fujita who is one of our most stalwart friends and supporters.\nMany more Shout-Outs and updates about the game to follow.\nWe are creating a new Indie pro football game called Gridiron Thunder for the OUYA, other Android devices, Apple devices and Facebook, and we need YOUR SUPPORT!\nGridiron Thunder will offer much more than your typical sports game.

One of the features that we are adding in is fantasy football. This won't be the regular fantasy football that you play with your friends and co-workers. Gridiron Thunder fantasy will allow you to actually play the game with your fantasy roster.\nPit Your Team Against The Best!\nAdditionally, we don't want you to be in the dark about what's happening in the real world while you're making a name for yourself as the baddest gunslinger in our game. That's why we are going to pipe in real-time news, stats, and scores into the game, so that while you are playing you'll stay up to date with the latest happenings in the football world. To make Gridiron Thunder even more immersive we will have live feeds coming into the game from some of your favorite pro football players' and personalities' social media accounts. \nWorking Concept For News And Social Media Center\nAll of these features will be built into and around an eye-catching, easy to play, and extremely fun football experience that you can enjoy with your friends. \nA big factor in deciding what features to add will be hearing about what you guys want to see in Gridiron Thunder.

We at Xaos Publications have been working hard trying to bring a new system and a new gaming opportunity to the market.\nMechanika was designed to truly embrace the Steampunk horror genre, while at the same time incorporating Magical elements. Bringing them all together in a way that makes them feel genuine, and fully realized. Mechanika (indeed all the Xaos games), is also designed to deliver a rapid fire cinematic tabletop experience. We call this genre of tabletop gaming: Cinematic Roleplaying.\nWe accomplish this in a few different ways.\nFirst, the system is designed to be easy to learn, with fewer types of dice in mind. Fewer types of dice means fewer types of rolls, fewer types of rolls means faster gameplay. All you need to play is a pair of percentile dice, and a set of FUDGE dice. This dice combination is simple, yet allows for a high level of customizability. It gives the game a system for varying degrees of success or failure. We have found that this ensures combat (whether social, mental, or physical), is quick, brutal, and rewarding.\nSecond, we give you all the tools to play what you want, how you want, from the very beginning. We have no classes or level system, resulting in an open ended free form development process, while still offering rich opportunities for character advancement. Character creation is deep and satisfying, with perks, flaws, bonds, back stories, and more customizability than you can shake a gas powered stick at. We want the characters you make to feel like they are the true stars of the game.\nThe Mysterious Sylvan\nThirdly, magic is magical and machina is amazing! In mechanika you have access to terrible and incredible powers through a force we call flux. We want it to be a truly spectacular thing to cast an incantation, or use a piece of artifice. But everything in Mechanika has a price, and the price can be dire indeed. Manipulation of flux can draw the attention of sinister beings and dark forces better left unmentioned, and unimagined. For this reason overusing these terrible powers can cause insanity, death, or worse. This gives your decisions weight and consequence; and makes success that much sweeter.\nFinally, we want the characters to feel like they are more than just players in a story. We want the characters to help create that story. For that reason we have implemented a destiny system. Allowing player the ability to earn points for roleplaying the aspects of their characters that make them unique. These points can then be used to make live in-game changes. Anything from rerolling dice to completely altering the scene in a measurable way. This keeps the GM on his toes and makes the whole experience more engaging for everyone, and therefore, more fun!\nMechanika is about Steampunk and steampunk is about building anything and everything. We want to emphasize that creation process in every aspect. From magic, to machina, to monsters, we give you the tools to build practically anything you can imagine.\nNo seriously.\nTake magic for instance. We give you 12 primary schools of incantation, With many specific abilities in each school. You can then mix and match spell effects, allowing you to create elaborate chained catastrophic effects on the fly as the situation dictates. Do you want to set an undead soldier on fire, teleport him into a group of his buddies and watch him explode? Yeah. You can do that.\nOr take machina, our version of steampunk gadgets. We give you a system of templates and effects to work with and you do the rest! Want to build a steampunk set of ironman armor? How about a bunch of exploding clockwork spiders? Done and done.\nThe Sturdy Dwarf\nFinally even our monsters are fully customizable. We give you a rich menagerie of terrible and dark creatures to choose from, and a full system of templates and conditions that can be quickly and easily hot swapped to allow for unpredictable and innovative encounters. All of this customization and cinematic experience would mean nothing if it didn't have a rich and interesting environment to live in. The world of Mechanika is that environment.\nThe game is set on an anachronistic Earth, following an alternate timeline filled with historical and fictional characters from throughout history. Mark Twain, Mr. Hyde, Rasputin, Queen Victoria, Vlad the Impaler, and Nichola Tesla. Just to name a few. Altered and augmented in dark and exciting ways, and given new roles in our new world.\nThe Incorrigible Mr. Hyde\nWe have reimagined Earths cultures and countries in a myriad of interesting ways, injecting them with a heavy dose of Lovecraft inspired cosmic horror and exciting high adventure, and We can't wait to show you our vision and give you the opportunity to be a part of the story.\nThank you for reading, we truly believe we have a fun and innovative experience here that will tailor itself well to both the new and experienced gamer.\nFrom all of us here at Xaos Publishing. See you in Mechanika.\nAs we near our goal we wanted to let you all know that we've got plenty more to come beyond what we've already shared with you.  We have a set of stretch goals that we will be adding to the project as we finalize the steps and challenges to bring these additions to you early.  This is our love and our passion, every level we climb during this kickstarter allows us to pay for production, design and costs to make sure like our core rulebook we deliver quality products to you.  Because good people deserve good games.\nIf we reach 125% funding ($4687.50), we will begin production on our first run of unique Mechanika Chessex dice sets. They will feature a Victorian style plus and minus side, as well as the Mechanika \"Pentagear\" logo for the blank side. Each set will have four fudge dice and one set of percentile dice. They will come in three colors: Old One Green, Rusted Metal, and Blazing Inferno. Stay tuned!\nHere is the mock-up for our dice designs. This is just in white of course for the purpose of showcasing the look. We can't do the color swirls justice with the mock-up so we aren't showing those but as soon as they arrive from production we will take shots of them and add them to our site to check out.\nFinish writing, clean-up, editing and page layout for \"It Started at Innsmouth\" Serial to be ready at game launch. Everyone who pledges at the 35$ rank or higher will receive a PDF copy of \"It Started at Innsmouth\" in addition to the ones already included.\nFinish writing, clean-up, editing and page layout for \"Enter Jack the Reaper\" Serial to be ready at game launch. Everyone who pledges at the 35$ rank or higher will receive a PDF copy of \"Enter Jack the Reaper\" in addition to the ones already included.\nReaching 200% funded will move us into more promotion and exposure but more importantly more chances to connect with you. At the 200% mark being unlocked we will put in our registration orders to PAX Prime 2014 & GenCon 2014. We love getting to show off our work in person and run demos whenever we can; this is another chance to share what we created with you.\nThis stretch goal is a pretty fancy one if you ask us, and a manual labor of love.  We have been making a new fancy set of GM screens to release into the wild.  None of that cardboard stuff; rust, metal, expandable pouches, chalkboard panels, and best of all modular.  More details in the updates section but suffice to say this stretch goal will let us pick up some machining tools to help speed up the production and save some skin on our hands.\nOur final stretch goal will take you deep into the mysterious land of Bohemia. Once the three separate countries of Germany, Austria, and Poland, Bohemia, and its sturdy, but distrustful people wage an endless war against the undead armies of the Eclipse empire. With this stretch goal reached we will begin the development of the first \"Gazetteer\" from the world of Mechanika. \"The Lands of Bohemia\" This Gazetteer will offer 10 new perks, five additional flaws, one aberrant school, five unique artifice functions, and 20 powerful new spell effects. This is it Kickstarters, and thank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlease join us and help us bring this world to print. The kickstarter goal we have listed will help us finish and print the Mechanika core rule book, and get our virtual store and products up and running. We also intend to have a bi-monthly magazine and serial adventure available if we can get help from fans like you.

Without the Queen of Blades to stop the hybrid\u2019s assault, the protoss are overwhelmed and defeated. In this reality, what would the survivors of these shattered worlds do? StarCraft Universe tells this story.\nStarCraft Universe (SCU) is a game mod (Note: it is not a standalone game) for StarCraft II. Originally named World of StarCraft, SCU focuses on telling an epic story and intense combat action, as well as highly replay-able multi-player experiences. StarCraft Universe will be released as a series of custom games published through Battle.net.\nThe objective of this game is to experience the universe of StarCraft from a third person view and master a wide variety challenges, missions, and raiding experiences. The focus of the game is to have a team of players/friends, creating/customizing their own hero character which they use to battle together through enemy forces and powerful bosses in a rich and living environment.\nPlease note that this is just a quick listing of the most important features within the game. You can get more information and details by taking a look at our user guide right here.\n- A unique story line by Ryan Winzen which plays out in an alternate StarCraft Universe.\nYou can read an introduction to the lore on our homepage.\n- Custom model assets:\nKiefer 'Ghostnova' Traub, arguably the best kit basher in the world, rips apart, dissects, then re-imagines Blizzard assets in his own vision by combining and altering models and textures from World of WarCraft and StarCraft II. His art form allows for the creation of fully pre-animated model assets much faster than building them from scratch, and often has an equally as impressive result.\nThe Hybrid Harvester is a twisted genetic merging of the Zerg Hydralisk and seasoned Protoss Zealot. Its unrelenting demeanor on the battlefield strikes fear into the even the most experienced combatants.\n- A wide variety of monsters, bosses and character classes\nLeft-Click on the icons to view an alpha video demonstrating some of the abilities for each class.\nClick class image for details.\nClick class image for details.\n- A persistent system to customize, save and load existing characters.\nEach character can be customized upon creation and its progress will be saved permanently until it is deleted by the player.\nThe game allows to save up to 8 characters which you can choose from.\n- Hundreds of customizable weapons, combat modifiers and equipment variations to choose from.\nStarCraft Universe features an advanced item system akin to World of Warcraft with a variety of stats, bonuses, and different gear slots.\nThe character equipment screen.\n- Single and Multiplayer experience\nAn intense boss fight in multiplayer.\n- Vehicle System featuring mounted multi-passenger combat\nThe game features an advanced vehicle system which allows the player to control vehicles. The vehicles are powered by fuel and have a unique ability set which differs from your class abilities.\nFighting against the Hybrid in a vehicle.\n- Item crafting system\nMany items will be obtained by crafting them, meaning the player has to collect various components which then can be used to build a new item using a blueprint.\nA blueprint which can be used to create a new item.\nA vendor selling blueprints.\n- Unique allocation ability system allowing the possibility of hundreds of unique builds per class.\nStarCraft Universe features a unique ability system that gives players a wide range of freedom when customizing their character.\nAbilities can be unlocked by paying with Minerals (this is the main resource in SCU). \nOnce an ability is unlocked, it can be learned at any time from a Class Mentor, adding it to the character's ability bar. An ability can also be unlearned in order to make room for different ones.\nThe capacity of the ability bar is limited, so it only allows the player to learn a certain amount of abilities at one time. Stronger abilities will require more points (combat weight) to add to the ability bar. This simple principle allows for heavy character customization for combat while giving the developers enough regulation to prevent flavor of the month (FoTM) builds..\nA class mentor can teach new abilities to the player.\nThe character stat boost allows each player to customize his character by using Outfitting Points to boost its stats.\n- Original Soundtrack!\nStarcraft Universe features a unique, original soundtrack composed by David Orr, an award winning composer for games, animations, television and film.\n\n- Fully voice acted cut-scenes!\nVoice acting is performed by experienced professionals such as Michael Gough (StarCraft, Diablo, Dragon Age), Danielle McRae (World of Warcraft, League of Legends), and Eric Dieter (Heroes of Newerth, The Leviathan Chronicles).\n- Many options to customize your game experience\nStarCraft Universe allows customization of nearly every aspect of the game including arranging the various graphical interface elements to suit one's tastes or changing of hotkey preferences. In addition, there are other game settings which influence combat or display behavior.\nThe game options menu.\nAlmost every UI element in the game can be unlocked and moved to a new position.\n- Difficulty and player scaling system\nThe game can be played in 4 different difficulty levels to be challenging and fun for players of all skill levels. It also features a player scaling system which automatically adjusts enemy strength based on player count. It doesn't matter if you play the game with two or five friends!\nDifficulty-Level information within the game.\n\n- Achievement System\nPlayers can earn tons of achievements within the game by completing certain missions, defeating bosses and sometimes by completing crazy challenges.\nThe achievement window.\n- Enemy, loot and strategy information directly within the game\nIf there is a problem defeating a certain boss or you are simply looking for a specific item, you may use the in-game strategy window which displays all this information directly within the game.\nThe strategy window displays ability information ...\n... as well as loot information directly in the game!\nPlayers already familiar with the MMO genre of gaming will pick up StarCraft Universe quickly, as the core game-play elements are very similar. For those who are not familiar with MMOs, we've developed an extensive user guide for players new to the game!\n- You must have an internet connection and a gaming PC/Laptop.\n- You must have a Battle.net Account. A Battle.net Account is the gaming membership required to play StarCraft II. You can sign-up at Battle.Net by clicking on \"Create An Account\". Sign-up is FREE and requires a valid e-mail address.\n- If you don't own StarCraft II, you will need to download a FREE copy of the StarCraft II: Starter Edition here. Since the file size is very big, downloading may be paused and resumed at your own discretion.\n- Downloading the project through the Arcade and start playing!\nWe must emphasize that all acts and expansions of SCU will be completely FREE to play through the StarCraft II: Starter Edition. You don't need to buy StarCraft II to play!\nYes and no! Here's a good article which clears up the confusion from 2011:\nWhile Blizzard is not directly affiliated with this project's production, we do communicate with them to submit bug reports and make technical requests. They have given their blessing/permission for us to launch this Kickstarter, and they are supporting our efforts by featuring SCU as an Arcade Highlight.\nUpheaval Arts is a small company formed in June, 2012 by the lead developer Ryan 'Kreation' Winzen. Made up of a small group of modding hobbyists, members of Upheaval Arts have been modding Blizzard RTS engines for over a decade in the creation of prototypes and custom games and are considered elite developers by Blizzard Entertainment.\nUpheaval Arts contracts talented industry professionals and entertainers, aiming toward AAA content creation. \nUpheaval is a company created by the fans, for the fans, developing one highly-demanded title - StarCraft Universe.\nUpheaval has been developing StarCraft Universe for over two years with no funding whatsoever, donating their time and effort to its development with no monetary reward. All developers on the project have had to return to work their normal day jobs, dramatically hindering the progression of the project due to its time intensive requirements.\nAfter releasing the StarCraft Universe Beta Prologue: Chronicles of Fate to the public, we're hoping to receive backing from the awesome StarCraft community to push our project forward and expand the team with sufficient funds to expedite the development process. With your help, we'll have the time, motivation, and resources we need to put that fresh looking AAA polish on SCU and get it out to you faster, better, and sexier.\nDeveloping SCU is just as complex and time consuming as developing a stand-alone. Remember we've had to build a brand new engine on top of the StarCraft II engine for this to work.  \n\nPrimarily, the money will be spent on the lead developers so we can produce the mod full-time just like a job. Split among us, we are taking a VERY small amount of money for basic living expenses over the next year of production. Remember that 80,000 quickly becomes 72,000 after Kickstarter and Amazon take their share, and then there's a 26% income tax on top of that. We also have to pay our voice actors, pay for software, hardware, our musical composer, and the list goes on. \nModding isn't anything like it used to be. People's standards are VERY high now, and to produce something of quality takes significant time, energy, and sacrifice. \nCan I play a demo of the game before I decide to back it?\nYep! One of the great things about this project is that we already have so much done, you can test out a single-player beta version of the Prologue! Please note SCU is still in the Alpha stages of some elements of its development, but it's fully playable and still enjoyable!\nTo begin playing, just log into your StarCraft II client, click on the Arcade button, and search for Universe in the reach box! We should pop right up!\n\nIf you don't have the time to play through online, or haven't downloaded the StarCraft II: Starter Edition, you can check out this game-play video, or search \"StarCraft Universe\" on youtube to view some of the many player-uploaded videos and see their reactions.\nOK. That was pretty cool. So, if this funding is successful, how will Upheaval Arts release StarCraft Universe, and how will it sustain itself to provide additional content in the future?\nWe will release StarCraft Universe as a series of downloadable games over Battle.net that are FREE to play with the StarCraft II: Starter Edition.\nBecause of our limited Staff, the first chapter we plan on releasing will be a multi-player open beta to test the core system functionality, combat balance, and progression rates of SCU through a gauntlet of challenges. Kickstarter pending, we will release this open BETA in late 2013/Early 2014.\nOnce we feel that all of the game elements are stable, we'll begin developing additional campaign missions as episodic content, released as completed.\nUpheaval Arts believes that the Arcade which Blizzard is currently developing to support mod game sales will sustain our ability to provide content for players throughout StarCraft II's lifetime, but we need your help to continue until that point.\nWe have the talent, we have the drive, and we have the passion - Now all we need is your help.\nEn taro Adun!\nThis grid reflects the current bonuses and add-ons to the original offers. Things have only been added to each tier. Nothing has been removed.\nAll in-game rewards will be awarded once the first map of the initial stretch goal is finished. In order to receive the rewards, backers will be notified via their Kickstarter provided e-mail with additional instructions.\nRelic aspect overview\nA relic aspect is a special piece of gear which changes the way your character looks and what stats it focuses on building. The class you are logged in with when receiving rewards will effect what Relic Aspect you receive.\nJudicator's Warshield\nThe class you are logged in with when receiving rewards will effect what Weapon you receive.\nPets will be awarded in the form of an item which can be used to warp in the pet. Please note that pets do not take part in combat. \nPets from left to right: Automaton 2000, Artosilope and Baby Ursadon\nVehicles will be awarded in the form of an item which can be used to warp in the vehicle. \nArmored Personnel Carrier, SCV and Troop Transport\nTanker Truck\n\n\nSCV: The SCV is a single slot vehicle which has a channeled repair ability which can restore health on friendly or neutral mechanical units. \nTroop Transport: This vehicle has multiple player slots. The first player who enters the vehicle is the driver and has access to its abilities, such as \"Engine Overdrive\" which makes the Troop Transport move faster but consume more fuel. \nTanker Truck: The tanker truck is a slow but durable mountable single-slot vehicle able to both tow and re-fuel other vehicles. Warning! If a tanker truck is destroyed it will instantly kill the driver and deal massive damage to both friendly and enemy units in a large radius. Can be used as a bomb in this manner if executed properly.\nArmored Personnel Carrier: This huge vehicle has multiple player slots.

Players create and maintain a military force to defeat their opponents. Here is an example of StarCraft II gameplay.\nWhat's the difference between a standalone game and a mod? \nMost mods are like mini-games, but like StarCraft Universe, some are complete re-workings of the StarCraft II engine which make the game play completely differently than it was originally designed. These custom games are created using the map editing program included with StarCraft II and are published online through Battle.net.\nWill I need to own StarCraft II or its expansions to play this?\nNOPE! The StarCraft II: Starter Edition, which is FREE, is all you will need to play StarCraft Universe!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we've already completed most of the core systems and functionality behind SCU, and we're permitted to use the endless assets provided by Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Editor, the risk factor is very low in our development.\n\nSome risks do include converting the RTS engine to run properly within a third-person RPG engine. Some players have experienced synchronization issues with the current camera systems and slight delay with input commands. This is an issue both Blizzard and Upheaval are aware of and working to remedy.\n\nThe biggest challenge we face is the time required to implement custom assets and script in content for players to explore, but with your monetary assistance we'll be able to eliminate many of the challenges of our lives, and focus on our work.\n\nIf delays in production do arise, backers will be notified of the issues via provided e-mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "StarCraft Universe AMA 8/20/2016", "update_content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4yqg8j/starcraft_universe_launches_in_a_week_ama_with/\n\nHey everyone!

They are standard engraved 16mm six sided numbered (or Fudge/FATE) dice, cast in zinc with an antiqued bronze finish, which, while probably not exactly like these prototypes, should be similar.\nWe also have Gearpunk dice available as seen above, though those are plastic Shapeways prototypes that I've dyed, painted and color shifted (on top), whereas these Tinker dice are metal Shapeways prototypes.  The Tinker designs and the Gearpunk designs will all be cast in solid metal for the final product.\nIt should also be noted that these dice are already available via Shapeways over in my shop, Tish Tosh Tesh Toys, which is where the dice in these photos are from.  I have them there in collector-ready form, singletons or pairs, ready to be printed.  They have been hollowed out to save cost, hence the holes in the corners, and they are still much more costly than they would be via this campaign's group order... but they exist.\nWe're trying to get a big group order together so everyone can get them in higher quality at a better price.  The final product will be solid, with no holes in the corners, coated with antiqued bronze, and will be cleaner.  Shapeways does fantastic work, but the nature of 3D printing simply leaves artifacts that a nicely moulded die won't have.  This does give them a certain character, though, which has its own charm, to be sure.\nWhy\nThere are plenty of custom dice out there. There are even a bunch of mechanical or steampunk styled custom dice. I've even designed some of them, the Gearpunk Dice over at Shapeways. So why make more? Well, dice are among the most affordable pieces of gaming art that can be made, at least if you can leverage the economy of scale and get a nice, big, juicy order to a manufacturer. Dice also are simply just fun little tactile toys.  Metal dice are somewhat less common as well, and these designs just seem to really work well in metal.\nI believe these designs to be unique and appealing, fitting with games that have a mechanical theme. I'd love to have some of these dice in my collection, and I'd love to get them to other people who might be interested as well. So, I'm bringing these designs to Kickstarter to see if we can put together a sufficiently sized order to make these Tinker Metal Dice happen at a good price point.\nWho\nI am T. Eshelman, or more frequently, just Tesh. I am a happily married father of four, technical artist and animator in the video game industry by day, game designer, artist and photographer in my hobby time. I fit the occasional blog post in as well, over at Tish Tosh Tesh. I love machinery and I love to see how it ages over time. I have a series of game components and games in mind that fit this Tinker theme, and this is one of the simplest, smallest piece of the puzzle. It's a good start to the larger experiment that is the Tinker world. Good machines are made of good parts, and I'm excited to see what we can build. Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to hearing from you as time goes on!\n\nRewards\nEach pledge tier has some mix of Tinker Dice, Gearpunk Dice or both.  You may mix and match in each design type, selecting from any of the unlocked designs for that type.  For example, an order of six Tinker Dice might consist of four Fudge/FATE Tinker Dice, and two numbered D6 Tinker Dice.  An order of 12 Gearpunk Dice might consist of a set of seven \"gamer dice\" (the D4, D6, D8, D10, D10decader, D12 and D20), a set of four Gearpunk Fudge Dice, and a spare D6 to make a neat pair with the other D6.\nIMPORTANT UPDATE:\nInternational shipping rates have been adjusted downward, I just can't change the pledge tier descriptions.  Please adjust as follows. I'm sorry there isn't a better way to do this (U.S. shipping is unchanged):\nIf you're pledging for 4 dice (of either type), please subtract $1 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 6 dice (of either type), please subtract $2 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 7 dice (the GEARPUNK GAMER tier), please subtract $3 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 9 dice (the NICE NINE DICE tier), please subtract $4 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nIf you're pledging for 12 dice (of either type), please subtract $6 from the Canadian and international shipping I ask for in the pledge description\nThe newest pledge tiers, SEEING DOUBLE and 31 FLAVORS, are unaffected by this, as they have the new numbers for shipping baked in.\nAlso, as noted in the Twisted Metal update, we're teaming up with the Mechanika: Empires of Blood and Steam RPG campaign to offer a Tinker variant of their Fudge dice design, which will be available as one of the Tinker designs you may choose from.\nAlso, in addition to the Pentagear Fudge Tinker Die design being added to the design pool, we'll also give you an extra one of them as a bonus (not another Tinker Die pick, just one of these specifically) if you pledge at any level with six or more dice of either type, and if you back their campaign (at any level, noting that you'd need to be at $35 or more to get the exclusive serial adventure, too... which may or may not have a \"kill ten rats\" easter egg).\nPentagear Tinker Die Mockup!\nOf special note is the NICE NINE DICE tier.  It functions as the collector's tier, where you are guaranteed seven Gearpunk Dice picks and two Tinker Dice picks.  (Which you may use on any designs, as in the other tiers, but it's tailor made for one of each die design.)  We're also throwing one Pentagear Fudge Tinker Die into that tier (whether or not you back the Mechanika campaign), and we'll also add one Gearpunk Fudge die since we cleared through the $10,000 goal that unlocked that design.  Yes, that makes the tier very cost-effective.  We kinda like it that way.  (Note that alternate finishes for the dice do not count as new dice picks.  If you want one of each design and finish, that's going to be the SEEING DOUBLE or 31 FLAVORS tier, if we hit $18,000.)\nALSO, because we appreciate those of you have pledged for a dozen dice in either type and don't want to seem like we're just paying attention to the NICE NINE DICE tier, we're going to make those 12-dice tiers a Baker's Dozen (13 dice) now that we've hit $10,000.  I can't edit the pledge descriptions, but I'll make a note of this where I can, and we'll be sure to note it in the surveys at the end of the project.\nSince we've hit $11,000, each order will come with one (or more) of three types of bag:  Simple Cloth Bags, Mad Science Cloth Bags or Leather Bags.  Just let us know which you prefer when the final surveys come to you.\nCloth bags that have been through the Mad Science Lab will look something like this, though there's not much predictability to the processing.\nYou blasted the campaign through $11,000, so we'll order a big batch of these leather bags and upgrade everyone at no extra charge. (Though if you want up to 3 extra bags, those are available as Add Ons at a charge of $2 each.)\nColors will be random. You can request a color, and we'll try to get it to you, but we can't guarantee anything.\nStretch Goals \nWe've stretched significantly past the base goal in the time we've been running so far.  Many thanks, everyone!  As such, we've unlocked the Tinker Fudge design:\n...and we've unlocked all of the Gearpunk designs as well.\nHere is the plastic prototype set of these Gearpunk dice, dyed a dark brownish purple and painted with a bronze paint to catch the highlights.  Of course, once cast in metal, the corners will be filled in (these are also hollow Shapeways prototypes).\nHere's another beauty shot by a kind lady who printed them in black via Shapeways then did some painting on them:\nIt is important to note that the company I have lined up to do these weren't able to use my source 3D files, but I gave them the 2D art for the faces and plenty of photos of these prototypes and Shapeways renders, and they are confident they can match the shapes.  Since we are dealing with this sort of secondary setup, there's a bit of risk involved, that we may not get a precise translation, but I'm going to work hard with them to make sure that it's as close as possible.\nSpecifically, they are ready to make four sided dice (D4), six sided dice (D6), eight sided dice (D8), two kinds of ten sided dice (D10, D10 \"decader\"), twelve sided dice (D12), and the important twenty sided dice (D20).\nWe're getting them all in standard sizes (16mm for most, 20mm for the D12 and D20), so they should fit into most dice collections.\nThe Gearpunk dice do cost more to produce, so there are different pledge tiers for them, and there is an add-on system (see below) so you can get some of each type, since mixing and matching the Tinker dice and the Gearpunk dice would make for too many variables.\nThank you all again for your support thus far!  It's great to see these received as well as they have been, and I'm really looking forward to getting them made and shipped out to all of you!\nSince you all pushed the campaign to the lofty heights of $14,000, we're talking about a new stretch goal at $15,000, wherein we'll offer all but the Pentagear Fudge die in an alternate finish.  As yet, we're undecided on what finish that will be, so please go check out the poll at my blog, Tish Tosh Tesh, and let us know what second finish option you'd add to the antiquated bronze base:  a pure zinc finish or antiquated copper!  (Yes, these are photos of medallions, not dice, but they are from the production company, so should be at least relevant.)\nPoll over thisaway!\nKicking it Forward\nWe've also updated and decided to participate in the Kicking it Forward initiative.  There are a bunch of great projects out there, and this community is filled with awesome people.\nAdd-Ons\nSince we've introduced the Gearpunk designs, and the prices are necessarily different, we're using Add Ons to let you pick up some dice from the type other than your base pledge's contents. \nPlease note:  Just to keep things cleaner, you may only do each of these once on your pledge.  So, you could add on up to twelve (12) Tinker dice and seven (7) Gearpunk Dice and up to three (3) bags, if you felt so inclined, but no more.\nTo add TWO (2) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $8 to your pledge.\nTo add FOUR (4) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $16 to your pledge.\nTo add SIX (6) Tinker Dice to your order (any mix of the three designs), please add $24 to your pledge.\nTo add ONE (1) Gearpunk Die to your order (any of the available designs), please add $6 to your pledge.\nTo add TWO (2) Gearpunk Dice to your order (any of the available designs), please add $12 to your pledge.\nTo add FOUR (4) Gearpunk Dice to your order (any of the available designs), please add $24 to your pledge\nTo add ONE (1) Bag to your order (any available type), please add $2 to your pledge.\nTo add TWO (2) Bag to your order (any available type), please add $4 to your pledge.\nTo add THREE (3) Bags to your order (any available type), please add $6 to your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs have been preapproved by the production companies, so there shouldn't be trouble there.

You\u2019ll have under your lead every single detail of war: logistics, equipment and diplomacy, which are as important as leadership and cold blood in battle. \nDo you enjoy strategy videogames like X-COM? The powerful machines from Mechwarrior? Sci-fi universes as we\u2019ve seen on Stargate? Black Talons gives you a bit from all of these, mixed up with real time tactics veterans in mind.\nYou will lead your forces from a battlecruiser where new troops and mechs can be recruited, trained and customized. As the commander of the company, you must decide which missions to accept, and carefully manage your reputation amongst all the existing factions.\nSquads and Mechs are persistent in Black Talons; you can choose and upgrade your own army the way you like it. The surviving units of each battle learn new skills and abilities, and will get more powerful with earned experience. Squads from other factions can also be recruited... if the company has previously gained their trust. And sniffing around the black market could also be a source of additional weapons and equipment for the battlecruiser. Build a powerful warship and become unstoppable! \nIt's the year 2179.\nHumankind has reached and conquered the stars long ago; alliances and nations are born on distant planets. But there are also new struggles on the horizon... \nThe United Space Federation tries to maintain order and negotiate peace with the Alliance of Free Worlds, formed by dozens of planets and star systems where warlords and governments rise to power.\nYou'll join the Black Talons, a mercenary company that have been hired by the Noctae Republic to do a simple job: help a small army mount an organized defense against an overwhelming invading force, the Tzanar Union. \nBut things quickly go sour. When Black Talons arrived in Genai, Noctae\u2019s homeland, the planet had already been overrun by Tzanar\u2019s forces. Noctae\u2019s remaining forces had scattered and retreated to the forests and wastelands. Black Talons find themselves stranded in an occupied star system and surrounded on all sides by enemy forces. What started as a simple contract is now a fight for survival. \nDo you have what it takes to prevail?\nThe Black Talons need to fight for their survival, standing against enemy armies and expanding their influence into new unexplored planets. The company need to manage both powerful units and strong allies ,which also can be recruited from other factions by doing contract missions. Missions allow you to earn money; as a commander, you decide wether to spent it on equipments, units or new recruitments from other factions.\nEvery mission or contract will have a different objective. For instance, capturing resources, destroying buildings or eliminating units, personnel rescue, infiltrations, ambushes... And keep in mind that units can't be used and killed like cannon fodder. Reinforcements can be called from the battlecruiser during the mission, but even these are limited to the available troops.\nYou will travel around different planets and various regions, chasing or evading your enemies, and facing rain, snow, fog... even ionstorms! Think fast and readapt your army in order to beat not only the enemy, but also the environment. \n\u25aa Persistent and customizable squads.\n\u25aa Deep campaign mode. The actions of the player directly affect the balance of power on the system. There is one main objective to achieve, but there\u2019s much more to do, and many different gaming experiences to discover.\n\u25aa Customizable Battlecruiser. The Battlecruiser serves as the base of operations, and can be customized with weapons or infrastructures that will boost the squad numbers, teleport soldiers or even bombard the battlefield.\n\u25aa Advanced Diplomacy System. Your reputation will affect your relations with the factions you encounter, allowing you to trade or forcing you to fight them.\n\u25aa Upgradeable and unique (per class) skill tree for all units.\n\u25aa 5 worlds with different environments and weather conditions that directly affect the battle: rain, fog, snow, ionstorms and more.\n\u25aa Different unit classes with specialized roles: Recon, Tactical, Assault, Support, Engineer. Each class can carry a different set of weapons and has its own abilities. \n\u25aa Powerful mechs can enter the battlefield with salvaged or bought equipment and weapons.\n\u25aa DRM-free for Windows, MAC and Linux versions\nThe Black Talons have infantry and mechanized units at their disposal. Infantry units fall into three categories: light, medium and heavy armored. Light armored squads are faster and stealthier and can perform specialized roles like recon or sniper units. Heavy armored squads are slower and less agile, but are able to carry heavy weapons like chainguns and laser cannons.\nInfantry squads can perform different roles depending on their armor type, each equipped with different gear, weapons and abilities: Scout, Tactical, Assault, Support, Engineer and Sniper. Allied factions can provide specialized troops with unique abilities; a great complement to the Black Talons unit.\nAnd don\u2019t forget about the icing on the cake: mechs. They vary in tonnage and hardpoints, and can be equipped and customized with the weapons available in the armory, ranging from laser and projectile cannons, large chainguns and missile launchers.\nThe funds will be used to cover the development expenses of the game, ensuring that we're able to keep our view on the design and vision of the game without outside interference. This means covering the expenses of programming, art (2D & 3D), production, audio and QA.\nThere\u2019s already been extensive work of pre-production, where we outlined and designed the whole project: graphical assets, timings, levels, gameplay mechanics \u2013 everything that is needed to successfully complete the game.\nIn the chart below, you can see how the funds will be used:\nThe biggest slice goes to programming and art \u2013 about 40% for each. This includes gameplay, game mechanics, AI, level design, concept art, unit design and software.\nWe intend to create an awesome soundtrack \u2013 epic, futuristic and action oriented. Music will make a difference bringing a scene alive, and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not overlooking. We\u2019re choosing not to use royalty free stock music, but instead, customized and unique themes.\nAnd there\u2019s something that we definitely don\u2019t want. And that is to rush production. That\u2019s why we reserve part of the funds for Quality Assurance. The game won\u2019t be released without intensive testing and bug fixing.\nBack in 2005, three friends tried to make a shoot 'em up game, just as part-time fun. It was released in 2006 and sold an astonishing amount of 5 copies.\nAlthough the game was a flop in terms of sales, the three friends decided that they wanted to make more games and pursue game development professionally and full time. They then made a second game and entered a game development contest in Portugal, winning the \"best game\" and the \"best visual art\" category. \nThe three friends were the founders of Camel 101. \nSince then they've learned a lot and worked on a multitude of platforms ranging from PC, to mobile and consoles, releasing a number of successful titles over the years - starting with casual games - but eventually shifted their focus to strategy & wargaming, which is their true passion. \nThey're now using all that passion, knowledge and experience acquired over the years to create a fun, powerful and entertaining wargame that you'll hopefully enjoy.\nRight now you\u2019re probably thinking. Who are these guys?\nWell, come and meet the team!\nBruno is the tech and engine expert. He\u2019s like these guys in the matrix that look at something and see strange codes passing on the screen. He handles most of the coding.\nBoris is the graphics wizard. 3D art and vfx are his specialties. Don\u2019t mess with him or he\u2019ll make a photorealistic image of a pig with your face. Most of the 3D art in the game is made by him. \nRicardo is a software engineer, but it\u2019s said that he mostly bugs the team with deadlines and strange charts that only he understands.\nObviously we can\u2019t make such a game just by ourselves. We also work with several artists through outsourcing.

When a wealthy and eccentric noblewoman from British Hong Kong named, Lady Cushing, hires the father/daughter duo, they are instantly thrust into a world of intrigue, lies, danger and excitement in which the balance of worldly power rests unaware, alternately in both the calloused hands of Sho Tinker and the gloved hands of Lady Cushing.\n1st Season Overview\nThe wealthy and eccentric adventure-seeker, Lady Cushing, attempts to complete the life\u2019s work of her late father and older brothers, with the help of a well-known father and daughter team of inventors called, the Tinkers. \nBy engaging the services of this world-famous duo, Lady Cushing hopes to build an unprecedented device from a set of incomplete plans created by her father 15 years earlier. The \u2018contraption,\u2019 as she calls it, is supposed to provide sustainable energy and is to be demonstrated at what will surely be a triumphant presentation at the 1899 World Exposition in Paris. If successful, this device will provide cheap and abundant power to the general public and likely change the world, but this innovation threatens the status quo and for that there are repercussions.\nWord of this device has even caught the attention of renowned inventors and energy pioneers, Nicola Tesla, Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse, as well as cutthroat businessman and financier, J.P. Morgan. The corrupt energy utilities of Western America, most notably the Ministry of Water & Power and the Gasworks, have each dispatched their agents in an effort to thwart the Tinkers and Lady Cushing.\nHer well-equipped entourage, lead by the courageous Captain Alexandra Victoria Brian Pelham, intervenes but Lord Blackwelder has a plan to maintain his dictatorship over the American nation\u2019s valuable and extensive power resources. With an energy war on the verge of erupting, an additional obstacle surfaces, provided courtesy of the notorious masked criminal, Jawbreaker, who runs interference at all parties, by playing both sides in this emerging battle for power and the wealth that typically accompanies it.\nNow when you say \u2018Web Series\u2026\nThe Web Series is planned to consist of 14 first-season \u2018Webisodes\u2019. \nTINKER aims to expand the boundaries of Steampunk science fiction by further transforming it from what many know as just an aesthetic to evolving it into a multi-ethnic, culture- exploring, collection of stories that does for Steampunk what Star Trek did for science fiction back in the sixties. \nConcept Art by Johnnie Quan\nThis includes: mature themes, exotic locations, sub-plots, drama and action, always making the effort to keep true to the 'punk' in Steampunk by going outside currently established 'rules' of the genre, and fusing the diverse talents of several industries into a new kind of steam-powered animal. Even if you don't actively follow the subculture of Steampunk, there is still something here for you.\nHerzhaft 7ft Giant Robot\nSTEAMPUNK PARTNERS plans to distribute the show initially on the Web. The episodes would be available on both the TINKER Web site: www.TinkerSteampunkSeries.com as well as on Vimeo.

The music will be as diverse as the Tinker's travels taking the audience on journey's of beauty, adventure, classical, the darkness of a corrupt system, and of course just plain fun! As this Kickstarter is for the Pilot. The remaining music of TINKER and the soundtrack will be funded by a PledgeMusic campaign following our Kickstarter campaign. A double disk featuring the original score on disk 1 and bands tracks on disk 2. Our bands are steampunk themed, or steampunk fans themselves that want you to hear their vision of our steampunk inspired world.\nFeatured in our Kickstarter fundraising videos are: \nThe Anix \n3 Piece from Southern California known for their sonically massive choruses, and constrained electronic verses. Inspired mainly by film rather than music. \nBirdeatsbaby \nOrchestral rock quartet from Brighton/London, UK. Birdeatsbaby are far from your average rock band. Incorporating a varied collection of influences, the band combine piano-lead power-pop with orchestral and melodic rock, resulting in something that sounds hauntingly original and delicate.\nOther Artist's on board Tinker are:\nGood Co, Violet, Savi0r, Chamber of Echoes, Arcane Dimension, Psyche Corporation, Marquis of Vaudeville, Shovelman, Arthur A. Belekonov.\nMore to be announced!\nWardrobe\nSome of the wardrobe, jewelry & accessories in TINKER will be by: Generations of Art, The Blonde Swan, Steampunk Obscura, Nonconformity, Dr. Brassy Steamington, Kelly's Heroes, Wonderland Corsets, and Silver Leaf Costumes.\nThe Pitch Video\nThe content of the pitch video does not reflect the final production value and feel that will be TINKER. McCune Design & Mr. Hardberger will become involved in TINKER once it has reached it's funding goal.  It is a conceptual pitch video of minimal budget featuring costumes provided by some of the cast. The majority of wardrobe will be completed after the completion of our Kickstarter, to finally begin this ambitious projects world creating.\nNarration by Shelley Avellino, and Tommy Mack. \nAdditional music by www.pacdv.com/sounds\nKeane played by Tommy Mack, Lady Cushing played by Tabitha Marsden. / Herzhaft Giant Robot developmental stage\nWhere will your hard earned money be going, and why do we need your support?\nSome of you might be thinking we have talent involved that has worked on big movies why do we need your money, we must be rich right? While we wish we were rich, we aren't. As evidence that this is our 3rd attempt at crowdfunding. Times are tough for creatives, and those big names don't come free, no matter how much they love our project. \nOur goal of $20,000.00 will cover: Pre-production, Production, Sound, Musical Score, Inicial Original Music for the Soundtrack, Wardrobe, Props, Sets, and all other essentials to create our Pilot. Without your support TINKER will develop at a crawl.  \nPre-production\nIf we raise funds beyond our goal, then the next expense is the all important Marketing. After that will come more production value on the pilot, then the next priority will be the episodes planned for the first season, and even more production value by bolstering the current budget in all areas, all only possible with your support!\nBare minimum once we have our high quality Pilot other opportunities to sustain, and continue the series will be available to us. Aside from the soundtrack, it is our preference to not rely on crowdfunding after this initial kick start. We will try our best to utilize alternatives, or in the least greatly reduce the funding we need from future crowdfunding until the series develops a strong following.\nWe support the http://kickingitforward.org/ movement!\nRewards!!\nMore rewards viewable & larger images ->HERE<-\nChoose your flavor of the TINKER Pilot: \nHD Digital Download, DVD, Blue-Ray DVD Combo, or the Deluxe Collector's Edition Blu-\u00adRay / DVD Combo!

We'll ask about additional names in the reward survey. If you have questions, feel free to message me. \nThe HPLFF started almost 20 years ago in Portland, Oregon by Andrew Migliore. After years of attending and contributing, filmmaker Aaron Vanek went insane and spawned an HPLFF in his hometown of Los Angeles. This is a licensed franchise of the Portland fest, but each festival has its own distinct brand of madness. \nThe first three LA festivals were successes but paid for out of pocket and just missed breaking even each time. Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the same excitement and entertainment this year without your help. Our savings are drained so without YOU we'll be hard pressed to maintain and improve the quality this independently run horror and weird tale film festival has had in the past. \nEaten Last - Thank you!

Joshi (editor) and Steven Gilberts (illustrator) - With eight psychotropic visions of damnation and transformation in the urban coral reef of San Francisco, COPPING SQUID forms a mosaic of otherworldly menace shot through with glimpses of awe-inspiring majesty: of invisible outsiders and self-medicating seekers whose desperate prayers and hidden rituals lead them to behold their alien reflections in the all-seeing eyes of the secret masters of creation. \nThe Womb of Time by Brian Stableford (author), S.T. Joshi (editor) Cyril van der Haegen (illustrator) - From Britain's master of the fantastic comes a pair of insidious new novellas that combine the pulp existentialism of the Cthulhu Mythos with a counterfeiter's eye for masterful literary forgery. \nTHE WOMB OF TIME: The rustic English village of Dunwich is slowly crumbling into the sea, but a rare tidal event promises to roll back the waves and reveal ancient ruins, buried treasures and the lost true crown of England. Three scholarly pilgrims have come to Dunwich for their own secret reasons, but as they gather at The Hidden Crown, the mysteries that summoned them begin to take on a life of their own, and the seashore offers a brief but shattering glimpse of the ultimate Other. Dreams and debates intertwine with nameless, sentient dread to form a daring deconstruction of the meaning and menace of Cthulhu.\nTHE LEGACY OF ERICH ZANN: Music hath charms to soothe the savage breast, but in the wrong hands, it can open doors to spheres of infinite evil. When a murderer stalks the streets of Paris on the trail of Erich Zann, only Europe's greatest criminal investigator, Auguste Dupin, can hope to foil an insane scheme to take up where the mad violinist left off. With deft craftsmanship that transcends pastiche, Stableford introduces a brilliant reincarnation of Poe's seminal detective to the cosmic irrationality of Lovecraft's Mythos, with explosive results.\nRadiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk two novels by Cody Goodfellow - \nTHE BEGINNING IS NEAR - From a ruined chemical weapons bunker in Iraq to a shallow grave in California's San Andreas Fault, the lines are drawn for a shadow war that will decide who, or what, will inherit the earth and reign as the next dominant species.\nThe Electric Eye, Copping Squid, The Womb of Time, Radiant Dawn and Ravenous Dusk are all courtesy of Perilous Press\nStrange Aeons & Morbid Adventures - A miniature skirmish game of Eldritch horror: The aim of a miniature skirmish game is to enact battles between two opponents on a tabletop. In the case of Strange Aeons, one player takes control of a band of heroic Threshold operatives and the other player acts as the evil Lurkers.

Lovecraft Film Festival & CthulhuCon - Los Angeles"}}, {"backer": "Mark Taormino", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "For the Love of Pie and Pi\nEver since I learned the formula to find the circumference of a circle, I have longed for the day to create a Pi shaped pie. After talking with many Pi enthusiasts, it seems that they have had that same desire. The goal of this project is to help geeky cooks around the world celebrate March 14th in style.\nNow some people have indeed created Pi shaped silicone baking molds, but this product has fallen short. For starters, you can't even bake a pie in a silicone mold, so what's the point? Also, if you do make a cake, when you flip it over and someone takes a slice, you are left with this amoeba looking form that makes no sense to the poor guy at the back of the cake line.\nBrownies are exceptionally tasty in Pi Pie Pans because you get tons of crunchy edges.\nWe made this first run of Pi Pie Pans to solve this problem, giving the ability to make a perfectly baked Pi shaped pie to the world for the very first time. Furthermore, because you serve the pie from the tin, even the last guy to get a slice can still can get the joke and realize that you are the geekiest person in the office. It turns out that the Pi Pie Pans bake great, and not just for pies. Brownies and cornbread are awesome because of all the edges that you get.\nThis is what our Pi Pie Pans look like without any yummy filling.\nDesigning Pi Pie Pans, 2010 to 2012\nIn 2010 I had left my company to try to start a software business. While this ultimately never was able to take flight, I found myself incredibly creative at this time, working on different iPhone apps, blogging as well as coming up with different ideas for products. Being a food blogger and a bit of a math geek, I thought it would be spectacular to create a Pi shaped pie pan when my preliminary search yielded no product in the market. I dusted off my Autodesk Inventor skills and drew up some preliminary CAD drawings to show to friends.\nOne of the first designs of the Pi Pie Pans in 2010 - pretty crude, huh?\nThe feedback I had received was positive - people just couldn't believe that there was not a Pi shaped pie pan. Unfortunately, the project would stall for the next couple of years as I had to re-emerge into the workforce (man cannot live on hotdogs and potatoes alone) and just didn't have the time, or know-how, to manufacture an item.\nAnother prototype design of the Pi Pie Pans in 2010.\nThis all changed in the spring of 2012. One of my friends from middle school, Philip Butler, remembered the concept for the Pi Pie Pans. Philip believed in the idea and worked with a classmate and friend of his at MIT, Chris Possinger, to get the pan designed up to the correct specs needed to manufacture it.\nPi Pie Pans prototyping in 2012 - the pan begins to take shape!\nWe went through several molds in the summer of 2012 and ultimately got our first prototype in the fall of 2012. \nSome of the molds that were made in the evolution of our Pi Pie Pans.\nAfter that time we worked with the manufacturer and received our first small run of finalized product in the first half of 2013.\nGetting back one of the first functioning prototypes of Pi Pie Pans.\nNot Pie-in-the-Sky, Our Team Can Get It Done\nOur team is led by an individual with a strong order fulfillment experience. Philip runs a distribution business that ships products all over the world. He has a keen understanding in the shipping challenges and has set up a system to rapidly pick, pack and ship products to the end consumers, perfecting this in his business for the past three years.\nCornbread made in Pi Pie Pans turns out well too - I like mine with jalape\u00f1os.\nChris has a background in mechanical engineering, material sciences and manufacturing. He has been the interface with the manufacturer overseas to ensure that the mold and fabrication of our pans fulfilled our vision. Through his efforts, we were able to produce an manufacturing die to shape the pans in the summer of 2012, our first prototypes in the fall of 2012 and our initial small run in the first half of 2013. We did a small run of pans and have full confidence that our manufacturer can handle additional subsequent requests on a longer run. If, however, this project was to explode (which we hope it does), we would be interested in exploring further options to decrease lead times in order to get our product out to our bakers.\nIn addition to having a background in Industrial Engineering, logistics and marketing, I love to eat pie.\n\nWith the Pi Pie Pans team, experience and current manufacturing provider, we foresee no problem with satisfying our backers needs for the Pi shaped pie pan.\nDon't you want a cherry pie like this? Please back our project today!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe made an initial run of several hundred Pi Pie Pans, which took a little bit of time. One risk is that our current supplier couldn't meet the demand if this project absolutely exploded (which, of course, we hope it does!).

However, we have recently had some reports of pans becoming discolored after being washed in a dishwasher. This problem is not unique to the Pi Pie Pan: search for \"aluminum dishwasher discoloration\" and you'll find all sorts of horror stories. It seems that in 2010 a new EPA regulation forced the removal of phosphates from dishwasher detergent [ ], and the new detergents have a different mix of chemicals that can oxidize and discolor aluminum. This discoloration is cosmetic, and the aluminum of the pan is non-toxic, but we understand that these pans are also decorative items, so we wanted to send out a warning and recommend that people NOT wash their pans in the dishwasher."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Pi Day 2014! #PiPiePan", "update_content": "Happy Pi Day Eve Kickstarter Backers!\nI hope that everyone is excited about the big day!

Thank you all so much! If you're in the San Francisco area, please join me in celebrating the completion of funding this evening!\nSee the collection as I scan it on Tumblr\nMore information at WalterKoessler.com\nI have a hundred page photo album with nearly a thousand photos my great-grandfather Walter Koessler took in World War I. It's in pristine condition, beautifully preserved by my family over the last hundred years in Southern California. They've even saved the negatives\u2013 untouched, crisp and unfaded \u2013and a box of stereographs from the war and the early 1900s.\nThis album is a real treasure. Trained as an architect and conscripted into the German Army directly from the classroom, Walter became an officer in the reserve artillery battalion and he took advantage of many unique opportunities to record his experience on film. He captured the haunting experience of building and living in the trenches, the sunlight pouring in through the broken windows of bombed churches, and the clouds through the wings of biplanes as an early aerial reconnaissance photographer. After moving to Los Angeles to work as an art director in films, Walter made this album. The story the book tells begins with a pack of young men playing at war and ends with their crushing realization of what war really means.\nThese photos have captivated me for nearly two years, even after paging through them hundreds of times. It's an unbelievable, rare and intimate story, a deep look into the first world war you can't find anywhere else.\nThe images deserve to be seen and appreciated in the context of their whole story. They're compelling on a digital screen, but having spent many hours with the originals, they are significantly better on the pages of a book you can explore as a physical object. If I can find enough supporters and meet a minimum order requirement for this ambitious project, I will create a book from this album at its original size with my notes in the margins so you can have this full experience with history too.\nSaint Quentin Cathedral, August 1917 (Walter Koessler) - October 2012 (Dean Putney)\n\"When Dean first shared this discovery with me, I knew he'd found a rare family history treasure \u2014 but I don't think I, or he, or anyone realized at first what a treasure of shared world history this collection would turn out to be. It's such an amazing story: a time capsule from an ancestor, finding its way to the hands of a young man who works in the digital world. I'm glad Dean is able to preserve it, and I'm happy to see it shared with the world.\" - Xeni Jardin, Boing Boing\nAs seen in:\nWhat I'm doing\nI want you to experience this part of our shared history. I've done a lot of research about the photos in this book and Walter's journey. I even went to France to attempt recreating the photo above. This project means a lot to me and I've spent a lot of time working on it.\nMy goal is to scan and archive each image in the book, make an annotated version of it in its full form, and share that with all of you. I've already begun this process by posting some of the pages and their photos on Tumblr. I also want to print these images in a book roughly the size of the original, with space for my notes and closeups in the margins so I can share my research.\nDigital images are neat because they don't take up space, you can zoom in closer than the eye can see, and they are easy to share. But the images in this book belong together, not separated or in a mishmash online. They deserved to be printed, held and spent time with. They're a priceless, rare look into forgotten age that you'll come back to again and again.\nThe book itself will be available in high resolution PDF form and as a high-quality offset printed, casebound 11\"x17\" coffee table book. I've rejected vanity press for this project because it's absurdly expensive at nearly $1 per page, and it greatly limits the sizes at which you can print. Each book would cost over $150 and the quality would not be worthy of Walter's work. I've begun researching the best ways to do photo printing, found a printer, priced it, checked paper samples, and begun laying out the book. These are going to be really beautiful prints, with a fold out page in the back for the large aerial panorama. A collector's item for sure and much higher quality than a vanity press could deliver. Here's a blank copy of the book's actual materials, this is the size and format I'm making it at:\nI need supporters to help me approach a 1000 copy minimum order quantity so I can move forward. When ordering a book from the non-early bird levels, you'll also receive a print from one of the book's photos.\nI'd also love to get people following along as I scan images so they can spot things I wouldn't normally see and share their expertise. The Internet has been invaluable in identifying military equipment, locations, people and much more. For backers $25 and above, you'll receive access to high resolution images of prints and negatives as I scan them so you can see my progress and pitch in if you'd like. Definitely get in on at least on this level, this stuff will knock your socks off.\nThe goal here is to have rewards dated for December 2013 in your hands before Christmas. I cannot guarantee that will happen (see Risks and Challenges section), but if I meet my funding goal I will do everything I can to meet this goal.\nI hope that this project will make you consider the stories in your life. How do you create and record new ones? How do you review the ones you've already made? How do you preserve the stories from your family? Go make those stories something you can share, can't ignore or forget, and want to spend more time with.\nHigh level rewards\nFor those of you particularly interested in early 20th century photography, military history or World War I specifically, I have some very special rewards for larger backers.\nStereoscopic View-Master\nWalter took fifty nine stereoscopic photos throughout the war. These show military equipment, biplanes, and possibly a crucifixion in 3D when seen through the proper viewer. I'm planning to make classic View-Masters and reels of the best ones to make viewing these images easy and fun! You'll also receive digital versions of the stereograms in anaglyph magenta/cyan and side-by-side formats. I'm expecting to be able to include four reels of six images for each backer here, but I may be able to make more if there are enough backers at this level. Here's an example of one of the 3D photos as an animated GIF:\nTriptychs or panorama\nThese photos are incredibly detailed, and as I've been scanning the prints and negatives I've found nuances and hidden bits you can't see in a small image. Walter took photos that tell stories, and I'm curating a few triptychs for this. These may change in the future as I find more negatives, but here are some mockups of possibilities. You'll receive options from me if you back at this level.\nTrenches\nChurches\nThe back of the book will include a fold out copy of this aerial panorama Walter took, with annotations of trench and front positions. This reward level will have an option to receive a print of this panorama instead of a triptych. The book board will be removed in this image.\nPrints from the original negatives\nI've started experimenting with printing photos in the darkroom using traditional photo enlarging and processing techniques from the original negatives I have, and the results so far are exciting. \nAs I work with these images, get better and larger paper, and learn more about enlarging them, these photographs are only going to bring you closer to the day they were shot. Walter's negatives are pristine and clear, and he took many wonderful photos. Printed large, they show details you just can't see with the naked eye.\nI won't be making many prints. The negatives are nearly a hundred years old now, and I'd really like to put them back in storage. But for the few of you who want a beautiful and rare art print from the original negative, this is a great opportunity to get one made for you. Few people have negatives from this era, and I doubt anyone besides me is crazy enough to actually print from them now. Sizes to be determined, but at least 8x10, and I will provide a series of images for you to choose from.\nVisit from me, showing of all the materials, and discussion\nI want to make these photos available for the hardcore enthusiasts to see first hand. It's so much fun sharing the story and images with people, and I could talk all day to the ones who are most interested. So let's do that.\nAt the highest tier, I'll fly out to your gallery, museum, club or organization with all the materials I have. We can spend a day discussing them and going through everything. I've limited this to five so that I can prevent undue stress on the album and materials, but I've priced it relatively low so that small but determined clubs still have a chance of organizing a meeting. Can't wait to meet you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter. It's been a long time in the making because I believe this is a deeply important thing to share and share right. Here are some points I expect may present challenges and how I intend to reduce the risk behind them.\n\nI have never written or published a complete book before. Fortunately I am getting excellent advice from print designers and publishers who do this regularly. Since I work for major online publishers (boingboing.net, Kevin Kelly and others), many of my friends have made books and print products before, and the printer I've chosen comes highly recommended by the publisher of Coilhouse Magazine, so I'm confident that I'm in good hands. I've already begun the layout of the book, received financial quotes and checked paper samples. I've set out a timeline from now until I plan to ship, and I'm ready to commit to it. I've given myself a substantial time buffer between each stage of the process to prepare for things going wrong.\n\nI expect shipping physical product to have some unforeseen hangups. I have first-hand experience in seeing this done, but I have not done it myself. I've consulted with experts in retail shipping to make sure my timeline and goals are reasonable. International shipping is particularly risky and troublesome, but I've already begun pricing it out and preparing for it. I am hiring help with packing and shipping once the books arrive to make sure this goes smoothly.\n\nPrinting large numbers of photos is new to me. I've priced this out, done test prints, and begun learning more about printing from negatives. I've got experience printing high quality photographs, and I've connected with SF Photoworks to print the reward images. I've done test prints at RayKo Photo and I'll be working with them to create the best traditionally processed prints from the negatives I can. I've been working with photos for years, but I've never printed them in large quantities, so this is an area I'm actively learning more about to get the best results.\n\nAlthough unexpected production challenges will undoubtedly arise, I've spent a year and a half and plenty of my own money on this already, and I will not give up until you get your rewards. I look forward to you joining me in reliving history through First Lt. Walter Koessler's photo journal of World War I.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "From Grandma's closet to the museum walls!", "update_content": "Dear friends,\nJust about all rewards have been shipped to backers!

Here is how it will unfold:\n150K Let's Bring In The Team\nHere is where we can really begin to play. Hitting the 150K mark will fund additional episodes featuring our spectacular website columnists like John Ary, Eric \"Quint\" Vespe, Glen \"Merrick\" Oliver and more, more, more! We will dig into the glorious insights and secrets hiding out in the darkest reaches of their brains, and include live talk back with the studio audience; all within a new set built especially for this level of interaction, a true, \"Cinematic Playground\" if you will. It will be wild, uncharted, unmanageable and not to be missed!\n200K Beyond The Studio\nHitting the 200K mark will fund an additional batch of episodes that feature people who just can't get down to the Austin studio; so the crew will go to them! We have so many opportunities in this category that that it could develop into a feeding frenzy! So we'll be using your feedback via Twitter polls to sort through them and prioritize. We plan to go wherever this takes us!\n250K AIC Special Event Episodes\nHitting the 250K mark will allow us to expand the reach of the Ain't It Cool with Harry Knowles studio to create a special event with the Alamo Drafthouse and the Austin Film Society that I have long dreamed about doing: a large capacity, affordable classic movie event that includes the actors, filmmakers and craftspeople who made it happen. The resulting live interviews, footage of the events and the in-studio interviews would be integrated into an extended length bonus episode that fully explores this great talent! \n300k The Big Enchilada Meets Crepes\nDreaming big comes naturally to me, especially when it involves what I can do to please our Ain't It Cool community. With another 50K, we'd take our homemade green chili enchiladas to Cannes, or Sundance or Toronto or SITGES or ComicCon, exact festival to be determined by YOU by TwitPoll, and capture those moments of insight and pre-news-break scuttle on what's coming for the coming year. Even at 50k, it won't buy us any yacht time, but hey, we've got the best enchiladas! Plus, we're resourceful... The people who matter to us most will respect that! From this we will create one or more bonus episodes and make them available to the entire community before anyone else gets to see them! But you won't have to wait that long to reap the benefits as we will be sending out enough live time updates, clips, mini videos and pics to make you feel like you are right there with us!\nWhat Happens If We Go All Veronica Mars?\nUhhhhhh... I guess we'll throw one hell of a wrap party! \nAnd then let's aim for the moon!!! Instead of being limited by impossibly small budgets that have us perpetually robbing Peter to pay Paul, the realm of a serious 300K+ budget would put us in the position of acquiring a multiple year lease and customizing the studio as a full on production hive for our own projects and many others! With a permanent studio home, we could go far: help foster new filmmakers, help other kickstarter projects take off and teach multiple generations about the breadth and scope of cinematic cool! I would really love to help continue to make Austin shine for film events; the more resources that come together, the bigger and better this whole cool thing is gonna get! For example, hiring additional crew and studio help and growing the talent pool for gonzo cinema journalism and imagination. Plus, including other collectors with film history in their possession to join us and give magical life to those objects! \nThe Martini Shot\nMy crew and I want to thank all of you for being a part of our crazy dream at whatever level you can handle. We know firsthand how much  dedication and sacrifice it takes to support a career in the arts and recognize that most of you have your own projects for which you are also pursuing funding. We have bootstrapped it, paid it forward and dumpster-dived with the best of you and we hope that you will see the potential for the Ain't It Cool with Harry Knowles studio and show to serve all of us who so passionately believe in the transformative power of storytelling though the film arts!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks? Challenges? For those of us who have spent years as a part of the Ain't It Cool News community, this is a no brainer. Me, my director Brett Hart, my production designer Suzette Soucie and my entire crew are on board for Season 2. We completed 30, yes 30 episodes for Season 1 in 7 months, using a format we invented on the spot. This inaugural season earned us an International Academy of Web Television nomination, accolades from film luminaries such as William Friedkin, and best of all, the delight of our fans. \n\nEven with the new features we're including for Season 2, delivery is a sure thing. And to keep the guest lineup filled with multiple options for this season and beyond, we have brought on casting director Jaime Gallagher, incredibly well connected in Los Angeles and currently casting the next Coatwolf Productions feature film. \n\nFor those of you who are new to our little party, you are in for a wild ride with the Ain't It Cool News community. I founded Ain't It Cool News in 1996 and worked tirelessly to grow it into the film fandom powerhouse of today. Our community is made up of the most passionate fans of the art of film based storytelling, and I usually feel like the most enthusiastic one of all. Between myself and my co-writers at Ain't It Cool News, we view, review, analyze, and discuss more films than we can count. And then we do it again! We care about film history, film futures, the indie industry, the studio industry, the stories behind the movies, the stories behind the stories! And so do the almost 1 million visitors who are on our site daily. If you have ever loved a film, hated a film, wanted to make a film, or are a filmmaker already, then you are one of us.

After each game, players are hungry to play again with a new captain and to try their hand at a new strategy or play style.\nComponents List\n20 Captain Cards\n40 Bounty Cards\n40 Port Cards\n60 Cargo Cards\n60 assorted coins\n6 coin bags\n1 white and 2 red dice\n6 Colored Ship Pieces\n1 Map Game Board\n6 Ship Tracking Boards\n30 assorted track markers\n1 Wind Marker\n\nGameplay\nThis game was meticulously designed to be fun for both new initiates and seasoned players. We love playing board games. We also have a very large group of friends with diverse interests. Our challenge was to create a game that could be enjoyed by anyone who we wished to play the game with. The result is a game that has been enjoyed by children, teenagers, adults, and grandparents. The game takes a relatively short amount of time to explain (even to non-board game players), yet allows for deep strategy and rewards adaptive foresight.\nBy supporting this project, you will allow us to finalize the production of a game which we have been playing for over a year and a half. Our prototype game is a blast, but we would love to bring the production in line with other games you may already own. It is our belief that Privateer deserves a spot on anyone's gaming shelf, or can be the first game to start one!\nShipping\nPrivateer will retail for $50. On Kickstarter we are offering the game for $45, which includes shipping in the US (a significant savings.) For backers in other countries, there are some increased costs for shipping:\nCanada: Add $10 to your pledge total (down from $20!)\nEU: Add $10 to your pledge total (down from $20!) *Remember, you may also be responsible for VAT*\nEverywhere else: Add $20 to your pledge total\nThe object of the game of Privateer is to be the first captain to amass a total of 20 \"Infamy\" points. Infamy is a measure of how fearsome, clever, and skilled your captain has become throughout the entirety of the game. Infamy can be gained through upgrades to your captain's ship or through the accumulation of powerful and rare Relic cards.\nEverything in Privateer is based off of your captain's upgrades. Upgrades can be purchased in any of the game's four unique tracks, which are detailed as follows:\nSails: This track determines how quickly your captain's ship can sail between ports. A higher sails score allows you to visit ports more frequently, catch and attack other ships, or even outrun other ships altogether. \nCrew: This track governs your captain's influence. Throughout the game there are a large number of events which may transpire during play (called Fortunes). When a Fortune occurs, captains with a high crew score often receive larger benefits than captains with a lower score. For instance, during the Parley Fortune, each captain rolls a six-sided die and adds the result to their total crew score. The captain with the highest total roll may receive a free upgrade to any of their four tracks!\nCannons: Upgrades to this track will allow your captain to best other ships in combat. This track is essential if you wish to plunder cargo from other ships or if you want to ensure that your own cargo will not be plundered by other aggressive captains. A captain with a low Cannons score can often fall prey to continuous attacks from greedy captains with an eye out for easy plunder.\nHold: This track affects a captain's ability to store cargo. Simply put, the higher a captain's Hold score, the higher the number of goods he or she can carry and trade at a time. This is often a very important track for merchants, or even for pirates who often plunder large amounts of cargo at one time. What is the use in plundering cargo if you have nowhere to store all of your hard earned booty?\n\n\nAll of Privateer's captains are wholly unique, and have special abilities that increase a player's ability to utilize different track upgrades. You will often want to play to your captain's strengths in order to ensure victory. Often, however, a player may choose to play their captain in an alternate way depending on the way the game is transpiring. There is no wrong road to victory!\nIf you like your project, please consider backing us and sporting this nifty backer avatar:\nBacker Avatar\nTo add the avatar, Right click the above image, select \"Save As\", and save the image on your computer. You can changed your avatar on Kickstarter by clicking on Me -> Edit Settings -> Picture.\n Our goal on Kickstarter is to fund our project to a total of $25,000. We arrived at this figure by approaching many different game manufacturers and calculating costs, as detailed below:\nOne-time costs: These include costs for creating molds, developing artwork, and ensuring our legal compliance.\nProduction costs: These costs include the per-unit cost to produce and ship one game of Privateer.\n\nWe believe very strongly in this game, and we have brought the total funding goal lower than what we believe is necessary by investing a good portion of our own money to cover production costs. As such, we don't want to just successfully fund this project, we want to see this game in as many homes as possible! In order to ensure the quality of the game reflects the interest of our backers, we would like to offer the following additional rewards for all backers who will receive a copy of the game. Each Stretch Goal will be unlocked when the total funded amount reaches the amount detailed on each rung of the boards, as detailed below:\nEnsignia Games is a small game company consisting of Rick Barnes, Braven Carver, and Zackariah Schuster. Originally we were just three friends who all loved playing Privateer, but after exploring our options and then realizing how talented each of us were in our own rights, we decide to take a risk and develop our own company.\nEverything produced so far has been done through our own hard work and through the charity of a lot of great friends and family. We are unbelievably lucky to have access to such a huge network of immensely skilled videographers, artists, marketers, CEOs, designers, and even fellow game developers. \nA huge thank you to Robert Bagby, who has helped mentor us every step of the way. None of this would have been possible without your help, Bob.\nA big thanks to all of our family and friends, especially Judy Secor and Dawn Schuster, who convinced us to make this project a reality.\nAlso, a shout-out to Bill Trammel (of Catan Boards fame) for the early Kickstarter help and to r/boardgames on Reddit.

I would love for games to be in backer's hands before the holiday season, and artwork will be the one element that could have the potential to postpone that goal. \n\nAs such, a great amount of our resources will be spent in art creation.

The dungeons change each playthrough and always offer new situations to handle. Crypt Run presents combat, exploration, and collection in a playful medieval fantasy world. What makes Crypt Run special is its unique death mechanic -- the game isn\u2019t over when you die in Crypt Run!\nNote: now all $15 rewards and higher come with a free copy of Lava Blade (for Windows, Mac, and Linux).\nPlay the early demo in your browser!\nCrypt Run screenshot\nGameplay\nCrypt Run is a desktop Windows and Mac game that can be played with a keyboard or a gamepad. The action takes place in dungeons, which are comprised of a series of rooms packed with interesting monsters, traps, and loot. Explore the rooms to collect powerups and dodge hazards. Attack and kill monsters by throwing swords, daggers, axes, and other fun weapons.\nWant to see Crypt Run in action? Play the early demo in your browser or watch this gameplay video:\nDeath is just the beginning!\nDesign on Crypt Run is driven by the theme \u201cDeath is just the beginning.\u201d Any decisions made about the game revolve around that theme. \nThis theme has also been applied to the game mechanics. When players die in Crypt Run, they find themselves transported to the Realm of the Dead. This new realm has an otherworldly appearance and is inhabited by evil dead creatures (some of which you yourself put there!). In this way, dying begins an adventure in a new realm. (This unique death mechanic will allow for extremely deep gameplay, including challenges that require transporting between realms to complete!)\nCrypt Run gelatinous cube\nDark medieval fantasy theme\nAlthough it\u2019s a hardcore game that requires considerable skill to play well, Crypt Run\u2019s art style is intended to be accessible and lighthearted. Since the game involves so much blood and death, we feel that these heavy themes are easier to consume in large quantities if delivered with a playful aesthetic. Though Crypt Run is a cartoony game, its subject matter is quite mature!\nCrypt Run giant spider\nProcedurally generated dungeons\nThe dungeons in Crypt Run are procedurally generated, meaning they are randomly created by the game during runtime. We apply heuristic techniques to make the level design feel as handmade as possible. Our goal is to provide a fresh and exciting experience every time you play Crypt Run!\nProcedurally generated dungeons!\nOpen Development\nWe believe in developing out in the open as much as possible.

Geoff Blair and Matt Hackett founded Lost Decade Games in 2010 and have since released Lava Blade, Lunch Bug, and Onslaught! Arena (as well as an assortment of small mobile games). Joshua Morse has done the music and sounds for all of our games.\nGeoff Blair\nGeoff Blair\nGeoff Blair is the principal architect and co-founder of Lost Decade Games. His chief influences are Shining Force, World of Warcraft, and Final Fantasy Tactics. When not chained to his desk, Geoff loves to spend his winters hurling himself down snow-covered mountains on a snowboard. His apartment has more cats than people!\nMatt Hackett\nMatt Hackett\n\u201cTechnical artist\u201d is probably a good label for Matt Hackett, since he handles all of the visuals for Lost Decade Games. Also a co-founder, he spends about half his time on game art, the other half writing scripts to make the art feel more alive. He\u2019s also an award-winning foosball player!\nJoshua Morse\nJoshua Morse\nJoshua Morse is an accomplished video game composer and songwriter. Heavily involved with the video game remix scene (including plenty of contributions to OverClocked ReMix), he was referred to as \u201cmaster of funk\u201d in the June 2012 issue of Game Developer Magazine!\nWant to know more about Lost Decade Games? Please download our press kit or contact us.\nThe Music of Crypt Run\nCrypt Run\u2019s music has been inspired by the Sega Genesis era, especially by classic Climax adventure games such as Landstalker and Shining Force 2. Joshua is diligent about matching visual aesthetics to sound design, and has developed a warm, retro feel for Crypt Run\u2019s unique soundtrack.\nWatch the below video to hear some beautiful Crypt Run music:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nHere at Lost Decade Games, we currently pay the bills by making small games (like Onslaught! Defense) and licensing them to game portals. These portals seek quantity over quality, so they want as many small games as they can get -- and that\u2019s not what we\u2019re all about! Our passion is to develop large games that offer players plenty of depth and rich content.\nAll of Crypt Run's development so far has been out of pocket. If we aren't able to fund the game, we'll have to stop development, and find other ways to pay the bills.\nWith your help, we'll be able to finish Crypt Run!\nWhat are the funds for?\nOur budget will buy us just enough time to finish Crypt Run. This includes a few months of fleshing out the content, polishing, fixing bugs, finishing features, and finalizing the death mechanic. We'll also be able to afford awesome new sound effects!\nAn important thing to note about Kickstarter is that it works on the \u201call or nothing\u201d framework. If we meet our funding goal, we get funded and the game gets made. If we miss the funding goal, even by just $1, the game will not get funded and we get nothing.

Either way, the only people who will be receiving two sets of packages are people that ordered , because there obviously wasn't a way to make those work in the same box without destroying everything.

I've contacted a few of those folks already, have a few more messages to send today, and will be reaching out to everyone else tomorrow looking for updated addresses.\n\nNow the bad news:  I got a note from the post office that quite because the shipping company didn't include customs forms, which is surprising considering that I but whatever.  Nevertheless, there's a decently-scary stack of boxes on the floor of my apartment that need to have customs forms hand-written out before they can be shipped.  I'm very much hoping that, aside from just being a tremendous pain in the balls, this return-to-sender situation didn't also cancel out the postage stamps the mailing folks had affixed to the packages, because international shipping is expensive as hell and I don't want to have to fight the mailing company to reimburse me for their screw-up. \n\nRegardless, I've got a couple good pens handy and intend to have all of those returned international packages back in the mail by Friday afternoon.  I've heard some nightmare stories about delivery time on international parcels, but hopefully you won't have to wait too long for your stuff. \n\nAnyways, aside from a few random loose ends that will inevitably pop up, that should be it for this show.  Thanks again for all your patience on this project, guys.
