Do that here!\nYou can also Follow us on Twitter or join our Discord.\n\nABOUT THE GAME\nWhisker Squadron is our fresh take on forward scrolling aerial combat, featuring feline heroes, dynamic missions, and procedurally generated bosses and worlds!\nComing to PC and consoles in 2022\n Wishlist on Steam | Website | Twitter | Facebook | \n\nHey everyone! \nWe are Flippfly, the team behind 2013's Race The Sun. We are so excited to let you know about our new project, Whisker Squadron!\nClick banner to wishlist Whisker Squadron right now!\nWhisker Squadron is the culmination of a creative spark that was lit over 20 years ago, and that has burned in us through our careers, and strengthened by modern indie games. When we created Race The Sun in 2013, we took aesthetic cues from classic low-poly games like Star Fox for the Super Nintendo, and created something with a uniquely minimalist feeling that was loved by our fans. Ever since that project shipped, we\u2019ve talked about creating a follow up that was more combat-focused, and that pushed the procedurally-generated elements even further.\n\nWhisker Squadron is that game.\n\nChoose your pilot and fight your way through procedurally-generated worlds and epic, procedurally-generated boss fights. You've got one life, and your tactical upgrade choices will be crucial to your success in this aerial roguelike.\n\nEngage in epic aerial combat with your feline pilot of choice\nTake on a series of epic, procedurally-generated boss fights\nFight your way through dynamic worlds in a mission that's unique every time you play it\nAnd there's more:\nProcedurally generated, rogue-like mission structure that's unique every time you play\nIncredibly dynamic procedurally-generated bosses that make for intense climax to every act\nChoose your pilots from a cast of 3 feline heroes\nDaily challenges and leaderboards\nDon't just take our word for it! Here is what the games press is saying about Whisker Squadron:\n\u201cSome of the bosses look downright inspired\u201d - PC Gamer \n\u201cIf this is where the game is starting in the public eye, I can\u2019t wait to see where it ends up.\u201d - Polygon \n\u201cIt's early days yet, but yeah, I'd play this\u201d - Rock Paper Shotgun \n\u201cWhile on the surface Whisker Squadron looks like Starfox with cats, the addition of Race the Sun\u2019s elements make it a very different game.\u201d - Hardcore Gamer \n\u201cThe foundation of a tried and true rail shooter mixed with procedurally-generated level design, roguelike gameplay, and striking art design is a solid one for Flippfly.\u201d - Shacknews \nWhisker Squadron is a corridor shooter with procedurally generated worlds, some light roguelike elements, and a cast of cats! Pilot your ship, avoiding obstacles and blasting the autonomous bots built by the sinister PAW Technologies corporation in an effort to save the galaxy from out of control algorithms bent on planetary destruction.\n\nThe game follows an action rogue-like formula: You get a single life to play through a 3-act campaign through several worlds and random space encounters, each with their own looks and threats. Challenge yourself to acquire higher rankings by avoiding damage, blasting all the bots, and keeping your multiplier high to earn the most rewards for beating each world.\nChallenge isn't everything, so we also offer a set of customizable gameplay settings instead of traditional difficulty settings. Start with more shields on your ship? Encounter less enemies? Get health pickups at the end of each world? Go for it!\nAnd if you want a nightmare, the settings will be there for you masochist-cats as well...mewhahaha\nDynamic mission map\n\nPlay as multiple characters, each with their own unique special weapon. Along the way you'll encounter shops and events to acquire a choice of new weapons and items to powerup as you make your way across the galaxy to stop the bots. Each play-through is unique, with each world being procedurally generated from a set of 'pattern' chunks, and a map that presents different connections and choices.\nAnd it's not just the worlds which are generated: each act culminates with an epic battle against a large enemy bot, and the bots are always looking for improvements so you'll have to keep on your toes each play-through because this bot is procedurally generated for a unique battle each time!\nJin is our character artist, and has drawn our wonderful cast of cats. Here's a few of them:\nSean is leading the way on the visual development for the game, using the custom world editor that we\u2019ve built for this game. We\u2019re evolving the minimalist style we developed with Race The Sun, and adding layers of visual flair on top. What you see on this Kickstarter page is a work-in-progress. We\u2019re improving the visuals more every week, and we\u2019re confident that the final look will blow you away.\nWe\u2019re also super excited to be working with Chel Wong on the game\u2019s original soundtrack. Chel has an amazing range of styles and really nailed the feeling that we\u2019re going for with this game. You can hear her work in the trailer above!\n\nHere\u2019s what Chel has to say about working on the Soundtrack:\n\u201cFor the soundtrack I have so many ideas I'm excited to work on! I plan on taking some influence from predecessors in the genre but also going to be putting my own spin on things. And as is my specialty, I can't wait to see what kind of adaptive layers I can put into this soundtrack to react to gameplay!\n\nSOUNDTRACK PREVIEW\nhere's a little preview of what Chel's cooking up for the soundtrack. This is the track for Lunar Canyon, along with the \"boss variant\" that will play at the end level boss fight.\n(Note: this is a work-in progress, Chel is still in the process of adding some sweet guitars!)\nHere are a few of the more unique Kickstarter-exclusive rewards we're offering!\n\nPUT YOURSELF IN THE GAME ($200 and above)\nYou'll send us a photo of yourself, your pet or anything that's age-appropriate, and we'll add it to an object in a special \"Easter egg\" level that players can access in the game itself!\nPut yourself in the secret level, rough concept\nADD YOUR FURRY FRIEND ($500 and above) \nYou'll send us a picture of your pet, or some artwork of your personal animal persona, and we'll add it to the game as a secret playable character, unlocked with a unique cheat code.\nYour furry friend in the game, rough concept\nCUSTOM SHOUT OUT $1000 and above)\nWe'll send you a survey and code up a special conversation with the characters in the game, who will give you a shout-out by name, activated by a special personal cheat code. We'll work with you to make it special!\nCustom shout-out, rough concept\nAaron San Filippo is a co-founder of Flippfly and the company\u2019s lead programmer. He\u2019s overseeing production and code, building new tools to support the design of the game, and coordinating the team. He also built the prototype for the game and helps out with design.\n\nSean Campbell is the designer and creative director. Sean helped Flippfly build Race The Sun\u2019s portal worlds, and has returned as the world creator and Whisker Squadron\u2019s creative director. He\u2019s also leading the efforts on the game\u2019s 3D art. \nAaron, Sean, Chel, Jin, Chris, and Zaire\n\nChel Wong is a seasoned composer with multiple game soundtracks to her name. Chel works in a variety of styles with an incredible range, and she\u2019s creating an awesome original soundtrack for Whisker Squadron.\n\nChris Atkins joined Flippfly recently as a programmer, and is helping flesh out Whisker Squadron\u2019s gameplay.\n\nJin Li is a concept artist and animator from Sydney, Australia. She created and drew all of the characters for Whisker Squadron and contributed concept design.\n\nZaire Lanier is a writer and narrative designer from the Midwestern US. She's creating a comic called The Bone Herder, and will be helping create the WS universe, characters, and in-game dialog.\nJune 2021: beta-level backers and above get early access to the beta on PC\nDecember 2021: game is content-complete and enters final phase of testing\nMay 2022: The game launches and all backers get a PC copy\nJuly 2022: All physical and digital rewards are delivered.\nMost of the funding for Whisker Squadron comes directly from Flippfly. We have been working on this game for about a year, and we are in a fortunate situation where Race The Sun and our other games are providing a steady income stream that\u2019s allowed us to work on the game. However, this Kickstarter will be essential for getting us over the finish line, and if we reach our stretch goals, will allow us to create an even better game, and guarantee an on-time delivery.\n\nWe\u2019ve invested a lot of Flippfly funds in Whisker Squadron already, supporting a small core team to build about 1/3rd of the game so far. We are on Kickstarter to raise funds to help finish the game and expand our team. This money will help us create an original soundtrack, add additional features, and finish the game sooner.\nYour support means the world to us! Our fans have always been central to Flippfly\u2019s success, and you are quite literally making this project possible. Thanks for coming along for the ride and being a part of our dream project!\n\n* Platforms:\nAt this time, we are planning for Steam, Epic Games Store on PC. We're also looking into PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch We will finalize these plans in the coming months and keep you updated!

Last year, we successfully launched our brand thanks to the support of more than 590 sponsors who helped us not only to fulfill our dream but to go beyond our wildest expectations!!\nDuring our first year, we have shipped many orders around the world, and we have grown thanks to the support of thousands of people who believe in us and who have given us their feedback to help make our brand even better.\nWe are back once more to ask for your support to turn our latest and biggest endeavor yet into another Rogue Fang success story: We are of course talking about our new line of sexy trunks and boxer briefs!\nReady? Let's go!\nThe Deer\nThis is \"The Deer\", it gathers the design fundamentals of our jockstrap from the same name. Elegant, refined, and playful. \"The Deer\" is made to enhance your curves while providing comfort. Colors: Light blue and black.\nThe Wolf\nHere is the sturdy one\u2014\"The Wolf\", being in yellow and black, and like the Jockstrap version, it has a faux pocket in the pouch that adds extra comfort even in the heaviest situations. Colors: Yellow and black.\nThe Behemoth\nFinally, we have \u201cThe Behemoth\u201d featuring a straight cut both in shape and design and with a punch of lime and black colors that is sure to stand out as the highlight of any underwear collection! Colors: Lime (Green) and black.\nWe have decided to return to Kickstarter to finance our new line because we are still a small brand with limited resources, unlike other large fashion companies, we cannot run the risk of creating a new line with the large outlay that this entails.\nHowever, thanks to the experience gained from the first campaign, we have been able to pinpoint the requirements to take the project to the shore safely. The minimum we must reach on this occasion is 18,000\u20ac. Because we already have logistics and partners that help us, we have been able to opt for better prices and quality.\nIf we exceed the 18,000\u20ac goal, we will be on our way to unlock better rewards and stretch goals! We have very special things waiting, we just need your support.\nStretch goals unlock items included in the selected rewards and are granted if the goals are met, in that case, you're receiving goodies at no extra cost!.

With the designs already polished and with the samples reviewed and approved, we have only minor adjustments left before sending them to production.\nFirst of all, these estimates are subject to change since, as you know, the world is fighting against a global pandemic that affects many areas such as production and logistics.\nStraight to the point, the project needs at least one month to funded, around 2 months for production with  +/- 30 days of shipping to our warehouse. That makes around 3 months of work, so we will be ready to make the first shipments in February 2021.\nThis time we will ship the items despite your geographical location, whether it reaches you sooner or later depends exclusively on how quickly you answer the form \ud83d\ude0a\nThanks to our experience acquired during this year of activity, we have access to better shipping prices and greater control over the particularities of each country in terms of shipments.\nPlease allow me to talk personally as I want to thank WhiteLeonard for his hard work doing those awesome artworks and helping with designs, logos, etc. His help is invaluable and thanks to this Rogue Fang keeps progressing.\nI also want to thank all the people who have helped Rogue Fang to improve through their feedback and to those who posted photos and videos excited to receive their order. \nLast but not least, I want to thank my friends (and you know who you are!) as they have helped me lots when it was needed.

That means that you can slap a design on to their website and put it up for sale right away. No start up costs and no planning whatsoever. It also means you don't get to assure the quality of your product, nor your print. It means you have no idea who made your clothes nor the conditions in which they are manufactured. It means you are likely sending out products to customers with your design on it that are poor quality and badly made. It means you're limited to making whatever they are capable of printing on.\n\nAt Nomad Complex, we don't do that. We refuse it. \n\nEvery piece of clothing we put out passes through our hands from start to finish. From the concept of the design, to its creation, to the materials used to create our garments, to sampling what the final product will be before it goes out to a customer, to packing and shipping everything ourselves. This way, we know what quality of merchandise you're getting because we've been in charge of it - Every step of the way. \n\nThis process foregoes the ease and low setup cost that comes with print to order, however, and to create these quality clothes we turn to Kickstarter to procure the funds to do so. You couldn't have clothes of this quality created on a print to order website - Or at all. \n\nWe've already sampled the products. We've done the testing. We've put them through the wash 60 times to ensure the colors won't fade. Now it's time to get them into your hands.\n\nSay NO to cheap quick clothes. Say YES to quality clothes that'll last you for years.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nWe have tested dozens of material samples and stitching techniques in order to ensure a long-lasting quality in all of our loungewear. Digital sublimation printing ensures a long-lasting print that can stand dozens of washes as well as take heat well in the dryer. We continue our commitment to quality assurance at every step and refuse to ever resort to dropship fulfillment services for our products - Every product you receive is inspected, packed and shipped by our own staff, not a third party.\nReusability and recyclability\nAll of our clothing is designed to be your new favorite piece. We reject the idea of fast fashion and outfits you wear only once - We embrace the idea that a piece of clothing is something to be loved, cherished forever, worn to death, stitched back up, and passed on to someone else if you no longer wish to have it. That's our mantra.\n\nAll of our packaging is minimal - We do not wrap our clothing in harmful plastics. All of our shipping materials are made from 100% recycled materials.\nSustainable materials\nAll of our packaging materials are made from 100% recycled content.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nWe have been working with the same manufacturer since we began our company in 2016, and have personally verified the conditions and quality of the area where our clothing is produced. Not only that, but we've even had a hand in running the presses once or twice ourselves.\nSustainable Distribution\nDid we mention our motto of loving your clothes until they die? We mean it. Anyone can buy a certain color of a pair of pants, or they can buy cheap clothes that will only last them a few wears before they get thrown away, but ours are different. They'll stand up to everything you throw at them, and they look so good that you'll never want to give them away.

With your help, we can reach this goal and more. \nThe ArtworkTee team is experienced with crowdfunding, having had two very successful campaigns on Indiegogo, raising money for Last Chance Corral horse rescue and Flatbush Cats rescue. In total, we have raised over $80,000 for charity via crowdfunding in 2019 alone.\nFor this campaign, our initial goal is to raise $3,000 USD. This money will go to things like card processing, fees that go to Kickstarter, and the costs to produce the rewards. We are dedicated to providing the highest quality shirts for you guys, so we are making sure to spend the resources to get the best ones that we can. As we reach stretch goals, then the additional funds will be used to purchase those items and prepare them for shipment.\nEven if you can't afford to support this campaign, don't worry - you can still help by spreading the word about this fundraising campaign!

The first season is only 3 episodes long and revealed the season's main world idea:\nNOTHING IS REAL.\nSally is a 6 year old girl, with quite a twisted mind, making up all the stories in the show.\nBut why?\nIn season 2, we will recieve a closer look into Sally and her imagination together with a new extended cast! \nWatch season 1 of Sally HERE.\nSALLY started as part of our student university project. The original plan was to create a three part web drama and run this across various social media platforms. \nHowever, the show garnered an overwhelming amount of love and support.\nThe production team had little idea how the pilot would be received, but in the six weeks after its premiere on YouTube, the show gathered an astounding amount of attention; ranging from numerous comments, fan-art, and support for the show as well as wholehearted demands for more episodes. \nSo now, we're raising money to continue the show. \nWe care about this show so much, simply because it is something we always dreamt of: Being able to create fun content online for an audience.  We had no idea what would come of it but over the past few months we watched the show and its fanbase blossom. \nAs this was a university project it was scheduled to be completed at the end of March 2019, and us then completely move on to a new project in April. \nBUT we don't want to end this series as we have a lot more ideas where to take the show and would love to continue making more episodes. However, the show costs a lot to produce so we need your help to continue it and to evolve the show into something that truly will make a positive impact on the fandom! \nThe next season will have a way greater production value than before. A new team, new skilled volunteers, and restriction-free storytelling!\nSECOND ATTEMPT!\nThis is our 2nd attempt at raising funds!\nOriginally we planned to raise \u00a312,000 to hire those who would be leaving university right now and would be looking for work. Unfortunately we failed in our attempts to do that.\nBut we're not the ones to give up just yet! Instead, we now gathered a small team of people to create the show as a voluntary passion project. All the money we raise will go towards travels, accommodation and food for everyone helping to make this show! Any additional money will go into future episodes and creating merchandise!\nYou can check our first kickstarter here.\nOUR TEAM:\nWho would've thought: we're a group of passionate Furries. Initially, we started out with 6 people. After the student project 3 of us stayed together to continue the show. Though we receive help from you guys and people we know in the film world, be it through volunteers, equipment or funding! :)\nChantelle/Yoka - Creator and Manager\nA Fursuit Maker who has been on YouTube for many years and always wanted to create a successful show starring a diverse range of characters. One of her favourite shows is Bojack Horseman and her favorite company is Pixar.\nEm - Producer and Writer\nAs an aspiring producer and writer, it has always been a passion of hers to write and create shows that are unique and quirky within the horror/thriller genre.\nCarlos - Director, Photography and Content Production\nA photographer and content creator aspiring to one day become a film director. He sees this series as a chance to make his mark in the industry, assisting in his pursuit of a prosperous career in film making. With a load of ideas for sub-arcs and stories for the series, the future for the show looks exciting!\nFinn/TraaaashPanda - Graphics Designer and Social Media Manager\nA german hobby Graphics Designer and aspiring Content Manager.

The first series takes place in London where a young teenage wolf named CODY gets swept up in trouble for a crime he didn't do. The first season is only 3 episodes long and revealed the seasons main world idea.\n No one is real.\nSally is a 6 year old little girl, with a twisted mind, making up all the story's. But why? In season 2 we will get a bit more of a look into Sally and why she is telling the story's that we are watching. As well as a new cast of lovable character. \nWatch Season 1 HERE:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWtkjGp-DSc&t=291s \nSALLY started as part of our student university project. The original brief was to create only a three part web drama and run this across other social media platforms. \nHowever, the Sally series garnered an overwhelming amount of love and support. The production team had little idea how the pilot would be received, but in the six weeks after its premier on Youtube, the show has gathered an encouraging amount of attention; receiving numerous comments, fan-art, and support for the show as well as inquiries over more episodes. \nWe're raising money to continue this beloved show. \nWe care about this show so much because it is something we have always wanted pursue, being able to create fun content online for an audience.  We had no idea what would come of it but over the past 6 weeks have watched the show blossom. Receiving many comments, fan-art and support for the show, with people asking if there will be more episodes. \nAs this was a university project it was scheduled to be completed at the end of march and for us to completely move on to a new project in April.  We don't want to end this series as we have many ideas and want to continue making episodes. However, the show costs a lot to produce so we need your help so we can continue it and to evolve the show into something greater! \n\nWHO WE ARE\nThe team started with 6 people. From the student project 3 of us have stayed on to continue the show. However we are receive help from you guys and people we know in the film world. \nChantelle/Yoka - A Fursuit Maker who has been on YouTube for many years and has always wanted to create a successful show starring a diverse range of characters. One of her favourite shows is Bojack horseman and her favorite company is Pixar.\nEm - As an aspiring producer and writer, it has always been a passion of hers to write and create shows that are unique and quirky within the horror/thriller genre.\nCarlos - A photographer and content creator aspiring to one day become a film director. He sees this series as a chance to make his mark in the industry, assisting in his pursuit of a prosperous career in film making. With a tonne of ideas for sub-arcs and stories for the series, the future for the show looks exciting!\n\nWHAT IS OUR PLAN?\nOur plan is to raise enough funds for Season 2 by the end of May, so that production can begin in August/September, outputting 10, 10 minute long Episodes. The funds will go towards enlisting skilled professionals to work closely with us to produce and edit high quality episodes.\nThe reason for this is we brake up around this time ( finish the school year) so have a few months where we can go deep into production).\nWhilst this fund raiser is live, work will be undertaken to script the episodes ready for production. Meanwhile working on merchandise and other content development until we have made the funds to go into production. \n\nSo while our goal of \u00a312,000 may seem like a LOT, we have provided you with a brake down so you can see where the funds are going!\n\nCamera Operator: \u00a32,200 is the cost to hire someone in London to come on set with us for 2 weeks to make sure all the visuals are as good as they can be!

It provides a real life look into the furry community as told by our own artists and creators. We completed part one, a YouTube mini-series prequel. This Kickstarter is to fund part two which will be released as a feature film!\n Check out the mini-series (part one) below!\nThe Feature Film\nFor the film, we want to take an in-depth look at the early history of the fandom and explore our origins as the first internet subculture. We will focus on the individuals who helped to start our first conventions, meetups and facilitate artistic expression. Then, we will examine where we are headed as a community today. As furries ourselves we would like to show the world what our community is really about!  \nSubjects that we will address:\n The furry fandom is, perhaps, the first subculture to rise with the internet. With its origins in the late '70s, furry grew out of the science-fiction communities, debuting the first furry convention in 1989. But while the internet provided a means of uniting this budding community, it also became a breeding ground for misconceptions about furry identity. \nThis film will give you a glimpse of what makes the furry fandom so special to those who call themselves \"furry\". By interviewing the individuals who pioneered the fandom, we will explore this unusual community from the ground up, uncovering the passion, creativity, and the drive the inspires its members. We hope you join us on this journey! \n The Cast (So Far)\nThese are just some amazing folks lined up to participate in the film, with more to be revealed shortly!\n Our cast is made up of some of the artists, creators and personalities that really drive our community forward.\nFAQ\nDispatch date?\nWhile the campaign proceeds and as we approach our target, we hope to start production in April after Kickstarter funding completes.

It was a live concert film of a show at St. Andrew's Hall in Detroit, but the idea emerged out of  a planned film of a concert in London, England which was derailed when the company engaged to film it ended up pulling out of the project.  So we thought it was time to bring it all full circle. Electric Six has engaged in five previous Kickstarter campaigns and the sixth one will be the last one. Six bodies on stage in Electric Six.  Six senses. Six Kickstarter campaigns.  No better way to celebrate all that we, Electric Six and YOU, its fans, have accomplished together than by bringing it all back home in a sense and filming a live show in England, a place which has given so much to us over the years and which in a relatively direct way sparked the very idea of these projects.  \n\"Live In Liverpool\" is exactly that, a film of a concert to take place on May 18 at Arts Club Liverpool. Much like \"Absolute Treasure,\" the band's previous live concert film, \"Live In Liverpool\" will be a multi-camera shoot with some behind the scenes material included alongside the concert itself.  We'll be producing DVDs and Blu Ray versions, as well as digital only formats of the film (those who pledge for physical formats will also receive a digital copy). Additionally, we're going to provide every pledger with a CD and digital download version of the concert, for those moments when you just want to listen to the music undistracted by the overpowering beauty of Electric Six's collective visage.  The set will once again be a unique one, as we've done with all of our live projects over the years. You will get some of the classics you've all come to expect, but we'll bust out some newer material and some deep cutz as well...and there's always the wildcard of the pledger selected material to account for as well.  It's guaranteed to be a unique set the likes of which you haven't experienced before in its totality. We first played this venue in 2003, so we're bringing it all back home in that way as well. After careful consideration, we felt an intimate setting such as the one the Arts Club will offer should lend itself to a fantastic night and a great concert recording. We also remember how our UK and European fans felt they missed out years ago on the opportunity to be at a gig which would be filmed for release, to perhaps see their own faces on a screen, in ecstasy as they witness Electric Six...the circle will now be complete. To give you a partial preview of the songs we'll play, here are 8 which will definitely make it into the set, a mix of old favorites and new material, none of which have been on any of our live recordings previously:\nBride Of The Devil\n         Daddy\u2019s Boy\n         How Dare You\n         She\u2019s Guatemalan\n         Bite Me\n         Mr. Woman\n         Dance Pattern\n         Lenny Kravitz\nAs usual, we expect to add lots of others via this campaign, between pledgers and pledger voting.\nAs this is the last Kickstarter project we'll do, we're including many of the old favorite packages to make sure those interested fans get one more opportunity to get items or experiences they've wanted, but we're also rotating some stuff out and  including some new ideas, given that it's the final campaign.\nThe biggest news is an item we've never offered before as a part of a Kickstarter campaign...Electric Six LIVE in the location of your choice.  See the reward section for details on this, as there are some conditions we unfortunately have to apply, most importantly that we have to limit it to the continental United States (it gets too complicated overseas, sadly). This will be the full band playing a \"real\" show...nothing stripped down, nothing acoustic...provided you've got the space and the gear to make it happen.\nWe're offering another Dick Valentine original, this time he'll create a suitable-for-framing larger size lyric sheet of the E6 song of your choice, complete with symbols and renderings in the margins which will make the words come even further alive.\nA new item this time around is a special four poster package.  These posters will be conventional glossy \"poster\" style (not screenprints) and will include two  gig posters done by Tom Deja, who's done much of our artwork over the years (one of which will be for the Liverpool show), as well as \"Bride Of The Devil\" and \"Daddy's Boy\" posters by Nick Bataran. Get a slice of E6 past and present in poster form.\nOne of the images you'll receive as part of the 4 poster set package\nAnother poster to be included in the 4 poster set package, this one by Tom Deja\nWe're going to produce a photobook of the the Live In Liverpool show, which will also include some historical shots mixed in for good measure. It'll be  a mix of behind-the-scenes shots, photos of live performance and text, with most of the photos never before seen.\nWe're also offering some more conventional \"merch\" items, things we haven't done in the past (at least not everywhere), such as tote bags, pin sets, etc.\nOld favorites include the opportunity to select a song for the show in Liverpool, or to perform with us at that show. If you don't play an instrument, don't worry, we'll get you on that stage with a mic in your grill one way or the other.  You can also select a song to be played as part of the Liverpool show, provided its an Electric Six song from one of the studio (i.e. non-Kickstarter and non-\"Sexy Trash\") records. We're also once again including a package where you can select a song for the band to cover and we'll make the results part of the subscription club package which any pledger can add to their rewards for $20 (those making pledges for packages of $500 or more once again will automatically be enrolled in the subscription club). You can also pledge to perform along with us on one of these recordings (either pledger or band selected, as we'll be doing some covers for the subscription club regardless)...we've had a ton of fun with these in the past. \nThese people all performed on Electric Six studio recordings. You could be next!\nWe're also doing a third volume of the popular E6 Karaoke series. This disc is anticipated to include the following songs (as always, subject to change but this is what we think it'll look like):\n Infected Girls\n            Slices Of You\n            I Buy The Drugs\n            Dirty Ball\n            Escape From Ohio\n            Clusterfuck\n            Free Samples\n            Kids Are Evil\n            Arrive Alive\n            How Dare You\n            Bride Of The Devil\n            Daddy\u2019s Boy\nThere are lots of Dick Valentine-specific packages once again on offer. You haven't truly seen yourself until you've done so through the prism of a DV portrait of YOU. Want to learn how to write songs the Valentine way? There's a package for that. Name a character in his latest psycho-pornographic-noir-thriller, or take him on in a round of golf...it's all there one more time. \nSomeone became a character in DV's last Bart Ducane book. Will the next one feature YOU?\nThe Subscription Club is once again an add on option for $20 (or free if you're pledging for a package of $500 or more). It'll feature outtakes, different mixes, photos and any of the covers we end up recording. For clarification purposes, the Subscription Club is a one year deal, so if you pledged for it last time, that one will end with December 2018's material, so doing so again in this campaign will get you access to the Club material for 2019 (4 times during the course of the year).\nBe part of the magic, one more time, with Electric Six and Kickstarter. Join us as we document \"Live In Liverpool\" along with the most important people in the equation, you, the fans of Electric Six. As with so many other great things...the television series \"M*A*S*H,\" the rotary phone and  civility being but three examples...Electric Six and Kickstarter has reached the Final Chapter. Write it along with us!\nA couple of important things to note.  First, for any of the \"experiential\" packages, such as encores, dinner and a producer, etc...these must be cashed in during calendar 2019. We've been relaxed about that in previous campaigns but this time must insist that they be used within the 2019 touring schedule...this helps us keep track of outstanding obligations and allows us to plan in a more productive fashion.  For US and Canadian fans, figure that we'll be in all the usual places (and if you have a question about a particular city, send us a message). For the UK, Ireland and Europe, we've announced our UK/Ireland shows for November 2019 and some of the European shows.  German dates (several of them) will be going up soon and we will once again be in Paris, St. Petersburg and Moscow. There will likely be a few additional shows in May in the UK and Ireland...again, if you have questions about this relating to one of the packages, send us a message and we can work with you to confirm that we'll be in your area. Unfortunately, we do not have any other areas of the world (Australia most notably) on the schedule as of now and don't anticipate that changing as of this writing, though we certainly wish it would.\nSecond, every year we have some non US pledgers distressed to discover when their packages arrive that they've been assessed customs charges by their local governmental authority.  Please note there is NOTHING we can do about this. We are required by US law to mark packages accurately for customs purposes and we do so. See the project FAQ for more on this.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe \"challenges\" we face mostly surround fulfillment. Having mounted previous successful campaigns, we are confident that this project will be similarly successful. A certain percentage of pledgers from outside the US face issues with customs charges attaching to their rewards and that may occur again in this campaign. Again, there is NOTHING we can do about these charges, as we are required by US law to mark them accurately for customs purposes. If customs charges are objectionable to you, you owe it to yourself to investigate what they may be in your country and make pledging decisions accordingly. See the project FAQs for further discussion of this issue for non-US pledgers. We generally have outstanding success with packages arriving on the first go-around. Those that don't arrive receive a second attempt. The number of packages which truly have been \"lost\" over the previous five campaigns combined can be counted on one hand.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "You get a digital copy of the concert film PLUS a digital copy of the audio from the show in Liverpool.\nPLEDGE AN ADDITIONAL $20 and join the E6 Subscription Club.

I remember it was near midnight on a Saturday, during Blizzard\u2019s 10th Anniversary Party. Instead of attending the company festivities, I was in my office, pensively thinking about dungeons because that's what the company's first 3D level designer does when dungeons aren't working. After six months, there was scant evidence that the game was going to work, certainly not under the budget or schedule we'd been given. WoW was my first experience with an unfinished game...and I couldn't believe that making one from scratch was this hard. I'd spent my first 6 months working over 90-hour weeks using the Quake 3 editor to build levels. I enjoyed the work, but the absence of progress was disturbing. There were many show-stopping issues with dungeons, and my only contribution to the project was to show that FPS technology, processes, and tools were incompatible with MMOs. After six long months, no one else on the team knew what to do either.\nWe couldn\u2019t find experienced 3D level designers (willing to work for what the project could afford). Every week I send the company recruiter half a dozen \"candidates\" whose work I found on the internet--though none were interested. Nor had any suitable environmental texture artists applied for positions on our jobs page (and none of the staff artists wanted to work on dungeons). I wasn't even satisfied with what I was designing. I had to launch Quake 3 just to walk through my structures--and everything looked dark and edgy, just wrong for Warcraft. I began to worry, \u201cWould we have to make our MMO without dungeons?\"\nThat Saturday night, I put fingertips to keyboard and began my four-year chronicle about the games industry, Blizzard, Team 2, and WoW. Whether the project was a failure, or by some miracle, a success, I was convinced it was going to be a good story.\nComputer game development is not pretty.\nMy book, The World of Warcraft Diary, offers a rare, unfiltered, comprehensive look at game development. I start at WoW\u2019s humble beginnings, and give a fly-on-the-wall access to the dev team\u2019s conversations, debates, failed experiments, and internal pressures. Licensed by Blizzard Entertainment, it contains over 130 behind-the-scenes images (many of which have never been seen before). Every image is captioned and dated within the project's timeline. \nAlthough the book has been licensed by Blizzard, I didn\u2019t write it like the average promotional merchandise, or the typical art folio brimming with gorgeous concept sketches. In fact, I kept the pretty pictures out of the book. I am celebrating the chaotic, humorous, and ugly side of computer game development. I covered the people and philosophies behind the curtain. If you\u2019ve ever wanted to know the ingredients inside Blizzard\u2019s secret sauce, this book is for you.\nWho is the author (John Staats)?  \nI served on World of Warcraft for over 10 years. On the original product, I worked longer hours than anyone on the team. My ears were so low to the ground, my officemates and I played a game where they'd try to surprise me with recently heard gossip\u2014and I took great delight informing them that I\u2019d heard it weeks before. When I left the WoW team, I had logged more bug-fixes than anyone else in the company (Mike Morhaime joked that I\u2019d probably caused more bugs).\nAfter I joined Blizzard, so many of my misconceptions about the games industry were dispelled that I thought a development diary would be a compelling subject to cover. Most companies give only a short, vague idea how games are made. I wanted to give an on-the-ground report about the devs. I wrote about our teams\u2019 complaints, moods, arguments, and inside jokes.  \nMy Vanilla WoW portfolio includes designing and building 90 percent of the game's non-instanced caves, crypts, dens, mines, and hive tunnels. My Vanilla WoW dungeons include:\nAhn\u2019Qiraj Temple\nBlackfathom Deeps\nBlackwing Lair\nBlackrock Mountain\nBlackrock Depths\nBooty Bay\nKarazhan (w/Aaron Keller)\nLoch Modan Dam\nLower Blackrock Spire\nMolten Core\nRazorfen Downs\nRazorfen Kraul\nScholomance\nThe Slag Pit\nUpper Blackrock Spire\nThe Wailing Caverns\nWarsong Gulch (w/Matt Milizia)   \nA few years ago, I developed a medical condition with my hands that prevents me from sustained computer use\u2014including both making and playing computer games. With computer game development in my rear-view mirror, I am passing on what I learned about the industry.\nTable of Contents (click for a readable image)\nWhat production values can be expected?\nAs far as content goes, I am a polish-freak. I have rewritten, iterated, and edited the text eighteen times over, cramming in every detail I could muster from memory and notes. This narrative has also been subjected to four passes by professional editors; one for content, one for copy edits, and two separate proofreads. I don\u2019t believe it is boastful to say the text embraces the principle of \u201cconcentrated coolness.\u201d   \nBefore joining Blizzard, I had been in advertising for ten years, so I\u2019ve lots of experience with printing. I\u2019ve weathered angry glares from pressmen twice my age for holding back print runs for minor color corrections and errors. I will be on-press for this book to personally sign-off on every sheet and can guarantee that this will be a high-quality item.\nThe WoW Diary will be fancier than most books. For you printing nerds, it\u2019ll be printed in the United States, on a brand-new press, a Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 106. This press uses a sheet-fed process which gives superior control over ink coverage\u2014at double the cost of a web press (which is how most books are printed). It will be full-color, full-bleed (and varnished if necessary), and, of course, it made using a high-quality matt-coated paper stock. I will be on-press for weeks to sign off on every sheet. \nI expect The WoW Diary will become your go-to coffee table book.\nMock Up\nWhat will backers receive?     \nElectronic backers will receive a PDF and an eBook version of The WoW Diary after this campaign is funded (3-6 weeks after the Kickstarter closes). The PDF/eBook will have the same images and words, although The WoW Diary layouts/captions are best viewed through a full-spread format.\nFirst Edition Backers will receive an Electronic Edition + a printed first edition of The WoW Diary, comparable to a 8\u201d x 10\u201d hardbound textbook with 336 full-color pages. It has over 95,000 words (the length of The Hobbit) and over 130 captioned images.  \nShowcase Edition Backers get an Electronic Edition + a signed first edition of The WoW Diary encased in an sleeve (book case). Included inside the sleeve will also be a saddle stitch-bound booklet, containing four essays about the team after WoW shipped. I omitted them from the book because they fell outside the timeline (the book ends after I cover the game\u2019s launch). While these essays will be available online, they make for worthy companion pieces.  \nPress Sheet Edition - GONE! - backers will receive a Showcase Edition of The WoW Diary and one signed press sheet--used to approve the printing of the first edition of The WoW Diary. Each sheet will have my sign-off indicating the page is a \"go\" on the print run. There are 21 unique press sheets, roughly 22 x 36 inches in size, and there are 8 pages on each side of the sheet. I have no control over the imposition (arrangement of pages), but the odds are high (with over 130 images) that either side of the press sheet will have images. For a book that celebrates the production process, these complement the Kickstarter.\nPress Sheet Mock-up (each are unique and limited to 20)\nIt looks like the book is already finished, what will the money be used for?\nAfter ~8% goes to our good friends at Kickstarter, the money will support printing, binding, packaging, and shipping. It will also cover the operational costs and fees associated with selling extras on Amazon.com--extras that will be made available after the Kickstarter rewards have been fulfilled.  \nWhere I can get more information about The WoW Diary and John Staats?  \nwhenitsready.com has some juicy excerpts and covers my post-Kickstarter goings on. Updates on The WoW Diary will be made via Twitter @JohnStaats_WIR. If you don't want spam about my book\u2019s progress, but you do want previews of my next project (a dungeon-based board game), sign-up to my email list.\nThis stretch goal will fund two versions of The WoW Diary. The first, will be the standard Amazon Edition that has all the high-end specs already listed. Then, I'll print a Golden Edition that will be for only and all of my Kickstarter First Edition backers. \nUpgrade 1: $300,000 - Funded! The end sheet (pictured below) will be gold that reads \u201cOriginal Kickstarter Backer\" followed the whenitsready logo. The mock-up (on the right) shows the subtle printing, and the magnification (on the left) is darkened and enlarged for readability. \nUpgrade 2: $350,000 - Funded! Gold foil title lettering on spine and front cover differentiates Kickstarter editions from non-KS prints. \nUpgrade 3: $400,000 - Funded! Spot varnishing makes all the pictures shiny and opens opportunity for shiny \"ghost shapes\" on an otherwise blank page. Very few books have this because it costs a lot, but if we hit this mark, I'll add it for free. \nThis means all hardcover Kickstarter backers will have a rarer copy (only a few thousand worldwide) than later editions. The Gold Kickstarter Edition will never be reprinted. Owning one means you've helped found my new company, whenitsready and its flagship product, The WoW Diary.\nGolden Edition End Sheet Mockup\nBy reaching the Golden Stretch Goal, The WoW Diary would have become, at least, the 3rd highest funded non-fiction book in Kickstarter's history. The only way to make this happen is to tell your friends. Tweet and Share this link to let everyone know you support The WoW Diary. Let your freak flag fly and distinguish your copy from future printings.\nRead below for achievement details.\n The Golden Bookmark Achievement System\nThe reward for this achievement is a special bookmark, of which I am not showing. The bookmark design isn\u2019t a \u201csecret\u201d because I\u2019m not finished with it yet, it\u2019s design has been done for over a year and I want it to be a surprise when you receive your hardback edition of The WoW Diary. It has two Easter eggs, one of which refers to something in the book, the other won\u2019t be apparent until I release my next project, a dungeon-based board game. The Golden Kickstarter version of this bookmark will never be reprinted again (extras will be destroyed at the printer). \nBy reaching 300 achievement points all Kickstarter backers will receive a golden (Kickstarter) bookmark with each hardcover.\nSome quotes from the book:   \n\u201cUntil YouTube began streaming videos a year later, WoW servers handled over 10 percent of global Internet bandwidth in downloads, and its players contributed to roughly half of active global Internet traffic at any given time. The sun never sets on the Warcraft empire.\u201d  \n\u201cSince the point of a database was to always know where game\u2019s data was located, it was no small irony when WoW\u2019s entire database was lost. While the database system was working and on the network, somewhere in the building, the hardware itself had been forgotten and no one could locate the machine when an upgrade became necessary.\u201d  \n\u201cDuring the tornado\u2026.A facility technician heroically shuts down a \u2018450 volt power inverter\u2019 (triple the voltage of a hair dryer) while standing in a room-wide, quarter-inch deep puddle. The Blizzard techs were in awe of his daring, as water dribbled, from a beam above, onto the very units he was powering down.\u201d  \n\u201cBlizzard\u2019s rarely used PA system sounded, \u2018Attention: The WoW beta is live. I repeat: The WoW beta is live. The first transport is away!\u2019 The dev team was unprepared for the announcement, since we\u2019d been waiting days for AT&T to fix their stupid facility issues, so it was met with almost no reaction. We were more impressed that we had a PA system. A few people looked out of their office doors so see if any team gatherings were happening, but nothing ensued, so everyone went back to work. A few of us even laughed at how little enthusiasm the team showed.\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a licensing agreement with Blizzard Entertainment to use their content for this book.

Their first album, Hashtag: https://foxamoore.bandcamp.com/album/hashtag encountered success and launched what ended up being a longer tour than either party expected. The combination of vocals taken straight from They Might be Giants and strings out of something by Hans Zimmer, ended up making something new.\nFox and Pepper had an amazing time working on Hashtag. So much so, that they\u2019re gonna do another one. \u201cSpread Thy Wings\u201d is bigger in scope, orchestration, instrumentation, and, critically, equipment. The goal of this project is to get enough money together to hire session musicians, rent Ocean Way studios in Nashville for 3 days and pay technicians/engineers. There will also be overhead costs for the printing of the CDs and (maybe) vinyls, along with the art and graphic design for said music discs.\nHow far this project goes is based entirely on what level of funding we receive. Our stated goal is what it\u2019ll cost to rent the studio, and have us out to record the album, but we have bigger plans than that.\nThere are loads of extremely talented people in this fandom (furries), and we want to use this album to showcase some of them. \nWe have Rhubarb, a diversely talented multi-instrumentalist potentially doing bass and winds. \nAlice, an electric guitar player that can shred to a degree far above Pepper.\nUnderbite, a drummer we\u2019ve been doing a lot of work with and are anxious to get on an album with us.\nKeith \u201cOddy\u201d Lesinski, a sound engineer that has essentially come on tour with us over the last couple years due to all the convention shows we end up working together on.\nThe amount of polish, professionalism, and production value that this team could bring to the album cannot be understated. While we can do a lot with just the two of us, we can do so much more with this squad, and this studio time. Here are the specific amounts we\u2019re estimating for each step we wanna take with this.\n$12,000 (Paper) - Studio time and CD run/design fees.\n$15,000 (bronze) - add Vinyl run of 500.\n$18,000 (Silver) - add guest musicians (Rhubarb, Alice, Underbite, others)\n$25,000 (Gold) - We will book a live choir of Nashville session musicians to bulk up the sound. A lot of these songs have a gospel flare, and a full choir will make a huge difference!\n$35,000 (Diamond) - Live symphonic orchestra, with orchestration by Tonya Song (Tonya Wind Singer) who also worked with Fox on his previous studio albums, \"The Dreamcatcher\" and \"Come Find Me\". If you\u2019ve heard our projects before, you know how much live strings can contribute to our style of songwriting. The people we want to hire are the same pool of musicians that have recorded a TON of cool video game soundtracks. Ori and the Blind Forest, The Last of Us, Fortnite, Mass Effect, MGS V: Phantom Pain, Ratchet and Clank, and on and on. For this much we\u2019ll reach the full potential of the project, and be able to fund the various reward tiers.\nLinks to more music by Fox and Pepper\nhttps://foxamoore.bandcamp.com/album/a-musical-tail-one-weekend\nhttps://foxamoore.bandcamp.com/album/the-dreamcatcher", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFox and Pepper have a lot of experience making albums, they just get a little bigger each time.

Featuring an all-new design, V2 introduces a plethora of innovations spanning from materials selection, functional design, and aesthetics - all while preserving the core functionality that inspired the original.\nWhen we first created V1, the original impetus was to transport whole desktops, in a well-rounded duffle. As we began working on V2, the challenge was to improve and re-think many of the decisions we had made with the original design.\nIn this way, it is through the lessons learned from V1 that V2 innovates upon, furthering the goal of uncompromised flexibility in ways that make it even more useful, to even more people.\nTo start, we began with the exterior of V2. From the outside, we've simplified the aesthetic, yielding a bag that is distinctively modern and minimalistic.\nFunctionally, the reduced protrusions and more compact nature of the bag not only look good, but make V2 as a whole more practical to stow away and transport. Meanwhile, from the inside, clever use and placement of the integrated pockets ensure that this simplification doesn't come at the expense of utility and adequate storage space. Quick-access pockets of varying size are implemented on nearly every face of the bag - even the bottom - and these can support devices as small as smartphones and as large as 15\" laptops.\nDifferent users have different preferences on how to carry their bag, and V2 supports just about all of them. The integrated handles make the bag easy to grab, pull, and retrieve. With the revised Shoulder Strap kit, V2 can be carried like a traditional duffle. With the all-new Backpack Strap Kit, V2 can also be carried like a backpack. Finally, with the Luggage Strap Kit, V2 can be secured to luggage handles, and stacked on wheeled luggage for transport of heavier equipments.\nFor the interior of V2, we've developed a padding kit that's both modular and flexible. From delicate cameras and lenses, to awkwardly shaped microphones, to a veritable grab bag of necessary electronics, V2's Modular Padding Kit can be arranged in almost any way imaginable. It provides crucial internal structure that's rigid enough to keep belongings protected, but soft enough to mitigate the jostling of bumpier trips.\nThe Modular Padding Kit is appropriately proportioned for a cozy fit with the following solutions:\nDAN A4 \nNCASE M1\nNFC Skyreach 4 Mini\nApple eGPU, Razer Core and other eGPU docks\nAny desktop PC smaller than 47x29x21cm\nWe're also introducing dedicated keyboard bags that can be packed inside V2. Compatible with TKL and Full Size keyboards, these bags provide just enough protection while minimizing bulk. The interior material was chosen to allow attachment of Velcro straps for additional organization. One can even use the V2 Shoulder Strap with either the TKL and Full Size bags, and carry the keyboard independently of the duffle.\nIf you want to use V2 as a general travel duffle, we've also designed a pair of bags that provide convenient access to toiletries, compact equipment, and other personal items. Like the keyboard bags, they complement V2 and use the same durable materials, while keeping belongings easy to organize - especially in concert with the Modular Padding Kit.\nAdd-On pledge examples: \nFor backers of \"Early Bird\" tiers (limited quantity): Weekender + Padding Kit + Full Size KB Bag = 115 + 20 + 30 = $165\nFor backers outside of Early Bird tiers: Weekender + Padding Kit + Full Size KB Bag = 145 + 30 + 40 = $215 \nWith the benefit of experience and a full production run behind us, we're currently slated to complete our crowdfunding campaign in the end of March, with surveying to backers wrapping up in April, and fulfillment completing by mid-May. For most backers, this means that items will arrive at your door by late May to early June.

THESE TWO SONGS ARE ADDED TO THE ACOUSTIC SHOW SET\nSYNTHESIZER\nYOUR HEAT IS RISING\n********************************************************************************\nOver the years,Electric Six has given its fans insight into many sides of its creative world.  Besides the regular studio albums the band releases, Electric Six has recorded multiple live records.  It's recorded cover albums.  It's done live show DVDs and rarities collections.  It's even done a doc (or is that mock?)umentary.  However the well is not dry. Electric Six is thrilled to be offering fans something yet again different and unique in its catalogue to fans interested in pledging.  For the first time ever, Electric Six will be recording a collection of holiday songs.  A few years back, we did a recording of the theme song from \"How The Grinch Saved Christmas\" for the AV Club (part of The Onion's comedy and culture empire) and every year when we post it we get tremendous reactions from you, the Crazies. We believe the time is right to pull together an entire collection of holiday favorites, and to do it we need YOU to be involved. You'll see how as you examine the reward packages to the right of this page. We're offering pledgers the chance to pick some of the songs we'll do.  We're even offering to record an ORIGINAL holiday themed song for this record, where you can have some input as to the specifics of the subject matter. Collectively, this disc will be entitled \"A Very Electric SiXmas\"  We've already identified a few of the songs we'll do...\nSilver Bells  \nFather Christmas (Kinks)\nYou're A Mean One Mr. Grinch\nChristmas Card from A Hooker in Minneapolis/Silent Night  (Tom Waits)\nGrandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer\nThe rest will be filled out by us and  you, the Crazies. We're anticipating a 12 song record.\nNothing says the holiday season like a holiday record from Electric Six!\nYet, that's not the only thing we're doing   As is usual for us in these projects, we're doing a two disc set.  So disc one is the holiday record. Disc two is going to be another new endeavor for us. We're going to do a full band acoustic set here in Detroit, and we're going to record it as part of this release. Of course Dick Valentine has performed solo acoustic shows for many years  but this will be something different. This will be more akin to the old MTV Unplugged sessions.  Do you remember when Stone Temple Pilots did an MTV Unplugged? It'll be a lot like that, but even better, because it'll feature songs exclusively from the Electric Six catalog. Imagine, DaVe and Nashinal on acoustic guitars.  Tait? on a REAL piano. The mind reels with the possibilities.  As part of this, we'll offer many of the usual things we tend to do when we have a live recording as part of  a Kickstarter project...we'll let folks determine some songs we'll do, perform on stage with us during the set, etc. Believe it or not, this will be one of the more complicated and potentially exhilarating things we've ever attempted, so we're excited to let all of you be a part of it. This disc will be entitled \"Chill Out!\"  We're going to perform this show at Small's (DaVe's bar) in Hamtramck, Michigan on March 21, 2018.  The set will include these songs, with many, many more to be added of course:\nMcDonnellz  \nPink Flamingos  \nShow Me What Your Lights Mean  \nSteal Your Bones  \nBig Red Arthur\nSYNTHESIZER (Stretch goal addition)\nYOUR HEAT IS RISING (Stretch goal addition)\nElectric Six is going to play a show the old-fashioned way, without electricity! Just the way the guys in this photo would want it to be done.\nWe're bringing back some tried and true packages which we know you all love.  So, yes, the exclusive t-shirt, poster, etc. will all be available.  We'll also do similar things to what we've done in the past in enabling pledgers to become part of the recording and/or show process. So there will be room for you to select songs for either record, or perform either in the studio with us on the holiday record or at the live show in Hamtramck. Our Karaoke disc was so wildly successful that we're doing a Volume 2, with an entirely new set of songs for you to drunkenly sing along with. Of course we're also bringing back some of the Dick Valentine favorites...if you love the idea of a DV crafted mix CD or having your portrait drawn by him or your tarot cards read, those are back in the mix as well this time around.  Yet, we're bringing some new ideas into the fold as well. Ever wanted your very own E6 Christmas stocking, complete with your name customized on top? Now it's available.  How about a set of Dick Valentine drawn holiday cards? Your friends and family will never know what hit them!  We're also, for the first time, offering a Dick Valentine stained glass night light, created by our friends at Glass Action. Light up your life with DV!\nWe know you're been dreaming of your very own E6 Christmas Stocking and now we're making it happen! It'll look just like these, except totally different!\nPledgers may notice that a handful of packages which have previously been very popular (Soundcheck Experience, Dinner and a Producer and You Choose The Encore) have either been reduced in availability, seen a price raise, or both.  The simple explanation for this is that, though we've enjoyed providing these packages for you over the years, they all have taken a great toll on Electric Six. Learning entirely \"new\" songs multiple times in a tour or having time to prepare for a show cut drastically short has started to strain Electric Six's sanity.  So, we're cutting back on those this time, but we've still made a few available for you if you REALLY want them.\nPledge for this original \"The System Works Just Fine\" shirt, as worn by Dick Valentine. He actually wore this! Multiple times!\nWe're also bringing back the E6 Subscription Club for a second round! This will function in exactly the same way as it did last time. For an extra $20 added to your pledge, you'll receive a quarterly (so that's 4 times a year, delivered electronically approximately every 3 months) collection of material.  It will include demos of songs being developed for the next Electric Six studio record, so you'll get an early sense of where that record is headed and follow along as the song is developed.  It may also include things like alternate or remix versions of new material. We'll also include the odd outtake or live recording...as an example the band did a live recording in Austin, Texas this past spring and may send some of that material to Club members. We'll also include exclusive photos, etc. Additionally, we're going to include any cover selections or remix selections made by pledgers in this campaign as part of the Subscription Club...so all members will get those sent to them as well as the other material mentioned above. PLEASE NOTE: If you subscribed as part of the \"You're Welcome!\" Kickstarter campaign, your subscription will expire with the material to be sent out at the end of 2017. So, if you want to continue to receive all the great stuff which is part of this club, you'll need to pledge for it in THIS campaign with $20 added to your pledge (or you get it for free if you've pledged for any package of $500 or more).\nA Dick Valentine Night Light! It can be yours!\nWe're really excited about \"A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!\" Now,  just to be clear, it's going to take us awhile to pull all this together, so this will be delivered in October of 2018 (not in time for THIS holiday season, of course). The holiday season is about family among other things and Electric Six IS YOUR FAMILY NOW. Electric Six gonna make everything merry and bright, and then it's gonna take things down a level and cool out with non-electric versions of E6 favorites which will blow your mind. REMEMBER, the ONLY way you can get this set is to pledge in this campaign.  It is exclusive to this Kickstarter. Take a psychological sleigh ride with Electric Six...become a part of \"A Very Electric SiXmas & Chill Out!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges, such as they are, mostly surround fulfillment. Having mounted previous successful campaigns, we are confident that the project will be similarly successful. A certain percentage of pledgers from outside the US face issues with customs charges attaching to their rewards and that may occur again in this campaign. Again, there is NOTHING we can do about these charges, as we are required by US law to mark them accurately for customs purposes. If customs charges are objectionable to you, you owe it to yourself to investigate what they may be in your country and make pledging decisions accordingly. See the project FAQs for further discussion of this issue for non-US pledgers. We've had very good success with packages arriving on the first go-around. Those that don't arrive receive a second attempt.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "You get a digital copy of the 2 disc set.\nPLEDGE AN ADDITIONAL $20 and join the E6 Subscription Club.

The game takes a few minutes to learn, it's kid-friendly, and each round takes about 20 minutes to play.\n(Stretch Goals here!)\n    THE ORIGIN STORY\n                                   I\u2019ve always wanted to make a card game. A few years ago, I started working on a game based on my comic, The Oatmeal, where you connect heads, torsos, arms, and legs to create a variety of monsters based on characters from my comic, such as the Bear-O-Dactyl. The original version of this game was doodled onto paper cutouts, and had no functioning game mechanic other than \u201cbuild funny-looking things.\u201d \nThe very first version of the Oatmeal card game.\nTwo years ago I met Elan Lee, and he showed me a prototype of a game called \u201cBombSquad,\u201d which we renamed to Exploding Kittens. After Exploding Kittens launched, my creature-building game got put on hold.\nAfter the dust from Exploding Kittens eventually settled, I asked Elan to help with the design of my monster-building game. I didn\u2019t want this to be one of those games where you're trying to \"out-comedy\" one another; I wanted it to be more of a deck-building game, such as Dominion or Hearthstone, but without all the complexity. I wanted a monster-building game you could easily play at a party.\n Up until this point, my version of the game had a big problem:  when you played, you were on autopilot. You had no decisions to make and usually one correct action to perform on every turn.  Elan has been designing physical and digital games for most of his career (he invented the genre of alternate reality games, and was formerly the creative director of the Xbox), so he put his gargantuan puzzle-solving brain to work and added a layer of much-needed complexity to the game.  He tinkered a bunch and established the basic rules of conflict, construction, and the escalation mechanic that would define the core gameplay. The tricky part was keeping this simple enough to be a party game, but complicated enough to allow for depth and strategy. It\u2019s easy to fall into two bad categories when designing tabletop games: either they\u2019re easy to learn but completely random, or they\u2019re very strategic but mind-numbingly boring. You have to walk a very thin line between the two. I think with Bears vs Babies we did that.\nOur battle-hardened \"Sharpie Deck\"\nAfter months of pestering everyone we knew to play the game with us and tweaking the rules bit by bit, we finally got it to the point where our friends pestered us to play, instead of vice versa. And that eventually brought us here, to Kickstarter, where we\u2019re now pestering the whole internet to play with us.\nAnd so here we are. \nLet the bear hugs and baby burping begin.\n-Matt and Elan\n----------\n   ----------\n                                                                                 Press Inquiries\nEmail: info@bearsvsbabies.com\n----------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRemember that one time two years ago when we built Exploding Kittens and shipped everything we promised to you ON TIME?\n\nSeems like a pretty keen idea to try that again.

Electric Six has taken a vacation from making music videos but now that we've hit the $50,000 mark, that break will have ended. Electric Six will make a video for the song \"I Got The Box\" off its brand new album \"Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres.\" This video will be a sequel of sorts to the short film \"That Voodoo You Do, or The Legba Luncheon,\" which featured DV and Tait and was directed by Andre Bennet. This will be a continuation of the adventures of Harlem Hank and Flatbush Frank.\n*******************************************************************************************\n$45,000 STRETCH GOAL RANDY'S HOT TONIGHT WINS!\n********************************************************************************************\n$40,000 STRETCH GOAL! I INVENTED THE NIGHT WINS!\n********************************************************************************************\n$35,000 STRETCH GOAL REACHED! DANCE PATTERN IS THE WINNER!\n********************************************************************************************\nThere are many things Electric Six fans love about the band, but besides the obvious (gay bars, songs about the Devil, etc.), two of the most oft cited are the way the band can make the songs of others firmly their own and the explosive live performances the band renders.  We get asked about this stuff all the time and so Electric Six will answer the call. Electric Six will give you what you want and what you need. The band has decided to address both of these concepts in a new, exclusive to Kickstarter backers audio package, via a 2 disc set entitled \"You're Welcome!\"\nThe first is the sequel to the \"Mimicry\" disc of 2014.  The first set of all covers, released in 2014 via a Kickstarter campaign, was a blast for the band to do and was so well received by those who supported it that we're coming with a sequel which will be at least as good as \"Weekend At Bernie's II.\"  The covers album included as part of \"You're Welcome!\" will follow much the same format as its predecessor, with the band members picking tracks to cover, but filling out the set with fan participation via packages and perhaps some votes as well. We're once again going to record it with Bill \"Bill\" Kozy and Tim Patalan, who did the first \"Mimicry\" set.  This project allows Electric Six to be the stylists they've always been deep down, interpreting works created by others and finding those elements within them which allow the songs to exist in the perverse Electric Six universe.  Dreams shall be made reality, concept shall become flesh and wishes come true with \"You're Welcome!\"\nThe second disc will also be  sequel of sorts, as it is a live record to be done much in the same way as 2012's \"Absolute Pleasure.\" This time, however, both the set and the setting are very different.  First, we're recording this one in the UK, at Oxford Academy on April 22 to be precise. Both \"Absolute Pleasure\" and the \"Absolute Treasure\" DVD were recorded in the US, so this time we're giving our UK fans a golden opportunity to be part of a LIVE RECORD. For once, that statement will not be a lie.  It's true...it's true.  The second difference is that the set will be ENTIRELY different than the ones recorded for \"Absolute Pleasure\" and \"Absolute Treasure.\" This set is going to be comprised of songs which have either been out of the regular set rotation for years or, in some instances, songs which have never been played live before. We may even bring back a REALLY old favorite or two from the smokehouse days (when the band was known as The WIldbunch).  As with elements related to the covers disc, this campaign allows for fan interaction and a significant role in crafting what this performance will be, as we're offering packages allowing individual songs to be selected and likely will have some backer votes determining others as well.  This one wil also be produced by Bill \"Bill\" Kozy and Tim Patalan, who did both \"Absolute Pleasure\" and \"Absolute Treasure\" (on the audio side).\nThe band will commit to the following songs, with another 15 to be determined by a combination of you, the Crazies, and us, the band.\nNEWARK AIRPORT BOOGIE  \nI'M THE BOMB      \nNIGHT VISION   \nMC SUCKA DJ\nROCK AND ROLL EVACUATION   \n\nGet your tickets here NOW! www.ticketweb.co.uk/event/DEH2204Z\nAs with our other Kickstarter projects over the years, this one offers some truly unique experiences for fans. It's provided us the opportunity to get to know those who love the band in intimate and interesting ways, and we're once again offering a lot of different ways for interested parties to get to know us...very, very, very well.\nImagine your own E6 Karaoke collection! Now it's possible!\nMany of you have dreamed of performing an Electric Six song yourselves, and through this campaign it is now possible to do so in the comfort of you very own home with an Electric Six karaoke collection. Have you ever wanted to learn to write a song the Dick Valentine way? Now you can, via an intimate, one on one songwriting seminar conducted by the man who wrote \"Naked Pictures\" and \"I'm On A Diet.\" Are you interested in having your portrait drawn by an insightful artist, one who may just enlighten you to aspects of yourself heretofore unknown? We've got you covered. Plus, we have many old favorites returning as well, packages which have proven to be immensely popular with you, the Crazies, over the years.\nAn example of a DV songwriting seminar.\n Also featured this year is a brand new concept, the Electric Six subscription club. You can pledge an additional $20 on any package and become enrolled (and those who pledge for any package of $500 or more are automatically enrolled, so if that's you, you don't need to pledge the additional $20. You're in!). The subscription club will receive a \"new\" song quarterly (so once every three months) for a year, and this will be delivered digitally. This material will be of three types. One will be demo versions of songs being worked on for the next E6 album...so you're getting both an early preview of the next record and insight into the creative process, as you'll see how these songs develop along the way from their earlier stages to the completed album version. A second type of new song will be reworkings/remixes/rearrangement of finished new material. So this will be a song from the next album in a reinvented format. The third type will be a fully finished (i.e. non-demo) song not included on the next album at all. So for example, subscribers might receive a demo of a new song in March, another one in June, a remix of a new song in September and a finished non-LP new studio song in December.\n  In addition to these new songs, members will receive at least one unique older song per quarter as well...these will be things like demos from previous albums, board recording live songs from earlier eras (we have a great gig from 2004 which has never been shared, for example), etc. Finally, there will be odds and ends like exclusive photos, etc. included for subscribers as well. We think this is going to be a great way to allow fans insight into the creative process as well as providing an early sense of what the next record is going to be.\nPortrait of the Artist drawing a portrait\nAgain, all of these recordings included as part of \"You're Welcome!\" will be *exclusive* to those backing this project. We won't be selling them outside of this campaign, so get in the mix on this one now to experience it all with us.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are virtually nil, as E6 has all resources (once the project is funded successfully) necessary to bring the project to completion. As we are now Kickstarter veterans, there isn't much which will surprise us.\n\nChallenges, such as they are, mostly surround fulfillment. Having mounted three previous successful campaigns, we are confident that the project will be similarly successful. A certain percentage of pledgers from outside the US (almost exclusively in the United Kingdom) face issues with customs charges attaching to their rewards and that may occur again in this campaign. See the project FAQs for further discussion of this issue for non-US pledgers. We've had very good success with packages arriving on the first go-around. Over the three previous campaigns, less than 1% of all pledgers have failed to receive their packages on the first try, and all of those have been addressed with a second mailing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "You get a digital copy of the 2 disc \"You're Welcome!\" set.\nPLEDGE AN ADDITIONAL $20 and join the E6 Subscription Club.

We thought about this very carefully and came to the following conclusions: Quality first!  \nFor now, we rather build an awesome game that launches on computers first and then step by step on consoles, than having a not so solid title launching on multiple platforms at the same time.\nWe hope you agree and that we will get even more content together by reaching some of our Stretch Goals!\n       FOX n FORESTS is a 2D 16-Bit style action platformer with adventure and puzzle elements, empowering you to switch seasons on the fly!\nSet within a mystic forest and its surroundings, FOX n FORESTS is a stunning fable offering pixel perfect Retrotainment and rewarding challenges!\nThe game is inspired by the glorious days of 16-Bit and all time classics like Super Ghouls \u2019n Ghosts, Wonder Boy in Monster World and ActRaiser 2 as well as the Castlevania and Zelda series.\nYou play as Rick the Fox and your weapon is a magic melee crossbow that can not only be used for ranged and close up combat, but empowers you to seamlessly switch between 2 seasons per level, completely changing the whole environment and resulting in amazing secrets, tricky skill tests and thriving exploration! \nPixel perfect platforming, screen filling bosses, rich bonus levels, powerful potions, bags of loot, stuffed shops, clever backtracking, challenging skill tests, a magic melee crossbow to shoot and slash enemies, upgradeable shots, not 4 but 5 seasons to explore, stunning 16-Bit pixel art, a catchy chip tunes soundtrack and tons of humorous retro charm combined with the luxuries of modern game design will make FOX n FORESTS a worthy revival of games from the Golden Age. \nEasy to learn, difficult to master, impossible to not fall in love with!\nA passionate, talented and highly experienced team stands behind the development of FOX n FORESTS - it will be available for download on PC, Linux and MAC and most likely additional platforms in 2017. Please check our stretch goals for details.\nBack us and soon the seasons will be yours to command!\n  An evil force is messing around with the seasons in the vast mana woodlands and is building an army of tree like creatures and half-plant half-animal mutants. Its plan is to introduce a mysterious, deadly 5th time of a year.\nWandering through the dense forests, looking for winged prey our reckless hero Rick the Fox could not care less, until he meets Patty the Partridge. On behalf of the rather remarkable Guardian Tree she begs him for help, promising gold in reward and a magic melee crossbow as a powerful weapon to defeat evil.\n\u201cHa, I will outfox them! First earn this gold, then snatch the crossbow and finally swallow that annoying bird!\u201d clever Rick is thinking while following Patty into the deep forests, not knowing what epic adventures lie in front of them, in this thrilling furry tail of change.\n  At its core FOX n FORESTS is a 2D action platformer with challenging levels and gut-busting enemies. In addition to that rewarding RPG elements and a clever season switch mechanic create a lasting experience with depth.\n    In FOX n FORESTS every level is a unique experience!  \nYou can switch between two pre-defined seasons per level, changing the world and its environments in 3 major ways: Weather! Plants! Animals!\nDeep waters in Summer can only be crossed when frozen solid in Winter, wind- and watermills in secret mines and on stormy hills can be brought to life, vanishing fog on a graveyard will make nightmares appear and of course all sorts of growing and wilting plants as well as responsive wildlife will affect your action-packed adventure.\nOn top of that the season can only be switched for a limited amount of time, so sometimes you need to hurry up to cross a lake or get up that giant vine. But do not worry, once your season meter runs out it recharges quickly and automatically. Power is nothing without control!\n  YES 16-Bit Style Graphics  \nYES Parallax Scrolling \nYES Chiptunes OST \nYES Super Secrets \nYES Cheat Codes \nYES Mode 7\n  NO  Save Game Battery\nNO  Cartridge Blowing\nNO  Slowdowns\n  The funding goal for FOX n FORESTS is \u20ac95.000. This will make sure the game will come out in September 2017 on PC, Linux and Mac, including achievements! There will be versions for Steam as well as DRM free ones - you can choose the one you prefer.\nOf course we will make sure to bring the game to consoles as well! If this campaign is super successful, we will introduce according stretch goals which will get us there faster. And it would mean that every backer gets to pick between her/his version of choice for computer or console! \nEven if we \"only\" reach our basic goal we will do everything in our power to bring FOX n FORESTS to as many consoles as possible. At the moment we are planning for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Nintendo NX.\n  BONUS LEVEL ENTERTAINMENT is a team of passionate industry experts, skilled newcomers and experienced veterans who worked on hundreds of titles combined so far. We want to bring back the glorious days of 16-Bit and merge our love for retro gaming with the luxury of modern game design.  \nFOX n FORESTS is a co-development between BONUS LEVEL ENTERTAINMENT, staff at Independent Arts Software and talented freelancers from all over the world.\n            Next to the above core team we are in close contact to our friends Manfred Trenz (Turrican, Katakis, Rendering Ranger) and Henk Nieborg (Shantae, Mighty Switch Force, Contra 4, The Adventures of Lomax) who are providing additional support in the creation of FOX n FORESTS.\n    Why Kickstarter?\nWe chose Kickstarter as we want to try everything to stay independent! We believe that only as a truly sovereign game studio, Bonus Level Entertainment can make sure that you, our backers, get the 16-Bit action platformer how we all imagine it to be: fascinating and authentic, with the necessary love and attention to detail. For the last 6 months we have been working 24/7 on the prototype of FOX n FORESTS and this Kickstarter campaign, all of our private funds are used up. Now fate is in your hands: Please back us so FOX n FORESTS will become reality, a game that pays true justice to the 16-Bit titles we all love and beyond!\nA game for you, together with you!\nIn reward for backing us you will not only get an amazing game that would be too niche to get it funded by any publisher, but we would also like to give you as much insight into the development process as possible, with constant updates, shared design documents and a maximum of social engagement.\nYour trust - our commitment!\nOur basic goal is \u20ac95.000. With this budget and thanks to the team\u2019s experience in game development on computers and consoles - along with a professional, flexible resource planning - we can ensure the title launch in time and with high quality.\n  FOX n FORESTS will be out as digital download in September 2017 for PC, Linux and Mac, including achievements! We have Steam and DRM free versions, simply pick the one you like (we will send out a questionnaire once the campaign is over). \nOf course we will try everything to bring the game to consoles as well and have according stretch goals planned.

These 3 Magic Attack Potion are exclusive to our Kickstarter backers, so this will be the only way to get them! \n\u201cTendril\u201d - unleash vigorous tendrils that will break through the earth and torture your enemies. \n\u201cComet\u201d - let a powerful comet appear, raining down devastating shooting stars. \n\u201cNightmare\u201d - summon Death himself and turn the screen into the living hell. *muahahaha*\nUnderneath we have a mock-up for a Tree Face from the so called Developer Rewards section. These rewards all include us getting in direct contact with you, exchanging pictures, ideas, files and documents in order to incorporate you into the design process and make you a part of the final game! \nLast but not least enjoy our \u201ctidy\u201d chart where you can check which items you get for your selected reward.

Combined we have shipped over 100 titles on multiple platforms, won developer, sales and marketing awards and definitely know what we are doing when it comes to developing and publishing games.\n\nThat said making good games is always a challenge. The worst thing that can happen to FOX n FORESTS is that the title would get delayed. In a very unlikely event of a major delay and therefore issues with the planned budget, we would partner with a publisher or investor and have to reduce our share of the gross revenue. Not ideal but a rather convenient worst case scenario.\n\nThe truth is that we have invested so many hours, blood, sweat and tears and last but not least our private funds into this project, that we will do everything possible and whatever it takes to make sure the game will see the light of day and in the quality that will make us proud.\n\nWe hope our fun trailer and sincere campaign will make you believe in FOX n FORESTS as much as we do!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "R01: BACKER", "descp": "Fox Origami pdf to print out and enjoy\n+\nAnimated gif \"Don't Fox with me!\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac15 or more", "title": "R02: YOUR GAME", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nDigital copy of FOX n FORESTS\n(earlier and cheaper than anyone else)\n+\nYour name in the credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["583 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "R03: EARLY BIRD (PARTRIDGE)", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nManual pdf\n+\nDigital OST\nSame content as R04: DIGITAL DISCO but for a lower price!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["464 backers", "Limited (535 left of 999)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac25 or more", "title": "R04: DIGITAL DISCO", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nManual pdf\n+\nDigital OST", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac35 or more", "title": "R05: DIGITAL ART", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nArtbook pdf", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac50 or more", "title": "R06: MAGIC ATTACK POTIONS", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nKickstarter Exclusive Magic Attack Potions: \"Tendril\", \"Comet\" and \"Nightmare\" - this is the only way to gain them!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "R08: BRONZE EDITION", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nPhysical Box with OST on CD\n+\nPrinted Manual (DVD box size, full color)\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac60 or more", "title": "R07: POSER - Even more new stock!", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nBe featured in the credits with a photo of you and your beloved retro game collection in glorious 16-Bit.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (3 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac100 or more", "title": "R09: SILVER EDITION", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nPrinted Artbook (Invoice/A5, hardcover, full color)\n+\nPoster (Broadsheet/A2, full color)\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["30 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac130 or more", "title": "R10: GOLD EDITION", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nStylish Bandana with Pixel Characters\n+\nBumper Sticker \"I Brake for Foxes!\"\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac160 or more", "title": "R11: PLATINUM EDITION", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nSnatch an original, hand signed concept art print of a FOX n FORESTS character, enemy or boss (Invoice/A5).\n+\nWe will write a cheat on the back of the concept art print that you can enter in the Main Menu.\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["25 backers", "Limited (75 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac300 or more", "title": "R12: TREE FACE", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nSend us a picture of you and we will turn it into a spooky tree face that will be hidden within one of our forests.\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (6 left of 10)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac600 or more", "title": "R14: BOSS DESIGN", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nHelp us design a challenging and creative boss attack pattern and be featured in the credits as \"Associate Game Designer\"!\nPlus shipping.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (3 left of 3)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac800 or more", "title": "R15: SOUND DESIGN", "descp": "All of the above, non-limited rewards\n+\nMusicians only!

I dance with people all over the world. I make videos of it and I put them on YouTube to show that the world is a whole lot safer and friendlier than it looks on TV. I'm working on a new project and I hope you'll help.\nCairo, Egypt\nThis sounds familiar. Have I seen one of your videos?\nMaybe.\nRight! I remember that. Okay. So...you're making another video?\nI hope to. That's why I'm running a Kickstarter campaign.\nAh, I get it. You want my money.\nWell, yeah. That'd be nice. But I'd be just as happy getting you to dance on video and send it to me.\nWhy would I do that?\nBecause if you do, I might come out and dance WITH you.\nAnd why is that a good thing?\nBecause then you're connected to all the people I've ever danced with, like those Huli Wigmen in Papua New Guinea, and that nice lady in North Korea. And Beyonc\u00e9.\nHang on. Beyonc\u00e9?\nWell, no. But thousands of other people all over the planet. You'll be in good company.\nDo I have to give you money first?\nNope.\nHow do I send you a video?\nGood question.\nI don't want to watch a video. What does it say?\nDude, it's right there in the thumbnail.\nHold a sign with your location written on it.\nKeep your video it under 20 seconds long.\nUse #dancewithmatt in the upload details.\nDon't include copyrighted music that will cause the video to be taken down.\nGot it. And what if I want to give you money?\nHey, thanks! You came to the right place. Just pick a reward tier and...\nHang on. How much does it cost to fly around the world and dance with people? What are you spending my money on?\nRight. Does this help?\nFair enough. So what do I get for backing?\nAt the $10 level, you get three things:\nVOTE ON WHERE I GO. Your pledge will automatically count as one vote for the location listed in your Kickstarter profile. It doesn't matter which tier you back at. Each backer gets one vote. You'll be notified of when and where I'll be dancing so you can join in.\nTHANK YOU VIDEO. We'll scroll the names of all the backers up the screen while I dance to say thanks. I'll have a water bottle and towel handy, because it could take a while.\nThank You Video\nDOWNLOAD OF THE FINAL VIDEO. When the new dancing video is complete, you'll be able to download it to keep on your devices in the highest quality format without copy protection.\nAt the $25 level, we'll add:\nPOSTCARD FROM THE TRIP. Get a signed postcard in the mail of me dancing somewhere strange and exotic during my trip.\nSample Postcard\nAt the $100 level, instead of one postcard you'll get:\nSET OF POSTCARDS. Get a series of SIX signed postcards in the mail of me dancing in strange and exotic places during my trip.\nAt the $400 level, we'll add:\nDANCE-A-GRAM. I'll send you a personalized dancing video from my trip that includes a mix of exotic locations. You tell me the message and I'll say it while I dance around the world. One-of-a-kind birthday gift? Awkward wedding proposal? Fire an employee? Deliver the message to your friend, loved one, or underperforming subordinate in a unique and memorable way (okay, obviously nothing hurtful or unreasonable).\nAt the $2000 level, instead of the Dance-a-gram, you'll get:\nMATT COMES TO YOU. I'll dance with you where you live anywhere in the world at a mutually agreed-upon date and time. I'll upload the video to YouTube when we're done, but I can't give any assurances that what we film will make it into the final video I release. (Terms and conditions apply.

Additional guests welcome for a separate, reduced fee.)\nJOIN MATT IN MYANMAR (BURMA)\nMyanmar Tour\nSpend four days with me in one of my favorite places in the world.\nRide in a hot air balloon over the lost city of Bagan.\nFly to Mandalay to walk the U Bein stilt bridge and see Kuthodaw Pagoda; with its 730 inscribed stone tablets that make it \"the world's largest book.\"\nVisit the spectacular Shwedagon Pagoda in the capitol of Yangon.\nWe'll dance at all the major stops to create a special Mynamar trip video that will be put on YouTube.\n(Flights from/to Myanmar not included. Additional guests welcome for a separate, reduced fee.)\nJOIN MATT IN NAMIBIA\nNamibia Tour\nSpend four days with me in one of my favorite places in the world.\nRoad trip across the otherworldly Namib desert.\nVisit Dead Vlei; a surreal clearing of sun-blackened trees surrounded by some of the highest sand dunes on Earth.\nStay in a functioning lighthouse outside Walvis Bay.\nKayak out to a massive seal colony.\nTake a quad bike tour across the sand dunes.\nWe'll dance at all the major stops to create a special Namibia trip video that will be put on YouTube.\n(Flights from/to Namibia not included. Additional guests welcome for a separate, reduced fee.)\nCOMPANY-WIDE DANCING VIDEO. I'll come to you anywhere in the world to create a dancing video with your employees. Optional 30 minute talk about my story and what I learned, followed by a group dance and individual photos/videos with the audience. (Terms and conditions apply. Send me a message to discuss before backing.)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've made a few of these round-the-world dancing videos, so I have a pretty good idea of the work and costs involved. However, this is my first Kickstarter campaign, and my first time working with backers.\n\nThis project is far more collaborative than my previous efforts. I'm asking supporters to determine most of what goes into this video, so there is the risk that goes along with any shared creative effort. In addition:\n\nDISASTERS\nThis project will include many far-flung countries all over the world, so there is the risk of both natural and unnatural disasters altering the plan as we go.\n\nLOSS AND DAMAGE\nEquipment could get damaged. Footage could be lost or destroyed. All the gear I use is easily replaceable and we'll constantly be backing everything up to the cloud, so those risks are mitigated but still very possible.\n\nINJURY\nOne thing that isn't so replaceable: my body. I could get injured to the point that I can no longer dance. Worse, I could die. Let's not dwell on that.\n\nFAMILY\nSomeone close to me may require my presence to a degree that I'm no longer able to travel. My family is the top priority in my life. If I need to stay home for any of them, this project is going on pause.\n\nCOSTS\nThe costs of travel fluctuate a great deal. Exchange rates change. Fuel prices rise. Flights are missed and need to be re-booked. These things could limit how far we can make our travel dollars go.\n\nPOSTCARDS\nMailing postcards to backers from remote locations could go wrong for a multitude of reasons. Addresses are miswritten or misread. Postcards get rained on or crushed or forgotten. Stuff gets lost in the mail all the time. We're factoring in the high risk that postcards won't get delivered and will do our best to resend them.\n\nTOURS\nThe select few backers who come with me on the trip will be taking on a whole other level of risk. The activities we plan may prove impossible once we're there. The destinations, unreachable. In places like Bhutan, Myanmar, and Namibia, things don't always go according to plan. We'll do everything we can to create a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those who join me on my trip, but if things don't go our way, we may have to improvise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "It's Done!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "3 Days Until Release!", "update_content": "I wrapped filming on the new video in Cape Town two weeks ago.

Stalk camp counselors across Crystal Lake as Jason Voorhees, or assume the role of a helpless camper and attempt to survive the night. Come be a part of this incredible moment in video game and horror history! We definitely can't do it without you. \n                                                                                    Behind the Scenes Interviews\nWhat is Friday the 13th: The Game?\nFriday the 13th: The Game is a third-person, asymmetrical multiplayer title where one player controls Jason Voorhees while the remaining seven control camp counselors trying to survive the night.That's right...1v7 multiplayer set in the semi-open world of Camp Crystal Lake! It's a classic horror fan's dream, no shaky cam, no found footage. We want you to know we're revitalizing the golden era of slashers, and putting you at the controls of each horrific, blood-splattered moment.\nHorror Mash-up! Sackhead Jason from Part II performing the Head Crush Kill from Part III!\nFriday the 13th is the definition of horror to the millions of fans around the world. A masked killer going after the young and vulnerable; it grabs our attention, it frightens us, and yet we all come back for more. Friday the 13th: The Game will give you the feeling of horror and dread that you expect from Jason Voorhees. This will be the ultimate asymmetrical horror experience unlike anything you\u2019ve seen - a title we\u2019re proud to introduce that is worthy of the name \u2018Friday the 13th\u2019.\nReturn to Camp Crystal Lake...\nWhat happened to Summer Camp?\nWe were already building Slasher Vol.1: Summer Camp, and we've been creating and testing an internal prototype for some time now. You may recall that we announced Summer Camp last Fall via IGN. Soon after, Sean Cunningham personally reached out to us behind the scenes. That\u2019s when things got awesome. \nJason's watching you!\nSean came to us in early 2015, but we quickly discovered these weren\u2019t the normal business conversations you would have when you try to secure a license as important as Friday the 13th. It was totally different. It was a conversation built on mutual admiration and respect for what each had created. Sean immediately noticed the passion we had for Friday the 13th, and after several incredible meetings over the next few months, we decided to upgrade our plans for Summer Camp and embrace the Friday the 13th video game license. After several incredible meetings over the next few months, Sean surprised us by offering the Friday the 13th video game license. It was literally a dream come true for a group of lifelong fans. He knew he could trust us with the most coveted horror IP ever, and we plan to make good on that promise to both him and you, the millions of loyal Friday the 13th fans around the world.\nWhy use Kickstarter?\nThe great news is that we\u2019re not starting from scratch! We have already invested a lot, both financially and emotionally, into Slasher Vol. 1: Summer Camp. This isn\u2019t a request to put money towards an idea or vertical slice, but when we got the rights to Friday the 13th we knew we had to make the game better, with more features and content that complements the franchise. To put it bluntly, we wanted this game to be every bit as big as the franchise on which it is based.\nWe love the Friday the 13th franchise. Seriously, we love slashers through and through, and we know that horror fans can sense when something is phoned in without the care and attention to detail the genre deserves. We know this because we are fans. Friday the 13th was the biggest inspiration for Summer Camp so we were understandably thrilled beyond belief to have the opportunity to make an official Friday the 13th game. To do this right we had to change our original approach to take full advantage of a license that allows us to do something bigger, more focused, and better. That change is why we\u2019re here. We need the extra support to do this correctly. For you, the fans.\nWe want you to be involved in the process. Get behind the scenes access by backing!\nWhy not partner with a publisher?\nGreat question. We love working with publishers, most of them are great companies to work alongside. Fans of the \u201cFriday the 13th\u201d film series know that when it comes to Jason Voorhees, violence, gore and nudity aren\u2019t just concepts to consider \u2013 they\u2019re necessities. Collectively, we wanted to make certain that this game delivers the same kind of fun, brutal scares and creative kills that the franchise is known for and didn\u2019t want to risk having to tell our story with a \u201cT\u201d for Teen rating. We don\u2019t want that. You don\u2019t want that. \nWe\u2019re not interested in compromising what made the film franchise so popular. We\u2019re interested in building precisely what we, as fans, want. The ultimate Friday the 13th experience. Blood, guts, gore, brutal kills, and more. You want an experience true to the films, and so do we. It\u2019s about creative control and delivering the best game we can. We want to share that control, with you, not a publisher.\nI can be Jason Voorhees, right?\nYou get to play as Jason. Let\u2019s say that again. YOU GET TO PLAY AS JASON! You get to stalk camp counselors in Camp Crystal Lake and brutally kill in new and inventive ways (as well as some that will seem all too familiar). Grab a counselor in a choke hold, pick them up off the ground, and smash their face into a tree. Repeatedly. Or how about lifting a counselor up above your head as they kick and scream, holding them aloft long enough to walk near a rack of farm spikes to slam your victim down upon them? Yes, you get to do that because that\u2019s what Jason does. He\u2019s an unflinching, brutal killing force; the ultimate predator, and for the first time ever YOU control this horror icon.\nJason Voorhees is the ultimate predator! Brutal, merciless, and unrelenting...\nWe didn\u2019t stop there. We added Kane Hodder to our team last Fall and with the license we\u2019re happy to report that Kane will be returning to the iconic character for the first time in 14 years. Kane will be doing all the motion capture as well as directing his team of stunt men to help us capture the most brutal animations possible \u2013 professionals that can take the physical abuse that Kane will put them through. Once again, it HAS to be done right. No exceptions. That\u2019s part of why we need your help. \nPlay as the most prolific slasher in all of Horror!\nFriday the 13th: The Video Game is focused mainly on the Jason vs Counselor scenarios that have been the staple of the series since the beginning; you will be playing as Jason or a camp counselor in Camp Crystal Lake. The multiplayer component to the game will pit one player as Jason against up to seven people as counselors. We\u2019ve dedicated an incredible amount of time to balancing out counselor vs. Jason scenarios to ensure fans are every bit as excited by the possibility of slaying jocks, nerds, and cheerleaders as Jason Voorhees, while simultaneously giving you that sense of challenge and fear from being a counselor.\nOne of our major goals is overcoming the stigma that some players have about asymmetrical multiplayer games. We know the worst feeling in the world of multiplayer gaming is believing you are \u2018stuck\u2019 and \u2018without hope\u2019. Horror in general, but specifically Friday the 13th, lends itself well to this style of game. The premise plus our game design consideration will overcome this dilemma and we can prove that asymmetrical multiplayer can work, be balanced, fun and frightening as hell.\nWhile Jason can be an immensely daunting, seemingly unstoppable force, he is able to be brought down with an \u2018epic\u2019 win condition. It\u2019ll be difficult, require some teamwork, and perhaps a bit of ingenuity, but we\u2019ll be giving you the tools and opportunities to realize the biggest win in horror gaming. That sense of relief at the end, knowing you stopped the biggest and baddest killer in the world is not something to take lightly\u2026 We hope that this becomes a proud gaming moment for everyone that achieves it, one worth sharing and boasting to the world about. Lest you be worried\u2026 Jason will always come back for more!\nWatch out Jason, she's got a mean kick!\nPlay as Jason Voorhees - The game you\u2019ve been waiting for; you\u2019ll be stalking the shadows and picking off each and every counselor as the most feared name in horror, Jason Voorhees! Jason will be brought to life in the game and you make the decision of how to go about setting up and performing each kill! We\u2019ll be giving you a slew of abilities to terrify, harass and then brutally dispatch those opposing you.\nIt's probably too late once it's gotten to this point...\nCounselors: Fight or Flight - Jason is deadly, but he can be stopped! The movie does have to end, right? You and your fellow counselors will have a multitude of ways to escape from Jason while in Camp Crystal Lake. Not satisfied with simply running? You\u2019ll have the opportunity to try and take Jason out. Be warned, Jason won\u2019t go down easy, and nothing is a sure thing.\nClassic stereotypical horror character classes... Say that 3 times fast.\nMake Your Own Horror - Camp Crystal Lake, Jason Voorhees and a lot of horny teenagers makes for a lot of good stories. We\u2019re going to be implementing a \u2018Movie Trailer\u2019 system that plays at the end of the match. This dynamic trailer will highlight the best moments of every game, in the style of the original 1980\u2019s trailers! Each and every time you play Friday the 13th, you\u2019ll be creating your own little movie. Beyond that, we plan to allow you to share your best trailers. Want to show Jason killing in dark, grisly, or even hilarious ways? Do it! Want to try to emulate the trailers from the original 80\u2019s films? Give it a go. We\u2019re eagerly anticipating some really gnarly cuts from the community\u2019s trailers!\nFear System - Jason Voorhees strikes fear into every single person he comes across, and while many bravely attempt to take him on, most fail. The fear of never knowing where Jason is at any given time is powerful, and counselors will have to do everything they can to mitigate that fear while playing. Get too struck with fear and you\u2019ll start to question what\u2019s real and what isn\u2019t.\nProgression - Friday the 13th is a long-running franchise, one with a whole cast of characters. Players will get a unified progression system to unlock multiple Jason character models from the classic films, as well as additional Camp Counselors with their own unique stats and traits.These are just a few of our unlocks and only scratches the surface of what we have planned to engage players over the lifetime of Friday the 13th: The Game. Remember, creative gameplay from both counselors and Jason will result in bigger and better rewards!\nThe Return of Tommy Jarvis - One of our biggest goals is to bring back Tommy Jarvis as a guide for you, the player. With a stretch goal, we hope to give you a fully 3D environment where you can access stories about Jason, view your progress and even collect bits and pieces from Camp Crystal Lake for use with Tommy Jarvis. Do enough for him, and a special surprise will await you!\nThat really depends on where this Kickstarter campaign takes us. Summer Camp was originally conceived as a multiplayer title only, and thus was budgeted as such. It was only after taking on Friday the 13th that we really started to dream up plans to bring Jason to life in ways that everyone has wanted to experience (but no one has been able to create to date).\nTo that end, the proposed single player portion will give you the Jason experience you\u2019ve never had; direct through his eyes. We\u2019ll be offering several \u2018scenarios\u2019 based off classic movie scenes from the franchise as you stalk and kill each and every counselor from a first person perspective. Not to leave the counselors out, we\u2019ll be adding several counselor scenarios where you\u2019ll have to confront your fears and take on Jason directly, especially in compromising situations! We are not going for anything less than a Mature Rating on this; the franchise deserves it! These scenarios might also make their way to VR, and would bring an entirely new perspective to the slasher genre!\nPLAY\n\n#Unleash Jason! Help us bring him back! \nWe\u2019re proud to announce that Friday the 13th: The Game, and Jason Voorhees's return to video games, is fueled by none other than the amazing Unreal Engine 4 from Epic Games!\nUE4 makes it possible to fully realize Camp Crystal Lake, in all it's horrifying beauty.\nSTRETCH GOALS FULLY REVEALED!!\nRIPPIN\" HEARTS OUT!!

It's a real chance to push asymmetrical multiplayer in new and interesting directions and doing it with such an iconic part of my life is just icing on the cake.\nShane Stoneman\nLead Artist:You grow up seeing these old slasher films thinking that they would make a great game, or wondering why someone hasn't jumped at the chance to make something like this a reality. This is that chance. Jason for me is the king of all slasher films and to have the opportunity to work on such a large IP is quite the honor. I'm pretty stoked to be able to bring this iconic character to life in a game with such a talented team.\nThis game represents years of dreaming about doing a Friday the 13th game, those dreams have brought us to this point.

Only pledgers shall know the truth.\n*****************************************************************************************\nNEW $50,000 STRETCH GOAL!\nThose of you who have seen the band live over the past several years have likely intermittently noted Dick Valentine wearing a cape. There have been a few different versions of this cape. We're not putting any of those up but there will be a BRAND NEW cape made for \"Roulette\" and once we hit $50,000 we shall once again turn to our old friend the Random Number Generator and determine a winner who shall receive this one of a kind garment. This will be the only \"Roulette\" cape in captivity, so let's hope we hit the mark.\n*****************************************************************************************\nEDIT AS OF JUNE 28\n$40,000 HAS BEEN REACHED!\nOK, so first thing's first...Now that we have reached the stretch goal, it is time for the pledgers to vote. We will film FIVE songs for inclusion on \"Roulette\" Two of the five slots will be reserved for songs off the new album coming out in October. We can't give you those titles yet but soon enough, soon enough. You, the pledgers, the backers, the CRAZIES, shall decide the other three from a list of the following candidates:  \nNight Vision\n Boy Or Girl\nKarate Lips  \nHorseshit  \nWho The Hell Just Call My Phone\n Good View Of The Violence\nNew Shampoo  \nPledgers may vote by indicating ONE of these songs via Kickstarter message over the next 3 days. Voting will close at 11:59 PM Eastern on Wednesday, July 1. The top three votegetters will be placed in the mix, performed and filmed. Our intention at this point is to film at DIY in Ferndale, Michigan on September 25. This is a show free to the public, so if you want to see a wonderful set and become immortalized on video forevo, join us if you can. Thanky.\n*******************************************************************************************\nEDIT EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 24\nWe are now offering an \"all-in Digital Download\" package whereby you will get a digital copy of the film \"Roulette Stars of Metro Detroit\" PLUS a digital copy of the soundtrack PLUS a  digital copy of the \"Dick Valentine Raw\" material as well.\nAlso, ALL PLEDGERS who have pledged for physical disc packages (so that's everyone except for the original $20 digital download package) will get a FREE digital copy of \"Roulette\" as well as a FREE digital version of \"Dick Valentine Raw.\" That's in addition to the free digital copy of the soundtrack you were already getting.  Keep in mind, the digital version of \"Roulette\" is a 720P version, so not the same high definition resolution as contained on the Blu Ray version. So again, pledgers in all categories except the Digital Download selection who pledged the additional $20 for the 2 disc set don't have to do anything...you'll get everything digitally as well as physically.\n********************************************************************************************\nEDIT AS OF JUNE 15 : We have added a \"Choose The Cover Plus Live Component\" reward package to the offerings on hand. Check the rewards to the right for details.\n********************************************************************************************\nEDIT AS OF JUNE 9: We've had a few pledgers contact us asking to make \"Sexy Trash\" available as a bonus add-on in this campaign. We're happy to do so. Unfortunately, Kickstarter limits our ability to change descriptions, pricing, etc. once we've started but the fix for this is similar to the 2 disc bonus set already available.  If you'd like to add \"Sexy Trash\" to your pledge, simply add $10 to your total and message us via Kickstarter (don't put it in the \"Comments\" section, please...we won't see it or connect it with your pledge) indicating that you'd like \"Sexy Trash\" to be added. We'll also get that info from you with survey questions once the campaign closes but hitting us with it a couple of times helps to ensure nothing slips through the cracks when it comes time to fulfill, which believe us is in our best interest as much as it is the pledgers.\n********************************************************************************************\nThe following may be attributed to Dick Valentine:\nFor over a decade now, fans of Electric Six have been clamoring for a \u201cbehind-the-scenes\u201d documentary about the Electric Six. The reasons for never doing one are manifold. There are no scenes. There is nothing to get behind. There is only the cold icy tundra\u2026.of reality. And the reality of Electric Six on the road\u2026is six guys sitting there.\nPlus, no one watches VH1 Behind The Music anymore. Today\u2019s viewers are interested in opulence, luxury, the caviar and the people, specifically the bitches, that bathe in these things. Bathing in caviar is now known as \u201creality\u201d and over 70 million viewers have cast their vote. Fantasy is out\u2026.reality is in. We no longer want to hear about the heroin needle stuck in Nikki Sixx\u2019s arm. We want to see billionaire housewives drinking too much champagne and stepping on each other\u2019s necks\u2026with 5-inch heels.\nElectric Six has taken the hint and is excited to bring you the pilot episode of its new reality television series \u201cRoulette Stars of Metro Detroit\u201d. Now it can be revealed\u2026the boys in Electric Six have spent the last several years at Detroit casinos gambling their way into a life of luxury, and the time has come for you to go behind the scenes to see how they live. You will see dreams realized, money attained, jewels attained, infinity pools attained...bitches tamed.   You will see the rapturous ramparts of reality within which only Electric Six can realistically reside.\n\"Roulette Stars of Metro Detroit\" will be a 45-60 minute near-feature length production, to be embodied on DVD, Blu Ray and digital download. As part of the project, you can bid on fantastic packages, countless opportunities to inject yourself into the reality of Electric Six. Through participating in the making of \u201cRoulette Stars of Metro Detroit\u201d you get exclusivity. You get membership points. And you may even end up at a restaurant, choking on a pork chop, while Percussion World gives you the Heimlich maneuver. It doesn\u2019t get more real than that.\nNow, we anticipate the question you're all asking... is this reality\u2026or is this fantasy? The answer\u2026is in the cards\u2026.\nElectric Six is going all in on you. We need your help this summer to help us help ourselves to some screen time. Help us? We\u2019re Electric Six. We are good at kickstarting ourselves and that\u2019s mostly because of you. We\u2019re all in on you. So sit back, have a cocktail\u2026.and watch that ball bounce on the wheel of fate. Dealer goes to the house, house goes to the odds. Everyone\u2019s a winner. Devil gonna get his due\u2026.\nNOTEWORTHY FEATURES/ELEMENTS/TALKING POINTS\n- \"Roulette Stars of Metro Detroit\" will be a 45-60 minute near-feature length film, written by Dick Valentine and filmed by Tom Lehrer and Tom Nahas,  using the structure of a pilot episode of a series which clearly will never exist. This is a project we've been kicking around in one form or another for several years now, and now is the time. Now is the time to act. Now is the time to make it happen. What you will get as a pledger is that \"pilot episode\" plus behind the scenes hijinks, outtakes, bloopers, deleted scenes and more as extras. As this is a film project which must be executed when we are available (i.e. not on the road changing your lives one gig at a time), it will take some time to complete. Little bits of this have been done already but the vast majority of filming, all editing and post production work lies ahead. We are anticipating a delivery date of June 2016 of packages to all pledgers. \n- \"Roulette\" will feature a soundtrack EP by Electric Six. This soundtrack will include at least 5 songs (possibly more by the time we're done) and feature new, original and exclusive material as well as perhaps a remix or two of other Electric Six songs. \n- EVERYONE who pledges will get not only the film in whatever format they choose, but a digital download of the soundtrack included as well, at no additional charge.\n- There is a bonus option available on all packages save the \"digital download of the film\"...this includes a physical two CD set comprised of the soundtrack AND \"Dick Valentine Raw.\" The Dick Valentine disc is a collection of deep demos recorded by the man himself. These are early, embryonic versions of songs you know and cherish, from all of his projects (E6, Evil Cowards, and solo work). They're mostly synth driven and only two include a vocal. The track listing for this one is as follows:\nClasson Ave. Robots (Evil Cowards)\nDigital Jackass (Became \"System Overload\" on second EC album) \nHello! I See You! (with vocals)\nI Belong In a Factory \nI Can Translate\nI'm Not Scared of Flying Saucers (Evil Cowards) \nLaughing Gas (\"Stretching Out The Tunes For Mario\" on Here Come The Bags!)\nMaking Progress \nMiami (\"Zombie Zombie Skeleton\" from Bite Me songs) \nRubbin' Me The Wrong Way \nSuitcases (w/ vocals when it was originally intended for a female artist) \nSynth 2 (became Flashy Man) \nTheme from Garage Band \nTonight Should Have Never Been Tonight \nWaste of Time and Money \nZora and Nora (Evil Cowards) \nKickstarter doesn't make it easy on us to deal with options like this, but here there's a pretty simple way to go about it. As indicated in the package verbage, simply add $20 to whatever the pledge amount is for that package if you want the bonus 2 disc set. That will indicate to us that you've requested the CD set. We'll also ask about/confirm it when we send you the post-campaign survey questions. So, it's simple: if you want the bonus CD set, increase your pledge by $20 over whatever the stated price is for the package of your choice and you're all set. Note that for all pledges related to $500 packages and above, the 2 disc set is thrown in for no additional charge, so if you're pledging one of those packages, don't bother with the $20 increase. PLEASE NOTE FOR NON-US PLEDGERS ADDING THE BONUS OPTION: Kickstarter appears to be inconsistently failing to add shipping to these packages when you add in the bonus amount (sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't). In most instances, that shipping charge is $10 so please verify that you are being charged the package amount, the $20 bonus CD set amount and $10 for shipping. If the gliltch gets past you, no worries...we'll contact you directly to adjust. If it's adding the shipping automatically for you the way it should, you're all set. Sorry for the confusion but Kickstarter ain't gonna make it easy on anybody, apparently.\n- Many of the packages on offer require travel (either yours or, in most cases, ours). If you're interested in one of these packages but have questions as to whether we can realistically make it happen (due to where you live, where we live, timing, etc) you can email us at electricsixofficial@gmail.com and we'll work through it. We've been fortunate enough in the past to have all similar sorts of packages work out swimmingly for all concerned, so we don't anticipate any issues here. If you have questions, just ask.\n- In the past, we've had incredibly generous people who have wished to purchase multiple packages. Kickstarter makes this REALLY difficult, as you've been limited to one package per Kickstarter account. One way around this is to establish multiple accounts with them, using multiple email addresses, but that's unnecessary. Instead, just contact us and let us know what you want to do. We've handled that via the pledger simply increasing the one pledge they've made by enough to cover the cost of the second pledge. It's not ideal but it gets the job done and puts less hassle on your plate. Just contact us first and let us know what you want to do and we'll make it happen.\nIMPORTANT NOTE RE: EXCLUSIVITY \n- \"Roulette\" will be available for purchase only via this Kickstarter campaign. We won't be selling this at merch tables or by mail or via digital downloads (other than those pledged for during the campaign, of course). That goes not only for \"Roulette\" the film but also ancillary items such as the soundtrack and \"Dick Valentine Raw\" as well. We do things this way for two reasons. First, it allows us to have a defined set of parameters with which to work...we know our costs, we know our revenue and we know what we have to do in order to complete the project. Second, we like the idea of rewarding those who so graciously opt to support our projects with something which won't be readily available outside of the campaign. We don't cap the number of copies available...if you're interested, you can get it by pledging and we have a number of price points by which to do that. We also run the campaign for 45 days, so there's ample time to get involved if you so choose. Electric Six offers plenty of product which isn't limited in any way. With these projects, we opt to go another route.\nVan and Trailer, your temporary home for several hours if you pledge for the \"Hitchin' A Ride\" package\nThe spacious, luxurious interior of Van, your temporary home if you pledge for the \"Hitchin' A Ride\" package", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are virtually nil. We have the resources (or we will if this project is successfully funded). We have the technology. We have the know how, the partners and the old fashioned horse sense to pull this off.\n\nChallenges are the usual ones faced in executing any complicated project. We have great partners (Tom and Tom at Mad Habit Creative) and are confident we can meet our stated timeline for delivery but circumstances can change. On the other hand, we're 2 for 2 in delivering previous Kickstarter campaign products on time, so we believe it to be extremely likely that this one follows suit. Whatever happens, we believe we have a track record of communication between ourselves and fans, so all involved will be aware of progress made and any issues which might unexpectedly pop up in terms of delivery time. At this point, we believe we have built enough into the project's timeline to meet the stated delivery goal.\n\nOur funding goal is slightly higher than in previous projects because the costs involved are higher.

If we hit that number, the band will be producing a video for the song \"I'll Be In Touch\" off its new \"Fresh Blood For Tired Vampyres\" album. While we can't give away the plot just yet, know that it is heavily inspired by work from a pop music legend.\n \"You're Welcome!\" is a 2 disc set (available in both physical and digital versions). The first disc is a \"Mimicry Pt II\" of sorts, as it will also be covers, some selected by pledgers and others by the band. We had so much fun doing the first one and we get asked about doing more constantly by fans, so this was an obvious choice for us. The second disc will feature the first live recording the band has done in the UK. A show on April 22 in Oxford will be recorded for inclusion in this set and besides the setting, the other unique thing about it is that the band won't duplicate any songs included on either its live record of a few years ago (\"Absolute Pleasure\") or the live DVD from 2013 (\"Absolute Treasure\"). Instead the set will be comprised of songs which haven't been played in E6 sets for several years, songs from albums recorded since those two live recordings were completed, or in some cases songs which haven't EVER been played live by the band.

Her youth is deceiving, making her seem confrontational and quick to judge, though in reality she is constantly evaluating her next step. The pain she felt as an orphaned child fuels her compassionate desire to protect her loved ones and friends.\nGebel\nOriginal host for the magi-crystal curse that summons demons to the planet. Gebel (JEE-bill) was the only one to survive its effects at such a high level. He destroyed the guild that created him, but in doing so realized he was no longer human and had no place on Earth. This in turn, lead him to summon the demon castle from hell to appear on the planet.\nIt is said that his real purpose in summoning the castle was to give Miriam a place of her own, but as his Magi-crystal disease progressed, he soon forgot his own reasoning. The more he surrounded himself with hell-spawn, the quicker the magi-crystals engulfed his body. He continues to plot the downfall of man, and how to best convince (or use) Miriam to achieve his dark ambition.\nJohannes\nA member of the defunct Alchemist guild and Gebel\u2019s best friend. Johannes (yo-HAH-nis) was the only Alchemist who dissented with the plan to call demons to the earth to cement Alchemy as the prevalent philosophy. His rejection of the other Alchemists\u2019 scheme is what kept him from sharing their fate. He has a vague understanding that Miriam\u2019s awakening and the demon castle\u2019s appearance are no mere coincidence.\nExploration: Bloodstained's story unfolds as you explore Gebel's hellish castle; a sprawling structure that features a variety of locations. As you explore the massive castle you'll find warp gates that will allow you to travel quickly without having to backtrack too much.\nRPG Elements: It's not an Igavania without leveling, and Bloodstained will be no exception. In addition to the classic elements everyone\u2019s come to expect, enemies in Bloodstained will drop a wide variety of items, materials, and magi-crystals necessary to create the items that will get you safely through Gebel\u2019s castle. \nCrafting: As you explore, fight enemies, and complete quests you will gain experience and become more powerful, acquiring a variety of weapons along the way. Enemies will also drop materials you can use to craft new weapons and abilities using Miriam's training in alchemy.\n\n \n \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDarkness lurks around every corner, seeking to corrupt all that it touches. The world is torn between those in power and those the powerful would destroy, and both sides are held in thrall by the demons lust and avarice. Games get delayed sometimes, and it would be dishonest of us to promise you this one won't be.\n\nBut Inti Creates has shipped more than 30 games on eight different platforms, and Koji Igarashi personally oversaw the production and design of one of Japan's most legendary franchises. Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night is the kind of game they love to make, and they've got a lot of experience making them.\n\nBetween us, the people behind this Kickstarter have helped to launch and fulfill several of the biggest, most complicated gaming Kickstarters ever launched. We've spent months trying to get this one right because we believe in the game (and really, really want to play it.) We\u2019re certain the game will be made, and that you\u2019ll get all the rewards you\u2019ve backed for.\n\nIGA has worked for more than a year to prepare and gather support for this game because fans have asked him for it. Now that he's come to you for help, his goal is to make the game you've been waiting for. By backing this campaign, you'll become a part of the process. During and after the campaign he hopes to keep you involved, whether it's voting on swords and whips, telling us how you play his games\u2014as fast as possible, or exploring every hidden passage\u2014or helping us find the perfect style for the graphics.\n\nFinally, the possibility exists that a man scarred by unfeeling, power-mad alchemists could summon a hell-castle filled with demons across the street from Inti Creates headquarters in Tokyo. IGA has as much experience handling that risk as any game designer on earth, but we estimate that it might set production back slightly (depending on whether or not he's allowed to backdash).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #106", "update_userinfo": "Classic Mode and Kingdom Crossover Are Here", "update_content": "Hello, Army of the Night!\nClassic Mode and a new area and boss based on the hit game Kingdom: Two Crowns launched on January 14th.

Thanks for your support.\nYooka-Laylee is an all-new 3D platformer from the creative talent behind the Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong Country games. We\u2019ve come together to form Playtonic Games and create a spiritual successor to our most cherished work from the past!\nOur new heroes, Yooka (the green bloke with no pants) and Laylee (the wisecracking lady-bat with the big nose) were conceptualised from the ground up for stellar platforming gameplay, created by the same character artist behind the rebooted Donkey Kong family and legendary N64 heroes Banjo and Kazooie.\nUsing an arsenal of special moves like Yooka\u2019s tongue grapple and Laylee\u2019s tactical sonar blast, players will explore \u2013 and expand \u2013 gorgeous 3D worlds drawn up by esteemed environment artist Steven Hurst (Banjo-Kazooie series, Viva Pinata) and through skill discover the plethora of delicious collectibles hidden within.\nWe did this in 3 months. It took me almost that long to write this page.\nHeroes Built for Fun: Our new buddy-duo were dreamed up specifically for entertaining platforming gameplay and exceptional colour coordination. We think we've captured the spirit of our past heroes while introducing our most inventive moves yet.\nAn Arsenal of Abilities: Sonar blasting, tongue whipping, sky soaring\u2026 a move roster built for platforming fun \u2013 and unlocked with added freedom. Additionally, there may or may not be a move involving a giant fart bubble.\nYooka regretted filling out that PPI claim.\nA Dream Soundtrack: David Wise (Donkey Kong Country) and Grant Kirkhope (Banjo-Kazooie) combine in what's sure to be a melodic masterpiece! Seriously, clean out your ears - they're in for a treat.\nCollect-em-up 2.0: A roster of shiny collectibles with gameplay progression at their core (as well as other, more valuable materials). Every collectible type in our new game will expand gameplay in a meaningful way. Yes, we employ the man responsible for DK64's myriad of trinkets, but we've had a stern word. Our main collectible, Pagies, are used to unlock and expand new worlds in Yooka-Laylee.\nExpandable Worlds: Experience more of the playgrounds you love by spending collectibles to expand your favourites into bigger, more challenging worlds.\nTake (musical) note: our new collectibles are work in progress.\nA Cast to Last: A huge cast of memorable characters to meet (or beat) brought to life by the art and audio teams behind Banjo-Kazooie and destined to endure in future games as part of Playtonic Universe. Expect all manner of grunts, squeaks and squawks.\nIntroducing Play Tonics: Discover these unique gameplay modifiers and use them to customise gameplay to suit your style. Will you run faster, hit harder or fly further? Also, are they named after our studio or vice versa? We'll never know.\nArcade machines: Each world hides at least one secret arcade game encasing old-school gaming goodness. Complete its retro-tastic challenge to claim your Pagie!\nYou can expect accurate bat physics.\nDuring their adventures Yooka and Laylee will complete challenges to unlock and collect Pagies. These golden collectibles are the main currency in the game, used not only to unlock new worlds but expand them too.\nIt's snow joke, this world's going to be cool.\nIn the jungle world showcased in this Kickstarter for example, new islands containing advanced features and challenges will become available once you\u2019ve decided to hand your Pagies over to the world-building construction crew.\n\nDon\u2019t give a monkey\u2019s? Spend your Pagies elsewhere. If you desire, world expansion can be ignored entirely and you can hop, skip and roll your way through the standard worlds towards the final boss lurking in his or her mighty keep. And once the pivotal villain is nought but ash on the pavement, you can still opt to explore the expanded worlds with your full moveset post-credits to hunt down those leftover Pagies.\n\nYooka-Laylee will feature a truly mouth-watering (ear-leaking?) soundtrack created in collaboration by three of gaming\u2019s greatest composers, the legendary David Wise (Donkey Kong Country, Diddy Kong Racing), equally esteemed Banjo-Kazooie composer Grant Kirkhope (Viva Pi\u00f1ata, GoldenEye 007) and Banjo sound effects supremo Steve Burke (Kameo: Elements of Power). \nThis is one musical performance you definitely won\u2019t want to miss!

You might as well play it with your eyes closed, to be honest.\nIf our initial Kickstarter funding goal is reached, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team will deliver a complete and satisfying game package. However, given the opportunity and additional resources required, we have a list of \u2018dream\u2019 additional extras \u2013 and release structures - that we\u2019d love to deliver in order to make Yooka-Laylee an even better game.\nIf funded, Yooka-Laylee will be released for Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Wii U. However, the exact release timing and scope of each version will be determined by the success of this Kickstarter campaign and specifically, our stretch goals.\nWe\u2019d love to be able to guarantee a simultaneous, day-one release on all platforms in order to satisfy every Yooka-Laylee backer. In order to do this we\u2019ll need to significantly expand our resources and budget, and if we can reach the funding number required we\u2019d be excited to do so.\nAny extra money will of course go towards improving the game. Below is an example of some of the extra features we\u2019ll be able to fulfil by reaching stretch funding goals:\n What the Bleedin\u2019 Norah is a Toybox? Our Toybox experiences are designed to deliver hands on time with Yooka and Laylee before the game even comes out. You can be the first to take our heroic duo for a spin (literally, if you press X) but we promise this self-contained plaything won\u2019t spoil the full game: It\u2019s built from in-game assets arranged specifically for this experience. There won\u2019t be any objectives to beat, just a controllable duo, nice music and a few surprises too\u2026 !\n Toybox ++ The Enhanced Playtonic Toybox? Well of course, sir. A fine choice. I\u2019ll prepare the improved play space, advanced props and special moves right away. Oh I\u2019m sorry, are those sports shoes?

Between them, the seven-person Playtonic team has over 100 years of combined experience working on blockbuster franchises such as Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pi\u00f1ata and Kameo: Elements of Power \u2013 and using this Kickstarter we intend to grow our talent even further! Allow us to introduce the team (so far)\u2026\nOur plan is to have Yooka-Laylee ready to ship on PC, Mac and Linux by October 2016. Console versions will follow shortly after, dependent on resources and the performance of this Kickstarter campaign. However, if our crowdfunding is a big success and stretch goals met, then we will look to secure the resources required to pull off a simultaneous, day-one release on all major console platforms alongside PC, Mac and Linux.\nIn order to finish Yooka-Laylee we will need to expand our team to an \u2018N64 size\u2019 roster of around 15, which we\u2019ll look to do immediately upon reaching our funding goal. Therefore the vast majority of our budget will be allocated to wages and office space, plus the cost of outsourcing sound, testing and version creation. \n\nYooka-Laylee is a real passion project for the Playtonic team and we\u2019ve all made financial sacrifices to get it this far. We\u2019ll finish the game at a smaller scale even if this Kickstarter doesn\u2019t succeed, but the game will be bigger and better if it does! \n                                                                 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame development can be a harsh taskmaster, with time and financial constraints often providing unexpected challenges that can ultimately lead to changes and delays. Fortunately, the Playtonic Games team has collectively been involved in more than 30 different games across more than ten different platforms and has great expertise in the 3D platformer specifically, with a strong track record of shipping some of the genre\u2019s greatest hits. \n\nSo not only do we have extensive experience delivering quality releases within this genre, but we\u2019re also well versed in working under the pressures of strict deadlines, budgets and high expectation. We\u2019re very confident we can deliver a game that lives up to fan expectations, on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge is to find the perfect balance between our own ideas for Yooka-Laylee and the expectations of the community. We\u2019re well aware that many fans are deeply, passionately attached to our past work and in some ways probably understand and adore its intricacies even better than we do. That\u2019s why over the coming months \u2013 and during this very Kickstarter campaign \u2013 we\u2019ll be consulting the community on some design issues and then ultimately making the final decision within our development team on the absolute direction.\n\nIn the past our most famous games have been single-platform releases. However, backers can be assured that the Playtonic team already has the necessary experience and channels to deliver a multiplatform release, and if certain stretch goals are met we\u2019ll recruit in this area to deliver different versions of our game to an even smoother deadline.

Her fabulous voice can be heard on a half dozen other game soundtracks (Including Bloodrayne: Betrayal and Adventure Time: Hey Ice King!) However, in addition to her years of experience as a vocalist, she is also a skilled professional artist.

His recording and editing work can be heard all over WayForward and Yacht Club games, including Double Dragon Neon, Shovel Knight's trailers, and the infectious title track for Shantae: 1/2 Genie Hero. If you've heard The Impresario (Opera House) from OCRemix's Final Fantasy VI: Balance and Ruin album, then you've heard how Robbie can transform good music into something awe-inspiring.\nEach segment will be designed by a different team of artists. By pairing up traditional 2D and 3D illustrators and animators, we can give the project a huge range of visual contrast, telling a cohesive story that flows across many different settings.\nSo far, our list of contributors includes:\nCharmwitch [ Website ]\nCHARMWITCH is a Puerto Rican 2D artist currently based in Los Angeles, California.

Finally, the time has come. \nIt's our hope that lovers of music, art, film, and VR technology will all come together and help us to fairly pay our amazing artists and programmers, and bring something into the world that has never existed before. \nMost of our rewards are intangible but personalized, and this is by design - you'll be able to have your name immortalized in a video segment, see your face used in a creative way, or even co-direct your own entire segment!\nWe're sure that you, the Kickstarting public, have seen how easy it is to promise all kinds of crazy physical reward tiers, figurines, posters.. and then run out of money to actually finish the project. We want to put as much as possible directly into creating [NUREN], so the few physical items we're producing are going to be extra-cool, and extra-exclusive!\nFor example, here's the original $50 tier reward (SOLD OUT for the $50 tier itself, but higher-tier backers will still get one!!) A custom-machined USB thumb drive, containing the complete [NUREN] production for Windows, Mac, and Linux, as well as a copy of the soundtrack in MP3 and FLAC! (Colors and final design will vary; this is just a prototype!)\nUPDATE: THE USB THUMB DRIVES HAVE SOLD OUT! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!\nNot wanting to leave you $50 backers out in the cold, we are proud to announce A BRAND NEW $50 tier: The COMPLETE VIRT COLLECTION -- Every album that Jake has released on Bandcamp, including game OSTs and original albums, all in a single download, PLUS an entire SECRET BACKER BONUS ALBUM of exclusive material, which has never been made available on Bandcamp, with custom artwork! And who knows, there could be a few more hidden soundtrack gems that you never expected to hear! But even just 16 albums for $50, PLUS [NUREN], PLUS all the lower tiers, is a pretty good deal, if you ask us.\nIs there anything lasers can't do?  We just got some custom made METAL COLLECTABLE CARDS!  You can get one red or blue metal card of your character of choice for $50.  These cards are anodized aluminum and heavy with a laser etched image on one side and the NUREN logo on the other.  If you can't decide which card to get you can also grab our new $200 tier featuring the PLATINUM CARD COLLECTION.  This collection includes all 4 combinations of red / blue  cards with QGK / RIX and one platinum colored aluminum card.  This is five cards total!  The platinum card will have custom art and will be signed by the crew.  These are very limited in quantity and will be individually numbered.  No two will be alike!\nPrototype cards shown. Images will be different.\nPrototype cards shown. Images will be different.\nWe will unveil pictures of the collectible art book and T-shirt during the campaign, as soon as we've finished the prototypes!\nIf demand is high enough, we MAY consider doing a physical run of soundtrack CDs, but the flash drive is something you can actually use!

There is no question that we can complete this project with an incredibly high level of creativity and polish.\n\nYour support will go directly toward hiring artists and engineers; the two co-directors won't be taking a cut at all until [NUREN] is out for sale to the general public. We still have to pay bills and eat during development, so we must continue to take on freelance work with other clients.\n\nKnowing this ahead of time, we've assembled a phenomenal team of support staff. Having spent years working with (and as) off-site contractors, we know that logistics can make or break a project, so we're not taking any chances, and we're getting the help we need.\n\nTo help mitigate the cost of our physical rewards, we have friends and colleagues who are in the business of making things, with their own fabrication plants or direct access to otherwise costly services.\n\nWe're keenly aware that [NUREN] is already quite ambitious. By limiting our scope to 7 main segments, we can avoid the over-commitments that frequently doom large projects. If we are lucky enough to over-fund, we will \"build up, not out,\" hiring additional artists to make each existing segment and interlude even more stunning.\n\nWe hope you'll put your faith in our vision, and help us bring [NUREN] to life.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "[NUREN] and MINT POTION STUDIOS: UNITE!", "update_content": "What up, robots.

Players take turns drawing cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. The deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding by peeking at cards before you draw, forcing your opponent to draw multiple cards, or shuffling the deck.\n\nThe game gets more and more intense with each card you draw because fewer cards left in the deck means a greater chance of drawing the kitten and exploding in a fiery ball of feline hyperbole.\nThe game was created by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).  We think this game combines all the things we're best at creating, and and put together this Kickstarter campaign because we can't build this without you.\nSo if you're into card games or laser beams or weaponized enchiladas, please help us make this game a reality.  We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and enchilada kisses, \n-Elan, Matt, and Shane.\nThe Origin Story\nExploding Kittens started when Shane Small proposed a game to Elan Lee where a joker was inserted into a deck of cards and they took turns picking cards until the joker came up. It was called \u201cBomb Squad\u201d and it wasn\u2019t any fun at all.\nOver the next few weeks, two important things happened: First, after neglecting work, family, and a social life, Shane and Elan developed a rule-set that started working and brought the game to life. Second, Matt Inman saw the game, thought it was super fun, and asked to join the team. (btw, if Matthew Inman ever asks you if he can join your team, the answer is \u201cHELL YES\u201d.)\nWe changed the name to \"Exploding Kittens\" and our little team was born.\nBUT YOU'RE BLOWING UP KITTENS! NOT COOL, BUDDY.\nWe struggled with this a lot. We love the name Exploding Kittens, but we don't want to hurt kittens. We also don't want the kittens to be hurt by anyone else. Eventually we decided to explore the concept of the kittens blowing themselves up.\nFirst, Matt tried drawing the kittens as the actual bombs:\nBut that felt too Angry Birds\u2019ish.\nNext, we tried making the kittens suicidal, but that felt terrible.\nIn the end, we realized that everyone understands feline shenanigans, and that could be our solution.  Our kitties would not blow up out of malicious intent or negligence, but by doing the things that kittens do, like running across keyboards or chewing on things they shouldn't be chewing on.\nFrom there, the rest of the cards fell into place, and the cards used to defuse the exploding kittens were items you'd use to defuse regular kittens.\nHELP US BUILD THIS GAME\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community.  We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo, if a world full of weaponized pork missiles is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \n\nWith love and pork missiles,\n-The Exploding Kittens Team  (Matt, Elan, and Shane)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more information about the game: http://www.explodingkittens.com\n\nFollow us:  Facebook  Twitter\n\nMusic: Royalty-free music from Bensound.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduction of the game is simple: it's just a card game, so other than building the box it's a relatively straightforward product to make.

This will be a studio recording (not a live recording).  Our hope is to be able to obtain funding for our stretch goals so we can produce a full length live concert motion picture as well.  Over the past decade Video Games Live has helped to legitimize video game music and has shown the world the creative, cultural and artistic side of gaming. Although VGL has obtained a lot of accolades and success, the music industry and record companies are VERY different and no music or record company is willing to invest the budget needed to accomplish our goals and put out a top quality product that we and the entire game industry can be proud of. They don't believe in the culturally artistic significance of video game music and they don't believe that people are interested in listening after the game is turned off.  And that's where YOU come in!\nLast year we successfully funded LEVEL 3 on Kickstarter and the project came out ON TIME!  We over delivered on Rewards, content and number of songs on the album.  You can view the LEVEL 3 KIckstarter video HERE:\nLightning CAN strike twice!!\nThis project is open for funding for EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE in the world! We will ship anywhere and if we meet our video Stretch Goals there will be absolutely no region coding, etc. and PAL versions of the DVD/Blu-Ray will be made.\nVideo Games Live: Level 4 will be the 4th album of symphonic video game music from the award winning 10 year+ world touring Video Games Live concert series.\n\nThe album will be recorded, mixed and mastered in world famous recording studios with a 72+ piece orchestra of world class musicians as well as famous video game composers from around the world!\n\nEach music segment in Video Games Live is personally arranged and orchestrated by the original composers and also uses input from the actual game designers & producers and game developers & publishers.\n\nThe album track list will consist of NEVER BEFORE RELEASED Video Games Live music arrangements from game franchises such as Final Fantasy VI (Opera), Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Donkey Kong Country, World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, League of Legends, BioShock, Metal Gear Solid 3 - \"Snake Eater\", Earthworm Jim, Uncharted, Resident Evil, Assassin's Creed, Cave Story AND MORE!

We hope to be creating another DVD/Blu-Ray as one of our Stretch Goals!\n \nWe want to film the new Blu-Ray/DVD/motion picture in Latin America during our South American tour this December (Brazil, Chile).  The fans in Latin America are VERY loud, VERY excited and VERY passionate about Video Games Live.  Here is just a small taste of what it is like at a Video Games Live show in Latin America!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe album will take 3 full studio days to record.  An orchestral recording of this nature is based on 3 hour sessions.  We will need a total of SIX 3 hour sessions (18 hours total).  This cost could range anywhere from $75,000 - $110,000 depending on where the recording is done.  Our aim is to keep the budget low and the quality HIGH!  A top-of-the-line recording studio (including ALL costs) will be approximately $5,000 per day ($15,000 total).  Mixing with a top Hollywood film (& game) audio engineer (one week including studio and assistants) = approximately $25,000.  Mastering will take place at the most famous Mastering Studio in Hollywood (Bernie Grundman's) by one of the most highly regarded mastering engineers in the business... Patricia Sullivan. Patricia has personally worked with and mastered films by John Williams (including Star Wars & Indiana Jones films), James Newton Howard, James Horner, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Mark Isham.  Mastering budget for this type of project (both 24bit 96KHz & 16bit 48KHz versions) could go upwards to $7,500.  Other parts of the budget will include things like, CD manufacturing based on 7,500 initial units (approximately $7,500), Music Licensing/Mechanical Licensing to the Game Publishers, composers, right holders, etc. based on 7,500 initial units ($10,000), Kickstarter & Amazon fees (10% = $15,000), hiring of a PR firm in both North America and Europe ($10,000), Shipping & Handling of goods, added physical products at certain tier levels, etc.\n\nMusicians (symphony & choir) = $75,000 - $110,000\n(Includes all conductor, score supervisor & travel fees)\nRecording Studio = $15,000\nTrack Recording Editing = $5,000\nAdditional Musicians/Instruments/Studio Time = $5,000\nMixing = $25,000\nMastering = $7,500\nCD Manufacturing = $7,500\nMusic Licensing/Publishing/Mechanicals = $10,000\nKickstarter/Amazon fees = $15,000\n7% non-payment from backers = approximately $10,000\nProject PR (Worldwide) = $10,000\nMarketing (Facebook, YouTube, etc.) = $5,000\nDomestic U.S. Shipping & Handling of Rewards = $5,000\nPhysical Reward products (pins, mouse pads, sheet music, etc.) = $5,000\nLocation Rental & Celebration Events = $2,500\nChrono Trigger/Chrono Cross piano album creation & recording = $5,000\nMusic copying/printing for new arrangements = $2,500\n\nTaxes on Gross money raised (minus Kickstarter/Amazon fees and 7% backer non-payment) = $30,000\nTOTAL = Approximately $250,000 - $285,000\n\nDepending on how much money is raised or still needed, it will be put in by Video Games Live and Tommy Tallarico personally.\n\nVideo Games Live is not making any money from this project.  Our goal is to continue doing what we love and bringing it to the people who care (as well as introducing game music to people who don't!)\nVideo Games Live has produced 3 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray.  Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994 with Capitol Records) and has composed and produced 12 highly acclaimed albums since.  This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\nThe main idea behind our project is to give back as much as possible to donors by AT LEAST QUADRUPLING THE VALUE of the amount pledged! \n \n \n \n      \n      \n    \n       \n    \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \nHere's a handy text based matrix for all the Reward Tiers!

Track would be decided by the fans in a poll.\n\n$350,000 - Add a 14th track to the album.  Track would be decided by the fans in a poll.\n$400,000 - Mini documentary and interviews with game composers & designers on the making of the album as well as a behind-the-scenes look filmed during an upcoming Video Games Live tour.  Upon funding of this goal, EVERYONE who pledges will get a special and exclusive digital version of this documentary (we ask our fans to please NOT publish this publicly out of respect for the people who backed the project).\n$750,000 - A live full length feature film and documentary of the music, making-of, interviews with composers/designers, history of game music, etc. to be recorded during the upcoming Video Games Live South America tour taking place in December.

The VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 4 album will be a studio recording and NOT a live recording.  The movie on the other hand WILL be a live video recording (and documentary) filmed in South America.  Depending on additional funding and stretch goals, we may include a special download album of the live recordings from the film as well.\nThe main goal of Tommy Tallarico (25 year video game composer veteran and creator/producer of Video Games Live\u2122) has always been to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become as well as helping to usher in a whole new generation of people to appreciate the arts.\n\nPlease watch this very informative and important video that will give you incredible insight as to what goes on in creating such an event and the passion behind it (courtesy of Game Informer).\n  The cover of Symphony Magazine!\n\n\nJapanese Video Game Composer Party for Tommy Tallarico in Japan!  Check out this amazing party that my Japanese game composer friends had for me in Japan!\n\nIncorporated in 2002, Video Games Live\u2122 is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having already performed almost 300 shows in 40 countries on 5 continents. Over 1 million people have experienced the show live. Video Games Live\u2122 has previously released 3 albums worldwide (all of which debuted in the Billboard Top 10) as well as an award winning full length feature DVD/Blu-Ray.

As one of the most successful video game composers in history, he has helped revolutionize the gaming world, creating unique audio landscapes that enhance the video gaming experience.  He is considered the person most instrumental in changing the game industry from bleeps & bloops to real music now appreciated worldwide by tens of millions of fans.  As a well-recognized on-air television personality, live performer and composer, Tommy brings his in-depth knowledge, years of experience, and love of cutting edge multimedia and video games to the masses.  Tommy has worked in the gaming industry as a designer, product manager, producer, writer, games tester and heads of both music and video departments.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Tallarico has been writing music for video games for more than 25 years.  He has won over 50 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles; to date, they total sales of more than 100 million units and over four billion dollars in revenue.  No one in the history of the video game industry has ever worked on more titles and projects.  In 2008, he was enshrined in the Guinness Book of World Records with a two page feature article and interview and currently holds 3 Guinness World Records including the person who has worked on the most commercially released video games.  In 2012 during the Game Developers Conference he received a Lifetime Achievement Award and is also in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for his contributions to the game industry.  In 1994, he founded Tommy Tallarico Studios, the multimedia industry's largest audio production house.    Tommy is a cousin of rock star legend Steven Tyler (nee Tallarico) and in 2002 Tallarico\u2019s music was used as the opening song for Aerosmiths' \u201cGirls of Summer\u201d world tour.  His top titles include Earthworm Jim, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Disney\u2019s Aladdin, Spider-Man and Metroid Prime as well as top selling popular game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Madden Football, Mortal Kombat, Time Crisis, Unreal, Lineage, James Bond, Blitz Football, Knockout Kings, Test Drive, Scooby Doo, WWE & Twisted Metal. His score for Advent Rising has been noted as \"one of the greatest musical scores of all time\" by websites such as Yahoo, Gamespot and others.\n\nTallarico has been featured on numerous national and international television shows, appearing repeatedly on CNN, FOX and MTV.  Tommy hosted, wrote and co-produced the top rated and very popular Reviews on the Run/Judgment Day television show as well as the longest running award-winning video game television show, The Electric Playground (www.elecplay.com), which has been on the air since 1997.  The show is syndicated worldwide and airs daily in prime-time.  The Electric Playground won the 2001 Telly Award for \u201cBest Entertainment Cable Program\u201d.  In 2006, Tommy hosted and helped to launch the worldwide Championship Gaming Series for DirecTV.  His national television debut came in 1994 when he was featured and asked to guest host ABC's \"In Concert\" television program which included artists Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren.  From 1991 to 1994, he headed Virgin Interactive\u2019s music and video division, and executive produced numerous video game green screen shoots for films including \u201cDemolition Man\u201d where he worked with Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Hollywood producer Joel Silver.\n\nIn 2002, Tallarico created the critically acclaimed Video Games Live (www.videogameslive.com), an immersive, audio and video concert experience celebrating video games.  Video Games Live features music from the greatest video games performed by top orchestras and choirs around the world combined with synchronized video footage, lasers, lights, special effects, interactivity and live action to create an explosive and unique one-of-a-kind entertainment experience.  Video Games Live is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having performed over 250 shows in 25 countries on 5 continents.  The debut performance was launched on July 6th, 2005 at the world famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic.  Over 11,000 people attended making it the biggest video game concert in the world at that time (since then they have performed to over 40,000 people in places like Taiwan and China).  Most of the game music played during the initial launch of the show (Halo, Sonic, Warcraft, Tomb Raider, Myst, Kingdom Hearts, Tron, Advent Rising, etc.) had never been performed live anywhere in the world.  Since then over 1 million people have experienced the show live.  On October 30, 2005 they broke new ground once again by putting on the very first video game concert in Canada (Vancouver).  They followed with groundbreaking first ever game concert performances in countries such as Brazil, New Zealand, Spain, Mexico, England, Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Wales, United Arab Emirates & France.  Video Games Live was also the very first American video game concert to perform in Asia (Korea) and the first non-Japanese game concert to perform in Japan.  In 2007 they were recipients of a major industry award in Brazil for \"Special Breakthrough Achievement\" following their performances in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the year before.  Also in 2007 they helped to launch the $1.8 billion LA Live Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles and had their national television debut on Spike TV.  In 2008 they released the highly anticipated album entitled Video Games Live - Volume One, recorded at the world famous Abbey Road Studios in London, the album debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts.  It was the first video game compilation album to ever be released worldwide and won BEST SOUNDTRACK ALBUM awards from IGN.com and the Game Audio Network Guild.  In 2010 a 90 minute national PBS Special was aired in over 90 million households across America.  A Blu-Ray, DVD and album were released.  It was the first time that music from franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Sonic and Megaman were released outside of Japan.  The second album (entitled Video Games Live - Level Two) debuted at #8 on the Billboard Charts.  With literally 100\u2019s of ticket buyer reviews on Ticketmaster.com, Video Games Live boasts an impressive and outstanding 4.6 (out of 5) rating.   There are currently over 100,000 unique videos of Video Games Live performances on YouTube which total over 100 million views.  Sponsored and endorsed by some of the top corporations in the world, the Video Games Live concert event continues to tour the world, break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\n\nTallarico was the first musician to release a video game soundtrack worldwide (Tommy Tallarico\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. 1 \u2013 Capitol Records).  He has released over ten video game soundtrack albums since, including the highly acclaimed James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies, MDK and award-winning Advent Rising and Earthworm Jim Anthology.  Tommy was one of the first musicians to ever use live guitar and 3-D audio in a video game (The Terminator), and was instrumental in bringing true digital interactive multi-channel 5.1 surround to the gaming world.  He has performed and sold out shows on the biggest and most prestigious stages in the world including London's Royal Festival Hall and Hammersmith Apollo, the Olympic Park Stadium in Korea, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., WolfTrap, Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Pan-Chiao Stadium in Taipei, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and multiple shows at the Hollywood Bowl attended by tens of thousands of fans.  In 2004 he performed the grand finale music act on national and worldwide television (E! Entertainment, G4TV) with BT & Mobius 8 for the G-Phoria awards show.  In 2007 he performed along with Kid Rock and the Foo Fighters during the nationally televised Spike TV Video Game Awards show.\n\nTommy is the founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), which is a non-profit organization educating and heightening the awareness of audio for the interactive world (www.audiogang.org).  With over 2,500 members representing over 35 countries since its inception in 2002, G.A.N.G. has quickly become known as one of the strongest and best examples of helping the game industry community.  Tommy is an Advisory Board member for the Game Developers Conference, a Governor for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS/GRAMMY's), a spokesperson for the Entertainment Consumers Association, a proud member of the International Game Developers Association and a nominating peer panel leader for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nBorn February 18, 1968 and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, he moved to Southern California on his own at age 21 to pursue a career in entertainment.  Homeless with no means of financial support, Tommy was discovered in a music store and started working in the video game industry within 3 days of arriving in California.  All 4 of his grandparents came to America from Italy in the early 1900's and instilled a great sense of hard work, compassion, appreciation, passion, dreaming, creativity, sense of accomplishment and love for others that he has carried with him his entire life.  Tommy is a proud vegan and has been a spokesperson, supporter and contributor for many animal rights organizations.  In his spare time he enjoys nature, photography, traveling, cooking, video games, comic books, backgammon, being a kid and meeting new people.  His popular website www.tallarico.com has received over 250 million hits by more than 10 million unique users.\nHere is the video of Tommy's 2013 TED talk explaining the cultural significance of video games and they're importance as art.\nTommy playing Intellivision circa 1982", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe came through successfully with our Kickstarter last year! On time! On Budget! We know what we're doing and have done it many times in the past. Video Games Live has produced 3 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released award winning PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray. Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994) and has composed and produced 12 highly acclaimed albums since. This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\n\nBecause we have done this same kind of project multiple times in the past, we know exactly what the challenges for this project are (and how to overcome them). The toughest part in doing the project will be to get the game publishers approvals for the project. That being said, Video Games Live was the FIRST in the world to officially perform music from game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Warcraft, Sonic, Myst, Tron, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, StarCraft, Diablo, Civilization, God of War, Skyrim, BioShock, Mass Effect, Silent Hill, Shadow of the Colossus, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Tetris, Earthworm Jim, Journey, DOTA, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny, Monkey Island, Cave Story and MANY MORE! Video Games Live was also the FIRST to license music and synchronized video for an album and DVD/Blu-Ray release outside of Japan from companies such as Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami and Sega!\n\nVideo Games Live creator/producer Tommy Tallarico has been in the industry for over 25 years and has worked on over 300 video games (a Guinness World Record!). He has worked with and created games with every major publisher and game developer over the years. This is one of the main reasons why Video Games Live is able to get so many approvals and why it is the only show in the world with so many different games by so many different publishers and developers. \n\nAs I hoped I proved with the Level 3 Kickstarter...

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us. And if you do, you'll be hearing from several of us throughout the campaign, and after that, in our backer updates.

The 19 inch (48 cm) cable supports high-speed data transfer.\nUnlike power banks, JUMP charges automatically every time you charge your phone, giving you complete reassurance that whatever situation you are in, there\u2019s always power in your pocket.\nWe developed intelligent technology called AutoCharge\u2122 \nAutoCharge\u2122 is an efficient circuit prioritization system that detects when the battery inside your smartphone is full, and automatically redirects the power to charge the batteries inside JUMP.\nIt's always ready and charged\nJump provides a significant power boost to your smartphone when you need it most.\nIt's compact and lightweight\nJUMP fits easily in your coin pocket. (50mm x 50mm x 13.6mm)\nWith it\u2019s compact size, JUMP is small enough to hold behind your phone as you call.\n JUMP is case-friendly\nIt even fits with the official iPhone case\nWe designed JUMP to be your everyday charging solution. One of the priorities was to ensure it is small and compact, no bigger than your average rolled up cable, allowing you to take it with you wherever you go.  \nThe cable management system enables you to carry JUMP easily and neatly; no more messy cables thrown into your pocket or bag.\nPrecision-engineered channels securely hold the cable, allowing you to pull out the desired length during charging, as well as fastening whilst on the go.\nIntelligent design that is robust, compact and portable\nQuality of the components are extremely important to us \u2013 we wanted to create a device that cannot only withstand the stresses of everyday use, but is also something that looks and feels really good.\nWe custom made cables from a hard-wearing resistant nylon, resulting in cables that are durable and long lasting. We wanted to use materials for the casing that would ensure strength and longevity; therefore, we selected a thermoplastic blend of PC and ABS.\nThis is what we have been waiting for.\nFeatures Overview\nThe Design Story\nToday's Working Prototype\nElectrical evaluation of the first working prototypes have proven AutoCharge\u2122 and we are confident that JUMP will provide substantial additional charge to an iPhone 5s as we move forward towards production.\nWhy Kickstarter \nWe wanted to share JUMP, our latest product, through Kickstarter first. We recognize that Kickstarter hosts an important community: artists, innovators, and the intellectually curious. We wanted to share the background and development of JUMP with you because we value your opinions and support. We believe we have started a new product category within the portable charging market; one that we hope you would like to follow the progress of. Your support means everything to us, and all of the funding will go towards vitally important aspects of making this product a reality.\nNATIVE UNION\nnativeunion.com\nNATIVE UNION is a creative and lifestyle brand that has received critical acclaim from the design community.\nIn 2013 NATIVE UNION launched SWITCH, a wireless portable speaker, conference call device and mobile phone charger.

At this stage we foresee the largest of these hurdles, aside from the normal challenges involved in any development, is Made for iPhone (MFi) compliance testing and shipment of individual products around the world.\n\nJUMP is the first MFI accessory that combines a battery and sync product and is classed as a charging cable; this puts us in new territory within the MFI certification process.\n\nTo reduce risk and challenges, we have partnered with a world-leading manufacturer of MFI products; this provides us added insurance and confidence to pass the Made for iPhone (MFI) certification. \n\nDe-bugging the software involved in AutoCharge\u2122 and within compliance of MFI will take further fine tuning and testing as we want the most efficient device for power vs size on the market today.\n\nThe last challenge is getting the individual product to each of our kickstarter backers \u2013 with tighter restrictions on the shipping of singular products that contain batteries around the world today.

Taking on the role of Mutt, a naive and unlikely hero, players will run, flip, and dropkick across 9 unique, interconnected worlds.\nInspired by the boss battles of MegaMan players take on a league of sinister villains in a themed game world. By defeating and unmasking each of these villanos, Mutt gains new abilities and powers. Doing his best impression of Metroid\u2019s Samus Aran, Mutt uses these newfound abilities to retread through previously explored territory to unlock new areas and secrets. All worlds are found and unlocked from the game\u2019s overworld which holds it\u2019s own challenges and secrets for players to discover a la Banjo-Kazooie.\nPlayers will meet a colorful cast of oddball characters, (some friend, most foe) and enjoy offbeat humor through their gaming experience. Vibrant visuals, diverse worlds and more collectables than an episode of Hoarders; Lobodestroyo is the game for those of us who never really grew out the Nintendo 64 glory days!\nThe legendary Lobodestroyo is the sentinel of Costa Lucha. His wolf pack protects its citizens by locking away villains who threaten the peace, and maintain order from high atop Mt. Justice!  At least he did...\nMutt, the runt of the wolf pack litter, wakes up to find Mt. Justice in ruins; His wolf pack brothers missing; and the Lobdestroyo\u2019s championship belt strewn across his destroyed temple. To top it off the maximum security lockup has been breached and the 10 members of La Liga de Los Villanos have escaped. Determined to avenge his brethren and prove his worth, Mutt dons the championship belt and takes up the mantle of his fallen hero.\n'San Lobo' sits atop 'Mt. Justice'.

We have been plotting, planning and scribbling down the ideas, scripts and logic that we will build the game on. \nWe have our platform selected, our needs lined out and a head-start on the creative assets we intend to work into the final game. We are ready to go to the next step, which will require us to properly arm ourselves with the hardware and software needed to continue.\nBy building our game in Unity we will not only have the flexibility to deliver the title we want to build, but will have an easier time porting Lobodestroyo to other platforms\nDuring the campaign we have become Nintendo Indie Developers! Click here to learn a bit more about how Wii-U became one of our top priorities!\nNot to tip our hand but everyone on the core Lobo team is working upfront for free. We are all passionate about the project and want to realize that age-old gamer dream of creating our own title.\nThat said there are costs associated with a project like this, and that\u2019s where we need to go all \u2018panhandler' on you. Our artists need a few new digital brushes. We need to purchase music, record vocals and get the necessary Unity licenses in the hands of our eager programmers. There are numerous other expenses but the vast majority of what we are asking for is going directly to putting the tools in the hands of the guys who need them to bring Lobodestroyo to life. We are keeping our costs to an absolute minimum to ensure an achievable goal. While our goal total may seem high to many, please be assured that this is a tight budget considering the scope of the project.\nKickstarter is a fantastic tool for crowdsourcing that we are excited to use. Without it we would not be able to realize this project. We hope that you consider becoming a backer and join us on our nerdy journey.\nWe need Kickstarter to realize our vision for this game, more so we need YOU.

Being that we are building the game in Unity, we will be able to port to other systems with relative ease at minimal cost. These stretch goals will allow us to purchase the necessary licenses to move Lobo onto additional systems, as well as cover the associated costs with developing on new platforms. With the promising future for indie devs on next-gen consoles we are excited to aim at getting our game on Xbox One, Playstation 4 and Wii U. Please note that there will be additional development time to port these games to additional consoles and they will not be available at launch should they be funded.\nUPDATED MORE: We have rolled the Wii-U into our initial stretch goal! Checkout how/why in our update post!\nUPDATED: The Nintendo is strong with you backers! Wii-U bumped to the top spot to ensure a more obtainable goal. To learn more about how and why this happened click here.\nAt the risk of jinxing ourselves: If the beautiful people of the internet decide that we are able to not only meet these goals, but surpass them, then the additional funds will go directly into improving the balanced game we have laid out. Instead of falling into the trap of promising new worlds or additional content/items/characters, we want to funnel any additional funds to making Lobo the best game it can be. More voice actors, better music, higher production values and levels of polish. The more love you give us, the more we will be able to spend on our baby.\nWe're participating in OUYA's #FreeTheGames Fund, created by OUYA to support developers making new and creative console games.

A tree, a wall, an enemy, a passing cloud, even the levels themselves are all \"SCALEable\". Space is relative in the game so progress is as much conceptual as it is physical.

It\u2019s all about exploring and discovering secrets!\nYou play as young physics savant Penny Prince, inventor of a device which can suck the size out of one thing and shoot it into another.

If you\u2019d like to see the game before anyone else and give us feedback, pledge in a tier with Alpha access, and you\u2019ll get an extra-first look at SCALE as we\u2019re putting it together! This may be the only place in which you will be able to glimpse the creative team\u2019s true forms as they flicker in and out of existence briefly during the strenuous act of creating something from nothing.\nContrary to what the internet advises, you can\u2019t go naked all the time. You just can\u2019t. These tees, intended to cover and accentuate the chest and the top of the arms, are designed by Mr. Swink himself, with designs printed on tasteful grey, red, green, or blue cloth. Once this shirt arrives, place it on any part of your body and move about through the world to collect \u201cmad props\u201d, \u201cinstant respect\u201d, and fistbumps ad libitum. Transformation into a marmalade tabby is rare. After several weeks of wear, you will probably turn into some other sort of cat. \nPart of what we love about SCALE is it\u2019s potential for wild and abstract visuals made from the distorted hash of everyday objects like flowers, houses, cars, trees and even the landscape itself. It\u2019s already made for some fantastic and unique art. So we\u2019re really excited about putting together a series of slick posters! We don\u2019t have a final designs to show you yet, but we\u2019re planning on at least 5 of them. (One of our cat interns whipped up the prototype above). But rest assured, we will not feed our cats until they forge the finest print ever seen in their secret workshop underneath the stairs\nFor those of you who left a part of their heart in the 90s, we have just the thing: the SCALE OST in CD form. Glimmering sides caparisoned in delicately wrapped custom-designed packaging, this item will provide great comfort to those whom, when they listen to music, want to know that somewhere, somehow, there is a disk silently spinning.\nIf you are someone who enjoys existing in physical space and possessing objects likewise endowed with tangible properties, this is the reward for you! The Scale Meatspace Masterpiece Possession Form of SCALE includes a custom designed physical box for the game (artist and final design TBA), the game on disc, an instruction manual full of unique content/dubious advice, and a CD copy of the OST. All items possessed of mass and composed entirely of matter!\nWe\u2019re gonna\u2019 cut the SCALE OST and the ALL AWESOME COMPANION Albums to a pair of Vinyl discs housed in beautifully designed dust jackets. Why? Because we like vinyl\u2019s charm and warm sound. Those who obtain such an item should be prepared to instantly become cool(er?) and stay that way for the rest of their life.\nWhen the apocalypse comes and all your buds are vainly thumbing the blank screens of their uncharged mobile devices, won\u2019t you be glad you opted for the SCALE Masterpiece Meatspace Artbook with analog-style pages? In this volume, we will collect all the goodness of the digital artbook, wrapped up in retro physical form, amazing cover design, and custom packaging. Once it arrives, place it on a coffee table or bookshelf to seduce anyone instantly!\nSteve is a game design instructor who has experience helping game designers refine and scope their ideas into manageable, fulfilling projects. If you select this reward, he\u2019ll work with you to hone your idea into the best possible game it can be, and playtest, and offer feedback. Includes a trip to get ice cream. Not valid at participating locations offer void if coupons vouchers.\nAs Penny progresses through a universe she has skewed seemingly beyond all repair, her inherent curiosity compels her to collect all the subatomic particles that now drift as big as life through the detritus such as tachyons, fermions, muons, quarks, inflatons,and even those that have yet to be discovered like the benbernankion, the orgon, and the emoticon. If you pledge at a tier that includes a particle, tell us what you\u2019d like to see, and we\u2019ll craft it for you into a classy model.\nPenny is confined in a miniprison, carefully SCALEd and crafted by the Poetic Justice System so that her punishment fits her crime. Just like PJS, we will uniquely craft a miniprison of your very own, complete with advertisements for popular near-future prison contractors such as Nev-R eScape Therapy Cell and EZ Kwik & Accurate Memory Trappers, LLC. This item sits nicely on any desk, table, or secret shrine behind the bookcase.\nCertain recently resurrected species of the Silurian period have been genetically enhanced to provide the ultimate in prisoner rehabilitation. These brain parasites work with their host to overcome and correct a wide array of antisocial tendencies and mental difficulties. But to those on the straight and narrow, they just make great hats. If you feel you are virtuous enough, consider sporting a lovingly crafted Silurian Brain Parasite Hat.\nThe SCALE device streams the \u201cSCALE-ness\u201d or \u201cSize Juice\u201d out of one thing and into another allowing the user to really mess up the universe big time. We are planning five different versions of THE DEVICE for usage in game, each more refined and magnificent than the last, especially because the first one is basically whatever Penny could build out of the garbage on hand in her mini-prison. They get cooler though. If this is your chosen reward, you will receive one (1) Hollywood prop quality version of the in-game SCALE device, for you to use on your very own quest to discover the ultimate nature of matter.\nThis would be the perfect opportunity to make a joke about how the quality of the game will SCALE up to match your contribution (huh? get it? get it?) but that\u2019s really not the case. We don\u2019t believe in holding mechanics, levels, or key features ransom behind ludicrous stretch goals. We\u2019ll be able to make a great game if we hit our initial funding target, and if we make it, you won\u2019t have to settle for \u00bd the systems you got excited about when reading about our project.\nBut there are some things we\u2019d like extra money to do, and we do think that they\u2019ll make the process of making the game swifter and easier.\n100K - Oculus Rift support\nDue to how we\u2019re making the game, it should be pretty easy for us to add support for the Oculus Rift, which is why Oculus support is our first and lowest Stretch Goal.\n125K - Unlock Dale\u2019s SCALE custom companion comic\nDale\u2019s writing the game by using up the last jot of love and passion in an otherwise cold and robotic heart. But with some extra money we could activate his for-profit subroutine and tap into a rich dark vein of wild SCALE-themed comics undreamt of in this modern age. Dale experts tell us it\u2019s dark magic would create a special companion comic for the game that would go with you wherever you went.\n150K - Hire Additional 3D Artist\nAn additional 3D artist means we\u2019ll not only be able to have more art in the game, but we\u2019ll be able to have better art, as there will be more time refine for the artists to refine their work.\n175K - Level Editor\nWith a level editor, you\u2019ll be able to build the worlds you\u2019ve always dreamed of, and then make them really, really big or really, really tiny and watch your friends play them. However, you\u2019ll need to supply your own Zoolander style \u201cwhat is this, a _____ for ANTS?!?!\u201d jokes.\nOfficially, we call our company CubeHeart, a Voltron-like flesh monstrosity of game development talent, lead by Steve \"I'll form the head\" Swink for the purpose of making SCALE a good video game that humans will enjoy. Steve is SCALE\u2019s designer and principal developer, and he has made a bunch of other great games, taught game development course, and even written a book. You can learn more about that by checking out the biography section in the sidebar.\nCubeHeart's other robo-parts include:\nDale Beran, Writer (A Lesson is Learned but the Damage is Irreversible, The Nerds of Paradise):\nDale forms CubeHeart's writing core located in a jaunty robotic hat and is responsible for SCALE's excellent story, dialog, and world building.\nEddy Boxerman, Physics Ninja (Osmos): Eddy is our physics guru extraordinaire, and forms CubeHeart's adamantium skeleton, upon which bugs are righteously shattered. A true warrior poet.\nAndrew Coggeshall, Polygon Wizard (RedFrame): Andrew's abilities in the eldritch world of 3D art are not to be underestimated. Andrew is CubeHeart\u2019s raw brawn, beefy arms, and rakish good looks all in one package.\nMax Geiger, Producifier (Unfinished Swan, Deadliest Warrior): Max forms CubeHeart\u2019s robo-codpiece. What that conceals, no one knows, but it is responsible for the potency and chutzpah of CubeHeart\u2019s planning and project management.\nMike Wright, Soundsmith and Composer (Miscrits): Mike is SCALE\u2019s audio designer, and CubeHeart\u2019s shining ears. His shimmering platinum lobes make lesser golden ears seem crude and unrefined in comparison.\nWith Voiceover work by:\nAshly Burch (Hey Ash, Watcha Playin\u2019?, Borderlands 2)\nSarah Elmaleh (Gone Home, Skulls of the Shogun)\nForming CubeHeart\u2019s sonorous vocal cords, Ash and Sarah have agreed to lend their considerable talents to SCALE as the voice of Penny and Penny\u2019s Silurian brain parasite therapist, respectively. Their euphonious stylings will carry you to new emotional highs and lows over the course of the game.\nFeaturing tracks by:\nBen Prunty (FTL, Gravity Ghost)\ndanny B (Super Meat Boy, The Binding of Issac, Drifter)\nThe sweet grooves of these two maestros need no further introduction, but we\u2019ll try anyway. Like the golden fingers of CubeHeart\u2019s left and right hand caressing the smoothest saxaphone you\u2019ve ever heard, Ben Prunty and DannyB are laying down the finest tracks we\u2019ve ever heard to accompany what we hope will be the finest game you\u2019ve ever played.\nTogether we are CubeHeart. THE CUBEHEART IS BEATING!!\nWhy are you Kickstarting this project?\nBecause we think Kickstarter is the best avenue for raising the funding we need while putting SCALE in front of an audience of people who will have a vested interest in the success of the project. We also like that with Kickstarter, there\u2019s the expectation that we\u2019ll keep our backers updated. We think building SCALE is going to be a fun ride, and we\u2019d love to bring you along with us, rather than toiling in secret.\nWhy is your goal $87,000?\nBecause we\u2019ve run the numbers, and the advice we\u2019ve gotten from everyone has been \u201cask for the money you need, and don\u2019t try to lowball it.\u201d We think 87K will be enough to cover development expenses for the time it will take to make SCALE, as well as pay the talented people who are contributing to the project. We\u2019re also keenly aware that a lot of project underestimates fulfillment costs and Kickstarter/Amazon Payment\u2019s 5% and 3-5% shares, respectively, and so we\u2019ve tried to build this in to our estimate.\nHow are you making SCALE?\nSCALE is being developed in Unity, which is a familiar and comfortable development environment for us. Steve has been using Unity since version 1.6.\nWhich platforms are you targeting?\nCurrently, PC, Mac, and Linux are all viable platforms we\u2019d like to see SCALE on. Targeting Linux means we\u2019ll be on SteamOS/Steam Machines as well. We are also considering next-gen consoles, and are in talks with a few different publishers about the viability of bringing SCALE to a those platforms, but a getting the game out on personal computers is our first priority.\nHere's an interview Steve did with Adam Sessler at the INDIE MEGABOOTH this year at PAX.\nJohn Walker, Rock Paper Shotgun: \"This was undoubtedly the star of the afternoon. Receiving gasps of delight, along with multiple bursts of spontaneous applause, it was a concept that just kept delighting.\"\nTaylor Cocke, GameCenterBlog: \"Steve Swink's first-person puzzler might be my most-anticipated game of this year.\"\nJared Rosen, Indiestatik: \"What instantly struck me about Scale was how it seized on such a pure, childlike focus on exploration.\"\nNorthernLion did a \"Let's Look At\" preview video of the PAX build of SCALE.\nA Carl Sagan Quote because Carl Sagan:\n\u201cIf the cosmos is closed...there's a strange, haunting, evocative possibility...one of the most exquisite conjectures in science and religion. It's entirely undemonstrated...it may never be proved, but it's stirring. Our entire universe, to the farthest galaxy, we are told...is no more than a closed electron...in a far grander universe we can never see. That universe is only an elementry particle...in another still greater universe and so on forever. Also, every electron in our universe, it is claimed...is an entire miniature cosmos...containing galaxies and stars and life, and electrons. Everyone of those electrons contains a still smaller universe...an infinite regression up and down.\u201d - Carl Sagan", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISK 1: SCALE's project schedule is not final yet.\n\nSCALE is a videogame, and frankly, video games take a long time to finish and get right. There's a morbid joke in game development that building the features and levels of the game is the first 90% of the work that a development team does, and the second 90% is fixing all the bugs in that work and polishing it up. The official answer for when SCALE will be complete is \"when it's good,\" but we anticipate that we'll be done way before the heat death of the universe. For some perspective, Steve has been working on SCALE in bits and pieces since 2012, but retooled the art and started serious work on the game in early 2013, and as of now we estimate that the game is currently 25-30% done.\n\nWe know a lot of people have been mislead on Kickstarter, or feel like backing a videogame on Kickstarter is a risky proposition, and that's not without good reason. But we're a team of veterans who have a solid track record of shipping quality games and projects, and we're confident that given enough time, we'll be able to ship the best possible version of SCALE.\n\nRisk 2: Hey, aren't you the guy behind Shadow Physics? That game turned out to be vaporware, won't this one too?\n\nCutting right to the hard questions, eh? The story of why Shadow Physics was canned is simple: you gotta know when to fold 'em. It just wasn't working. We worked our butts off and the game just wasn't fun. Lessons were learned and have been applied. The past 9 months of development on SCALE have resulted in more enjoyable gameplay than the entire two and half years of work on Shadow Physics.\n\nRISK 3: Will you guys be able to fulfill all these physical rewards in a timely fashion?\n\nYes. We are currently planning on working with Fangamer, the folks who are doing the fulfillment for LA GameSpace, and we have the advice of friends and mentors who have successfully Kickstarted their projects and fulfilled them before.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "Alive!", "update_content": "Hey everyone!

We're not done yet!\nCreating an Archive of Video Game History\nToday most people's hunt for information begins and ends with a Google search.  I want to create a video game museum that caters to this new information reality by making an online collection that can be freely visited by anyone, at any time, through a simple internet search.\nThe Vanamo Online Game Museum is an effort to create an archive of video game history with high-quality, high-resolution pictures with detailed descriptions.  The museum's photos will be in the public domain, making them free for anyone to use in other media, like articles and videos.  They will also be placed on Wikipedia, making them highly visible and readily available, along with vastly improving the quality of their associated articles.\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to improve the quality of images and information about video game systems one finds on the internet.  The funds will go toward building a physical archive and collection of hardware that, in turn, becomes an online gallery of high quality pictures - a virtual museum.  After the pictures have been taken, I'll be working with the NYU Game Center and The International Center for the History of Electronic Games to help house and display the physical collection.\nThis Kickstarter greatly expands and completes work that I have already begun, which can be seen on my Video Game Wikimedia page.  I'm turning to your for help in expanding the reach and depth of my work, because I believe others can benefit from this work, and share my appreciation for a virtual video game collection of this quality and care.\nClick to see an example of the resolution and quality of my images. This image is also a Featured Image on Wikipedia and was Picture of the Day on July 7th, 2013\nMuseum Concept Gallery\nThese concepts show what can be accomplished with funding: a clean and simple site with in-depth information and free, hi-res media.\nAn easy-to-navigate, top-down design.\nEach console page contains categories like: history, controllers, supplied components, accessories, technical info, media type and console variants.\nThe final level: individual pages for console controllers, components and accessories\nWhy Help?\nBy participating in this Kickstarter, you are helping the Vanamo Online Game Museum accomplish four significant things:\nConsolidating images of video game consoles and accessories into one comprehensive collection\nMaking new images easy to find through the reach of Wikipedia\nProviding images for free, in a quality that enables reproduction in other media\nIf funding succeeds, Camera RAW files will be available for the first time through the Internet Archive.\nWikipedia is now an essential resource for many, but often its articles have low quality pictures or none at all.  This is because Wikipedia requires that photos uploaded to the site have a free license, basically meaning that the photographer gives up ownership rights to the photo.  This requirement deters almost all good photographers from contributing to WIkipedia, and keeps the overall quality of the photos on the site poor.  The photos from the museum will be in a free license.  I give up the rights to my photos so that they can be shared with the world, and improve the overall quality of the photos that are available to users.\nThe Internet Archive is very excited to be a partner in this project and help make it more expansive.\nThe Challenge\nProperly photographing all existing video game consoles and their accessories is a vast undertaking.  Video game hardware goes back to the '70s and there are over a hundred different consoles and handhelds to capture, some very rare and expensive.  Gathering and cataloging all of these items is both very costly and time consuming.\nProduct photography is a timely process due to cleaning and setting up the shot.  When I take pictures with collectors, I only have a small amount of time to photograph, meaning I have to focus on quick, basic shots.  Owning lets me spend time to create the comprehensive galleries I've been yearning to make.\nThis is the increase in output that funding will achieve.\nA deconstruction photo made capable through owning\nThe Solution - Create My Own Free Archive\nThe simplest and most obvious solution to this problem is to buy the objects I need to photograph.  I would become a curator to a collection of consoles and hardware that would, in turn, become a digital archive available freely on Wikimedia.  However, the cost of such a collection rapidly places it outside of my means, hence the need for Kickstarter.  Creating my own archive has many benefits.  Owning objects lets me take them apart, clean them and, most importantly, take the time to get the best possible picture.\nThe gallery I'd be able to make through this funding would be much more thorough and extensive than the existing one.  Funding would be a worthwhile investment: I already have the largest and most visible collection of console pictures on the internet; an improvement to my gallery will reach more people than any other gallery.  People come to my gallery when they need photos and need them with a license that they can easily use.  Also, many times the only good photos on the internet of older or rarer consoles are ones I've taken. \nExample of reward designs, designs not final\nSince my photos are free and high quality, they have been frequently used in magazines (Game Informer, Retro Gamer), newspapers, television shows (G4TV, The Colbert Report), YouTube (The Angry Video Game Nerd, Zero Punctuation, RetrowareTV), major blogs (Kotaku, Joystiq, IGN, GameTrailers, The Gameological Society, Wired, Slate, Gamasutra), textbooks and even by official sources like Mark Cerny (hardware designer of the PS4) when addressing Gamelab 2013 about the history of PS4 development.\nA small collection of the many examples showing people/sites who rely on my images\nThere is no doubt about the reach, importance and visibility of these photos.  There is immense educational and historical value in having these consoles and hardware preserved in a digital state, in pictures that are clean and consistent.  This gallery will also continue to enrich the video game community by providing quality, free media to anyone to use in their own projects.\nHow Is The Money Used?\nAll funds from this Kickstarter will go toward one thing: video game hardware.  It will not be going toward photo equipment or software, only game consoles, controllers, hardware and accessories.\nMoney collected only goes to building an archive of hardware\n\nWhat Am I Looking To Buy?\nA true 100% collection of game hardware is both extremely expensive and probably unattainable, mostly due to things like prototypes or very rare items.  In order to keep my Kickstarter grounded and attainable, I have placed priorities on certain areas of gaming.\nThe original $8,500 funding goal would go toward creating an almost-complete collection of Atari, Sega, Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo consoles.  I picked these as the highest priority due to their popularity in my current galleries and on Wikipedia search results.  Since a true collection could reach into the tens of thousands of dollars, I have committed other areas to stretch goals.\nStretch Goals\nThe stretch goals of this Kickstarter are extremely important as they increase the size of the museum and the gallery.  Stretch goals are based on different brand collections, as outlined below.  The most exciting stretch goal is when it goes past $25,000, which means that I can start to get debug and developer consoles.  These are very limited release and generally not well documented, so putting these into a public information museum would be a great benefit to gaming history.\nStretch goals are the only way to make a more complete collection\nThere is no real ceiling to the amount of money that can be used for this project.  The amount of items that could go into such a museum is vast, from color variants to prototypes, that even $100,000 or more could be all directly used for acquisition purposes.\n$9,500 - Vintage consoles (including Magnavox Odyssey)\n$10,500 - PC Engine/TurboGrafx consoles\n$11,500 - Neo Geo consoles\n$12,500 - 3DO & CDi consoles\n$15,000 - Non-American releases (Playdia, FM Towns, etc.)\n$20,000 - Misc. consoles and hardware\n$25,000+ - Debug/developer consoles, prototypes and variants\nWhat Becomes Of The Physical Archive?\nCreating the physical archive is a necessity to create the media galleries, but what happens to it after that?  The last thing I want is such an archive to sit in storage, so I'm working with the NYU Game Centerand The International Center for the History of Electronic Games to help house and display parts of the collection.  These items collected for the museum will be available to students and the community.\n             Direct Hardware Donation\nAll of the funds of this Kickstarter are going to hardware, so any direct donation of hardware allows funds to go even farther.  I would accept anything hardware-based: consoles, add-ons, accessories or controllers.  This can be old or new items, as I'm building the collection from the ground up.  All I ask is that the item be in either good or decent cosmetic condition for photographing; items can be non-working.\nEvery hardware donation helps", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is generally low risk. Successful funding means the ability to buy hardware, and any hardware in my hands will turn into photos. This is work that I've already accomplished in the past, so I'm aware of the time and effort that goes into it.\n\nThere will be some challenge to acquire the items at the price point I have budgeted, but I have experience in being thrifty or getting good deals. There are a few rare items that might take longer to acquire than others, but I'm positive I'll be able to complete the console archive lists I have outlined.\n\nOnce the archive is created, picture taking will begin and will take a few weeks or months for all of the photos to be uploaded. Pictures will be uploaded as they're taken, so the turn around is much faster than most other projects. I'm confident in my ability to deliver on this as it's something that I have accomplished before, so my timetable is based on actual experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "Book PDF download link", "update_content": "Hello everyone!

But we are delivering a fully branded (It's a proper 'ColecoVision'!), fully licensed set of original games. That means it is 100% legal, totally official, no grey areas. This is the ONLY way you are going to see a collection like this for sale.\n- Rewards costs and other fees (Kickstarter/Amazon). \nUnlike some Kickstarter campaigns where the 'physical' rewards kick in at $100+, we start ours at just $45 for a custom T-shirt or poster. We feel strongly that we want our backers to get a LOT for their money. We deliberately pitched our 'core' reward at a super-low $10 so that as many retro fans as possible could get something without breaking the bank. Of course, by pitching physical rewards at a lower price, that means our margin on those pledges is reduced - and the amount that goes into the actual delivery is lower too.\n- The remainder\nIn total (it's impossible to be precise because we get different margins on different rewards) we are going to be left with around $130-140k after the licensing, rewards and fees. This money is all going to go on actually executing the project. This means paying for: \nGraphics Designer \nUser Interface & User Experience Specialist \n3D Modeller \nDevelopers\nRemember we are absolutely not just building \"an emulator\" here. It's going to take about 5 months to complete the project, and we're creating a beautiful, unique, graphical, intuitive user-interface including competitive scoring, challenges, achievements, box art, instructions and history of ColecoVision.\nPress Coverage\nWe've received some great press coverage so far from some of the biggest gaming and tech websites around!\n\"Rantmedia Games has a knack for rekindling childhood gaming memories -- see its uncannily accurate Vectrex Regeneration as proof.\" - Engadget\nWe've got some great ideas and would love to find out what you think. It's going to be slick, polished and beautiful. You can check out the concept art below too, and see where we're heading with it.\nWe really like the idea of re-creating a living or family room with a ColecoVision console right in the center. We want people to be reminded of the original system, to see what it looked like. We're thinking atmospheric lighting - the glow of the TV, lighting the room and then to the left, we're imagining your stack of games.\nSwipe or tap, and the games all fly up and assemble in a line so you can swipe left and right through your library - accessing box-art, instructions and the ROM cartridge. Choosing to play a game will drop the cartridge into the console, and then zoom you into the TV and you'll be playing full screen.\nTo the right, we're thinking it would be cool to have a trophy cabinet. Only, instead of it containing football or athletics trophies, this one will slowly fill up as you get scores and achievements in the games. You'll be able to send challenges to friends, and see how you shape up on global leader boards.\nUltimately, it's all about the details, the little touches, the polish and the delivery of the most authentic experience possible.\nUpdate 10th October: Some fresh new renders!\nWe've got the rights to a huge list of games that we're going to include in the initial release including:\nAntarctic Adventure \u2022 BlackJack/Poker \u2022 Bump 'n' Jump \u2022 Brain Strainers \u2022 Destructor \u2022 Fortune Builder \u2022 Frenzy \u2022 Jumpman \u2022 Jumpman Junior \u2022 Jungle Hunt \u2022 Ms. Space Fury \u2022 Pepper II \u2022 Space Fury \u2022 Super Action Boxing \u2022 Super Action Football \u2022 Super Action Baseball \u2022 Super Action Soccer \u2022 Zaxxon\nWe're hoping that more can be added later on and we're also hoping to support homebrew games. That's a lot of games!\nInitially we're planning to launch on iOS, but we're also very keen to get this onto other platforms too. So it really depends on your enthusiasm - hopefully you can help us make this happen.\nWe know that everyone has their favorite platform, and we have ambitions to also launch onto Android, Mac, PC and even hardware like PS Vita. But we wanted to start simple, and then get feedback on what you'd like us to support.\nWe are excited to announce our first stretch goal!\n\n $300,000 = Android\nSomething for everyone hopefully! Depending on the amount you pledge you will get a selection of amazing rewards that include:\nWe're a small team, but we're experienced and we know what we're doing. We're the guys who bought you 'Vectrex Regeneration' - launched onto the App Store at the end of last year - bringing back the classic Vectrex experience to a whole new audience.\nIt got some great reviews from people who really know what they are talking about - like Classic Game Room, Kotaku, TUAW, Joystiq, ArsTechnica, Engadget and Touch Arcade. Lots of people called it the best emulator on the App Store, where we got featured by Apple in 141 countries!\nIt's pretty much like this: we love those classic games of the 80's and early 90's which are SO addictive and yet so simple. I guess that means you could call us 'retro enthusiasts'!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe wouldn't be pitching this if we weren't supremely confident we could deliver big time on our vision. We believe we've covered just about everything to nail this, from the design, development and delivery of the game to the logistics (and costs) of shipping the T-Shirts! We've got the rights and licenses already in place, and we've got track record of delivering this kind of thing successfully.\n\nThat of course doesn't mean it's going to be plain sailing - any game that is meaningful has the tendency to cause you pain when you least expect it, but we're confident we can deal with just about anything that comes our way. Except 8-bit killer ninja shark-bats.

It would be nice to continue development on our own but we have to be realistic, we've run into some costs which would be a challenge without the support of our Fans. We're asking for your help in crossing the finish line not alone as a small development team but together as a community.\n We would like to be clear in that Contagion is already at this time playable and currently in Closed Beta. All 3 Game-Modes and 4 of the 5 Maps are being streamed on Twitch.tv by testers daily. We're also updating and polishing the game daily. So why Kickstarter?\n Some people are confused why they shouldn't just wait till our Official Release on Steam to purchase a copy of the game. Well, those who pledge on Kickstarter for $15 (or more) will receive all previous tiers and some exclusive in game bonuses. Another incentive is a head start to play the game before the official release date, once Kickstarter money is approved. Please read the F.A.Q. for more information regarding this.\nWith this money we plan to put it to the following uses:\nCover various engine/license fees (engine, sound tools, software licenses, etc.)\nExpand our initial reach with marketing\nServer costs (you need somewhere to play!)\n$75,000 \u2022 While we\u2019re focused on delivering Contagion to both Mac & Linux users whether or not we reach this stretch goal, we have to take into account the extra fees for each platform. Your support will most definitely expedite our efforts and be appreciated by those waiting on said digital releases.\n$100,000 \u2022 We\u2019re eager to release free Downloadable Content (No Season passes here) which of course means we hope to continue development at no additional cost to you and the rest of the community, however the developers have families and while we\u2019re confident in the release of Contagion we know there are no guarantees. If we were to hit this stretch goal there would be nothing holding us back. We could then develop and deliver at a steady rate:\n4 New Weapons\n4 New Characters\n2 New Maps\n1 New Game-mode (Flatline - A wave based survival mode that fits our current theme and style)\n$125,000 \u2022 As with the previous stretch goal, there is a plan in place and as always we want to complete the work without taxing our community but knowing we can afford the work involved as well as the ability to set deadlines it sure doesn\u2019t hurt. Reaching this goal we will deliver:\n4 New Weapons\n4 New Characters\n2 New Maps\n1 New Game-mode (Cruise - This one involves vehicles and will require quite a bit of prototyping and balancing but is one we\u2019re excited to get started on)\n$150,000 \u2022 Continued future support of Contagion guaranteed with new maps, content, community feedback we can work with to improve the overall experience for as long as we can afford to. We of course speak of not just this stretch goal but that in which we can fund from our own earnings like we have throughout the development of Contagion thus far.\n$250,000 \u2022 We, like many others from the community wish to see Contagion reach consoles and reaching this goal will make this a strong possibility and one we plan to again whether we reach this stretch goal or not will pursue to the best of our abilities.\nThere is no way to pay directly through PayPal alone due to the protection Kickstarter/Amazone Payments provides which is why major Credit Cards are required.

The game challenges players to conserve ammo, rely on your team, and work together to survive the zombie onslaught. Players will face traditional (NPC) zombies as well as former teammates who have been passed on and joined the walking deceased, fueling the carnage to come. The game has been in development for two and a half years after recovering from a disagreement with the original co-founder thus the delay.\nFeatures\nPlay alone offline or online with friends (up to 8 players)\nMultiple game modes.\nPlay as either Human or Zombie\nRandomly generated weapon, ammo, and item placement.\nUnpredictable and intelligent zombie spawning system that adjusts to the current situation..\nA pathing and objective system that has you returning to the same map repeatedly without losing that fresh feel.\nFull Steamworks support.

With us spread out on many continents the team quickly adopted a Virtual Developer model for the development of Contagion. \n This means that many of us have never met in person and yet call it with a straight face a true family. Of the few of us here at Monochrome we are based at locations such the US, UK, Germany, Sweden, Singapore, Romania, and Japan.

Originally named World of StarCraft, SCU focuses on telling an epic story and intense combat action, as well as highly replay-able multi-player experiences. StarCraft Universe will be released as a series of custom games published through Battle.net.\nThe objective of this game is to experience the universe of StarCraft from a third person view and master a wide variety challenges, missions, and raiding experiences. The focus of the game is to have a team of players/friends, creating/customizing their own hero character which they use to battle together through enemy forces and powerful bosses in a rich and living environment.\nPlease note that this is just a quick listing of the most important features within the game.

An ability can also be unlearned in order to make room for different ones.\nThe capacity of the ability bar is limited, so it only allows the player to learn a certain amount of abilities at one time. Stronger abilities will require more points (combat weight) to add to the ability bar. This simple principle allows for heavy character customization for combat while giving the developers enough regulation to prevent flavor of the month (FoTM) builds..\nA class mentor can teach new abilities to the player.\nThe character stat boost allows each player to customize his character by using Outfitting Points to boost its stats.\n- Original Soundtrack!\nStarcraft Universe features a unique, original soundtrack composed by David Orr, an award winning composer for games, animations, television and film.\n\n- Fully voice acted cut-scenes!\nVoice acting is performed by experienced professionals such as Michael Gough (StarCraft, Diablo, Dragon Age), Danielle McRae (World of Warcraft, League of Legends), and Eric Dieter (Heroes of Newerth, The Leviathan Chronicles).\n- Many options to customize your game experience\nStarCraft Universe allows customization of nearly every aspect of the game including arranging the various graphical interface elements to suit one's tastes or changing of hotkey preferences.

You don't need to buy StarCraft II to play!\nYes and no! Here's a good article which clears up the confusion from 2011:\nWhile Blizzard is not directly affiliated with this project's production, we do communicate with them to submit bug reports and make technical requests. They have given their blessing/permission for us to launch this Kickstarter, and they are supporting our efforts by featuring SCU as an Arcade Highlight.\nUpheaval Arts is a small company formed in June, 2012 by the lead developer Ryan 'Kreation' Winzen. Made up of a small group of modding hobbyists, members of Upheaval Arts have been modding Blizzard RTS engines for over a decade in the creation of prototypes and custom games and are considered elite developers by Blizzard Entertainment.\nUpheaval Arts contracts talented industry professionals and entertainers, aiming toward AAA content creation. \nUpheaval is a company created by the fans, for the fans, developing one highly-demanded title - StarCraft Universe.\nUpheaval has been developing StarCraft Universe for over two years with no funding whatsoever, donating their time and effort to its development with no monetary reward. All developers on the project have had to return to work their normal day jobs, dramatically hindering the progression of the project due to its time intensive requirements.\nAfter releasing the StarCraft Universe Beta Prologue: Chronicles of Fate to the public, we're hoping to receive backing from the awesome StarCraft community to push our project forward and expand the team with sufficient funds to expedite the development process. With your help, we'll have the time, motivation, and resources we need to put that fresh looking AAA polish on SCU and get it out to you faster, better, and sexier.\nDeveloping SCU is just as complex and time consuming as developing a stand-alone. Remember we've had to build a brand new engine on top of the StarCraft II engine for this to work.  \n\nPrimarily, the money will be spent on the lead developers so we can produce the mod full-time just like a job. Split among us, we are taking a VERY small amount of money for basic living expenses over the next year of production. Remember that 80,000 quickly becomes 72,000 after Kickstarter and Amazon take their share, and then there's a 26% income tax on top of that. We also have to pay our voice actors, pay for software, hardware, our musical composer, and the list goes on. \nModding isn't anything like it used to be. People's standards are VERY high now, and to produce something of quality takes significant time, energy, and sacrifice. \nCan I play a demo of the game before I decide to back it?\nYep! One of the great things about this project is that we already have so much done, you can test out a single-player beta version of the Prologue! Please note SCU is still in the Alpha stages of some elements of its development, but it's fully playable and still enjoyable!\nTo begin playing, just log into your StarCraft II client, click on the Arcade button, and search for Universe in the reach box! We should pop right up!\n\nIf you don't have the time to play through online, or haven't downloaded the StarCraft II: Starter Edition, you can check out this game-play video, or search \"StarCraft Universe\" on youtube to view some of the many player-uploaded videos and see their reactions.\nOK. That was pretty cool. So, if this funding is successful, how will Upheaval Arts release StarCraft Universe, and how will it sustain itself to provide additional content in the future?\nWe will release StarCraft Universe as a series of downloadable games over Battle.net that are FREE to play with the StarCraft II: Starter Edition.\nBecause of our limited Staff, the first chapter we plan on releasing will be a multi-player open beta to test the core system functionality, combat balance, and progression rates of SCU through a gauntlet of challenges. Kickstarter pending, we will release this open BETA in late 2013/Early 2014.\nOnce we feel that all of the game elements are stable, we'll begin developing additional campaign missions as episodic content, released as completed.\nUpheaval Arts believes that the Arcade which Blizzard is currently developing to support mod game sales will sustain our ability to provide content for players throughout StarCraft II's lifetime, but we need your help to continue until that point.\nWe have the talent, we have the drive, and we have the passion - Now all we need is your help.\nEn taro Adun!\nThis grid reflects the current bonuses and add-ons to the original offers.

Players create and maintain a military force to defeat their opponents. Here is an example of StarCraft II gameplay.\nWhat's the difference between a standalone game and a mod? \nMost mods are like mini-games, but like StarCraft Universe, some are complete re-workings of the StarCraft II engine which make the game play completely differently than it was originally designed. These custom games are created using the map editing program included with StarCraft II and are published online through Battle.net.\nWill I need to own StarCraft II or its expansions to play this?\nNOPE! The StarCraft II: Starter Edition, which is FREE, is all you will need to play StarCraft Universe!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBecause we've already completed most of the core systems and functionality behind SCU, and we're permitted to use the endless assets provided by Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft II Editor, the risk factor is very low in our development.\n\nSome risks do include converting the RTS engine to run properly within a third-person RPG engine. Some players have experienced synchronization issues with the current camera systems and slight delay with input commands. This is an issue both Blizzard and Upheaval are aware of and working to remedy.\n\nThe biggest challenge we face is the time required to implement custom assets and script in content for players to explore, but with your monetary assistance we'll be able to eliminate many of the challenges of our lives, and focus on our work.\n\nIf delays in production do arise, backers will be notified of the issues via provided e-mail.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "StarCraft Universe AMA 8/20/2016", "update_content": "https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/4yqg8j/starcraft_universe_launches_in_a_week_ama_with/\n\nHey everyone!

We did it!\nThe Kickstarter is over but the fun continues at www.wayforward.com!\nEvery copy of the game gets FREE DLC!\nOver the last 23 years WayForward has developed more than 200 licensed titles, our most recent being Ducktales: Remastered. When circumstances permit, we also make weird and wonderful original games like Shantae and the Mighty Series. \nIn all that time, fan letters, support emails and interviewers have made our most frequently asked question, \u201cWhy don't you guys make more original games?\u201d  \nKickstarter allows us to do just that! With your help we can create a large-scale multi-console game that's well beyond our usual self-publishing budgets.  \nBest of all, we have our ducks in a row. Half-Genie Hero is already approved for development on Wii U, PS3, PS4, VITA & VITA TV, Xbox 360, Xbox One and Steam (Windows PC). Now it's time to start making the game.... all we need is your support!\nWho is Shantae? Why, she's the star of our game! She\u2019s a human/genie hybrid (a Half-Genie) who hair-whips monsters with her ponytail, and belly dances to transform into magical creatures. She explores Sequin Land, solves labyrinths, trashes epic bosses, and foils the busty buccaneer Risky Boots, always managing to save the day! She's been featured in three daring adventures, all designed exclusively for Nintendo handhelds. Now Shantae's headed for the living room, but her core gameplay elements will remain intact:\n-Whipping! Destroy monsters, topple bosses, and solve puzzles with your hair\n-Belly Dancing! Dance to transform into a variety of creature forms\n-Platforming! Run and jump through deviously designed levels\n-Exploring! Navigate a world of interconnected levels and Labyrinths\n-Customizing! Earn new abilities, unlock stat-boosting artifacts, magic & costumes\n-Storytelling! Flirtatious characters and wonderfully off-beat humor\nShantae: Half-Genie Hero continues the tradition of action/adventure in the spirit of Metroid, Castlevania, and the Legend of Zelda. Our goal is to introduce Shantae to a whole new audience with a fresh art style and a brand spanking new storyline. As always, we're putting pitch perfect controls in the front seat.\nIn our story, Shantae is roused from a deep sleep, suddenly alert. She plunges into the moonlit forest in search of answers. In nearby Scuttle Town she discovers a mysterious trapdoor, and beyond that, a luminous subterranean cavern. A familiar voice calls out, drawing Shantae to a beautiful fountain. Touching its waters she is immediately spirited away to the fabled Genie Realm. At her feet a magical seal swells as some powerful evil seeks escape. The chamber trembles with a deep, bellowing roar and everything goes white. Shantae sits upright, back in her bed. Was it just a dream? Or a vision of things to come?\nAs the player it's your job to find the source of this new evil power and banish it once and for all. The story is doled out in CHAPTERS, with each chapter introducing new subplots, friends & foes, a new Transformation to discover, puzzles to solve, hazards to overcome, and a Boss to conquer. Revisiting past chapters with newly acquired abilities will unlock the next set of paths, powers & plot-lines.\nOur funding price will allow us to create an action-packed opening stage (with boss), 3 Chapters, and an exciting conclusion; similar to previous Shantae games. But why stop there? Together we can make this game truly epic by reaching our STRETCH GOALS!\nMatt Bozon: Director of Contra 4, Mighty Switch Force!, and the Shantae series is back in the director\u2019s chair, making odd noises and leading the charge.\nJake Kaufman:  Fund this pup for the soundtrack alone! He composed the previous Shantae OST's and we wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\nWF Animation Team: Character animation and visual design provided by our battle-hardened feature film veterans... the same crack team that brought you a Boy and His Blob, Batman: the Brave and the Bold, and Ducktales: Remastered.\nInti Creates: The developer that brought you the Mega Man series is providing character concepts and illustrations!\nMariel Cartwright: the Lead Animator for the much acclaimed 2D fighter Skullgirls is also animating Shantae!\nGigi Digi: Best known for her work on Cucumber Quest!  Gigi is the source of these beautifully stylized backgrounds.\nWF 3D Team: From environments to VFX, our diverse 3D talent has amazing range. Who else can build both Duckburg and Silent Hill? \nWF Engine Team: Our engine tech is world class. PC based, 1080p, and the silky smooth 60 frames-per-second our games demand. \nWF STAFF: Last but certainly not least, our programmers, level designers, directors, department leads, writers, testers and producers (defenders of your funds and our deadlines) are all on board.\nStretch Goals are an important part of this project, because they will shape the game's content in a big way. Animated sequences, Extra Chapters, and Unlockable Costumes will add something special to the final product and make an already great game even greater! A few of our Stretch Goals will be revealed over the next 30 days, just to keep you on your toes and have some fun...!\nWe've assembled a slew of great goods that you won't find anywhere else!

For over a decade Shantae games have won awards and acclaim the world over:\nShantae (Game Boy Color): Risky Boots transforms a simple steam-engine into a magical monstrosity! Can Shantae save Sequin Land from disaster? The game that started it all. Reviewers named Shantae the Game Boy\u2019s swan song. It earned a perfect score from Nintendo Power and was deemed a \u201cBest Nintendo Game of All Time\u201d in their final issue. Distributed by Capcom in 2002, Shantae has become one of the rarest and most sought after collectables out there. It was recently re-released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console.\nShantae: Risky\u2019s Revenge (DSiWare): Risky returns with a magic lamp capable of stealing Shantae's \"genie half\". Is this beginning of the end for Shantae and her friends? The sequel was a long time coming -- but was worth the wait, earning the highest Metacritic rating across all handhelds in 2010. The game was ported to iOS the following year. It was named Game of the Week by Apple and has since been featured numerous times as an \"essential\" platformer in the App Store. \nShantae and the Pirate\u2019s Curse (coming soon to Nintendo 3DS eShop): When a curse falls upon Sequin Land, Risky Boots and Shantae must join forces to battle unimaginable evil. The third act in the pixel series, this highly anticipated game is nearing the end of development, and will be available for download this Winter.\nLocated in Valencia, California and established in 1990.

He's taking responsibility for breathing new life into River City's soundtrack, from funky shopping tunes to fist-pumping brawling action. We can't wait!\n Press\n\"Oh man oh man oh man this is going to be awesome.\" - Ian Birnbaum, PC Gamer\n\"The art direction stays true to the original, but the animation is phenomenally smooth... add in a soundtrack by Rich \"Disasterpeace\" Vreeland, it's hard to imagine that this won't be a winner.\" - Jonathan Holmes, Destructoid\n\"Those seriously have to be some of the silkiest smooth moving pixels in recent memory. Though the updated combat system sounds equally enticing.\" - Matt Hawkins, MTV Multiplayer\n\"More than any other Kickstarter project I\u2019ve seen, the team's intense reverence for the original really comes through here.\" - Ewan Miller, VG247\nWe are also grateful for press coverage in these fine publications: Joystiq, Kotaku, Game Informer, IGN, Siliconera, Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Yahoo!

Techn\u014ds is already a household name for creating the beat'em up genre of fighting games starting with Renegade, the inaugural title in the Kunio-kun franchise, which would go on to become an iconic and prolific gaming franchise in Japan, as well as spawn the legendary fighting series, Double Dragon (1987). While most Kunio-kun games never made their way to North America, a few were localized for Western audiences: Super Dodgeball  (1988), Nintendo World Cup (1990), Crash N' The Boys Street Challenge (1992), and River City Ransom (1990). The latter was unlike anything ever seen before: a \"belt-scrolling\" fighting game with role-playing elements. The charming North American localization only added to the game's appeal.\nRiver City Ransom is an irreplaceable part of our gaming history, both for fans from the beginning, and those who discovered the game later during the emulation craze. This title is often cited as one of the top NES games of all time, and one of the most deserving of a sequel. We have a chance to make this a reality and give you the game you deserve. Let's do this!\nCore Rewards\nOur original rewards, while sporting pithy names and clever slogans, weren't a perfect fit for the campaign, so we've been working to improve them. Check these core rewards below!\nFREE SMILE AT MERV'S ($5 CAD) - You'll get a digital wallpaper pack and we'll put your name in the game in a River City special monument. You rock! Does not include a free smile at Merv's.\nJUST THE GAME ($15 CAD) - You'll get a digital copy of the game when it comes out! This will be a Windows, Mac, or Linux, DRM-free version of the game. If we launch on another platform, and that platform lets us generate free keys, you'll get a copy on that platform too.\nBARF! ($20 CAD) - We'll use advanced digital fusion techniques to combine both the FREE SMILE AT MERV'S reward with the JUST THE GAME reward, while you stare in amazement. And then we'll hand it over. Just like that.\nDISASTERPEACE ($25 CAD) - You'll get everything in the BARF! reward. Plus, you'll receive the game's digital soundtrack, as composed by Rich Vreeland (aka Disasterpeace). We'll throw in a weapon skin of a compact disc, so you can really \"hammer home\" your love for the game's music.\nWOOD STICK ($40 CAD) - You'll get everything in the DISASTERPEACE reward, plus you'll receive a digital feast: an old-school digital game manual, a digital map of River City and surrounding areas, and a digital comic book. On top of that, you'll have access to our private beta program.\nLEAD PIPE ($60 CAD) - It's everything you ever wanted in a WOOD STICK, plus some sweet weapon skins exclusive to Kickstarter: a double-barreled bat, a mystical morning star, and a gold-plated garbage can. \nSCANDAL RAG ($100 CAD) - You'll receive a River City athletics T-Shirt exclusively designed by our lead artist Bannon Rudis, only available during our crowd-funding campaign.

Some tiers don't appear here: they are \"legacy\" tiers that won't give you as much value as those in this grid. Don't worry though, if you don't change your pledge from a \"legacy\" reward, we'll figure out the one you should receive when fulfillment time rolls around.\nAdd-Ons\nWe're happy to provide physical add-ons for those who prefer a game or soundtrack on disc, want both English and Japanese versions of the shirt or poster, or just want a T-shirt or poster without all the digital extras.\nT-Shirt Add-On ($25 CAD) - If you wanted the T-shirt, you can now pick it up at any level by adding an additional $25 to your pledge.

A great option for the Do-It-Yourself crowd. Please add $5 for shipping outside Canada.\nYou can also add $10 for an additional digital copy of the game, or $25 for an additional 3 digital copies of the game.\nHow do I add on to my pledge for these?\nIf you're a new backer, simply add up the additional costs for the add-ons you want, like the recipes listed above, and pledge that amount, selecting the appropriate reward. For those who have already pledged, log in to Kickstarter, click on Manage My Pledge from the project home screen, and increase the amount of your pledge to match the add-ons you want and any additional shipping, while keeping your reward the same. After the campaign, we'll get in touch and you'll be able to select exactly what add-ons you wanted.\nStretch Goals\n$205K - Apple\u00ae Mac\u2122 and Linux\u2122 (FUNDED!)\nWith the recent announcement of SteamOS, Linux is even more of an interesting choice for developers. And of course, we can't ignore the many folks who love their Macs. Our game library is well traveled in the *nix space, so we are confident in our ability to deliver this stretch goal.\n$280K - Sony\u00ae PS4\u2122 and PlayStation\u00aeVita\nOur original goal remains unchanged. The technical complexity for this goal is higher, but the effort involved paves the way for future platforms.\n$320K - Nintendo\u00ae WiiU\u2122 and 3DS\u2122\nOur initial talks with Nintendo have been encouraging, and we have heard from many vocal and passionate fans of the platform. We have said that River City Ransom: Underground belongs on Nintendo, and with the right resources, we can make it happen.\n$360K - Microsoft\u00ae Xbox One\u2122\nBased on Microsoft's new Independent Developers Publishing Program, and the foundations laid in previous stretch goals, it looks like clear sailing to reach fans on this platform at this level.\n$390K - Sony\u00ae PS3\u2122\nThe current generation PlayStation 3 is a platform in its own right, and we don't want to ignore it. This level will give us confidence to ship on this console as well.\nNote: We don't consider Kickstarter a \"pre-order\" system, so to us, backing our project means you're supporting our vision for the game and want to see it happen. Though we'll bring our game to Windows first, we will then consider as many platforms as we possibly can, based on time, resources, and license approvals. The platform story doesn't end with this Kickstarter, and we're talking to all of the major players to make sure we get the game to as many people as possible.\nWe've set out to create a sequel worthy of the name, paying homage to the original while recapturing its charm and gameplay innovation. This is our love letter to River City Ransom, Techn\u014ds Japan, and the epic fighting and wrestling games of the 80's and 90's.\nWhile Techn\u014ds is no more, a new company, Million Co., was founded by former Techn\u014ds staff, acquiring the rights to all intellectual property in 2001. We acquired a license from Million in April to make an official installment in the series, which means we're on the hook to make sure our game can exist in the River City canon.\nYou're backing a 2.5D open world beat'em up with RPG elements, just like the classic game, for the Windows platform. We're making River City bigger, adding more stores, items, and bringing the cast and crew into the modern era. You'll reunite with old friends (and punch them in the face), meet new ones, and play through an epic story in an urban, open world. Yes, the game will feature local co-op play, and online co-op depending on our distribution partners on launch day.\nWe've evolved combat based on the mechanics of the golden age of console fighting, and we're pushing to get sophisticated, crafty opponent AI into the game. You're not safe standing on your bench anymore!\nWelcome back to River City!\nThe more things change, the more they stay the same. Nearly twenty-five years after Alex and Ryan defeated Slick and his gang of students and evil bosses, River City, home of the world's most violent high schools, enjoys a delicate peace. Alex and Ryan run A&R Auto, and the delinquents at River City High School are not up to much, as usual, until disaster strikes.\nWhy We're Kickstarting\nGames, and licensed games in particular, are expensive to produce and difficult to build. Usually, licensees rely on a publisher to finance their games, using the license itself as a bargaining chip to raise funds. Rather than go the traditional route, up to this point we've been completely self-funded, though we don't have complete control over the game's final product as a licensee. For us, this is an honor, not an obstacle.  \nWe've put up a significant amount of cash to bootstrap the game to this point; acquiring the license up front, preparing the campaign, building tools, and lining up key resources to make this game the best possible experience we can create. \nWhat We Need\nSome of our team members need to support themselves while we work on the game, so we'll cover adequate living expenses for the next year (tasty, tasty noodles!). We have standing contracts with amazingly talented people to fill in the gaps in our roster. We also need to invest in QA and localization as we prepare to launch the game in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Japanese, as well as legal and accounting support to help us manage our licensing obligations. Unlike many Kickstarter efforts, we'll also need to account for licensing royalties, on top of the usual Kickstarter and credit card fees, and fulfilling physical rewards. \nEarly Press for River City Ransom: Underground\nSince we acquired the license back in April, we've been lucky to have some great coverage in the media. Polygon was the first to write about our intentions to keep the game in the spirit of the original.\nIn May, we were blessed by indie game fans by winning Capsule Computers' Indie Dev Grant, a community-driven competition put on during their theme-based indie game bundles. The award provided funding to film our launch video. We really appreciate the early support!\nAttention: Developers and modders\nWe will open source our MonoGame-based game engine, and our game will be mod-friendly. This means that you can build off of our foundation for your own creations. Kickstarting a game to sell is cool, making something to allow others to do the same, is cooler.\nWho are you guys?\nWe are a small team of creators with a varied but deep background in web, mobile, gaming, and film. Each of us brings our own personal story. \nThe cool thing about our story is that it's a true story (no montage yet, unfortunately). It started as a daydream, but hard work and good timing came together and here we are. It's not just that we're crazy enough to cough up the cash for the license, and embark on a year long, intense journey to create this game under enormous pressure and expectations. No, we're crazy and we love this game so much.\nBannon Rudis (art director, game designer)\nForged in the fiery depths of California, Bannon is the self-proclaimed creator of underwater tennis and master of all things pixel. Some would call him an artist. He would reply to such accusations with \u201cI like to draw things.\u201d Working primarily with digital media combined with archaic pencil, pens and paper, Bannon creates various artworks for film, games, and apparel. Bannon has been sketching a follow-up to River City Ransom since the age of ten, so we stole him from his own indie game to make those sketches come to life. He worked so hard preparing for this campaign he broke his drawing tablet. So we had to buy him a new one. But it's nicer, anyway. He's over it now. Really.\nDaniel Crenna (producer, engine developer)\nDaniel is a web and mobile code-slinger with ten years of software development experience under his belt, working with large companies like Microsoft and Kobo. He's been a key player on projects that have reached millions. Learning to program games at the age of six with his brother, Daniel is a prolific open source developer whose contributions have surpassed two million downloads; his code is so ubiquitous in the Windows world, he accidentally has a credit on Bit.Trip Beat. Daniel's right at home coding our engine based on C# and XNA/MonoGame, which he's been hooked on since 2006. Daniel has written a few programming books and is a three-time recipient of the Microsoft Most Valuable Professional (MVP) award.\nDustin Crenna (audio director, game designer)\nDustin started his game career at 8 years old when he drew up an idea for a Gremlins game for the Atari 2600 (in crayon) and submitted it. While waiting for the final decision, he became a sound designer and composer, going on to log over a decade of AAA game studio experience. Nominated for multiple audio awards, you can hear Dustin's work in Halo 4, Bioshock 2, The Darkness II, Battlefield: Vietnam, He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe, and many others. Now an indie game designer, he's taking time off his first title to lend his talents to make every punch, kick, and barf elicit the proper childhood ecstasy. \nMark De Verno (gameplay developer, harbinger of reality)\nMark is a seasoned programmer who spent five years of his adulthood living in Japan, soaking up the culture and developing an addiction to the Famicom. A karate black belt, Spartan trifecta racer and dogsledder, when he's not being a superhero, Mark is obsessed with AI and physics. Mark is the developer crunching the numbers to get our physics and combat mechanics smooth and supreme. He's also our reality check for insane gameplay, and we like to think of him as our Scotty, but with a Canadian accent.\nJustin Cyr (animator)\nJustin is a seasoned beat'em up veteran, animating titles like Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World: The Game, TMNT GBA, and Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith GBA. Justin is the\"two\" in \"two-punch\", and we're lucky to have him lending his talents to the roster.\nRyoma Machida (executive producer in Tokyo)\nRyoma is \"our man in Japan\"; a successful business instigator with a special interest in promoting Japanese business at the international level. Ryoma is our one stop communication solution, localization coordinator, creative problem solver, and all around good guy. He's been with us since day one, and we're thrilled to have him on board.\nNina Matsumoto (localization, cover art, ???)\nNina is an Eisner-winning author and comic artist who is well known for her OEL manga comic, Y\u014dkaiden. She's bringing her versatile skill set to our project to assist with the Japanese cover art, game localization, and hopefully other exciting things. We are so happy to have her!\nWhere are we now?\nRiver City Ransom: Underground is wrapping up pre-production and gearing up for full scale development. Our game design document is being prepared for licensor submission and approval. Our game engine is operational and we are working to complete the physics sandbox, from which all of our combat mechanics will emerge! While we have some solid ideas for story and character design that were part of our licensing pitch, we're still piecing together the expansive world of River City, its inhabitants, and the various items you may find or shop for.\nWe think our budget and vision for the game are ambitious enough, but in the event that we reach stretch goal territory, we have a solid game plan. The last thing we want to do is spend more time working on smelting toys than making our game. \nTo ensure our backers get the most benefit from stretch goals without biting off more than we can chew, each and every goal we reveal will come equipped with additional talent to join our small team to help us handle the extra workload.\n\nFuture stretch goals may allow us to beef up our tangible rewards. For example, we would love to do a boxed product release, complete with an NES game cart replica USB stick, but the logistics involved for making that happen are nearly a project in themselves. If you want to see those kinds of rewards, please give generously! (Warning: friends don't beat up friends to turn them into coins, but you can ask nicely).\nA final word\nWe hope you'll get behind our team to make this game. If you can't back, we'd love it if you could share our Kickstarter link with your friends and the retro game store down the street. Thank you!\nSpecial Thanks \nRen\u00e9 Hartel, Adrian Mustain, James Croak, Chris Miller, and Griswold.\nSome images (c) Million Co. Ltd., and used under license.\nCreative Corner\nHey! You're still here? You made it all the way to the end of the page, and you should be rewarded for your efforts. Throughout development we hope to provide you with some insight into our development process. Below, you'll see examples of videos we've made for the campaign, that show you how we go about creating the game we know you're going to love.\nAnimation featurette by Bannon Rudis\nHere's the final result!\nSound design featurette by Dustin Crenna\n Level Design Featurette by Daniel Crenna", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs an officially licensed game, we do have the additional overhead of ensuring our game aligns with the brand vision of the original owner. While we're ecstatic to have Million's blessing at each development milestone, it may impact our speed if we need to make multiple revisions to major game assets. We are confident, however, that our vision for the game is in the spirit of the original.\n\nOur next challenge will be localization. We are committed to bringing this game to the world, but we want to get it right. Localizing for other cultures is not just replacing on-screen text. We have to have a solid foundation in place to allow that work to happen seamlessly.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be executing on our very large vision of the game in the time we have. To achieve this, we're relying on our experience, and passion, as a tightly knit team who have imagined this sequel since childhood. We feel the pressure to produce from fellow fans of the game, and this drives us to hit each milestone along the way.\n\nThe team we have put together are no strangers to producing high quality code and creations under tight deadlines. We know how to ship code and what it takes to succeed. We're tying our future livelihoods to this game, and failure is not an option. We've also lined up some clutch industry veterans in our stretch goals, in order to ensure that if scope increases with funding, that we have the firepower to make it happen without compromises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #60", "update_userinfo": "Anniversary Update: Retrosity, OST Bundle, Digital & Physical Rewards", "update_content": "It's hard to believe that we began working on River City Ransom: Underground five years ago, and the game released a little over a year ago.

You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nFor more details on other goals, check out the Stretch Goal section further down the page, and our handy FAQ at the bottom!\nMighty No. 9 is an all-new Japanese side-scrolling action game that takes the best aspects of the 8- and 16-bit era classics you know and love, and transforms them with modern tech, fresh mechanics, and fan input into something fresh and amazing!\nYou play as Beck, the 9th in a line of powerful robots, and the only one not infected by a mysterious computer virus that has caused mechanized creatures the world over to go berserk. Run, jump, blast, and transform your way through six stages (or more, via stretch goals) you can tackle in any order you choose, using weapons and abilities stolen from your enemies to take down your fellow Mighty Number robots and confront the final evil that threatens the planet!\nNote: All images on this page are concept art and not actual in-game screens.\nEvery aspect of development\u2014art, level design, music, programming, etc.\u2014is being handled by veteran Japanese game creators with extensive experience in the genre, and with Mega Man in particular, all the way up to and including the project\u2019s leader, Keiji Inafune himself! Backers will have unprecedented access to seeing this team at work through blogs, podcasts, videos, concept art\u2014the works!\nMighty No. 9 is being developed for the PC with gamepad support (of course!), and will be made available through Steam and DRM-free digital distribution methods. Other platforms, including home consoles, Mac, and Linux, are a high priority, but only if we can afford them via stretch goals. Should we reach those goals, anyone funding the project will be allowed to choose which version of the game they would like to receive. The estimated release date is spring 2015.\nThis project is on Kickstarter so it can involve YOU, the fans! Not only will this make it possible, through crowdfunding, for us to make the game exactly as we envision it, but it also allows us to bring dedicated fans of this genre together to assist the team in shaping aspects of the game\u2019s design. We need your help! Let\u2019s make something amazing, and let\u2019s do it together!\n  So what makes Mighty No. 9\u2014the character as well as the game\u2014different? Simply put: the ability to transform! Of course our hero, Beck, earns new weapons as he defeats each of his fellow Mighty Number boss robots, but more than that, his body itself can also reconfigure into new shapes, allowing for all kinds of new skills and abilities! \nFor example, his limbs might become giant magnets, enabling him to walk up walls or rip away enemy shields... Or maybe extendible spring-loaded hands would allow him to activate far-away switches or work as a grappling hook... Or he could have a tank-like body, easily crossing over spikes and pushing objects around the levels... These are just a few possibilities we\u2019re considering (the game is still in the design phase), but you get the idea!\nAnd it\u2019s not only killing bosses that gets Beck new powers. Taking out other enemies with a certain weapon, or hitting them in their weak spot, can expose one of three types of \u201cxel\u201d (pronounced \u201ccell\u201d) energy Beck can sap (if he\u2019s quick enough), store, and unleash later via his own Mighty Skills! Give yourself a double-jump and speed boost for a limited time, unleash a concentrated flurry of powerful punches directly ahead, or set off a blast that hurts everything on the screen! Whatever final form it takes, this system will add depth and strategy to the action, as you choose how to approach and defeat even normal bad guys to best fuel your special powers.\nOnce, you worked together, side-by-side\u2014but now, your fellow Mighty No. robots have lashed out, taking over key strategic locations across the globe and infesting them with their minions. You have no choice: the other Mighty Numbers...Must. Be. Destroyed!\nBut it won\u2019t be easy. Although they were originally designed for industrial purposes, the Mighty Numbers have all become fierce warriors, seasoned through seasons in the most popular spectator sport of the future: robot-on-robot combat in the Battle Colosseo!\nWe can\u2019t reveal everything about the Mighty Numbers just yet (partially because we wouldn\u2019t want to dump it all out at once, and partially because we\u2019re still working on their designs!), but here\u2019s a taste of what we\u2019re aiming for. Keep checking back for more to be revealed soon, and study what you see here closely\u2014learning the tactics and weak points of these mechanized monsters will be your only hope of defeating them!\nOverheard at recess: \u201cBilly Backer says you can trick him into the water to make him freeze himself and he dies instantly!\u201d (Note: Not true. ...We don\u2019t think.)\n\u201cTommy\u2019s brother heard if you magnet his missile back at him and pause the game right when it hits, he loses all his health down to one!\u201d (Note: Also False. Probably.)\nAny game of this scope takes a team\u2014a big team, way too many to highlight here (keep an eye out for an update with more comprehensive staff info)\u2014but here\u2019s a sample of some key personnel for the purposes of this Kickstarter campaign:\n  That\u2019s where you come in. As a backer to Mighty No. 9, you will become a member of the Mighty community, and in a way, an extended member of the development team, where your input\u2014taken in aggregate along with your mighty brothers and sisters\u2014can help shape the game. How will we get your feedback? Well, for example: \nSURVEYS: Within the first few weeks of a successful Kickstarter campaign, members of the Mighty community can take part in a survey to help judge their overall priorities: difficulty balance, length vs. replayability, favorite features of older games and what you hate\u2014things like that.\nPOLLS: From time to time, the team will ask the community to choose between ideas or characters they\u2019ve come up with. For example, the first poll planned is to choose between several designs to pick the look for Beck\u2019s trusted partner, Call. (That\u2019s right: Beck & Call.)\nYou can vote for your favorite Call from now until the end of our Kickstarter; click on the image above for details!\nCONTESTS: Later on in production, the team will hold a contest within the Mighty community to design an enemy! Come up with your coolest or craziest design and a fun way to sell the team and your fellow community members on it, and who knows? \nAND ??? These are just a few of the ideas the team has already that all backers will have access to. (At higher pledge levels, more involved but necessarily-limited interactions like beta access and more are likewise possible.) \nWhat form will all the final fan interactions take? Hey, you tell us! We can\u2019t promise we can do anything you ask for, of course, but we can promise to always be asking, and more importantly, always be listening. That\u2019s what this project is all about! :D \nWe\u2019re proud to announce we\u2019re working with Humble Bundle for digital reward fulfillment and Fangamer for physical items! These guys have built a name doing exactly this kind of thing\u2014we trust them, and so can you. Now, on with the rewards!\nIf we can make our initial Kickstarter funding goal and nothing more, you can rest assured we are going to deliver a complete and fully satisfying game experience. But given the choice and the necessary funds to make it happen, we have a whole bunch of \u201creally nice-to-have\u201d ideas for additional content, features, and platforms (!) that would be extra icing on our already delicious \u201cneed-to-have\u201d cake! Of course part of any extra money will go toward making up the budget of the game itself, but if the following funding numbers are reached, we're also excited to offer:\n$1,200,000: Two More Stages: REACHED!\nOur initial goal sets the table with six main stages and bosses, plus a final stage leading to the ultimate showdown\u2014but now we can invite Mighty Nos. 7 and 8 to the party, each complete with their own, unique stage!\n$1,350,000: Mac and Linux Versions: REACHED!\nWhy should Windows users get to hog all the fun? Now we can offer Mighty No. 9 on both Mac and Linux as well!\n$1,500,000: New Game Plus and Turbo Mode: REACHED!\nIf we pass this goal, we\u2019ll design a New Game Plus mode that allows those who finish the game but are still thirsty for more to carry over certain powers or items from the first play-through for a more challenging \u201csecond quest\u201d version of the game. We\u2019ll also work in a Turbo Mode that lets you play through the game at a faster speed for extra challenge.\n$1,750,000: The Making of Mighty No. 9 Video Documentary: REACHED!\nGet an in-depth look at the creation of Mighty No. 9\u2014and an unprecedented peek into the typically ultra-secretive Japanese game development industry\u2014with three 30-minute documentary episodes produced by the wizards at 2 Player Productions (the same team behind our pitch video and the amazing Double Fine Adventure documentary)!\n$2,000,000: BONUS Boss Rush Mode: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right -- we\u2019re adding a stretch goal here without pushing any of the other goals back! (Think of it more like a stretch reward.) :) After a lot of feedback (which we agreed with) on the big gap before the next goal of PS3/Xbox 360/Wii U console versions, the team really wanted to have something for everyone to aim for and celebrate along the way. So we took our best-bang-for-the-buck potential future goal and will include it as a bonus feature if we can hit $2 million: a separate mode where you can challenge all the Mighty No. Bosses, back-to-back, with a clock ticking to keep track of your best time, so you can share, compare, and show off your skills to your friends! \n$2,200,000: PS3/X360/WIIU CONSOLE VERSIONS: REACHED!!!\nThis one deserves ALL CAPS AND THREE EXCLAMATION MARKS! Now we can bring this game to the audience that made the genre what it is in the first place: console gamers! Specifically, we\u2019ll make digital versions for release on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U platforms. (You\u2019ll be given the option to choose any of these instead of the PC version.) \nThank you so much to all the fans who made this dream possible!\n$2,400,000: Challenge Mode: REACHED!\nSimilar to the Challenge Modes in games like New Super Mario Bros. U, this special extra mode would remix parts of existing levels and enemies to create dozens of mini-missions you can use to test your skills in a variety of enjoyably frustrating ways! \n$2,550,000: Extra End Stage & Boss: REACHED!\nWe\u2019ll add another full stage, complete with an intense, original boss battle (!), to the final area Beck will take on once he defeats the other eight Mighty No. bosses!\n$2,750,000: BECK & CALL ONLINE CO-OP CHALLENGE MODE: REACHED!\nWe\u2019re excited about all our stretch goals, but even so, this one is really special to us: based on your feedback, we wanted to offer something that both included Call as a playable character and put her on equal footing as Beck, while not breaking our schedule or budget. We also wanted this to be something new -- something the genre has never seen before. And that\u2019s how we came up with this: over a dozen missions you can play online with a friend, playing as Beck and his community-appointed partner, Call! Like the single-player offline challenge Mode, these missions will be parts of levels remixed, but this time around the theme of cooperative play. Players will need to use Beck and Call\u2019s different powers to complement each other and defeat these special challenges! \n$2,900,000: Intro Stage and Boss: REACHED!\nWe add an epic introductory stage\u2014complete with a closing boss encounter\u2014that players will take on before facing any of the Mighty No. boss levels! This will help ease everyone into the world of Mighty No. 9, and serve as a nice primer on the basic game systems and controls!\n$3,100,000: Support Character: REACHED!\nBeck will get a faithful sidekick to swoop in with special powers at his time of greatest need! The exact form this character will take is not decided yet, so we\u2019ll all be able to see it get conceived and designed together\u2014but it will be some kind of assistant that will drop in for a limited time, help out somehow, and then zoom away!\n$3,300,000: PS4 and Xbox One Versions: REACHED!!!\nYes! We heard your calls and are proud to report we can finally offer next-gen versions of Mighty No. 9 here! We know by the time the game ships in 2015, many of you will be proud owners of one next-gen system or the other -- or maybe both! If we reach this level of funding, we can add the PS4 and the Xbox One to the list for every backer getting the digital version of Mighty No. 9 to choose from! To recap, that would mean you could choose one of the following: PC, Mac, Linux, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, or Xbox One! \n$3,500,000: PlayStation Vita and 3DS versions: REACHED!\nThat\u2019s right! At this level, we can make digital versions of Mighty No. 9 for the two most popular handheld systems out there: the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS! (These will both be added to the list of available systems to choose from, so every backer who is set to receive a download version of Mighty No. 9 can choose either of these as the system for their game download, instead of a home console or PC version.)\n$3,700,000 SINGLE PLAYER CALL STAGE & BOSS FIGHT!: REACHED!\nYes! We heard the feedback from our community, and at this level, we would be thrilled to fulfill this popular wish -- to add an all-new single-player level, including a boss fight, where you can play as Mighty No. 9\u2019s heroine, Call! We agree it would be a fun addition and a great way to mix up the action, so fingers crossed we can make it this far!\n$3,800,000: OPTIONAL RETRO-STYLE CHIPTUNE SOUNDTRACK + FX!: REACHED!\nYou\u2019ve seen the names of the legendary musicians attached to this project: Manami Matsumae, Takeshi Tateishi, Ippo Yamada... It\u2019s a veritable who\u2019s who of veteran game composers. So we thought, why not tap into that retro vibe and cook up an optional chiptune version of the entire Mighty No. 9 game soundtrack, including classic sound effects? That\u2019s right \u2013 we\u2019ll remix the entire soundtrack, retro 8-bit-style, and the game\u2019s sound effects, for you to listen to in-game as you play, as an option you can toggle on or off in the settings menu!\n$4,000,000: ONLINE BATTLE RACE MODE!: REACHED!\nThe ultimate online competition! You and a friend compete online, racing to the end of slightly customized versions of single-player stages. You can see your rival as a \"ghost\" image in your game, but you can't affect each other...save for the enemies you defeat being sent over to impede your opponent\u2019s progress! It's an all new twist on versus mode play that will give Mighty No. 9 life well beyond the single-player campaign!\nWe're working out the details of our upcoming stretch goals now. More info here as soon as we have it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe all know game development is inherently unpredictable\u2014delays and unexpected costs being the two most common \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d The good news is, in their more than 15 year history, developer Inti Creates have shipped over 30 different games on eight different platforms, and our project lead, Keiji Inafune, has either worked on or overseen 30+ games in this genre alone, as well as having lead one of the biggest Japanese studios, and some of the biggest AAA games ever. So not only do we have extensive experience with running successful game productions in general, but also experience designing, building, and shipping games of this type specifically, with an established track record of being on time and on budget.\n\nAnother challenge: we are working in two languages here\u2014Japanese and English\u2014with developers and backers on both sides. While we feel this is a huge plus, as it adds appeal and makes our project unique, there\u2019s no denying it also adds unique requirements in terms of communication and workflow. The good news here: We all have experience making and marketing games for BOTH English-speaking and Japanese-speaking audiences, and are taking extra precautions in pre-planning and during development to buffer and budget for things like interpretation, translation time, etc., all to ensure we stay on the same page with our backers and with each other.\n\nFinally, what we see as our biggest challenge: properly involving the community. How exactly do you ask for and integrate fan feedback and contributions while keeping a project like this on track in terms of vision, scope, and schedule? This is still something of a wild frontier in the game industry, as it\u2019s only recently that any of us have had the tools to make this feasible. And especially in Japan, where we have honestly lagged behind our Western counterparts in the variety of ways we\u2019ve been able to interact with our fans up until now.\n\nWe\u2019ve been researching different projects\u2019 approaches\u2014and some of us even have experience from similar experiments in the past\u2014but as far as we can tell, there\u2019s really no one established \u201cright way\u201d to go about it. However! We do think, in this case, even knowing that we don\u2019t know all the answers up front is important: it reminds us we need to listen, to establish methods of ensuring we hear our backers\u2019 choices and feedback, and keeps us more flexible. We are trying to work in a new way with this project that will allow us to show more things earlier than we typically would, while ensuring that everyone seeing it will have the correct context to see it in, and that there will still be plenty of nice surprises in the final product. \n\nOne aspect we already know to account for is anytime you ask a (hopefully!) large group of people to choose between options, especially when you\u2019re asking some of the most passionate fans in all of gaming, you are going to end up, by necessity, with some portion of them disappointed, and you\u2019re going to hear about it. We know we\u2019re ready for the ride, and even better, we\u2019re excited as hell to take it. The biggest thing we believe we should all keep in mind, both as creators and as backers: we\u2019ll be learning more and more as we go along, so let\u2019s be patient and work together.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #123", "update_userinfo": "IMPORTANT NOTICE from Fangamer / Fangamer\u304b\u3089\u5927\u5207\u306a\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b", "update_content": "Hello Mighty Backers!\nFangamer has recently sent out the following notice.

All uppers levels are full.  Take a look at the FAQ for more details.  Thanks for everyone's support!\nConcept\nMy story begins in 2008 when I first played Dominion.  Five years and every expansion later, I am still hooked.  There's just one problem: Dominion lovers eventually find themselves buried in a pile of boxes.  Not only does this take up a lot of space, but it takes a long time to dig through each box to set up a game.  I'm here to solve that issue for you with a box that:\nHolds all 9 sets plus promo cards\nFits easily on your board game shelf\nSorts your basic cards for quick setup\nOrganizes and individually labels kingdom cards\nStores both sleeveless and sleeved cards\nIs licensed (non-exclusively) with Rio Grande Games\nThe Solution\nThe Box Itself\nMy design solution begins with a standard wooden artist case, fully equipped with brass hardware and a leather handle. I have adapted it to create a customized storage case.  The box is engraved with the Dominion logo and comes unfinished (may be stained and/or varnished by the end user).\nBox measures: 16 1/2\" x 13\" x 4 1/2\"\nInside the Box\nThe internal sections of the box are made from black acrylic, laser cut to organize all the components.  Every expansion (including promo cards and the latest Guilds expansion) will fit.  All supplemental game pieces have a dedicated storage space.  In order to accommodate both sleeveless and sleeved cards, I have come up with three variations that fit each option.\nOption 1: Sleeveless Cards\nSleeveless Cards Box fully loaded (except Guilds and promos).\nBasic Card Trays stack and allow for quick setup.\nOption 2: Standard Card Sleeves\n(Example: Mayday Games Sleeves - Standard)\nKingdom cards are stored, individually labeled, over the full depth of the box.  Basic (victory and treasure) cards are also stored in the main body of the box, sorted and labeled for quick setup.\nOption 3: Premium Card Sleeves\n(Example: Fantasy Flight Sleeves)\nThe additional space required to fit premium card sleeves requires a 2-box solution.  Modified versions of the previous options are used and come with an extra double compartment card tray.  With 2 boxes, there is even some space left to add extra cards (fan cards, etc.)\nRewards\nEach one of the box options is available as a reward for your support in getting production off the ground.  \nSleeveless Cards Box\nWooden Case\nKingdom Card Storage Area\nBasic Card Trays\nRandomizer Card Tray\nCoin Trays\n+ Durable Plastic Dividers\nStandard Card Sleeves Box\nWooden Case\nKingdom and Basic Card Storage Area\nRandomizer Card Tray\nCoin Trays\n+ Durable Plastic Dividers\nPremium Card Sleeves 2-Box Set\n2 Wooden Cases\nKingdom Card Storage Area\nBasic Card Trays\n2 Randomizer Card Trays\nCoin Trays\nExtra Double Compartment Card Tray\n+ Durable Plastic Dividers\n\n*Note that the game itself is not included.\nDividers\n+ Durable Plastic Dividers\nDividers are printed and laminated on a durable 24 pt plastic and die cut with alternating tabs to easily find what you need per game.  Take a look at the video (if you haven't already) to see just how well these plastic dividers hold up to repeated handling.  The entire series, 224 dividers in all, are printed and cut for you.\nYour help is essential to kick-start the printing and die cutting process for these high-end dividers.  These come with each box or you can get them as a stand-alone reward.   \nAlso as a separate reward level, you can also get a PDF Divider File to self-print and cut their own dividers from a PDF file.  The file will be set up for 8-1/2 x 11 printing.\nCoin Trays\nEach box option comes with stacking coin trays, but they are also available as a separate reward.  The assembly includes 4 trays and a lid that stack and key together for storage. \nAdditional Details and Notes\nPlease note that, fully-loaded, the box is heavy; nearly 3,000 cards add up!  I will be adding additional reinforcement to the bottom of the box to make the construction more robust.  Your help is again essential for this process as I require additional equipment.  (Even with extra reinforcement, I still recommended that the box be carried with both hands to help the leather handle remain like new over time.)\nAll rewards include insured shipping costs.\nThank You\nThank you to Rio Grande Games and Donald X. Vaccarino for making this amazing game.  I am proud to say that this is a licensed storage solution.\nThank you to my husband, friends and family for their continued support.

The upper level rewards are limited to maintain a realistic time-frame.\n\nPrinting and Die Cutting Dividers\nFor the prototype, the dividers are labeled 1-sided and organized alphabetically by set (because not everyone has every expansion and promo cards).\nThe goal in full production is to work out with the printers/ die cutters a 2-sided solution for maximum flexibility. This would allow users to organize the cards by set or alphabetically (irrespective of set). Contributors will be kept updated as to whether this solution is feasible.

Now that the X-Cube has been prototyped, I want to share it with everyone. This is a fundraising campaign to bring the X-Cube to mass production.\nHow are you going to mass produce and sell the X-Cube?\nYou can preorder an X-Cube by pledging to the campaign.\nA friend of mine, Scott Brown, is the head of product development for Marbles the Brain Store. Marbles is a chain of stores based out of Chicago that sells all types of brain games. I reached out to Scott and he said he would be thrilled to carry the X-Cube in stores.\nHe even introduced me to a trusted manufacturer in Hong Kong. This manufacturer has given me a quote for injection molding, assembly, and packaging. That's where the fundraising goal came from.\nI'll be updating the production process at http://xcubeproject.blogspot.com/.\nAnd you're letting us download the files to print one? \nYep. The X-Cube was was born on a 3D printer. Even if you don't want to print one, you can view the STL Files (using STL viewing software) and find out how the X-Cube works. Pay what you want to support the Kickstarter and you get to download the files!\nMy mission is to show that 3D printing technology is a powerful tool for bringing an idea to life and sharing an invention with the world.\nThis technology allows me to share my invention with audiences I would never have been able to reach before. The internet now allows inventors to share their work with a vast new audience in the same way artists and musicians can share theirs. By making this project open source, it can become bigger than I could ever hope to make it by myself.\nI hope people get as excited about the X-Cube as they did with the Rubik's Cube. I hope the project gets people excited about 3D printing technology. I hope it changes the way we share ideas and bring them to life.\nX-Cube Wireframe View (via Solidworks)\nDigital assembly of the X-Cube (via IGS Viewer)\nHow did you get the idea for the X-Cube?\nWhen I was in the 7th grade, a teamate of mine in FIRST Lego Robotics  taught me how to solve a Rubik's Cube. It became my first true love. We sat together every day on the school bus, and I spent countless hours learning its quirks. Two years later during the summer of 2008, we took our relationship to the next level. Using a dremel tool and a plastic casting kit, I hand built a 3x3x5 logic puzzle. You can see that here. It's not the most well crafted puzzle, but I was proud.\nWhen I was working on the 3x3x5, I came up with a design that allowed the extension of another two faces. I decided I would call rhis one the \"X-Cube.\" But I knew I would not achieve precision building it by hand. That\u2019s when I turned to 3D printing. The cube\u2019s progress was halted until I gained access to such a printer.\nFour years later during my sophomore fall semester at Illinois Tech, I was inspired to revisit the project. I brought the X-Cube CAD files to our Idea Shop and had the puzzle 3D printed. I decided to share a video of my creation on Reddit, and I woke up the next day to thousands of views! The video went viral and reached 1.5 million views in 9 days. That's when I knew I needed to share this. \nWhat about patents? Won't Rubik's try to cut your hands off?\nErno Rubik patented his cube in Hungary in 1975 but never obtained an American patent. New twisty puzzles are fair game! But I will not be patenting the X-cube. I would rather spend my time sharing the puzzle than suing people over it. A patent is for keeping something out of someone's hands, which runs opposite to the spirit of the puzzle.\nKnock-offs happen. It's inevitable with any product in today's world. But  knock-offs can reach markets that I cannot! I just want to get the X-Cube out to the world. I'm sure it will be successful whether or not it is patented.\nI'm not completely unprotected though. As a contingency, I have filed a provisional patent for the X-Cube. This means I can still patent the technology a year from the date I filed, else the possibility expires and the puzzle is unpatentable.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first venture I have undertaken. This process is new to me and will be both a great challenge and great learning experience. The X-Cube must be injection molded, assembled, stickered, packaged, and shipped, each of which will present new and unique challenges. There are even obstacles I have yet to foresee in bringing X-Cube to full production. I vow to produce a quality puzzle; if it is not up to my standards, production delays may arise.\n\nI am working on this project full-time so I can overcome these challenges quickly.

While it's tempting to throw out a new $150,000 stretch goal, we're simply out of ideas that wouldn't cause chaos to the process this late in the game. It has been a wonderful, exhausting process, and we're already more than $100,000 beyond what we thought was a minimum for this project. We're happy for any additional pledges we get from this point forward -- more people reading Digger is a good thing! -- but we really don't feel the need to go crazy trying to squeeze out any more from this campaign.\n(If you all decide to go crazy on your own and push us to $150K in the last hour, We're sure we can find something fun to surprise you with after the fact!)\nAdd-Ons Update: We reached our $100,000 stretch goal just in time for the last week of our campaign and the release of add-ons! Due to the stretch goal, we will be releasing a Digger T-shirt, free for backers at the $100 level and up, Ursula will be getting a wombat tattoo, we'll be getting professional help with our new website, and, as a little extra bonus, Ursula has agree to sign all copies of the book purchased through the Kickstarter, even the ones at the book-only level. We have also released our collection of add-on options. Be sure to revisit our Rewards section, below, for new images, and then the Add-Ons section below that for the basic numbers. Please visit our Add-Ons document for full details, and don't forget to refer to our Reward Matrix for details on what you are already getting at each level.\n***\nDigger is a story about a wombat. Specifically, it is a story about the wombat named Digger-of-unnecessarily-convoluted-tunnels of Clan Quartzclaw who digs a tunnel to a world populated with matriarchal hyena clans, oracular slugs, talking statues of gods, and other strange creatures. In the course of trying to find her way home, she becomes embroiled in an ancient battle between old gods and demons, despite her disaffection for anything of the sort. Digger\u2019s tale was published as a web comic over the course of eight years, and also as a six-volume printed collection. Along the way, it won a number of awards, most notably the 2012 Hugo Award in the category of \u201cBest Graphic Story.\u201d This Kickstarter campaign is to help fund the publication of a single-volume omnibus edition of the entire story, to be made available in both softcover and hardcover editions.\nHelp us replace the original six print volumes with a single, all-encompassing omnibus edition!\nWho are We?\nUrsula Vernon is a writer and an artist, a blogger and a podcaster. In addition to Digger she has published Black Dogs, a two-volume novel, Nurk, a book for children, and Dragonbreath a popular series of books for young readers that are a mix of prose and comic pages. She lives in North Carolina with her partner, Kevin Sonney, and a collection of rescued dogs and cats. She also blogs about gardening with native plants and produces a podcast with her partner titled, \u201cKevin and Ursula Eat Cheap\u201d (a.k.a. \"KUEC\").\nSofawolf Press is an independent publishing company that has been producing novels, graphic novels and literary anthologies about anthropomorphic animals for over a decade. We published Ursula\u2019s Black Dogs novels, her sketchbook, It Made Sense at the Time, and the six-volume Digger series. We\u2019ve come to Kickstarter to fund the printing of the omnibus edition of Digger, not only to take pre-orders of the book, but also to turn this into a fun event where Digger\u2019s and Ursula\u2019s fans can rally together and help make the omnibus edition bigger and better than we could have funded on our own.\nWhy an Omnibus Edition?\nWe produced the original six print volumes of Digger as the story was being written, allowing fans to read the story in print, away from their computer screens, as Digger's tale evolved. Now that the story is complete, it makes sense to compile the whole epic saga into a single volume that will be more convenient and cost effective for new fans to purchase. A single book is also much more likely to be stocked in comic book stores than the individual volumes.\nWhat Will It Be Like?\nAt a minimum, we plan to bring together all the original printed pages into this omnibus collection, bound in both softcover and hardcover editions. Digger's story was broken into twelve \"books\" online, and each of the original print volumes consisted of two of these books. The print volumes also included some form of extra stories, guides or other content that did not appear online. All these pages will be compiled in the omnibus.\nThe omnibus edition will also include a new introduction written by Phil Foglio, creator of the popular Girl Genius comic series!\nFull front to back cover design, under development.\nIf we make it into stretch goal range, we'll be able to make the omnibus bigger and better, in both style and content. We hope to raise enough funds to add a color section to preserve the original cover art and show off some of Digger's fabulous fan art. We'd love to make the cover jazzy with spot varnish, foil and/or embossing. And if things really get rolling, we hope to add author's notes from the website as well as a new story by Ursula.\n***\nRewards\n(Please note that most designs shown here are preliminary and may be changed to be made more awesome!)\nNEW: Add-Ons! Many of the rewards here are now available as add-ons. A short list of prices is available further down the page, but be sure to visit our Digger Omnibus Add-Ons document for full details.\nNOTE: Reward Matrix! We've created a Google Spreadsheet to help explain what you get at each reward level. It's not as clever or pretty as some we've seen, but hopefully it gets the job done.\nJust the Book: If all you want is a copy of the book, go straight to the $45 reward level for the softcover or $75 reward level for the hardcover edition. This will cover the book and shipping within the U.S. (Add $35 for international shipping.) This is really a great deal compared to cover price plus normal shipping!\nDigital Items: Ursula is working on a desktop wallpaper image that will be available in a range of standard sizes for backers at the $5 level and up. Starting at the $15 level, backers will be able to download a digital copy of the omnibus edition of the book in PDF format.\nFlat Printed Items: We are working on a thank-you card and an exclusive \"Remember Tunnel 17!\" refrigerator magnet for backers at the $15 level. Ursula is working on a \"cast photo\" poster that will be produced at a variety of sizes for backers at levels of $25 and up. We also have several vinyl stickers available at $60 and up: approximate dimensions in inches are Digger: 3.5 x 3.5, Ed: 3.5 x 5.75 and Shadowchild: 1.75 x 2.5.\nUpdate: Sizes for all stickers now available! Dimensions are approximate.\nDigger: 3.5 x 3.5 in (9 x 9 cm)\nEd: 3.5 x 5.75 in (9 x 14.5 cm)\nShadowchild (white or reflective): 1.75 x 2.5 in (4.5 x 6.5 cm)\nBoneclaw Mother 4.25 x 5.25 in (11 x 13.5 cm)\nGanesh 5 x 5 in (12.75 x 12.75 cm)\nSurka 5.5 x 4 in (14 x 10 cm)\nVampire Squash 10 x 2.5 in (25.5 x 6.5 cm)\nOracular Slug 6 x 3.75 in (15.25 x 9.5 cm)\nGanesh with quote 10 x 5 in (25.5 x 12.75 cm)\nRefrigerator magnet and NEW vinyl sticker designs for add-ons.\nPick Axes: Show your wombat pride with a commemorative pick axe bearing the slogan \"Remember Tunnel 17!\"\nAll backers at the $60 and higher levels will receive a large foam pick axe perfect for cheering on your team at wombat-themed sporting events. This axe will be approximately 15 inches long.\nA limited number of fully-functional, wombat-scale, hand-forged pick axes will also be available at the $1000 level. These will be created by Elmer Roush, a talented blacksmith (check out his website!) and a former coal miner who has personal experience wielding pick axes. The design of these pick axes is a combination of Digger's own axe and a human-scale pick axe owned by Elmer. They will be approximately 12 x 10 inches, roughly equivalent to a human geologist's pick in scale. We are investigating options for etching \"Remember Tunnel 17!\" into either the axe head or the hand-carved wood handle.\nPlease note that these are fully-functional tools, not weapons. They are commemorative replicas of one of the basic tools used for mining, and here they symbolize the pride Wombats have in their subterranean engineering skills. They are made for breaking rocks, not bones. Kickstarter does not allow us to offer weapons, knives, weapon accessories, or replicas of weapons as rewards, nor would we want to. We hope that our backers respect this and use their axes for only peaceful and constructive means -- a good rule for any of the heavy, blunt or pointy objects one might find in their garden tool shed. However, we'd be delighted if you simply hung yours on the wall as an awesome and unique display piece celebrating the industrious and ingenious subterranean culture of Wombats in the Digger series.\nFoam vs. hand-forged iron commemorative pick axes.\nNew! We presented Ursula with the prototype commemorative axe, now sporting the hand-engraved \"Remember Tunnel 17\", for her inspection at Anthrocon. She approves! (No, she didn't actually use the axe to destroy the hotel's pottery.)\nCloisonne Pins: We will be producing cloisonne pins of four popular characters from the comic: Digger, Ed, Shadowchild and Surka. They will be available at the $60 level and up.\nPin designs. Boneclaw Mother design yet to be finalized.\nT-Shirts: Having reached our $100,000 stretch goal, we will now be releasing a Digger T-Shirt, free to backers at the $100 level and up, and also available to backers at the $60 and $80 levels as a $15 add-on. The design of the shirts will be the scene below, where Digger first emerges inside the Temple of Ganesh. It will be printed in white on black fabric and will be made available in a wide range of sizes. (We are investigating options such as long/tall and women's cut T-shirts.)\nNaming Rights: Become an honorary wombat or hyena! Starting at the $250 level, we will come up with an appropriate wombat or hyena name*, as suitable for each of the cultures in Digger. Your wombat/hyena self will get a special listing in the contributor acknowledgment section of the book, and will also get a shout-out on KUEC. There is also a special $500 reward level that will get your name (either real name or wombat/hyena name) dedicated on a plant stake in Ursula's garden, and she will also dedicate one of her next lifebirds** to you.\n* Limited numbers available because of the limits to our creativity.\n** It's a birdwatching thing!\nStained Glass Suncatchers: We have partnered with Deb Kosiba to create several unique Digger-related stained glass designs for this Kickstarter. Deb is an artist and a friend of Ursula...who also happens to have created the beautiful stained glass bases for the 2012 Hugo Awards.\nOne-of-a-kind large Digger, Ed and Shadowchild stained glass suncatcher. See smaller pieces, below, for examples of glass colors used in previous pieces.\nLimited edition Digger and Ed stained glass suncatchers.\nBiting Pear of Salamanca Figurine: Ursula Vernon is also the creator of the digital painting, \"The Biting Pear of Salamanca,\" which went on to Internet infamy as the LOLWUT Pear. A limited run of figurines was created back in 2009 by PatchTogether, and is no longer available. We are offering four of the remaining highly-collectible pieces that we have been hoarding from this initial production run.\nMake someone you love this happy next Christmas with an original, limited edition Biting Pear figureine!\nDinner with Ursula: Come to San Antonio, Texas, in August/September for dinner with Ursula and Kevin during the World Science Fiction Convention, a.k.a. Worldcon, a.k.a. LoneStarCon 3. You and a guest can join up to four other couples for dinner at a local upscale restaurant. We will pay for dinner, as well as transportation from the main convention hotel if necessary; you will be responsible for transportation to San Antonio and your lodging there. We'll work with all backers at this reward level to find one or two evenings during the convention (excluding Sept. 1, the night of the Hugo Awards) on which to hold the dinner(s), and we will accommodate people's dietary restrictions and preferences to the best of our abilities.\nOriginal Art: We are excited to offer several opportunities to get original art from Ursula! Numbers are limited in order to fit this work into her existing schedule and priorities, so if you are interested, snag them quickly! At $250 you can grab one of 40 \"Digger doodles,\" which are quick sketches of Digger that will accompany Ursula's signature and dedication in your book. At $500 Ursula will draw for you one of 20 sketches of Digger and Shadowchild, done on a 5 x 7 inch sheet of quality art paper.\nAt the $750 and higher levels, things are a little different. The first 10 backers to pledge at any of these levels will receive an original sketch of Digger and one other character. (In other words, a maximum of ten will be offered, total, across all these levels.) The additional character could be one from the original Digger story, or it could be your wombat/hyena character, named as part of the rewards at these levels. These will also be done on a 5 x 7 inch sheet of quality art paper.\n***\nNEW: Add-Ons!\nFor this last week of the campaign, we are releasing many of the rewards as add-ons to augment your pledges.

We really hope to bypass that, because it's in the stretch goals that we get to add some extra fun things to the omnibus edition!\n$30,000 Baseline *** ACHIEVED! *** Thank you all for a wonderful, overwhelming first 24 hours. Now on to see what else we can do to make this even more awesome!\n$40,000 *** ACHIEVED! *** We will include a color section in the book to display the original cover art and a collection of fan art. Ursula will also release a set of Digger character icons free for use by all backers on their social media of choice.\n$50,000 *** Achieved! *** We will compile an appendix of Ursula's notes that accompanied some of the pages when they were posted online, but which never appeared in print. We will also add spot varnish and/or foil (depending on the final cover design) to the softcover and hardcover editions, and we'll add french flaps (endflaps) to the softcover edition.\n$60,000 *** Achieved***\nUrsula will write and illustrate a new short story in Digger's world, to be included at the end of the book.\nWe will add embossing to the cover of both hardcover and softcover editions.\nNEW: Thank you Canada Pin! We will include a special, exclusive cloisonne pin in orders to Canada as an apology and a thank you for the fact that Kickstarter doesn't have a separate Canada shipping level.\n$80,000 *** Achieved***\nWe will create an exclusive dust jacket for hardcover editions of the book sold only through this Kickstarter.\nWe will release new designs for a Boneclaw Mother cloisonne pin and vinyl sticker.\nWe will increment all reward levels that include pins and stickers ($60 and up) to include one each of an additional pin and sticker of your choice.\nWe're going to have to hire some help processing orders! While we at Sofawolf Press are happy to donate our time to the cause, we can't expect everyone to do so. In order to process orders efficiently, we'll hire some friends and associates to help get the books and other rewards out the door.\n$90,000 *** Achieved ***\nVideo has been posted to Update #8!\nEpisode 114 of \"Kevin and Ursula Eat Cheap\" experienced technical difficulties mid-recording and several minutes of scintillating commentary about artificial-crab-flavored chips were lost...or so everyone thought!Overlooked was the fact that Jeff had set up a camera to catch video for possible use in this Kickstarter project's video. He has recovered the audio, with video.\nIn thanks for making this milestone of 3x our initial Kickstarter funding goal, we'll release the missing audio and video.\n$95,000 *** Achieved ***\nWe will release additional sticker designs for those reward levels getting stickers.\nFor each reward level getting stickers, the number of stickers will remain the same, but backers will have the chance to choose their favorite designs.\nNEW: We will release add-on options for both books and other rewards.\n$100,000 ***Achieved ***\nNEW: Ursula will now sign all books, including those pledged at the book-only reward levels!\nUrsula Vernon will add a tribal wombat to her personal tattoo collection, and will post photos for all to see!\nWe will release an exclusive T-shirt, included free for all backers at the $100 level and higher.\nSofawolf Press will hire professionals to help fast-track our current project to migrate our website to Drupal. In its current form, our site is not the easiest to purchase from, especially for distributors, so website improvements will benefit Digger and Ursula by helping get the book out in front of more eyes. The more we sell products directly, the higher the royalty checks for Ursula and our other creators!\n$105,000 *** Achieved ***\nUrsula will record a commentary track to accompany Volume #1 (Chapters 1 & 2) of the original printed edition, similar to a director's commentary track you might enable while watching a DVD/BlueRay movie. Readers will follow along in their own copies of the book using audio cues for page turns.\nWe will release the audio track free to the Internet.\n$110,000 *** Achieved ***\nSimilar to Volume #1, Ursula will record a commentary track for Volume #2, covering Chapters 3 & 4.\n$115,000 *** Achieved ***\nSimilar to Volume #1, Ursula will record a commentary track for Volume #3, covering Chapters 5 & 6.\n$120,000 *** Achieved ***\nSimilar to Volume #1, Ursula will record a commentary track for Volume #4, covering Chapters 7 & 8.\n$125,000 *** Achieved ***\nSimilar to Volume #1, Ursula will record a commentary track for Volume #5, covering Chapters 9 & 10.\n$130,000 *** Achieved ***\nSimilar to Volume #1, Ursula will record a commentary track for Volume #6, covering Chapters 11 & 12.\n$140,000 *** Achieved ***\nUPDATE: because this stretch goal was reached so late in the campaign, too late to create an add-on for lower-level pledges, we will do whatever we can to include the special dust jacket in all hardcover levels without requiring extra funds from anyone.\nUrsula will create a full-color wrap-around design for the special Kickstarter-only hardcover dust jacket. The image will harken back to the gorgeous art that she created for the web chapter title pages and the individual printed volumes' covers. You just might want to frame it, rather than leave it on the book!\nBecause of Ursula's schedule and the complexity of this work, these dust jackets may not be ready by October, when we plan to ship the books and other rewards.\nDepending on the extra shipping costs and our margins at the lowest hardcover reward levels, we may offer backers at the $75 and $100 levels the choice of either (1) paying a little extra to help cover the added cost of shipping the covers separately, or (2) saving on shipping costs by waiting to ship everything together, once the dust jackets are ready.\nBackers at the $200 level and higher will have their dust jackets mailed at no extra cost to them.\n***\nVideo Extras\nPosted to give fans a little dose of Ursula during her absence due to honeymoon.\n$90K stretch goal: posting \"lost\" video from Kevin and Ursula Eat Cheap, Episode #114.\nThank you!\nWe, Ursula Vernon and Sofawolf Press, would like to thank you all for your support, now and throughout Digger's development. Without you, none of this would have been possible! We hope that you enjoy reading and sharing Digger in this new format, and we also hope that you find something else in our rewards to make this experience fun and memorable.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe at Sofawolf Press have been publishing books and selling them from our website for over a decade, so we are confident that we can pull the book together in a reasonable amount of time. Perhaps the biggest risk is that we set our baseline goal at a level that would fund a book not quite as awesome as we'd like to create, and so we are depending on reaching stretch goals to make the omnibus really shine.\n\nThere are a number of things yet to be completed that could throw off our ability to deliver our books and rewards on the time. Extra content for the book could slow down production. Unique rewards that rely on the work of individual artisans are reliant on fitting the work into their schedules. Any one of the many producers of the pins or posters or stickers could run into production bottlenecks that keep us waiting. We will do our best to keep things rolling along, and we hope that if there are delays, they will be minimal and that our backers will be understanding.\n\nIt is also possible that USPS could raise their rates (again!).

But they're either too bulky to be always carried along; or have pre-set angles that don't adjust intuitively.\nThe Pocket Tripod has been designed to be the most practical iPhone stand ever, by making it so portable, that you'll always have it with you in your wallet; and by giving you complete tilt-adjustment freedom.\nThe Pocket Tripod is as thin as two credit cards stacked on top.\n\nPortrait, Landscape, Upside-down, it all works. Since the iPhone has a uniform edge cross-section, it can fit inside the cut-outs of the Pocket Tripod with any of its four edges. This is what makes adjusting the iPhone to any angle possible with Pocket Tripod, both in landscape and portrait.\nThe Pocket Tripod can hold the iPhone both in landscape and in portrait.\n\nAdjusting the angle of the iPhone with the Pocket Tripod is done the same way as on a full sized photography tripod. Unlike most portable stands that use tabs to lean the iPhone on, the Pocket Tripod actually gives you smooth, uninterrupted 90\u00b0 sweeps of tilt adjustment. Its unique design let's you quickly and precisely aim your iPhone to any angle you like.\nA combination of four 90\u00b0 sweeps lets the Pocket Tripod hold the iPhone at any angle.\nFrom concept to reality, making the Pocket Tripod a market-ready product has been an awesome ride. It's taken a year and a half of meticulous engineering and prototyping to end up with a design that can efficiently take advantage of every millimeter-cube of an extremely finite space; literally the size of a couple of credit cards.\nThe challenge was to divide this limited volume into just the right geometries, that would allow the pocket tripod to intuitively transition between forms, yet still be manufacturable. The result is a highly refined product, that matches the design and quality of the iPhone itself. \nThe pocket tripod is the only portable stand of its size that can hold the iPhone at the most extreme angles, even in portrait.\nEven though the idea of the Pocket Tripod is based on simple concepts, a lot of innovation has gone into making it a reliable and easy to use product.\nFind out more about the design of the Pocket Tripod here.\nRewards for our Backers\nDelivery Dates\nThe promised dates take into to account unexpected setbacks. We expect to deliver the rewards earlier than the promised dates.\n\nFuture iPhone Models \nWe all know Apple releases a new iPhone model every year, and a lot of us can't help ourselves but to upgrade to the newest iPhone. Rest assured, we'll be developing a Pocket Tripod compatible with the upcoming model. If you upgrade your iPhone before we deliver your reward, we'll be happy to change your reward to one that is compatible with your iPhone at the time. We will also be happy to send you upgrade modules at no cost, if you upgrade your iPhone to the iPhone 6 within a year after we deliver your reward.\n\niPhone with a Case\nWe're working on compatibility modules that will allow the Pocket Tripod to work with some of the most popular slim iPhone cases. Below is a list of cases that are showing promising potential. Following a successful funding of the project, we will be able to test the Pocket Tripod's compatibility with these cases. If we are happy with the results, and you use one of the tested and approved cases, we'll be glad to swap your reward if we haven't shipped it already, or send you a compatibility module for that case at no charge, within a year after delivery of your Pocket Tripod.\nCheck the official Pocket Tripod website to find the latest compatibility modules.\nThe Pocket Tripod\nAt the most basic level, we want to thank you by sending you a Pocket Tripod, available in your choice of black or white, both with a high quality, glossy finish, similar to all of Apple's iPhone accessories. \nLimited Edition Pocket Tripod\nThis special model will be manufactured in limited quantities, only for our trendsetting KickStarter backers, and won't be available for retail afterwards. It proudly wears the official KickStarter colours to prove you supported this project when we needed you most!\nOrigami design T-Shirt \nThe design of this T-shirt was the winner of a graphic-design contest set to create the best T-shirt design for our awesome KickStarter backers. We instantly fell in love with this design because the graphic designer - one of 9 contestants - really had a unique vision. The T-shirt's design resembles origami instructions that have been wrapped around the torso. The graphic designer was inspired by how after twisting and folding, the pocket tripod transforms from a flat card, into a beautiful three-dimensional object with a purpose.\nWe're having this T-shirt made just for you, our KickStarter backers, and we wanted to make sure that the design emphasizes the fact that you were directly responsible for the success of the Pocket Tripod.\nWe're planning to make these T-shirts in both men and women cuts. To find out exactly what size to order, click below for the:\nMen's size chart.      or      Women's size chart.\nPocket Tripod App \nSince the Pocket Tripod is meant to be compatible with the iPhone, we thought it would be an awesome idea to let iPhone users have a first-hand test-drive of the Pocket Tripod. So we decided to put the iPhone's powerful graphics processor to good use by making a free app that has a 3D model of the Pocket Tripod in it, to give you the closest experience possible to actually holding a Pocket Tripod in your hands.\nThe Pocket Tripod app lets you virtually interact with the Pocket Tripod and really get a closer look of its form and function. The app lets you transform the virtual Pocket Tripod from one shape to another, and interact with a virtual iPhone; it even lets you experiment with different colours for the Pocket Tripod. We've been working with a fantastic app developer for the past 6 months to bring this wonderful app from just an idea, to reality; and we're really proud of the results. \n\nCredits\nThreeDeePixel, development of the Pocket Tripod App\nFederico Lopez, 3D animation for KickStarter video\nMarie-Christine Daudelin, 3D animation for KickStarter video\nBijan Thornycroft, origami design T-shirt Graphic Artist\nAlexandros Batsoulis, original soundtracks for the KickStarter video\nBronze Radio Return, Special thanks for letting us to use their song, Shake!Shake!Shake! in our KickStarter video. \nPocket Tripod's Design Innovations\nDevelopment of the Pocket Tripod \nDesign Evolution: The design of the Pocket Tripod has gone through dozens of iterations and prototypes to arrive at a real-world product that embodies the original concept, and that can be manufactured. The original concept of the Pocket Tripod was to split a rectangle the size of a credit card in half from the diagonal-line, to create two right triangles, and use these two halves to hold an iPhone. From that point on, each iteration addressed solutions to enhance the product, as room for improvements were discovered. With a lot of hard work and innovative thinking, over the course of seventeen months, the Pocket Tripod evolved into a highly refined product that could be used reliably.\nDesign evolution of the Pocket Tripod shown through milestone rapid-prototypes.\nManufacturing Plan: Throughout the development of the Pocket Tripod, we\u2019ve been working hand in hand with an experienced mold manufacturer to ensure the complex geometries of the product can in fact be manufactured. Their feedback has been invaluable in guiding the evolution of the Pocket Tripod\u2019s design. To ensure that the final product works flawlessly, we\u2019re planning to start production by manufacturing a prototype mold first. A prototype mold will give us the freedom to bug-out any unforeseeable production challenges. Unlike the full production mold, its moving components function manually, which will give us the freedom to fine-tune the mold until we get the dimension just right so that it produces the perfect parts that compensate for the plastic's shrinkage. We\u2019ve arrived at a final design that works great, and can be manufactured. Our mold maker has designed the prototype mold, and is waiting for our green light to start cutting steel.\nThe prototype mold design is ready, and we're waiting on your support to start manufacturing.\n\nProduction: The development of the prototype mold is expected to take ten to twelve weeks, taking into account any unexpected hiccups. Once we\u2019re sure how to manufacture the Pocket Tripod, we\u2019ll proceed onto manufacturing the full production mold. This mold will manufacture the final product, and all it\u2019s moving parts will be automated to ensure a seamless, and reliable production. This mold will be integrated into an automated injection molding system that injects molten plastic at high pressures into the cavities of the mold. The Pocket Tripods manufactured with the full-production mold will have a glossy surface finish, similar to all of Apple\u2019s plastic iPhone accessories. Manufacturing this mold is expected to take an additional eight to ten weeks, after which we will start production of the Pocket Tripods. \n  Assembly, Packaging and Fulfillment: The Pocket Tripod is an assembly of six parts. Each part is made separately by the injection molding system, which then needs to be assembled by a worker piece by piece. Once all the pieces are put together and tested for functionality, the completed units are packaged and shipped to our warehouses. One of the best advantages of having a product that\u2019s the size of a couple of credit cards is that it can ship at a very affordable cost. To this end, we\u2019re planning to keep its packaging as minimalistic as possible. The Pocket Tripods will be tightly wrapped with a tape-like packaging that will have the product\u2019s information and graphics printed on it. The packaging will be manufactured in parallel to the Pocket Tripod's production. Each Pocket Tripod is then sent to you, our backers, in the order we receive your pledges, using USPS first class mail and parcels. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne thing that really sets the Pocket Tripod apart, is its unconventional design. Needless to say, manufacturing it won't be the easiest of tasks. The Pocket Tripod has lots of undercuts and protrusions that are meant to guide and hold its pieces within set paths. Most of these features are almost microscopic, so that they can fit within the very thin volume of the Pocket Tripod. Because of that, the Pocket Tripod will require lots of attention during manufacturing. To manufacture the Pocket Tripod we will be using an automated injection molding system, that will comprise of many moving parts, and even robotic fingers to remove the parts from the mold without scratching them. Luckily the mold will be manufactured by a veteran mold maker and his team, who has had over 35 years of mold making experience here in the US. \nWe'll be relying on their expertise to manufacture the Pocket Tripod. \n\nDue to the high manufacturing precision required for flawless functionality of the Pocket Tripod, we need to bug out any unexpected problems before investing in a fully automated mold. This is why we're planning to start manufacturing the Pocket Tripod, by first making a prototype mold. The prototype mold will give us the chance to fine tune the dimensions to get the exact performance that we need. Once we're sure about the manufacturing process, perfected through the development of this prototype mold, we'll start tooling the fully automated production mold; and as a special thank you, we're planning to send out a limited number of sample Pocket Tripods made using this prototype mold to our Backers.\n\nOne of the most challenging parts of producing the Pocket Tripod will be getting the friction of the swivel pieces just right. Too little and the iPhone will slip to the horizontal position, too much and it will be cumbersome to use. We need to hit the perfect balance, which we're planning to achieve by experimenting on the prototype mold. We'll be trying different surface finishes, tolerances and possibly coatings to make sure we know how to achieve the perfect \"feel\" before investing in the full production mold. This can only be achieved with the help of our backers. We've been able to develop this product to its current state on our own, but because of the high cost of tooling, we can't afford to go on to full production without your help. We're confident that with your help, and our hard work, we can make one of the best iPhone stands ever made.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Our second Kickstarter campaign got funded", "update_content": "Great news!

As children, the fantasy game contained in that golden plastic NES cartridge was our initiation into our own imaginations.  \nMany of us have gone on to become creatives...writers, filmmakers, game designers, painters, sculptors, illustrators, animators...and we owe our first creative compulsions to our adventure contained in that golden cartridge.\nThe game franchise continues this day to inspire and compel new generations.  With a huge library of licensed games and an unending well of quality, unlicensed media, our film will be its own narrative adventure story through which it will explore the games' far reaching influence.  It will examine the pervasive fascination for 8-bit gaming beyond nostalgia, and how it has evolved from its tiny blocks of color to a form of fine art. It will explore the roots of the innate, international appeal of this game series that bridges across cultural divides.  And for those of you who have invested thousands of hours in the world of Hyrule, it will validate your passion.\nNot only that, but it will be a playable documentary.  For those that are interested in a non-traditional way to watch a documentary, an interactive version of the documentary will be available.  It will be its own adventure game that will serve as a metaphor for the film, and through the unique virtual adventure, you will be able to find pieces of the film, bonus material, and behind the scenes footage.\nHere is a proof of concept image of the documentary/game being played on an iPad (also represented in the video for this project).  While the art style is still being discussed and assets still being created, this offers a general idea of tone and concept.\nPROOF OF CONCEPT for interactive version of film.\nWe feel that this idea will make for a unique, interactive, experience with much replay value that will be appropriate for a documentary about the influence of the Legend of Zelda.\nThank you so much for your interest and your support.\nWHAT ARE OTHERS SAYING?\nThe film has gotten some great press and support from the Zelda community.

In fact, according to employees (and huge Zelda fans) at places like Gamer's Edge, NES era games sell almost as well as current gen games.\nAdventure\nIn case it is not obvious by this point...this documentary will not be a string of youtube videos with voice over.  It will follow its own adventure (as a true film about zelda should!), through which it will weave together several personal accounts of established creatives and artists inspired by the series.  \nThe Website...game...thing...\nThe website for this project is its own 8-bit adventure in a parodic style of those games we all loved.  The navigation for the website IS the game itself.  Many people have played and enjoyed the project, however in order to update and improve, we have taken it down for the duration of the Kickstarter Campaign.  It should be live again the first week of June.\nThe Teaser Trailer Music\nThe teaser trailer music was composed specifically for this trailer.  Its outline is based on the common chord progression that opens the original game's main theme, and its melodies and musical motifs are playfully derivative or reminiscent of those found in the rest of the game, reworked into a nostalgic musical homage.  Here it is without the voice over or interview clips from the trailer.  Enjoy!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf we do reach our goal, we will be traveling far and wide.

Portal: Lab Rat will run approximately 30-minutes or more and will feature suspense, mystery, action and a bit of humor, all in an enticing and believable Portal universe.  Much of the shoot will take place at The YouTube Space LA, on one of the massive sound stages they have generously donated. When finished, Portal: Lab Rat will be uploaded to youtube for the whole world to enjoy!\nVGHS season 2, one of the most successful kickstarter film/video projects of all time was also filmed here at the YouTube Space LA.\nThe Story\nFor Those Familiar with the Video Game Portal\nThis movie explores the story of Chell and her adventures in solving the puzzling test chambers of Aperture Science, in order to satisfy the test-happy, maniacal A.I. GLaDOS, who's running them.  This movie also explores the story of the official Portal 2: Lab Rat comic released by Valve which serves as a tie-in comic for the events between Portal and Portal 2. Essentially, the storyline of the movie is split between two characters, Chell and Doug Rattmann from the Lab Rat comic, (the man behind the mysterious writings on the walls in Portal, most notably \"the cake is a lie\") and follows them as they both discover the hidden intentions of the dangerous A.I., GLaDOS. Through a series of events, their fates become intertwined and Doug Rattmann finds that he must do all in his power to ensure that Chell defeats GLaDOS. This is the untold story of Chell's mysterious beginnings, as well as the infamous scientists of Aperture Science.  This movie will explore the world of Portal in a way that no one ever has before.  The majority of fan films out there are humor based, or just too light in their story.  We are really striving to make a film that can be watched and enjoyed by all audiences of every age; a film with heart, soul, and mystery.\n\"The Discovery\" Original Concept Art by Florian Moncomble\nThis concept piece shows Chell during her initial testing phase. She is not really outside, but rather in a simulated environment, deep in the underground chasms of Aperture Science. Chell must use her wit and tenacity to solve this puzzle, constructed for her by GLaDOS.\nFor Those NOT Familiar with the Video Game Portal\nBased on the widely-celebrated video game Portal, this movie tells the story of a young girl named Chell (the main protagonist from the game) who is woken up from a sleep-like stasis deep inside a mysterious underground facility in order to undergo a phase of dangerous scientific tests constructed by a rogue A.I. named GLaDOS, who has seized control over the entire facility.  The underground chambers and empty rooms Chell now roams were once home to Aperture Science: a controversial, scientific research company that was known for experimental research in the areas of teleportation and portal technology. In a race for government funding, Aperture Science built GLaDOS with the intention of giving her control over testing new scientific technology. In an extreme case of science gone wrong, GLaDOS turns rogue upon activation, and murders most of the scientists and employees who worked there, allowing her to nestle into a comfortable technocratic dictatorship, where she wields ultimate control of the facility.  This movie also tells the story of Doug Rattmann, a former Aperture Science employee who was one of the very few to survive the deadly A.I. takeover of the facility, and whose fate would be intertwined with that of Chell. This movie is based on the Portal 2: Lab Rat comic released by the creators of Portal.\n\"Doug and GLaDOS\" Original Concept Art by Nick Gonzalez\nThis concept piece illustrates the uncertainty of Doug regarding new A.I. technology being developed at Aperture Science.  Here we see GLaDOS spying on Doug from a far; foreshadowing the dangerous A.I. takeover Doug will experience but ultimately survive.\nConcept and Design\nThe movie will contain robots, characters, items, and various elements from the game that will implemented into the story.  We have begun conceptualizing and designing these things already and will continue to do so.  Here are some examples.\n\"Rocket Turret\" Original Concept Art by Mikhail Borulko\nHere is a concept for a rocket turret we are planning to have in the movie. It is a blend of the earlier rocket turret from Portal and some new innovative designs to make it unique as well as to show the progression of GLaDOS's \"scientific\" inventions over time.\n\"Rocket Turret\" Original Concept Art by Mikhail Borulko\nThe Portal 2: Lab Rat Comic\nAs mentioned earlier, Valve released a comic to tie in the narrative of Portal with its sequel, Portal 2, which we highly recommend reading.  The comic was a huge inspiration for us to make this movie because it opened up parts of the world of Portal never before seen, and allowed for a more expansive storyline with a slew of new characters and components of the story for us to work with.  The following are the first few pages of the comic, and then a link to see the rest.\nRead the rest...\nAren't There Already Portal Fan Films Out There?  What Makes You So Different?\nMany of the Portal fan films on YouTube are well made and entertaining, but they are mostly centered around the comedic side of Portal, with a sort of mockery of the serious aspect of the game. And when they are serious, they are just WAY too short, and have minimal dialogue and story.  While all this is fine, we think most Portal fans deep down long for a Portal movie, including us.  And while there have been talks among people like JJ Abrams and Gabe Newell about a big-budget Portal movie, the reality of one actually happening is still a ways off, or maybe even non-existent.  On top of that you will have to pay to see it.  With Portal: Lab Rat, we will deliver a cinematic, serious, and epic Portal movie, totally free to watch and enjoy.  \nHere is a link to our YouTube channel where you can see our previous work, youtube.com/ColinandConnor (links to our films at the bottom of the page too).  We tend to be quite unique in the YouTube-sphere, not only with the cinematic look and feel of our content, but also the length.  Last Fall we released a 45-minute, action packed, zombie film based on Valve's Left 4 Dead game, which remains one of the longest fan films on YouTube, receiving fantastic reviews and close to 2 million views (pretty good for a 45 minute film on YouTube!), and we did it on a skeleton budget.  We are strong advocates of bringing professional-looking, cinematic content to YouTube, with great storytelling, which we strive to do with every film we make.  We fervently believe in quality over quantity, and with just a quick look at our YouTube channel, you will see we aren't joking.\nWhat About Copyright?\nWe are not affiliated in any way with Portal or Valve (the creators of Portal) as this movie is 100% fan made and thus, made for fans!  However,  Valve strongly encourages their fans to create movies and other content using their material such as stories, characters, models, music, etc.  They have released several amazing tools to do so, one being Source Filmmaker.  To be clear, we are NOT selling the movie in any way; it will be uploaded to the internet where anyone can watch it for free.  Valve has an official policy when it comes to stuff like this so give it a read if you are unsure!

However, it will only be available on DVD/Blu-Ray or any other form through this Kickstarter so make sure you grab a copy!\nWhy We are Taking on this Project, and What We Hope to Accomplish\nPlaying Portal for the first time was really an incredible experience. It was one of the most unique, thought-provoking and terrifying games we have ever played. As filmmakers, we believe Portal has enormous potential as a serious film; one with an encompassing story that has heart and purpose which is always at the center of what we do.  We truly believe in and aspire to give the online community top-quality, cinematic content with great storytelling and a Portalfilm has always been one of our dream projects.  We really couldn't be more excited to start production on Portal: Lab Rat!\nWhere is My Money Going to?\nThat's a great question.  For a production of this scale, the money will go towards many things.  These essentials include: camera and equipment rentals, locations, custom props, set construction, actors, costuming, and visual effects.  Even the little things add up quickly, like production insurance, makeup, etc.  Portal is also intricately themed, meaning many of the things you will see in the movie will have to be custom produced.  All these things add up, but they make for a professional quality film.\nWho Are We?\nWe are Colin and Connor McGuire, two brothers who write, direct and produce films together!  We previously wrote, directed and produced Left 4 Dead - The Movie, a 3-part movie totaling over an hour long, inspired and based on Valve's zombie game Left 4 Dead.  We uploaded Left 4 Dead - The Movie to our YouTube channel and since, the film has received over 16 million views worldwide.  We also run a YouTube channel, youtube.com/ColinandConnor, where we upload our films and where Portal: Lab Rat will be uploaded so be sure to check it out!  We currently have around 20 million views and 115,000 subscribers to our channel!\nUs and the cast on the set of Left 4 Dead\nHere we are featured on the the front page of The Californian\nHere is some of our work!\nand our most recent one", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny production of this size, especially one placed in the Portal universe comes with a plethora of risks and challenges.

We will be thoroughly dedicated to ensuring the integrity of our vision, and that it will hold up as a quality piece of entertainment.

Making something digitally that need to feel, flex, and behave a certain way is not easy. I will explain how I have researched materials, and taken advantage of material properties to create products that benefit directly from the material in use.\n3) Learn from my mistakes and successes. This is not the first product I have prototyped in 3D, so I have definitely made mistakes and learned from them along the way. I can show some models that have and haven't worked in the past and what good practices are for a successful/working prototype.\n4) Sending a model to print. I would love for you to print your very first shapeways print with me. If you are not familiar with any 3D modeling software, we will use the free Sketchup and send a model to shapeways to print.\n5) Moving beyond prototypes. Is 3D printing the end goal? Probably not, so here is an overview of different prototype methods as well as manufacturing methods. They each have their pros and cons.\nI don't plan to teach you how to use a piece of software, since software changes frequently, and I strongly believe learning is about the process and getting to be familiar with a new medium. I am excited to give a personal look into the process and share some valuable lessons I have learned along the way.

Thank you! Keep up the support and let's hit our next goal soon!\nWait... What are Stretch Goals?\nStretch goals are extra content that we can accomplish if the funding goals are met. For instance, if we hit 200,000, then we will have enough resources to implement a 4 player battle mode! It\u2019s not to say we will won\u2019t see these features in the future some time (don\u2019t be too worried! ), but if we reach the stretch goals, we can promise them with confidence! Here is a description of the stretch goals:\nMusic Player\nSound Test! Adds an in-game music player that lets you listen to all of your favorite Shovel Knight tunes. Collect song scrolls in the levels and take them to the bard, who will play them for you with perfect accuracy! We might even have some special, hidden songs... You\u2019ll also be able to hear all the SFX samples, but we don\u2019t know how the bard does that.\nAchievements\nWe tend to like achievements because they change the way you play the game! This stretch goal will add a bevy of achievements to ALL VERSIONS of the game.  These aren\u2019t just going to be stock achievements; they will be creative and wonderful. Can you beat Shovel Knight without losing a life? Prove it!\nNew Game Plus\nStart the game over with your weapons and items fully upgraded. However\u2026 enemies are going to be tougher, resources more scarce, and new challenges may arise. With new game plus, it\u2019s like a whole new game! Kind of! +!\nPlayable Boss Knight\nPlay the full game as a member of the Order of No Quarter! If we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019ll hold a vote to see who it will be. Expect the game to play differently! For example, Propeller Knight could have the ability to hover for short distances, but would be a low health \u2018glass cannon\u2019 of sorts. Even the story and dialog will change a little bit to reflect the changes!\nLinux / Mac Versions\nWant to play Shovel Knight on your weirdo computer? Many folks have asked for Linux and Mac versions. We hope to support Mac and Linux either way, but this goal makes it happen for sure, and in a more timely fashion (hopefully in 2013!).\nGender Swap Mode!\nWe want Shovel Knight to be enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages, everywhere. With this mode, the main characters\u2019 genders will be swapped, giving us a chance to do it before the internet has a chance to. The story will also change a bit to reflect the changes. Can you defeat the Evil Enchanter?\nChallenge Mode\nAdds a comprehensive batch of challenge rooms  to Shovel Knight. In this mode, Shovel Knight will be tasked with a variety of mini-quests like \u201cdefeat all the enemies!\u201d or \u201creach the goal in time!\u201d. Expect things like pacifism challenges and other rules-benders\u2026 and expect some tough-as-nails challenges too!\n4 Player Battle Mode!*\nWe\u2019ve talked a ton about multiplayer for Shovel Knight. While full-on multiplayer is out of the scope of this project, we could totally do 4 player couch co-op battles! Imagine playing as Shovel Knight ( or any of the extra playable knights ) and duking it out in the arena! Several modes would be ideal:\n\u00b7         Cash collecting, where you fight for treasure that appears in the level. Knock your buddy to make gems fall out and collect them!\n\u00b7         Racing, where all players would have to make their way to the end of a stage\n\u00b7         Last man standing, where the only goal is to slash mercilessly\u2026 to the bitter end!\n*This is couch co-op only, not online. We hope to bring this feature to all platforms, but the 3DS isn\u2019t guaranteed because multiplayer is Wi-Fi only.\nPHYSICAL.ACTUAL.REAL.BOX.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, then we will make a physical box of the game, which will be mailed free to backers pledging at the $50 tier and above! Plus, ALL backers will receive the digital version, to print or view at your leisure. NOTE: This box art is only a mockup. We might have a surprise or two for the final box art! Johnny Vila, your prayers have been answered :P\n3rd Playable Boss Knight!\nCall this goal unoriginal, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re too excited to play as another boss knight! Let\u2019s get to this pledge level and have one more knight (who will be chosen by the community) make the cut! Rally! For the Order of No Quarter!\nAll Bosses Playable in Battle Mode!!\nIf we reach this goal, the entire Order of No Quarter (including the Enchantress herself!) will step into Battle Mode, for the ultimate battle royale. Wild new combat styles abound! Play as your under-appreciated favorite and beat up the more popular knights that got voted into the main campaign!\nShovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old that may remind you of Mega Man, Castlevania, or Dark Souls! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost.\nIf you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, and real heart\u2026 Shovel Knight is for you! If you don\u2019t, then what? How could you not be into that stuff? Keep reading, you\u2019ll come around!\nEvery great game needs a great set of baddies, and Shovel Knight\u2019s are a doozy. Shovel Knight\u2019s Nemesis is The Enchantress, a mysterious and powerful conjurer. Her Order of No Quarter has swept over the land, stationed in locations Shovel Knight is sure to visit. In order to get to the Enchantress, he\u2019s gonna have to beat them all!\nWe love themed bosses and themed levels; this love is on full display in Shovel Knight! Each knight in the Order has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality. These epic boss battles are really going to shine! We already love our villainous bunch, so let us share them with you.\nThis is Polar Knight: the Sabretooth to Shovel Knight\u2019s Wolverine. He\u2019s guarding a stranded ship in the frozen south. Titanic and terrible, he is the largest and most brutish of the Order of No Quarter. Some time in the past, Shovel Knight and Polar Knight have crossed Shovels before...\n\u2022 Pros: Wields Snow Shovel, Doesn't feel cold but is quite considerate!\n\u2022 Cons: Annoying laugh ( it's like water torture )!\nAnd Propeller Knight! He commands the Enchantress' flying machine with the cocksure attitude of a sky pirate! With his Heli-Helmet, he can zoom short distances with ease. Shovel Knight encounters Propeller Knight on top of the aircraft as it zooms through the sky; earth fights against air in a true battle of elements!\n\u2022 Pros: Talented Fencer, Mechanical Heli-Helmet, Debonair!\n\u2022 Cons: Arrogance, Lightweight, Outrageous Accent!\nSometimes, the bomb is mightier than the sword. Deep in the recesses of his alchemical lab, Plague Knight perfects concoctions both poisonous and explosive. Toxin, disease, and death are his playgrounds. Even his comrades give Plague Knight a wide berth, because he spreads more than just the common cold. With an array of mysterious and magical bottles at his side, Plague Knight could be considered the black sheep of The Order of No Quarter.\nPros: Maniacal scientific mind, fearlessness bordering on recklessness\nCons: Physically weak, short stature, shy at parties\nMole Knight... the shovel may rule the confines of man-made gardens, but in the wild, the titan of tunneling is the mole! Mole Knight embraces this truth wholeheartedly. With his modified drop-forged armored claws, he mockingly tears through the earth with brute strength! Mole Knight calls the subterranean Lost City his home... an ancient abandoned metropolis. Shovel Knight must pass through the Lost City, but chances are slim he won\u2019t be challenged to see who is truly the master of digging.\nPros: Great eyesight, shrewd, high endurance\nCons: Obsessive personality, gets sweaty in armor\nTinker Knight! Some knights love rushing into the glory of battle, ready to crush the skulls of their enemies! Tinker Knight is not one of those knights. He does his fighting before the battle begins, laboring on diabolical devices that do his work for him. The wrench is the tool of his trade, doubling as an engineering device and a melee weapon. Some are quick to dismiss Tinker Knight\u2019s lethality... usually just before falling victim to one of his mechanical monstrosities!\nPros: Gregarious demeanor, hard worker\nCons: Rough hands, works long hours, always out to prove himself\nWe\u2019re going to be sharing more of the Order of No Quarter as the Kickstarter proceeds, so check in often!\nShovel Knight is rendered in a pumped-up 8-bit style. We are adhering to the NES color palette, but adding many modern touches. For example, We have tons of scrolling background layers, giving a real illusion of depth.\nOur pixel animation and attention to detail is top-notch. Every character, even minor foes like these wizards, have painstakingly crafted animations and personalities.\nDetailed, living backgrounds and animation! Big, beautiful pixels! Just look at the screens!! With Shovel Knight, we are developing a next-gen 8 bit game!\nLike all of our favorite games, Shovel Knight has been designed gameplay first! We are especially dedicated to precise control. Pixel-perfect hit boxes, toenail jumps, and mobility mastery are our obsession. That wonderfully elusive 'feel' of great control.\nWhen thinking of the initial concept, we started by saying \u201cwhat if we built a whole game around a downward sword thrust? It would be great to sink into dirt, attack foes by stabbing from above, and maybe even bounce on hard ground! Ok, digging as a major mechanic\u2026 how about it\u2019s a shovel instead of a sword? That way, we can have him use the flat blade of the spade to flip things over and slash!\u201d\nFrom that gameplay concept sprung all of the ideas for Shovel Knight. We've learned from games like Mother 3 that a game becomes much stronger when graphics, story and tone work together to unify the gameplay experience!\nGreat music is central to great games, so it\u2019s with incredible excitement that we can announce that Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman is composing the soundtrack for Shovel Knight! For those of you who don\u2019t know, Jake is one of the most talented audio guys in the game biz, contributing on games from Mighty Switch Force to Contra 4 to Shantae. His most recent work on Double Dragon Neon has garnered as much praise as the game itself!\nNugget love\nTrue to our sense of collaboration, our team likes to involve audio early and often in development. For Shovel Knight\u2019s music, we\u2019re taking an NES+ style approach, adding sound channels and detail for a fuller sound that\u2019s still authentic. In addition to the main theme highlighted in the trailer, check out the track written for Pridemoor Keep, the level we\u2019ll be debuting at PAX!\nIf you liked that, you should just go listen to everything on his website (virt.bandcamp.com) because it\u2019s amazing. And check out the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack Album backer reward below! WE LOVE JAKE! \nYacht Club Games is an independent game developer started in 2011 by Sean Velasco and a crew from WayForward. We are a fun-loving bunch of gaming geniuses who have dedicated our lives to video games ever since we saw our first pixels. However, our serious and solemn goal is to make really awesome original games that fuse modern and retro sensibilities, and we have the pedigree to prove it! Our team is comprised of top talent that has worked on some amazing titles, including Contra 4, A Boy and His Blob, Thor: God of Thunder, Mighty Milky Way, BloodRayne Betrayal, and most recently, Double Dragon Neon.This is our maiden project as Yacht Club Games, which means we are determined to impress.\nSo what are we all about? We want to create fun and challenging gameplay. We want to both tug at your heartstrings and delight you with levity and charm. We want to make games that you play together with friends and family. Most of all, we want to give everyone the same collective types of game experiences that have defined our generation. It\u2019s such an exciting time to be a fan of games; the industry is experiencing a renaissance and creativity is flourishing. We are so, so excited to develop games that we love, in hopes that you love them too!\nShovel Knight is currently nearing the end of preproduction. This means that the game design has been written, the main character designs and story have been created, and we have a plan for moving forward. We have an early build of the game that proves out our game mechanics and technology; you can see some footage in the trailer and we'll also be at PAX East!\nHowever, many things are still up in the air. Enemies and objects need to be designed and drawn. Audio, Animation, and Backgrounds need to be crafted. Lastly, we need to polish everything to a mirror sheen. Basically, we have what you saw in the video. Now we need to make the whole game.\nSo, we think this is a great time in the process to involve the community. We have a skeleton to build on, but we want you to be the meat!\nVideo games are expensive and time-consuming to develop, so the usual way to get one made is to acquire funding from a publisher. We have had great partnerships with publishers in the past. However, working with a publisher has its drawbacks; you are beholden to them, and they are generally risk averse. We wanted to go to the community, because Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where fun and quality are always the top priorities.\nWe believe in Shovel Knight. We know that the final game is going to be great. We\u2019re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We\u2019ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it\u2019s not enough to finish the game. In order to make Shovel Knight a reality, we need you!\nWe have amazing rewards that we are as excited to give out as we are to make! Check \u2018em out below!\nThe Game!\nGet a digital PC copy ( PC, LINUX, MAC, STEAM ) of Shovel Knight, hot off the digital presses! Digital!\nAlso, ALL pledge levels $15 and above will be able to choose on which platform they want their stalwart blue hero!!!\nInstruction Booklet\nThe final Instruction book will have illustrations, not sketches!\nAh, the Instruction Booklet\u2026 the comfort food of books. We still have a few of our favorites, the pages worn and cramped with notes. Together with you, we can bring the lost art of instruction booklets back to the limelight! The Shovel Knight Instruction Booklet is full of important safety information, awesome character art, enemy lists, hints, and space for notes. We are taking the utmost care to make sure that these booklets are true to their predecessors, right down to the way they smell.\nWe want the kids of today to feel the excitement of reading the booklet in eager anticipation of the game\u2019s release, so we are going to send you the booklet FIRST, so you can read it and reread it, and go crazy with anticipation!\nShovel Knight Coffee Table Book\nThis is a Book of the Game! The goal is to make something fun and funny, an entertaining compendium of the whole Shovel Knight production. Design Discussions and sketches! Concept Art and Illustrations! Game Maps, pixel animation sequences, and work-in-progress versions of everything! As we develop Shovel Knight, we\u2019ll be chronicling the process and we want to put it all here on display. As a crazy indie startup, you know there is going to be a lot of juicy stuff!\nShovel Knight Official Soundtrack\nWe already told you how awesome Jake Kaufman's music is. Hopefully you are thinking that Shovel Knight is looking pretty awesome too. Well, now you can own the combined awesome with this pressing of the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack! Laid delicately into a bejeweled case, this CD and accompanying liner notes will be adorned lovingly with customized art. This is what you want. It\u2019s what we want! It\u2019s what we all want!!\nOfficial Shovel Knight Dirt Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is the best product photo ever, bwahaha!\nOwn a real piece of the Shovel Knight Saga! At this reward level, we will hand-sign and deliver a handsome, wax-sealed envelope filled with Official Shovel Knight Dirt. We have obtained dirt ( at no small expense, mind you! ) from each area of Shovel Knight\u2019s Kingdom; Gearwork Dirt from the base of the Clockwork Tower, Besmirched Dirt from the Village of Plague, and more! The dirt you receive will be chosen at random, but trust us when we say that all of the dirt is very special. Get it fast, because when it runs out, it\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not made out of dirt here!\nDesign Hangouts\nNow you can take part in our design process! We will be broadcasting on a private video channel available only to our beloved Kickstarter backers! You can be a fly on the wall and listen to us as we hash out the finer details of the design and work through problems, or you can jump in and tell us what to do! There is no guarantee we will listen, but many can attest to our receptiveness to ridiculous ideas. Budding game designers, armchair directors, and trolls can all have lots of fun!\nOriginal Concept Art / Game Design Card\nSuper Design Index Cards!\nThe Yacht Club loves index cards: we use them to quickly communicate ideas! Puzzle setups, boss patterns, and sketches of new enemies; they are hastily scribbled onto cards and passed around! It\u2019s completely awesome, and it also means that by the end of a project, we have a lot of really cool index cards lying around. We are going to send you an original one of these cards! You can specify if you want a design card or an art card. Maybe you\u2019ll get the very first sketch of an enemy that's in the final game!\nYour Likeness In the Game\nAppease your ego by having us painstakingly hand-craft a pixel version of you, which will appear somewhere in Shovel Knight. Send us a photo and we will recreate you in 8-bits and immortalize you forever\u2026 but where will you appear in the game? We know where we are going to put you, but it\u2019s a secret for now!\nSuperDeluxe Canvas Poster Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is a really super high-quality 24x36 poster, signed by the team and sent to you. Suitable for framing ( you had better frame it! ), this poster will feature the classiest art we have by the end of the project.\nDirector For A Day!!\nAs Director for a day, you will get to design a major character, boss, midboss, or scenario. We\u2019ll take you through the whole process from conception to completion, helping massage your design into the game with probably hilarious results! Check out the details below! NOTE: ( Actual implementation time may be longer than one day )\nYacht Club Sleepover!\nCome to sunny Southern California ( or if you are already here, just drive over to us ) to meet and spend the day with the Yacht Club! We\u2019ll do a studio tour, get a fancy meal (or drive-through if you don\u2019t have a collared shirt, but you can order whatever you want and we'll get like a whole extra bag of hot sauce), and then go back and play games for as long as we can stay up! Maybe we could also wear our jammies and talk about who we have a crush on! Oh, or if you would rather not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026 we\u2019ll take our cues from you I guess.\nYacht Party with the Yacht Club\nIf there is anything the Yacht Club loves as much as making games, it\u2019s partying hard to celebrate a game launch. At this reward level, you will join us in SoCal with other Yacht Club superfriends on an hours-long voyage in celebration of Shovel Knight\u2019s release! All of this is going to be on a Real Yacht on the Real Ocean, which we will be renting for the occasion ( the yacht, not the ocean ).\nListen as we regale you with tales of the game dev trenches! Stumble about as you try to get your sea legs! Sing karaoke and be merry, because tonight, my friend, we are all superstars!\nDid I mention our special musical guest Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman, who is going to play live?\nIt\u2019s gonna be epic as hell. You should totally come.\nFollow us on Facebook! If you'd like to support us, liking and sharing us would be very appreciated!\nFollow us on Twitter! We always have something dumb to say!\nWatch our YouTubes! New videos and other excitement will be posted here.\nHelp us get on Steam! We need your votes!\nLastly, if you want to reach out to us for ANYTHING, hit us up at: kickstarter@yachtclubgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking great video games is hard. Like, really hard! Art, design, and technology have to be blended seamlessly to create a cohesive experience. On top of that, it takes time to iterate and expand on ideas. There is a reason lots of awesome games take forever to come out!\n The biggest risk is that Shovel Knight would take longer than anticipated. If production were to go late, cash would be the biggest problem. If catastrophe truly struck, our backup plan would be to pool our remaining funds and partner with venture capitalist or publisher to get the game done. This game is our livelihood, so we will do whatever it takes!\n However, perish the thought of failure!

The look and feel of this game will be strikingly beautiful and at the same time mysterious and terrifying. The ocean, especially a million years in the future, is the perfect setting for a unique game play experience.\nThe Big Blue is a new aquatic action adventure game from the team that created Ecco the Dolphin.\nVisuals\nOur goal is to create the most beautiful water and lighting effects ever seen. Our team has a lot of experience in this area and we plan to push it to the limit. \nUsing Artificial-life technologies, the Big Blue will be teaming with life.  Swarming and flocking behaviors will give the ocean a hyper realistic, living feel. Everything in the Big Blue will be alive and reactive. \nAnimation\nUsing procedural animation system the creatures of the Big Blue will be very lifelike. The movements through the water, and even above the surface, will be perfect and super realistic. \nMusic & Sound\nAt the very heart of the concept, the Big Blue is all about sound and music. The music is not just an accompaniment to the visuals and gameplay, but is at the heart of the experience. To this end we are creating a specialized sound system, a musical engine that will run continuously as you play the game. Parameters and player's interactions will drive music and keep it fluid and in emotional context with the visuals and events that occur in the game. \nThe Music\nSpencer Nilsen will team up with Bear McCreary (Walking Dead, Battlestar Galactica) to compose the Big Blue's musical score. We couldn\u2019t get Bear for the video but he had this to say:\n\"Spencer Nilsen's groundbreaking videogame scores not only changed the industry, but also my idea of what videogame music could be when I was a kid. His scores were years ahead of their time and their influence can be heard in all the most popular videogame scores of today, especially the ones I composed! I'm thrilled to collaborate with him on Ed Annunziata's exciting new project, The Big Blue, and look forward to combining our unique musical sensibilities into one cohesive musical vision.\"\nOriginal sound track downloads and extended, boxed CD collections will be available to backers as a reward for helping us make this game.\nThe Game\nThe Big Blue is a massive adventure game. The basic game play involves the following:\nExploration\nQuests\nCollection and spawning of life forms \nAction puzzle solving\n\nThe Big Blue will be a highly unique play experience and will include these unique game play features:\nAll Creatures are controllable\nControl multiple creatures at the same time (like a swarm)\nAquascape and populate your own small sea\nBreed and multiply creatures to be used for various purposes (like quest assistance) \n\nThe world\nThe world of the Big Blue is vast, alive, beautiful but at the same time alien. The deeper you go the darker it gets.   The Big Blue is an immense environment to explore. \nGameplay\nThe moment-to-moment gameplay will be action oriented. Some creatures will be very fast, and can breach the surface like the dolphins. Some can swim very deep and have no need to surface for air. Choosing the right creature for the right quest will be critical.\nCreatures\nThe world of the Big Blue takes place a million years in the future. This futuristic time frame allows new creatures to evolve. A key member of the Big Blue team is Jon Berg, who designed the walkers in the Empire Strikes Back, and the chessboard creatures from the original Star Wars.\nJon will design our BIG creatures, such as the Leviathans, sea dragons, and evil Gyreforms. We are very lucky that he is interested in working on this project. Here are a few creatures that we are designing:\nSingers (Sea Mammals)\nThese are dolphins, killer whales, and whales. These creatures are our our playable characters and Non-Playable characters.\nLeviathans\nLeviathans are massive creatures, which can only be described as sea monsters. In the world of the Big Blue nothing is bigger than a Leviathan, which make blue whales of today look like minnows.\nSea-Dragons\nSea Dragons are a new species of creature. They are fast and able to fly above the surface for short distances. Sea Dragons are extremely intelligent and are able to swim to depths that no other creature can. Sea Dragons are very rare and elusive. You may play the big blue for months and never see one. If you do, beware, they could be deadly.\nGyreforms\nGyreforms are strange malignant life forms that evolved from the accumulation of plastic trash in the pacific gyre.  Since it evolved from plastic, this parasitic life form is NOT organic.\nCreature-Cards\nAll creatures are controllable in the Big Blue, and many can be spawned as pets or helpers. The game will feature a system that allows alphanumeric codes to share creatures outside of the game. \nCreature-Cards allow players to collect creatures and share and trade with their friends.  Some creatures will be common, some rare, and some extremely rare. For example white dolphins will be extremely rare, because they will only be available to KS contributors. \nStretch Goals\nIf we exceed our goal by 50% the game will get multiplayer, cooperative game play.  Players will be able to share environments, creatures, and complete quests as teams.\nEarth Day 2014\nThe Big Blue will launch April 22, 2014. Our backers will get early previews, and insider information during the development of the game. This gives us just over a year for development. There will be many subsequent updates to the game. This will lead the Big Blue to support multiplayer and then finally a massively multiplayer game.\n4/22/2014\nPlatforms: Where you can play the Big Blue?\nThe Big Blue is being developed in Unity. A huge benefit of using Unity is that we can compile to different platforms. The Big Blue will run on Mac, Windows, Linux, and iOS and Android platforms. \nBig Blue: Pocket Ocean\nOnce we are done with the first version of the game I will convince Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to embrace the game. We want the Big Blue everywhere.\nCheck out the Prototype\nWe have a VERY early prototype that you can check out now.  Click the link below to go to the Big Blue page.   Remember this early stuff but its just a taste of what you can expect:\nBig Blue Prototype\nThe Team\nWe have the best game programmers and 3D artists in the world.  All our team members have years of game making experience.  We know how to work together well and we know how to make games.  The Big Blue will take 10 people a year to make.  It's an enormous amount of work but its our dream project.   \nHere are the key people on the team:\nEd Annunziata (me)\nEd Annunziata\nI have been making games professionally for 20 years. As a game producer and designer, my title list is long and with many are original titles. My passion is to create original games with original play mechanics. This is what gets me up in the morning and pushes me through the day.\nI am extremely lucky to have an excellent team. After 20 years most of the original Ecco the Dolphin team still works with me to this day.\nLaszlo Szenttornyai\nLaszlo Szenttornyai has been my partner on more than a dozen games, including the Ecco games. Laszlo is a genius at turning my crazy ideas into implementable development plans. He decides all the technical approaches of the features and is the expert with tools and server side development. I consider Laszlo my better half in creating games and I affectionately refer to him as the Doctor House of programming.\nSpencer Nilsen\nSpencer Nilsen, (my brother of another mother), knows how to affect emotion during game play. Did you ever notice how easy it is for games to drive aggressive feelings? Spencer helps us to drive OTHER feelings such as awe, wonder, and love. Just like what he composed and produced with the Ecco games, the Big Blue will be epic with feelings that go beyond just aggression.\nJon Berg\nJon Berg, Creature designer - His approach to creature design and animation is genius. With nature as his Master Teacher, Jon thinks about how a creature evolved, lives, moves and what it does to fulfill its function. He uses all that to inspire the design of a living creature. Jon understands the spark that fires the imagination as he did when he brought the Imperial Walkers to earthshaking life in the  Empires Strikes Back. Jon will design our Leviathans and Sea-Dragons.\nProud to Kick it Forward", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks:\nBelow are the risks as I see them and how I feel confident that they are mitigated. \n\nForce Majore \nThe Big Blue will require more than 10 people working full time for a year. This is a big window of time for unforeseeable problems to occur. This is mitigated by the fact that we are a veteran team of professional game developers, with an excellent track record, we have created many games and have always been able to apply our creativity to problem solving. \n\nRisk of No Fun\nOften playing underwater games it is easy to get lost, or not know what to do next. We have to be very careful to construct the game so that this doesn't happen. The game has to fun and satisfying. We will involve many people to play test throughout development to help keep us on the path to fun. All backers will be invited to join our private community so we will have captive testers and a constant source of \"real people\" feedback. \n\nAn Epic Story that no one cares about\nFrom a story telling perspective we are taking a big risk with the Big Blue. This story has almost NOTHING to do with humans. This is a story about a civilization of sea creatures, NOT about humans. 99.9999% of our human stories are about other humans. The Big Blue's story is not about us. I hope we can make the story unfold in a way that players really care about the characters and the events that happen in the game. I've been thinking about this story for almost 20 years and in my heart I believe people will care, but I have to build this game to find out for sure. \n\nRunning out of Money\nIt may seem like this project is expensive but it isn't. It takes a lot of time and people to make a game like the Big Blue. Since there are subjective elements involved (like fun) it is sometimes hard to predict how much funding would be required to make the game just right. Our experience in making games will help control this risk. The Big Blue will never be \"done,\" it will continue to be developed and evolve over time. Our goal is to make the first version fun and satisfying enough for the game to start paying for itself. The money that we are asking for is to prime the pump. Once the game is born, I am confident it will live on.\n\n\nMy Promises\nI realize that I am asking for a lot of money and a lot of faith in me and my team. I've been thinking about how I can put into words that you can trust me to make this game great. All I can say is that the creation of games is my life. If I won a lottery for half a million dollars I would make this game. This is where my passion is. I promise you that every effort be made to make the Big Blue great, and it will be done with love and inspiration. \n\nI have made games all my adult life. Ronald Reagan was president when I made my first game for the Atari 800 computer. I started out programming then grew into the role of designer and producer. I have many games to my credit, most of my own invention, like Ecco the Dolphin. I consider computer games an art form. When I dream them up and find a way to develop them, they fill my life, my thoughts, and imagination. I always, always, approach the process of making the games with inspiration, confidence, and tenacity. \n\nAnother promise I'll make is that I will share with you, the backers of the Big Blue, the entire development process. I don't want to waste any energy on a \"making of\" video, but I'll give you a front row seat so you can be involved along the way. If you back the Big Blue you will be a part of it's genesis, and when it is born, and lives on, you will be proud of it, like me.\n\nI believe the Big Blue will be all that I promise it will be, if you believe.\n\nThanks for your support, and I'll see you in the ocean!

Vaccarino and Rio Grande Games. I am not affiliated with either and this project is completely unofficial. This project is not endorsed by them or any of the rights-holders or trademark-holders.  I am just a broke dude who wants to make a cool case for Dominion.\nIf funding is successful, I will create the unsleeved and sleeved versions of the case. \nI have designs for two versions of the case: one for unsleeved cards and one for sleeved cards (I tested it with a few different types of sleeves).  Both versions of the case will be manufactured in the US and have the following features:\nLow-cut foam interior with individual slots for every card in the game\nSoft-sided case with a zipper on three sides\nSlots for game accessories (player mats and game tokens)\nLearn more about how I came up with the design for the Dominion case by viewing the posts on my site.\nTwo Parts to the Dominion Case\nThe Unofficial Dominion Card Case has two main components: the internal foam, which has slots for the Dominion cards, and the outer case, which holds the foam/cards.\nThe foam is the main feature as it houses and organizes all of the Dominion cards.  It has been designed, prototyped, and tested.  It may need a few refinements, but this is near completion.\n3D render of the internal foam piece that stores the Dominion cards\nThe case is prototyped and just needs a few refinements.  I would like to get feedback from the backers about this.  The case will also have a pocket that will fit the instruction manuals as well as the Dominion Card Caddy from Boardcrafting.\nThe soft-sided case that houses the foam\nThe foam interior inside of the case, filled with Dominion cards. Sweet.\nThe first sample of the Dominion Case\nWeight test: 30+ pounds resting on top of the case. The cards were undamaged.\nLayout Diagrams\nYou can view some vectorized-PDFs of each case, which show a top-down view of the case's interior.

In addition, if you decide to sleeve your cards, they will no longer fit it the original box. \nOne thing I liked about the original boxes was that there was enough spacing between the cards to pull out a stack of them with two fingers. Many of the storage solutions I found online just tried to condense all the cards into a small case, which is great for transportation, but not for setup and gameplay.\nFrom Concept...\nTo Prototype\nSleeved version of the Dominion case (the case is not pictured since I do not have a protoype of it yet)\nI wanted a case that would strike a balance between storage and usability. \nTherefore, I came up with a set of requirements.  The case(s) needed to:\nstore all of the Dominion cards and accessories\nstore cards with or without sleeves\nallow players to remove the cards easily during gameplay\nallow players to read the titles of the cards\nallow players to organize the cards in any order they desire\nBecause of these requirements, I opted for soft foam with slots for the cards.  The foam would offer protection for the cards while keeping them organized.\nAs far as card labeling goes, I did not find it very feasible for an unofficial project, so I decided to design the case so that the card titles could be read while inside the case.  This also allows players to change the layout of their case if they wish to do so. \nYour name or alias will be added to the list of supporters on our Website.

That said, I have narrowed the scope of this project to create an Dominion case capable of storing all the games.  In order to keep the project small, I decided to keep the case simple and functional.\nIn addition, my long-term vision is to make custom cases for all types of games like Catan, Carcassonne, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Magic the Gathering, etc. I would even like to collaborate with people who are launching brand new card or board games via Kickstarter and design a case to go along with their game.\nMarch 2013\nLaunch the Kickstarter project\nApril 2013\nGather user information via Backerkit on the day the project ends\nCollect pledges (over the required two-week processing period)\nMay 2013\nPlace order with manufacturer (1-3 week lead time)\nStay in touch with backers via Backerkit\nJune 2013\nBegin packaging and organizing orders\nJuly 2013\nStart shipping rewards to project backers\n\nAdditional Pictures\nSleeved version: close up of slots (case not pictured)\nSleeved version: close up of treasure/victory slots (case not pictured)\nSleeved version: close up of player mat and trash card slots (case not pictured)\nUnsleeved version: ability to read card titles 1\nUnsleeved version: ability to read card titles 2\nSleeved version: showing distance between cards (case not pictured)\nPictures of the case\nMayday Premium Sleeves (left) and Fantasy Flight Sleeves (right)\n10 and 12 qty.
