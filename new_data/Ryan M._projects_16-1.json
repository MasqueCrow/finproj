Find out in The O.Z., a thrilling new comic series from Ringo Award-nominated writer David Pepose (Spencer & Locke, Going to the Chapel) and red-hot new artist Ruben Rojas that transforms a childhood classic into a war story for the ages. Debuting on Kickstarter with a 44-page first chapter, this campaign is dedicated to bringing this action-packed twist on L. Frank Baum\u2019s iconic Oz novels to life. Fans of Mad Max, The Old Guard, and Fables will not want to miss out on The O.Z. \nFOLLOW THE YELLOW BRICK ROAD\nDecades ago, when a young girl defeated the Wicked Witch of the West, she said farewell to the magical land of Oz\u2026 but unwittingly plunged the country in a vicious power vacuum leading to years of brutal civil war. But a generation later, the name of Dorothy Gale lives on in her granddaughter, an Iraq war veteran grappling with disillusionment and PTSD \u2014 yet when a tornado strikes Dorothy\u2019s quiet Kansas town, this former soldier finds herself in the war-torn battlefield known only as The O.Z. Forced to navigate warring factions led by the Tin Soldier, the Scarecrow, and the Courageous Lion, Dorothy must come to terms with her legacy and her past if she ever hopes to bring peace to the Occupied Zone.\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nReimagining the classic L. Frank Baum mythology of the Wizard of Oz through the lens of war, The O.Z. is a comic that takes no prisoners thanks to its striking artwork. With our first issue clocking in at 44 pages, we thought this preview would speak for itself: \nTHE BOOK\nTeaming up with rising star artist Ruben Rojas, Eisner-winning colorist Whitney Cogar (Giant Days, Steven Universe), and ace letterer DC Hopkins (Titans, Ghosted in L.A.), The O.Z. is an action-packed story of heart-rending choices, hard-fought redemption, and finding meaning amid the fog of war... even on the other side of the rainbow. \nFor you process junkies out there, we'll be printing this book on a heavy 80 lb. glossy paper stock with a cover at 100 lb. glossy cover stock.

Thank you for visiting our Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019re incredibly excited to share this with our family, friends and tiki fans alike.\nRecently, we\u2019ve developed our budding Promistyx company brand together, which Mistyx Tiki falls under. We\u2019re both big mythology nerds, and the Promistyx name represents a promise we\u2019re making to ourselves to bring this product and this Kickstarter to life.\nWe have SO MANY great designs, so this campaign will also help in developing future designs and bringing this tiki to (virtual, and someday in-person) shows in the SoCal area.\nThanks for giving us this chance!\nAaron & Jenn\nAbout the Product\nAaron has designed dozens of unique tiki and mug designs, but this one stood out as the one to launch with. The Death Blow mug establishes that we push the envelope on traditional tiki designs, and also pushes the boundaries of what a tiki mug can be. We both are Los Angeles transplants from the other side of the country. It\u2019s more than apparent to us what makes LA unique, and we hope to be able to bring those SoCal-inspired designs to life following this campaign. But modern tiki culture is rooted in Los Angeles, and it\u2019s that history that we\u2019re evolving in our work.\nJenn fought hard for the \u201cDeath Blow\u201d title of this mug, and desperately hopes it\u2019s not a bad omen for this campaign - just a fun, apt name that collectors will enjoy.\n We first printed the mug at 5.5\u201d high, which would have landed around 5.1\u201d with typical ceramic shrinkage. The 3D print felt nice in a grip, but wouldn\u2019t have confidently held a decent cocktail. So we decided to reprint at 6.75\u201d, which resulted in a much more comfortable size! Final fired mug should be around 6.25\" tall. We\u2019re now in the molding phase of the project - and the outcome of this campaign will determine how many molds we make. We\u2019ve partnered with LA-based Bauer Pottery, home of Tiki Bauer, and are excited to bring this concept to life with them.\nTo create the cannon base, we\u2019ve decided to hand-cast and hand-paint each and every one. So no matter who you are, if you purchase one of our \u201cDeath Blow\u201d or \u201cHell Fire\u201d bases, you will have a one-of-a-kind piece! This is why we\u2019re limiting the number of orders, but we\u2019ll do our best to expand the offering as much as possible.\nWe were inspired by our paint prototyping to do a lava-themed variant of the glaze and base, which is where \u201cHell Fire\u201d comes in. While \u201cDeath Blow\u201d will be an open edition, \u201cHell Fire\u201d will be strictly limited in its run.\nIn our initial outreach to friends and family about this product\u2019s price point, we were told repeatedly that we\u2019re underselling ourselves with this rate. (Thanks, guys! They like us. They really like us\u2026) Coming out the gate, we want everyone to be able to afford this mug should they want it. We\u2019re living through surreal times right now, and that gives us no right or reason to jack the price up for the \u201cHell Fire\u201d of it.\nWhat else ya got?\nIn addition to the mugs, we\u2019re producing a new enamel pin designed by Aaron. Whereas Mystyx Tiki is our tiki product development line, \u201cMiss Styx\u201d are our pinup illustrations. This Miss Styx is a hula girl who stands behind the  #freethenipple movement and never steps foot on the beach without a Bahama Mama in her cup.\nWe also have some special stretch goals lined up that we\u2019re hoping to reach during this campaign! The first is a set of swizzles and picks, specially designed for these mugs. \nSimilar to the swizzle sticks, we\u2019ve created cannon themed cocktail umbrellas. We want all your cocktails in these mugs to be explosive. (har har) \n So.... who are we, again? \nPromistyx is a husband-wife team based out of Los Angeles featuring 2D digital art and enamel pins as well as the development of artisan drinkware and apparel prints.\nAaron is a longtime product developer in the toy and collectibles industry. He has a background in industrial design and over ten years of combined experience in art direction and product manufacturing. It\u2019s a dream to finally bring one of his own designs to life!\nWhen not helping run the business side of her husband Aaron's designs and product development, Jenn also produces one-of-a-kind functional ceramics pieces. Her art is heavily inspired by nature and autumnal themes.\nWhy $32,000?\nWhile swizzle sticks and cocktail picks are individually not expensive, they come with very high minimum order quantities (MOQs) when it comes to manufacturing them. We've identified that $32K milestone as where we're comfortable ordering 10,000 (yep, that's the MOQ) of each. The good news there is that we'll be able to add *at least* a 4-pack of each to every cannon tiki mug ordered!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith ceramics, there's always the chance of breakage. We've integrated the cost of ordering enough to cover standard breakage rate, and have the ability to tailor the order to the final total.\n\nWe're also working with a local, US-based company to produce the ceramic mugs, so we're drastically reducing the risk of loss and time (compared to internationally based manufacturers.)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nShow off your tiki at all of your (virtual) parties instead of using disposable plastic cups!\nSomething else\nCeramic mugs will be made locally - limiting carbon footprint for shipping.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Shooting A Thanks", "descp": "For showing you believe in us, we'll send you a handwritten Thank You card on a custom postcard featuring our DEATH BLOW tiki design.\nINCLUDES:\nHandwritten Thank You Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Stick It To Us", "descp": "Get an original design enamel pin, based on our expanded \"Miss Styx\" pinup-style line of illustrations.\nINCLUDES:\nOne (1) Miss Styx Hula Girl Enamel Pin\nHandwritten Thank You Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 65 or more", "title": "\"Death Blow\" Cannon Tiki Mug", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nOne (1) \"Death Blow\" Tiki Mug\nCertificate of Authenticity - 1st Ed. w/ \"Death Blow\" Enamel Pin\nHandwritten Thank You Postcard\nBonus Blank Tiki Postcard for Sending to a Friend", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 85 or more", "title": "\"Death Blow\" Cannon Tiki Mug + Base", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nOne (1) \"Death Blow\" Tiki Mug\nOne (1) \"Death Blow\" Canon Base\nCertificate of Authenticity - 1st Ed. w/ \"Death Blow\" Enamel Pin\nHandwritten Thank You Postcard\nBonus Blank Tiki Postcard for Sending to a Friend", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["39 backers", "Limited (161 left of 200)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 95 or more", "title": "Here Comes the BOOM!", "descp": "You want it all?

In addition, we're proud to feature some up-and coming talent, with 2 back-up stories written and drawn by members of the COMICS EXPERIENCE Creator's Workshop!\nIn the 2016 series, Gutter Magic explored the story of a man named Cinder Byrnes, in his quest to become a wizard. Born without powers to one of the most prestigious wizarding families in the city, he was determined to gain the powers of magic for himself, and turned half the city upside down to do it.\nDidn't get a chance to read it? Check out the first 7 pages right here!\nBut that's just one story in a city full of them. In a world where wizards, goblins, fairies, and regular folks mingle together in a fantastical version of New York City, there's plenty of tales to be told.\nTALES FROM THE GUTTER explores some of these stories, and see the world of Gutter Magic through new perspectives.\nIn DEAD AND BURIED, we'll learn more about what drives Shiver - daughter of the Morgue, and leader of the Ghost Knives street gang. Featuring the wonderful art of Renae De Liz and Ray Dillon.\nPencils by Renae De Liz, Inks by Ray Dillon\nIn FREE SPIRITS, Eryk Donovan will illustrate the world through the eyes of the various elementals and spirits that the wizards employ. Turns out that most of them don't appreciate being bound. \nFree Spirits Character Sketch by Erica Rose Levine\nAnd, in  DIRTY WORK, Brett Barkley shows us the scavengers, who salvage weapons and technology from the great war, from the dangerous lands that lie beyond the city's borders.\nCharacter Design by Brett Barkley\nPLUS, We've got new pinup art from talented creators that are so hot, they're guaranteed to blister your eyeballs! Here's just a small sampling of the pieces we'll be revealing over the course of the campaign:\nWhispers, by Doug Hills\n  Shiver, by Bree Jordan\n  Oppenheimer, by Stan Chou\nHere's a NEW pinup by artist Kelly Williams! Kelly has been aweseome enough to offer the ORIGINAL artwork as a reward - check out the TREEBEARD tier for details! \nCosmic Cinder by Kelly Williams\nNEW REWARD! \n\nArtist Matt Horak (PUNISHER, THE COVENANT) has created a set of 5 Gutter Magic-themed sketch cards! Backers will get these as part of the Pinup PDF, but we're also thrilled to offer the original pieces for sale - just select the HORAK reward level to the right to snag them!\nSketch Cards by Matt Horak\nHere's another new art reward, featuring Shiver and Cinder, by the amazing Zach Bassett!\nShiver Reflection by Zach Bassett\nThere's only one physical set of these available, so if you love Matt's art, and lets face it, how could you not, get on it! \nIf you haven't had a chance to check out the miniseries, have a look at what some of the hottest talents working today have to say about it:\n\u201cGutter Magic is smart fantasy that\u2019s well worth your time and treasure.\u201d\n- Charles Soule\n(DAREDEVIL, DARTH VADER, DEATH OF WOLVERINE)\n\"Gutter Magic is a fantasy-fueled caper that mixes gun-slinging and spell-slinging. Fun stuff!\"\n- Jim Zub\n(WAYWARD, UNCANNY AVENGERS)\n\u201c Weird and surprising, which is what this and are two of my favorite things in comics. And fun, which is the part that really matters. There\u2019s not a lot of urban fantasy steampunk in comics, and Gutter Magic makes a good argument that we\u2019ve been missing out.\u201d\n- Justin Jordan (SPREAD, LUTHER STRODE)\n\u201cGUTTER MAGIC is a smart, engaging, and original debut that cements Douek & Barkley as creators to watch. With great characters, wonderfully composed action scenes, and an effortless sense of world building, GUTTER MAGIC pulled me in from the first page and has me anxiously waiting for issue two!\u201d\n-Frank Barbiere  \n(FIVE GHOSTS, VIOLENT LOVE)\n\u201cDouek and Barley\u2019s GUTTER MAGIC is a surreal and densely illustrated piece of work with charming characters that pull you into the story. And magic.\u201d\n- Declan Shalvey\n(INJECTION, MOON KNIGHT)\nPARTNERSHIP WITH COMICS EXPERIENCE\nWe're also proud to continue our relationship with Comics Experience by offering several rewards that will allow you to take full advantage of what they have to offer. If you're a writer, or an artist, or just someone who's always dreamed of making your own comic, Comics Experience has tons of resources to help you achieve your goals! At several different reward levels, we're offering: \nAccess to the Creator's Workshop, a place where you can meet fellow creators, learn from professionals, and participate in mutual critiques!\nProfessional Critiques from editors who have worked at some of the biggest companies in the industry, including Marvel and IDW!\nLive, one-on-one mentoring with CE founder and former Marvel Editor Andy Schmidt!\nDigital video bundles of CE workshops and courses!\nCopies of some of the great work put out by CE Digital Publishing and Comixology!\nAdd-on to any pledge! \n30-DAY TRIAL MEMBERSHIP IN THE CREATOR'S WORKSHOP  - $15\nDetails: http://www.comicsexperience.com/creators-workshop/\n3-MONTH MEMBERSHIP IN THE CREATOR'S WORKSHOP - $75\nDetails: http://www.comicsexperience.com/creators-workshop/\n\n1 HOUR OF LIVE MENTORING WITH ANDY SCHMIDT - $100\nDetails: http://www.comicsexperience.com/mentoring/\n\nComics Experience Digital Publishing Titles!\n\nTET PDF - from Paul Allor and Paul Tucker - $16 http://bit.ly/2qGnNex\nDELUGE PDF - from JD Oliva and Rich Clark - $12\nhttp://bit.ly/2qLaQeQ\nWRETCHED THINGS PDF - from Devon Wong and Ken Perry - $16\nhttp://bit.ly/2qFLnUR\nFinally, we're putting our money where our mouth is when it comes to supporting new creators, by opening up this anthology series to submissions from members of CE's Creator's Workshop! We'll be reviewing submissions throughout the campaign and sharing details of the exciting new talent coming aboard! \nWHERE IS THE MONEY GOING?\nOne of the main reasons why I wanted to do a digital-only Kickstarter was so that the majority of the funds could go to the artists involved in bringing the books to life. That, and I don't have the storage room for an entire offset print run. Hitting our goal will cover the line art, coloring, and lettering costs to put the stories together, and the graphic design work involved in putting it all into one nice, good looking package. \nWe've got stretch goals ready to go, that we'll reveal as we reach them, but again, the money will go directly to the creators involved with those items. \n  WHAT IF I HAVE QUESTIONS?\nI'm happy to answer any and all questions here, or on twitter @rdouek", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis being a digital project, we don't have to worry about printing, shipping (with the exception of the art pieces offered), or any of the other fun and anxiety-inducing challenges that come with producing a paper book. \n\nThe main risks are that we might run into delays if one or more of the creators involved misses a deadline, which is why we are choosing to work with established professionals who have a proven track record for putting out great work, on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "PRESTIDIGITATOR", "descp": "A full DRM-free PDF of the issue, with back matter, concept art, and scripts.\nINCLUDES:\nGutter Magic: Tales from the Gutter #1 Deluxe PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "EVOKER", "descp": "A full DRM-free PDF of the issue, with back matter, concept art, and scripts, a PDF including the scripts for the ENTIRE Gutter Magic miniseries (Issues 1-4), and a PDF of all the Gutter Magic pinups and covers we've had done for the series.\nINCLUDES:\nGutter Magic: Tales from the Gutter #1 Deluxe PDF\nGutter Magic (IDW) Full Series Scripts PDF\nGutter Magic Pinup/Cover Gallery PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["62 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THEURGIST", "descp": "DRM-Free PDFs of the issue, the script collection, and pinup/cover gallery, plus a PDF of Gutter Magic, Issue #1\nINCLUDES:\nGutter Magic: Tales from the Gutter #1 Deluxe PDF\nGutter Magic (IDW) Full Series Scripts PDF\nGutter Magic Pinup/Cover Gallery PDF\nGutter Magic (IDW) #1 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "THAUMATURGIST", "descp": "DRM-Free PDFs of the issue, the script collection, and pinup/cover gallery, plus a PDF of Gutter Magic, Issue #1, AND a PDF of original, out-of-print Gutter Magic #0 One-shot!\nINCLUDES:\nGutter Magic: Tales from the Gutter #1 Deluxe PDF\nGutter Magic (IDW) Full Series Scripts PDF\nGutter Magic Pinup/Cover Gallery PDF\nGutter Magic (IDW) #1 PDF\nGutter Magic #0 PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "DIABOLIST", "descp": "DRM-Free PDFs of the issue, the script collection, and pinup/cover gallery, plus a PDF of Gutter Magic, Issue #1, a PDF of original, out-of-print Gutter Magic #0.

Everyone forgot what it truly meant to be a hero... until the day the Giant Robot Octopus Alien Monster attacked! When one little boy finds the courage to stand up to this alien invader, it just might be enough to inspire the return of the world's greatest superhero... \nCaptain Ultimate is an all-ages superhero series created by Joey Esposito, Ben Bailey, and Boy Akkerman that is published digitally by Monkeybrain Comics. Though it\u2019s been well-received, the nature of the direct market has made it difficult for Captain Ultimate to find a home in print. \nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re turning to Kickstarter to fund the print collection of Captain Ultimate #1-6! This will include the printing and shipping costs and getting it distributed via Diamond so kids all over the world can order the book efficiently from their local comic book shop, library, or book store.\nThe issues are fully completed (and can be read on Comixology), so the book will be off to the printer as soon as funding is reached. You\u2019ll be able to read all of the crazy adventures including (but not limited to) the sentient ninja alphabet, the buffest Santa Claus you\u2019ve ever seen, punk rock Halloween, carnival carnage, and a Giant Robot Octopus Alien Monster rethinking his life choices! \nWant to make sure that what you're backing is awesome? Read Captain Ultimate #1 for free by clicking on the image below: \n  We believe that all-ages comics are undervalued in the market, but we\u2019ve experienced first-hand how important they can be. Here\u2019s a letter we received and printed back in Captain Ultimate #3: \nThis hit us hard when it came in because it was validation of everything we believed, and has been a reminder for us during the journey of bringing Cap to print that it\u2019s a worthwhile effort. It wasn\u2019t a brand that attracted this kid, it was the story itself.\nA story with a character he\u2019d never seen or heard of before. A story he wouldn\u2019t have ever seen without the help of Monkeybrain and the digital platform. There\u2019s no reason the same thing couldn\u2019t happen to a kid that comes across the book at his school library or local comic shop.\nOf course we\u2019re biased and confident about the book we put out, but there are lots of other great all-ages books out there that are in a similar spot. \nWe know that it\u2019s hard, as a parent, to go into your comic shop on Wednesdays with your kid and turn them away from Batman comics that are too violent for them or Spider-Man books that are too mature. There are the licensed options too, but as Logan has shown us, sometimes that\u2019s not enough. \nSo here's what we're offering to help us get Captain Ultimate into the hands of kids everywhere:\nIf all of that stuff isn't quite enough, here are some kids, parents, and other readers enjoying their time with Team Ultimate:\n      We hope you'll fall in love with these characters as much as we have.

Kickstarter has emerged as the single best platform for creators and small publishers like ComixTribe to fund the creation of premium graphic novels.\nWhile we love our retail and distribution partners, ComixTribe sales through those channels alone are nowhere near large enough to support the creation of this kind of book. But with the support of backers like you here on Kickstarter, we can and will make it happen.\nPlus, we look at the Kickstarter campaign as a month long online party. I've spent nearly every day the last three years working on SCAM, and now that it's done, I'm ready to have some fun. I hope you join me!\nHow Will the Kickstarter Funds Be Used?\nAll Kickstarter funds will be used to pay for the printing and fulfillment of the books and other rewards, and to help off-set the costs of creating this 256-page monstrosity. Should we raise more than the target goal, we'll look at making the book and the campaign even better.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI sincerely thank you for considering backing this project. While every creative project has its share of challenges, I\u2019ve taken the following steps to mitigate the risk associated fulfilling this project: \n\n1) The book is complete will be ready to go to print before the campaign ends! I finished the SCAM mini-series in October 2013 and the final issue hit the stands in December. The SCAMthology crew have been working hard over the past year complete this tremendous book. The most difficult and time-coming part of the project is behind us, which means we can go directly to print once funding is secured. \n\n2) While this is my first Kickstarter project, I'll be aided in the fulfillment by Tyler James and ComixTribe, who have successfully funded, and more importantly FULFILLED two successful Kickstarters in the past (EPIC and OXYMORON.) While this is a big project, it's one we're well-positioned to handle.\n\n3) Our printer is reliable! We\u2019re working with Trivision, a well-respected print shop that does books for Image, IDW, Th3rdWorld Studios and more. To date, ComixTribe has printed more than 14,000 copies of comic books with Trivision, and they\u2019ve never let us down.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "Drinks tomorrow night?", "update_content": "Hey, Joe Mulvey and the ComixTribe crew here with two quick things...\nTHING #1\nFirst, myself and some of the ComixTribe guys are going to be hanging out for an END OF KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN Livestream party tomorrow night.

It follows Cale Beckett, a legendary former mercenary, as he seeks to unravel his past on the frozen planeoid.\nYou may remember that we ran a previous campaign for the complete Graphic Novel and raised over \u00a34000 which was not quite enough to produce the full book. \nHowever we don't want to leave all of our supporters without the chance to enjoy this great story and so this campaign is designed to kickstart the series and fund the first issue. \nFor this we need a much lower amount so you can still be part of this adventure and help make it all happen.\nIssue #1 cover art by Giancarlo\n Meet The Creators\nPete Rogers\n Pete is an award-winning British writer, who came to comics via a series of screenwriting courses at Raindance in London. In 2007 he co-founded Orang Utan Comics, publishing anthology title Eleventh Hour, featuring his own short stories, alongside the work of other rising talent. Within a year the book had been nominated for an Eagle award. In 2011 his first graphic novel The Interactives was released, to critical acclaim, with art by Luciano Vecchio (Beware the Batman). Earlier this year the first title from his new imprint Dapper Chimp Press was released, \u2018Chris Smith and the Nazi Zombies from Hell\u2019 which he served as editor on.\n\"With his ferocious instinct for shifting perspectives, and a sniper\u2019s eye for finding that which is relevant amidst that which is fantastical, Rogers\u2019s recent work confirms his place as a leading light in the next wave of British comics talent. I\u2019ll be looking forward to Forgotten Planet with huge anticipation.\" - SI SPURRIER\nGiancarlo Caracuzzo\n Giancarlo has worked for most of the major European and American comics publishers, since his first work was published in 1982 in his native Italy. His bold, energetic artwork has been seen in the likes of Jonah Hex, Gorilla Man, Iron Man, Spider-Man and Random Acts of Violence. His work gives this project a unique style and voice, and we are very proud to have such a respected professional on board.\n\"Giancarlo is one of those classic talents largely lost to this modern world, building new worlds fully realized with weight and depth as if they'd always existed.\" -  IVAN BRANDON\n\u201cGiancarlo is a master storyteller and one of the freshest talents coming out of Europe at the moment. There is a reason I have worked with him over and over.\u201d -  JIMMY PALMIOTTI\nIn addition to the main creative team artwork is also being provided by star guest creators Mike Collins, Chris Wildgoose and Azim Akberali. There work will feature both in the comics and on some of our reward items.\nHere's the stunning artwork for the Pin Up by Chris Wildgoose:\nA massive thanks to Chris for creating this great Poster for our book\nA Little About Our Story\nOn Pluto Cale Beckett is infamous. He\u2019s the poster boy used to instil fear into the Plutonian race. But Cale Beckett is living in denial. Beckett spends a solitary existence on a Tanzanian game reserve, with just his dog for company. He can remember the things he did on Pluto in the 70s and he\u2019s been trying to forget about it ever since.\nCale Beckett by Azim Akberali\n When Pluto is downgraded to a planetoid, its new classification 134340 appears all over the media. This reignites the wiped memories of all the mercenaries who used to police the planet, and they are killed before they can talk. But Cale is different, he never forgot what happened, and killing him won\u2019t be so easy. When mercenaries are sent to kill him, on the same day that Pluto\u2019s planet status is revoked, he knows something is wrong. And he knows his two oldest friends are dead. The only way to unearth the truth, means a trip back into his past and a return to Pluto, the Forgotten Planet.\nSample page of Art from Giancarlo\n\"Forgotten Planet is definitely a labour of love for me, it\u2019s a story I\u2019ve been working on for some time and something I\u2019ve completely thrown myself into.

In 2007 he co-founded Orang Utan Comics, publishing anthology title Eleventh Hour, featuring his own short stories, alongside the work of other rising talent. Within a year the book had been nominated for an Eagle award. In 2011 his first graphic novel The Interactives was released, to critical acclaim, with art by Luciano Vecchio (Beware the Batman). Earlier this year the first title from his new imprint Dapper Chimp Press was released, \u2018Chris Smith and the Nazi Zombies from Hell\u2019 which he served as editor on.\n\"With his ferocious instinct for shifting perspectives, and a sniper\u2019s eye for finding that which is relevant amidst that which is fantastical, Rogers\u2019s recent work confirms his place as a leading light in the next wave of British comics talent. I\u2019ll be looking forward to Forgotten Planet with huge anticipation.\" - SI SPURRIER\n\"A fun science fiction premise, a killer mystery and a hugely talented creative team behind it all. The Forgotten Planet looks like a winner. And In Pete Rogers it has a writer who, one feels, could well be a name to watch in the coming years.\" - ROB WILLIAMS\nGiancarlo Caracuzzo \nGiancarlo has worked for most of the major European and American comics publishers, since his first work was published in 1982 in his native Italy. His bold, energetic artwork has been seen in the likes of Jonah Hex, Gorilla Man, Iron Man, Spider-Man and Random Acts of Violence. His work gives this project a unique style and voice, and we are very proud to have such a respected professional on board.\n\"Giancarlo is one of those classic talents largely lost to this modern world, building new worlds fully realized with weight and depth as if they'd always existed.\" -  IVAN BRANDON\n\u201cGiancarlo is a master storyteller and one of the freshest talents coming out of Europe at the moment.

In that series he was tasked with delivering monkeys holding big guns, beautiful femme fatales, insane tech, multiple time eras, and elaborate action set pieces.

He can remember the things he did on Pluto in the 70s and he\u2019s been trying to forget about it ever since. When Pluto is downgraded to a planetoid, its new classification 134340 appears all over the media.\nThis reignites the wiped memories of all the mercenaries who used to police the planet, and they are killed before they can talk. But Cale is different, he never forgot what happened, and killing him won\u2019t be so easy. When mercenaries are sent to kill him, on the same day that Pluto\u2019s planet status is revoked, he knows something is wrong. And he knows his two oldest friends are dead. The only way to unearth the truth, means a trip back into his past and a return to Pluto, the Forgotten Planet.\n\"Forgotten Planet is definitely a labour of love for me, it\u2019s a story I\u2019ve been working on for some time and something I\u2019ve completely thrown myself into.

There might be a fireplace involved.\nAND BECAUSE YOU MADE IT HAPPEN...\n We will translate the story into Portuguese and make a Portuguese language booklet available for preorder (see the $4 Reward Level on the right!).

Silvio illustrated and colored. I (Alex) scripted and lettered. We crossed the fairy tale of Snow White with the cross-cultural Trickster myth in a traditional high-fantasy setting (think Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, The Namedropper Trilogy, etc). You can expect a PG-13ish rating because of some violence, and because Snow White in this version... might not fare the fairest of them all.\nJudges Steve White, Tony Lee, and Mark Buckingham selected our story as one of only two finalists. It appeared in the London Comic-Con program in May 2012 and, by popular vote (thank YOU!) \"The Time of Reflection\" won the 2012 Eagle Award/MCM Expo Award for New Visionaries.\nLike many of you, Silvio and I haven't yet seen our story in print (that's a test printing you see in the video). So now we could use your help to make our comic available as a standalone booklet on this side of the world.\nSilvio's portrait of Mirror. Prints and such available as backer rewards on the right.\nPages from \"The Time of Reflection\"\nThe booklet (black cover) will be 12 glossy pages including cover, 5.5\" x 7.44\", which is large for a minicomic: more like a shorter \"ashcan\" comic, but thicker paper stock, especially the cover. This includes the complete 5 page comic and some character sketches, as well as Silvio's gorgeous concept illustration/portrait of Mirror as the back cover.\nWe will also be doing a signed and numbered Limited Edition (approximately 6.7\" x 9\") which, at 28 pages including cover, will include (in addition to the story at its original, larger size) the full script, the complete unlettered pages, the layouts, and some additional commentary on the making of the comic by both of us. I might make a few more available if there's a run on the initial rewards to the right, but even if these become wildly popular, I plan on capping the print run at about 200-250 at most. More likely there will be fewer than 80 of these, ever.\nStandard booklet cover. The Limited Edition version has a white cover.\nWe're doing something a little bit different, because we want to see if we can support and involve local retailers at the same time as we deliver a book direct to you through Kickstarter.\nWith any pledge of $3 or more, I'll not only send you the \"Time of Reflection\" booklet (all pledge rewards include shipping within the United States of America or to US Military bases overseas), but I'll also ask you for your favorite LCS (local comic book shop) or any independently owned retail bookstore (must be in business prior to the launch of this Kickstarter, and I must be able to verify the store's existence/phone number/address). And I'll send them a copy as well, at no charge to them.\nThese stores can do whatever they want with the booklets, including but not limited to selling them for the cover/retail price (there will be an ISBN and bar code), throwing them in the dollar bin, or giving them away to any customers they don't want as customers anymore.\nAlso: \nThe five North American shops with the most recommendations from backers will also receive a copy of the signed and numbered Limited Edition. If this Kickstarter reaches 500 backers, I'll bump that to the top 10 shops.\nIf any store in North Carolina gets ten or more such recommendations/copies, I'll also offer to travel to that shop for a reading/performance/signing on my own dime.\nAny store in Ohio, South Carolina, or Virginia: I'll be there with 20 or more recommendations/copies.\nAny store in a city outside the above states, but with a train station along the Amtrak routes Carolinian/Piedmont, Crescent, or Silver Service/Palmetto: I'll be there with 30 or more recommendations/copies.

See the notes under the heading \"Retailers\" below for details; backers will have a chance to request an alternative shop.)\nI'm a big believer that readings should be fun!

Retailers: send me a note if you want to see a short example of a past live \"performance/reading.\"\nAdd $2 to your pledge above any base reward level and I'll also send you a signed first printing of my just-released minicomic \"You Got Your Schwarzenegger in My President.\"  It's black and white, 16 pages including cover.

I wrote the first draft during my first week at the Clarion Writers' Workshop in 2006.\nTo get the micro-chapbook, backers at any amount (even $1, if you live in the USA*) may send me a note with a link to their Facebook share or Tweet or blog/forum post or whatever social media outlet the kids are using these days (and please do so before the Kickstarter ends, so it will actually, you know, help).\nLCRW #23\nAnd if you share this Kickstarter within a private post/forum (or... dare I even think it... tell a friend about it offline?!) just let me know what you did. I'll trust you, because the micro-chapbook will be printed using a special ink that's invisible to filthy lying liars, so you'd only be cheating yourself if you're not being honest with me.\nMicro-chapbook mockup. I'm experimenting with more interesting map-fold techniques, but I don't want to make it too difficult to read or hold.\n(*Those outside the USA: please pledge at least at the $3 reward level and add the $5 flat international shipping bonus to qualify for this freebie; see the \"Add to Any Pledge\" section below for more about this necessary annoyance.)\nAdd $25 to any pledge (above the desired reward level) for a T-shirt. Choose white or black designs below. Each has a line from the story on the front, and Silvio's art on the back. Add $50 if you want both tees.\nCookies!\nThe $52 reward includes four exclusive, freshly made \"Time of Reflection\" vanilla sugar cookies from Golden Age Bakery in Chapel Hill, each topped with a panel from \"The Time of Reflection\" in edible icing. \nThey'll look something like this, only less Photoshoppy and more delicious (it's a mockup).\nYou can find some photos of actual cookies on Golden Age Bakery's Kickstarter page. (Cookies are for backers in the United States only. Includes priority mail postage, shipped on a Monday.) The cookies will remain fresh for up to two weeks upon arrival.\n\"The Man in the Cellar\"\nAdd $10 to any pledge to receive a DVD of \"The Man in the Cellar,\" an award winning (\"Best Horror\" at the 2012 Cape Fear Film Festival) short film directed by Dean Garris and starring Alex.

And a few more available at $38, which also includes FQ#10 (includes my collaboration with illustrator Shaun Gardiner: \"Groundbound.\")\nPlease add $2 to your pledge (above the desired reward level) for each additional copy of the regular \"The Time of Reflection\" booklet you want.\nAdd $1 to your pledge (above any base reward level $3 or higher) if you want the Portuguese translation instead of the original English language version of the booklet. For each additional copy, it's $2, same as the English language version.\nAdd $7 to any pledge (above any reward level $10 or higher) for each additional signed (by both Silvio and Alex) booklet. These need to be shipped to Brazil and back to the USA for this.\nYou may also add $2 if you want a copy (or additional copy, if you took advantage of pledging in the first three days of the campaign) of the \"You Got Your Schwarzenegger in My President\" minicomic.\nAdd $5 to your pledge (above the desired reward level) to ship any order to an address outside the USA. Does not include \"me\" at the $1500 level, sorry. (Shipping within the United States or to US Military bases overseas is included at each reward level.)\nAdd $10 to any pledge to receive a DVD of the award-winning short film \"The Man in the Cellar,\" directed by Dean Garris and starring me/Alex. Signed by me/Alex. (Also available at the $13 reward level.)\nAdd $25 to any pledge (above the desired reward level) for a T-shirt. Choose white or black. Each has a line from the story on front, and Silvio's art on back. Add $50 for both.\nAdd $110 to any pledge (above the desired reward level) for the jigsaw puzzle of Silvio's Mirror.\nIf you want multiple higher-tier rewards (including multiple copies of the Limited Edition, or if you already have an art commission and want to add a song), please contact me so I can guarantee availability before the Kickstarter ends.\nI go over these in a more organized way in Update #16.\n\"The Time of Reflection\" booklets will have ISBNs and bar codes.\nAnd don't worry about receiving unwanted booklets just because one of your loyal customers recommended you for it. I'll contact each store prior to shipping. If anybody tells me they don't want a booklet... if they can't or won't stock it or use it as kindling for any reason, I'll contact the original backer and work with her or him to find an alternative retailer or library who might be interested. (And I have a backup plan if that fails, too.)  \nRetailers may also pledge $10 and select \"no reward\" for ten copies of the booklet to resell or do other nefarious things with (we'll clarify what you're asking for over email before anything goes out). This is based on an expected $2 retail/cover price. If the preorder numbers allow me to lower that cover price (it won't be higher), you might get a few extra copies so your cost for the books will remain at or around 50%. (You may also add $10 to an existing base reward level if you also want one of the rewards to the right.)\nRetailers may also pledge $10 and select \"no reward\" (or add $10 to an existing base reward level) for ten copies of the minicomic \"You Got Your Schwarzenegger in My President\" (see above under \"Add a Brand New Minicomic\") which doesn't have an ISBN or bar code, but is awesome in other ways.\nSee the \"One for You/One for your LCS\" section above for more retailer incentives which don't require you pledging at all.\nAt the $120 reward level, I will do the musical/\"filk\"-equivalent of an art commission based on your favorite comic/novel character, story, author, illustrator, editor, letterer, or other fandom-related subject or person. I tend to lean toward humor--both reverent and irreverent--but I've written some serious stuff, too.\nYou'll get an MP3. I might also do a YouTube video. I tend to use a ukulele or guitar for this sort of thing, but if I feel the song requires some groovy beats, then groovy beats it shall have. While I'll do my best to work within any stated likes and dislikes, I give no guarantees about genre or whether you'll like what I come up with.\nHere's an example: a song from half my lifetime ago. If only I could remember the name of the famous film trilogy it sends up...\n\"Hutt Seeks Slave (Wear My Chain)\" by Alex Wilson\nApologies for the sound quality; it was written, recorded, and over-compressed fifteen years ago. Read the lyrics in Update #4.\nThe sound quality you'll get with these rewards is more akin to what I did for the music in these next two (neither \"filk\" nor based on a genre property, but two tunes written during my \"Hutt Seeks Slave\" era/phase):\n\"Crack\" by Alex Wilson\nAnd the following is a more serious song, (sampled in my Kickstarter video). If I recall correctly, this was an extrapolation on the idea that an ancient nomadic culture might have held the carrier of its coal in the highest regard... as steward of the community's source of heat and life:\n\"Since We Never Could Stand Still\" by Alex Wilson\n(If you don't see the MP3 players above, try reducing or increasing the text size of the page. Oddly that makes the player appear for me in Firefox.)\nI tend to release projects like these with Creative Commons Licenses, so you'll be able to share it with friends as you might share a scan of an art commission you picked up at a convention, or you can learn the chords and play it yourself on filk-nights at conventions and such. If you have a specific purpose in mind and want to discuss it before you pledge, let's chat.\nAt the $250 reward level, comic book creators, authors, and other creative professionals or aspirants may request works based on their own fictional worlds, stories, and characters. You will need to supply a copy of the work, but a digital format in most cases will be fine: a PDF of a comic, text files/ebook files of prose or poetry, Quicktime or MP4s of film or TV series, or MP3s of songs if... if you want me to write a song about your song.\nNOTE: Kickstarter rules prohibit granting/sharing of copyright ownership to/with backers, so we'll start by saying the $250 reward level includes permission to use the recording or derivatives/reimaginings of the song to promote your work online (in book trailers, etc) and live in person. But additional use (reselling, incorporating into a for-profit work like a film adaptation, or broadcasting beyond the free online world, for example) should be discussed. If you want to clarify anything before you pledge at this level, yes, let's do so.\nSince this reward is sold out and this page is long enough as it is, I've moved its details to the FAQ at the bottom.\nFrom an upcoming work. See the Schwarzenegger minicomic above for more comickized photo examples.\nCan being in a comic lower your blood pressure?\nI expect to start shipping these (any physical reward that doesn't include something requiring Silvio to sign or produce) pretty quickly after funds clear.\nYou can see me holding a test printing in the video up top, so I just need to adjust the size of the initial print run based on preorder numbers, and away we go. Obviously any runaway success will include some delays in getting them all out the door, but I'll do my best to ship in the same order in which you all pledge.\nFor Silvio's signatures, sketches, and commissions, I'll need to ship these to Brazil and he'll need to ship them all back to me in the States so just assume a big chunk of the time and cost of about any pledge reward $10 or higher is going toward post time and postage fees there and back again.\nI expect to be able to write and record those \"song commissions\" at a rate of no more than one per month and produce those \"Starring Role\" minicomics at a rate of no more than two per year.\nThis page has become such a monster that I needed to move this to the FAQ. \n..\nThanks for being a part of this!\nAnd thanks again to the judges of the competition for selecting us, to all the voters who supported us during the open voting phase, to members of the Comics Experience workshop/forum for bringing the contest to my attention (and for the feedback on my initial script), and to Chapel Hill Comics for hosting our upcoming release party (date TBD)!\nSilvio is a freelance artist in Brazil. He\u2019s worked since 2008, and his USA work includes Clockwork (Gov't Comics), Meridien City (Alpha Girl Comics), Girls Night Out (Alpha Girl Comics), and the upcoming Outlaw Territory III (Image Comics). @silviodb on Twitter.\nAlex is a writer and actor in Carrboro, NC (originally from northern Ohio). His comics and prose fiction have appeared in Asimov\u2019s Science Fiction, The Florida Review, Outlaw Territory II (Image Comics), and LCRW. A comedy short he co-wrote and starred in will premiere at the International Cycling Film Festival in Herne, Germany in October. He fully expects to be CGI-ed out of the final battle sequence of Iron Man 3. @alexotica on Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a foot in the prose-writing world, where until recently the gap between collaborating with a publisher and self-publishing has been much bigger than it is in comics. So I'm stepping forward carefully. \n\nI've treated my creative work as a business for years, but I have never committed to so many deliverables (both new creative works as rewards and actual shipped books and booklets) at once before. We want to be a part of the comics community for a long time, so keeping these commitments is a priority.\n\nWe met and produced an award winning comic story in less than a month from inception of idea to finished product, all while both of us were juggling other projects.

Check them out!\nTHE STORY.\nAnyone that lives in a major city knows that there are millions upon millions of people rubbing elbows with one another each and every day. But what they often fail to remember is that we're all part of the same ecosystem; everyone is inevitably connected to each other, affecting one another's lives whether they know it or not. \nAnd that's what Pawn Shop is about. Each chapter follows a different character in a stand-alone tale that ultimately intertwines with the others, painting a larger portrait of their lives together in New York City. \nThe book is being rendered in a gorgeous mixture of watercolor and digital elements that, hopefully, gives it a unique feel that works to capture the magic diversity of New York City itself.\nWHO WE ARE.\nJoey Esposito is a writer who last year Kickstarted his comic Footprints (with artist Jonathan Moore). He's also the writer of Zenescope's Grimm Fairy Tales: Bad Girls and has had his work featured as a back-up story in Image Comics' Grim Leaper. You also may know him as the Comics Editor for IGN.com. He moved away from New York and has regretted it every day since. Pawn Shop is his attempt to make amends. You can find him on Twitter or visit his website.\nSean Von Gorman is an illustrator and escape artist born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. Sean is co-creator of the forthcoming graphic novel series Secret Adventures of Houdini as well as the creator of Sock It To Me Comics, both with Alterna Comics. During the self-publishing run of Secret Adventures of Houdini Sean handcuffed himself outside Forbidden Planet NYC until every book was sold. He recently preformed his escape act for Amanda Palmer\u2019s AFP Kickstarter Countdown Party at the bidding of her husband Neil Gaiman. He's such a devoted artist that he worked on some Pawn Shop pages while admitted to the ER (see below). You can find him on Twitter or visit his website.\nAdam Pruett has lettered comics for Arcana, Image, Markosia, Pop Goes the Icon, Black Jack Press, and various other publishers. He also makes his own comics sometimes. You can find him on Twitter.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nPawn Shop is a slice-of-life story. That means it's \"soft.\" There're no monsters, no violence, no tights, and certainly no flights. There's no \"genre\" hook. But what there is is something even better: a story everyone can relate to. \nPawn Shop was born out of the realization that there is nothing more fascinating, dramatic, intriguing, joyful, depressing, and outright absurd than everyday human existence. We're turning to Kickstarter out of a need to explore these ideas. We know that there's an audience out there for these kind of comics, and we think that's the beauty of Kickstarter -- people will support what they really want. \nWe're looking to you to make this book happen, and we hope you'll join us for the ride. \nTHE REWARDS.\nWe're offering a boatload of great stuff from the usual items -- digital downloads, a copy of the book, art prints, original artwork, etc. -- to the more... well, out there. We're offering things like Sean coming to your location (continental US only) to perform a straight jacket escape (yes, he really does that), CD mix tapes to supplement your reading experience, illustrated/performed poems, and we're even putting the very dedication of this book up for grabs. \nThere's also opportunities to co-write a bonus story for the book and become characters in the story itself. As we reach certain goals, we'll unlock even more rewards. \nWHERE IS YOUR $$ GOING?\nWe're aiming for a print run of 1000 graphic novels that we will publish and distribute ourselves in comic shops and digitally. Neither creator is taking any sort of payment on this project, so all of your money will be going towards making comics 100%. \nIf we happen to exceed our goal, the excess funds will go toward printing more copies of the book, or, if the excess is significant, upgrading the book to a larger format, making it a hardcover, etc. Beyond that, excess funds will go to assuring that we're out at any and every convention possible to promote Pawn Shop. \nIS SEAN FOR REAL ABOUT THE ESCAPE ACT?\nYes.\nWe hope you'll join us on this adventure through the lives of our four New Yorkers.

(I can't edit the reward text on the right, so I figured I'd tell you this way.)\nWhat is QUANDARY? \nQuandary is a digital comic of a story that takes place twenty years in the future. In this future, we all live in a 'police state'. We've been at war in the Middle East, where hundreds die every day, for the last thirty years. Protesters in the 'We the People' movement are regarded as terrorists, hunted down and executed for challenging the system. Basic rights are being stripped away, one mandate at a time. Then, one event\u2014an accidental death\u2015inadvertently sets in motion the wheels of a revolution, and tyranny begins eroding from within.\nIf Quandary were a mixed drink, the recipe would be:  2 parts George Orwell's 1984, 2 parts 'life as we know it', and 1 part Occupy movement.\nHere's a sneak peek of one of the pages!  (click image to enlarge)\nNoah and Cadence: characters revealed in issue #2. (click image to enlarge)\nAnother sneak peek at issue #1\n\nWhy raise funds for a digital comic?\nAside from printing costs, there is no financial difference between a digitally published comic and a printed one. ISBN numbers still have to be registered, creative contributors still need to be compensated, files continue to require hosting, and the importance of promotional materials remains. If successful, this Kickstarter will offset the cost of all of these items, ensuring that publish-ready issues meet a monthly deadline. \nProvisionally, we are saying that Quandary will appear over nine issues that are around twelve pages each. The primary Artist, Ken Frederick, will be responsible for illustrating the bulk of these issues. However, three issues will feature the work of guest artists. A few more guest artists will contribute to creating promotional art. This project is a labor of love for Ken and me, so we both will be working, unpaid.\n\nWill this digital comic also be printed? \nYes! Issue #1 will be printed inside the Kickstarter Exclusive \u2018Making of Quandary\u2019 magazine, along with information and images from the development process, concept art, and more!\nFurthermore, the series, when complete (est. 8/2013), will be printed in full and bound into both a softcover and hardcover edition available for purchase on Amazon, as well as at various comic shops in the NYC/NJ area.\n\nSo, who's the creative team? \nWriter:  Janine Frederick (Hudson Valley Zombie Apocalypse Graphic Novel, Awaken, Aleksander Christov) Janine's Web site\nMain Artist:  Ken Frederick (Hudson Valley Zombie Apocalypse Graphic Novel, The Forgotten Dead, Aleksander Christov) Ken's Web site\nGuest Artist:  Gabriel Bautista (Illustrator: Elephantmen, Jesus Christ: In the Name of the Gun; Colorist: All-Star Western, Will Eisner's The Spirit) Gabriel's Web site\nGuest Artist:  Silvio dB (Eagle Awards New Talent Competition Winner; Illustrator: The Time of Reflection, Meridien City) Silvio's Web site\nGuest Promo Artist:  Tom Feister (Illustrator: GI Joe, DC Comics, Dark Horse Comics, Lucasfilm, Marvel Comics ) Tom's Deviant Art page\nGuest Promo Artist:  Richard P. Clark (Illustrator: HBO, Wall Street Journal, Playboy, DC Comics, Dark Horse, Blind Ferret Entertainment, and more.) www.zippystudio.com\nGuest Promo Artist:  Ian Dorian (Phoenix #0, Marvel & DC sketch cards, Awaken) Ian's Web site\nGuest Promo Artist:  Igor Glushkin (Illustrator:  Lady Gunns, Isolation) Igor's Web site\n\nThat's pretty cool!  Tell me about the REWARDS.\nSure thing! As you can see on the right, there are several different reward levels to accommodate all different pledge opportunities. Each reward description is specific in what it includes, so please don't worry about having to remember what the the lower-end rewards were in order to get an accurate picture of what your reward will be. No 'researching'. This is Kickstarter . . . not a term paper.\nWe've been able to collaborate with some amazing people over the past two years. They have shown their support of our Quandary project by offering their time, talents, and handiwork\u2015all to help us meet our fundraising goal. Now a lucky few contributors will be able to have a one-of-a-kind oil painting by Richard P. Clark, a few budding comics writers will get to have a 22-page script reviewed by an IDW-published comics professional, and a few others will have the opportunity to be heard by an audience of about a hundred thousand with my friends, Ming and Mike, on a SmodCo podcast! If those rewards don't suit you, we have some classic reward items\u2014sketches, prints, and a 'making of' magazine, to name a few\u2014to offer as well.\nUPDATE:  Celebrate Independence!  Every contributor gets a free PDF of the independently produced one-shot zombie apocalypse-themed comic called THE FORGOTTEN DEAD.  This comic was penciled and inked by Ken Frederick, main artist on Quandary, and written by Chris Murphy, friend & supporter!THE FORGOTTEN DEAD tells the story of the Museum of Modern Art's curators' last ditch efforts to save some of the world's most treasured and all-but-forgotten masterpieces before the museums perimeters were breached by the undead.\nUPDATE (6/29):  New T-shirt reward launched at the $35 level! \n($35 reward includes T-shirt, 11 x 17 Kickstarter exclusive print, 'Making of Quandary' magazine, PDF of issue #1, and a mention of thanks on the Quandary web site.)\nPlease note: If your reward needs to be sent outside the US, please add $5 to to your contribution to help with the added shipping cost. Thank you so much!\n\nWhat happens if this Kickstarter raises more than $2,500?\nThe original Kickstarter goal of $2,500 is sufficient only to offset the total cost of putting this project together. By no means will it cover the project in its entirety. If we happen to exceed our Kickstarter goal, then the funds in excess of $2,500 will be put toward the remaining costs of developing this project. \nIf the Kickstarter goal is greatlyexceeded and the current estimated project costs are more than paid by what's raised here, then the available funds will be put toward our wish list items: hiring a dedicated colorist, having a consulting editor, enlisting additional guest artists, producing the aforementioned hardcover and softcover editions of the completed series, and giving the creative team a bonus.\nThank you for your consideration, support, and generosity!\nSome art!\nPage breakdown for page two of issue #1.\nMore art to come... stay tuned!  :-)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Cool things happening in Quandary land!", "update_content": "Hey everybody!
