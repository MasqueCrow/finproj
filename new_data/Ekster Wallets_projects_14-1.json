The good news is: this now got solved!

It sounds overcomplicated, it is not, but it should be done properly, paving the road for large-scale production at speed and with precision.

Bucqle exists of two main parts: the front housing and the back housing. Both parts move in opposite directions, so when you put some fabric in-between, it creates a neat fold in a \u201cZ\u201d shape. When you are happy with your fit and settings of your Bucqle, you want to lock it to secure the front- and back housing. Sounds quite simple, but many times a simple idea, or a simple invention, can be quite challenging when you move from a conceptual design into mass production. We sure did not oversee all that complexity, as we have no prior mass-production experience. We are learning more than we would have preferred on this journey and, rest assured, it will benefit you too in the finished product although we fully admit that the time this takes is beyond what we had ever imagined nor did you."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "Production Update", "update_content": "Dear Bucqle Community,\nUnbelievable we are writing such an update again.

The brake pads are located between the front- and back housing of Bucqle, activated by the locking bar. When pressing the locking bar, the brake pads will secure the fit of your preference until you unlock your Bucqle. Silicone turned out to wear out after a while, whereas the stainless steel pads will last forever."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "We are almost there!", "update_content": "Dear Bucqle Community,\n\nHappy new year!\n\nGood news from the team."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "High-level production update from the Founders of Bucqle", "update_content": "Dear Bucqle Community,\nPlease find enclosed a high-level production update from the Founders of Bucqle.\nAfter all complications, with regards to the Covid-19 situation overseas.

He called his idea 'New Babylon.' an imaginary borderless system the size of the entire planet were people can travel without restrictions. (more info here and here )\n\"The frequency of each man's movements and the distances he will cover depend on decisions he will make spontaneously\" -Constant Nieuwenhuys.\n-\nThe World Metro Map\nNewYork based Collective ArtCodeData revised this idea to create a map that represents human mobility. The inner life of cities is made of their subways. What would happened if all the lines in the world would be reunited in a single system. Since the tube is the veins and circulatory system of the 'animal-city' if we gather all those possibilities, we could achieve a total circulatory entity?\nThe result is a digital collage that contains 214 metro/subway systems. Totaling 791 lines and 11,924 stations . Every line in this map represents lines and stations in the real world, however all the lines are interconnected in a way that they all form a mega subway system. You can create routes from Times Square Station NewYork all the way to  Beijing National Library Station in China.\nSome of the included cities (see complete list below)\n\"Everything should remain possible, everything should be able to happen. The environment is created by the activities of life not the other way around. \" -Constant Nieuwenhuys (1)\nThe intersection Between Paris and New York\nThe intersection between New York, Moscow and Sao Paulo\nThe intersection between Berlin and Tokyo\nImportant Note: This map is a Work in Progress, The final result will thoroughly be inspected.\nPLAY\n\nThe map comes in 2 different sizes, 40x30 and 60x45, size A is the perfect size for rooms and studios, size B is perfect for living rooms and meeting rooms. Both A and B sizes can be encapsulated with museum quality materials to keep them perfect for years ahead.\nOPTION 1. Printed in Paper\nHigh resolution print using inks that won't fade and paper that won't turn yellow through the years. The map is sent in a mailing tube and ships anywhere in the world.\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nOPTION 2. Printed + Acrylic Encapsulation\nIn case you want something ready to be hanged, the acrylic encapsulation option is right for you. This technique used by galleries and Art museums around the world guarantee high intensity colors and that it stays perfect for years to come.\nWho is behind this Kickstarter Campaign?\nWe are an initiative called \"Open Accessibility\" selling a map to fund our operations.\nAnd what is Open Accessibility Initiative?\nOpen access is an initiative created by a group of individuals interested in facilitating travel for people living with disabilities.\nHow do we plan to reach your goal?\nWe plan to reach our goal by simply creating a large database of accessible environments in frequently travelled cities. We will accomplish this by physically entering facilities and gathering specifications that make a facility accessible.\nBut doesn't Google Maps or Yelp have this kind of info already?\nNo, and that\u2019s exactly the problem, \u2018accessibility\u2019 information in online maps and booking websites are extremely ambiguous if existent at all. Our initiative will allow us to gather a minimum of 50 accessible points that will help facilitate travel plans for people living with disabilities.\nSome of the aspects we include:\n\"where is your ramp located? are the door frames and hallways wide enough for a wheelchair? are there elevators in the building? Are the bathrooms accessible? do the bathrooms have one or two grab bars? where are these grab bars located? is there transportation services accessible to wheelchairs on your location? do they have hearing impaired services?\"\nWhy is this important to us?\nBecause as a fellow traveler we feel that everyone should have the right to enjoy traveling, including the ease of information accessible to travelers. Currently finding information on the best hostel, most accommodating hotel, the best view or even the best continental breakfast is so easy to find. Website blast their cheap prices directly to our emails on a regular basis. However, information on accessibility to a location is still limited. People are left having to call, email and that can be a total waste of time. OA believes that if the need for information about anything that facilitates life is out there then it should be shared.\nOpen Data\nAll the data we collect will be available for free under a Creative Commons Attribution License.

It is an ESP8266 based open-source Wi-Fi development board to create IoT applications by virtualizing plug-n-play modules to RESTful APIs with mobile APPs.\nThe traditional methodology of building IoT applications consists of electronic engineering, micro-controller programming, network programming, IoT protocols handling and application development. Every step involves various hardware and software knowledge and challenges.\nThis time, we define a new way to create IoT applications. \nNo hardware programming. No breadboard. No jumper wires. No soldering. \n3 steps. 5 minutes. Build your own IoT applications!\nThank you so much for supporting Wio Link!  \nHere comes our stretch goals and let us know what do you expect for the next! :-)\nPLAY\n\nVisual Configuration\nWio Link provides simple visual configuration via mobile APPs to replace the complex micro-controller programming. Drag and drop the sensor tags to certain pins then you can visually set up the hardware.\n\n  OTA (Over-The-Air) Firmware Updates\nWio Link compiles firmware through cloud and can do OTA (Over-The-Air) firmware updates. All the hardware libraries are ready in the cloud and you can proceed with software and applications development directly.\n\n\nPlug-n-Play Groves\nWio Link connects to the large library of Grove modules. Grove is a family of plug and play, open-source sensors and actuators with standard interfaces as well as various functions. Much like Lego\u2122, it takes an approach of building blocks to assemble a project. No breadboard. No jumper wires. No soldering. \n\nNote: By now there have been 30+ Grove modules compatible with Wio Link and you can find most of them in the Rewards. We're working to add more continuously. \n\n\nIFTTT Application\nWio Link provides basic IFTTT (if-this-then-that) applications for you to interact with friends through Seeed IFTTT Channel. Make the LED strip light up in random colors or set up a reminder of wearing more clothes when it becomes colder. You could create more with Wio Link.\nAndroid & iOS APPs \nWio Link mobile APPs can be used on both Android and iOS devices. \nRESTful APIs\nRESTful API resources let you develop IoT applications easily with the \u201cvisualized\u201d sensors and actuators.\n Come and pick up your own package of Wio Link! We have provided the single pack and double pack of Wio Link development boards, the five  different themes of Grove kits and three large sets for friends, workshops and hackathons. There must be a suitable for you.\nWe've also developed some cute accessories of Wio Link. Just add the amounts to your pledge then we'll send you the mousepads or T-shirts together with the rewards.

The network was built, from the bottom up, by people like you.\nWhen we started spreading the word about our first crowd sourced internet of things data network in Amsterdam, we got an astonishing response from the global IoT community. Within a few days, groups and companies from Sao Paulo, London, Paris, Sydney, Boston, Manchester, and many more were showing interest in the concept, actively starting open LoRaWAN projects using technology from The Things Network.\nThis was our proof that an open, global and crowd sourced Internet of Things data network is possible. Not only that, but we did show that we can deploy with an unprecedented speed.\nTo accelerate this rapid growth even further, and to support our global teams, we have decided to design our own equipment that can help build the network for 20% of the cost compared to other products currently on the market. Both the network\u2019s hardware and software will be open source.\nWe use Kickstarter to make the products more easily available to our community, backers and everyone else around the world who supports our vision and would like to make their hometown a smart city.\nFind out how many people you could be impacting by placing The Things Gateway in your home here.\nProducts\nTo help you make the most of this open network, we are offering the following hardware:\nThe Things Gateway\nThe main building block of the network. Small, easy to install, it essentially is a router between the things and the internet. With it you are creating the most substantial aspect of your connected city\u2019s network.\nAbout 20% of the cost of any currently available LoRaWAN gateway\nProvides up to 10 km / 6 miles radius of network coverage\nConnects easily to your WiFi or Ethernet connection\nSecurity through the https connection and embedded in the LoRaWAN protocol\nRuns on open hardware \nContains GPS to determine the gateway\u2019s location and node's location later\nCan serve up to 10,000 nodes\nOne of our BETA test gateways in action.\n  The Things Uno \nA network is nice, but how about some device to connect it with? \nImagine an Arduino Uno with LoRaWAN connectivity. We thought we are using one of the most popular microcontrollers and make it LoRaWAN ready for you to prototype with. \nUpgrade your existing Arduino project and make it wireless with up to 10 km range. How far is your home away from your office? Compatible with Arduino IDE and existing shields. Includes connections for an optional external antenna on the breakout circuit to maximize the range.\nWill be shipping pre-loaded with our open source LoRa library, which is also freely available on GitHub.\nOh, and we are collaborating with 3D Hubs for a awesome 3d printable enclosure for your Uno right over here. \nThings Uno with external antenna and 3D hubs printed enclosure!\nThe first batch UNO's, these are being tested in the field right now!\nThe Things Node\nA matchbox full of sensors, a light and a button. Show off, or just connect this bunch of sensors to your IFTTT account - it is up to you. It is perfect for the prototyping of use cases without the need for programming skills.\nThe Node includes:\nMovement sensor\nLight sensor\nTemperature sensor\nA button\nRGB light\nWaterproof (IP54) casing\n3 AAA batteries supplying power for over a year of usage.\nThe Node is a versatile device to test or build plug\u2019n\u2019play Internet of Things features. Easy set up as an IFTTT node through our intuitive web interface.\nOpen source / Open hardware\nWe believe in Open Source. From the firmware running on the devices up to the hardware designs and casings. We believe that opening this up to the community will benefit us all.\nProject costs \nThe Kickstarter pledges will pay for design, hardware production, software, backend software and shipment, regulation compliance testing, community and customer management and project documentation so you can see what we are up to.\nLoRaWAN - A new technology optimized for connectivity of things\nAll this is enable by a technology called LoRa. LoRa is a low energy, low bandwidth, long range (over 10km / 6 miles) wireless technology and uses an open data frequency. As we are setting up the network together there is no need for an operator. This amazing technology allows for things to talk to the internet without 3G, WiFi or Bluetooth. No wifi codes, heavy battery usage or worse, monthly subscriptions needed. \nThe technology was standardized by the LoRa Alliance and is a result of a collaboration between IBM and chipmaker Semtech. LoRaWAN is currently active on different open frequencies. Most popular are the 868MHz, the 915MHz and the 433MHz. We make a specialised version of every device according to where they will be shipped to. \nDo not worry, we will reach out to you after the campaign to check which frequency your devices need to be based on your local requirements. \nThe Things Network is an official member of the LoRa Alliance.\nThe technology is currently enrolled in France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and South Africa. All by larger telecommunication corporations. To make this an open network with no subscriptions we propose a decentralized, crowdsourced alternative to telcos. And to get there we need affordable and open, hardware. \nWe already have made working betas. Check out this video of the hardware on our workbench:\nPLAY\n\nHow secure is this?\nData security and privacy are an essential element of the internet of things and should be taken into account within every aspect of the network architecture: from the nodes to the application server. LoRaWAN uses AES encryption on both the network and the application level using 128 bit keys, with the network keys being unique per node and the application keys being secret. The Things Network offers end-to-end encryption from the nodes to the application server in the scenario where application developers use the Foundation\u2019s hosted routing mechanism and on-premise data handling and decryption.\nHow hard is it to set up?\nThe Things Gateway, Node and Uno work out of the box. The Things Network has an easy to use development service available for you to connect to your devices. We are building this so that you should be able to set it up with no help from us.\n\nHow does the backend work?\nThe Things Network community provides open source components for routing and handling of data which is fully compliant with the LoRaWAN 1.1 specification. The two core components in the network architecture are The Things Router and The Things Handler. Packets received from nodes are forwarded from the gateways to one or more Routers as configured by the gateway owner. The Things Gateway is pre-configured with the default Router hosted by the Foundation for plug-and-play deployment. The Routers publish the packets on their built-in MQTT broker. The Router contains MQTT topics for both uplink and downlink packets. \nThe Handlers receive packets from Routers by subscribing to, and send data to Routers by publishing to their MQTT brokers. Handlers are responsible for message integrity checking, decryption, deduplication, buffering, transformation and dispatching to application servers. The Handler contains Node RED to handle deduplicated and decrypted data and supports custom processing, also using MQTT publishing. The Handler contains built-in integrations with existing internet of things cloud platforms, including IBM Bluemix, AWS IoT, FIWARE, Parse.com, IFTTT and OpenSensors.io.\nFor your smart city, innovation campus and everybody else \nAt The Things Network, we believe with this project we are taking a big step towards a truly connected future for all devices. We think it has never been easier or cheaper to cover large areas or great distances and we just made it cheaper and easier to use through our accessible and plug\u2019n\u2019play approach to software and hardware design. \nAnd it will be available to everyone. Now is the time to build an internet from the ground up, owned and operated in a decentralised way by its very users.\nSmart Cities\nThis is your low-barrier chance to get started with any smart city initiatives. All major cities around the world have this on the agenda and you can have access to it with a simple pledge.\nUniversities\nWe provide educational packages for universities and schools, complete with teaching materials. A The Things Network community manager will help you set it up, if required.\nHackerspaces\nAs a hacker space this is an easy and fun way to get started with LoRa. We are creating license-free courses on our GitHub account, that can help you create workshops.\nEntrepreneurs\nOur Node means you don\u2019t have to have any programming or hardware knowledge to set up your prototype or business idea. LoRa is also a very competitive solution, if you need your own network.\nInspiration for some projects you can build\nPledges\nHave a look at the list of pledges we created. If you have any particular idea on a special set of devices that makes a better pledge, let us know, we can be flexible.\n\nTimeline\nEverything you see in our graphics, photos and videos is based on previously designed prototypes and working small-batch produced devices. The aim of this campaign is to start mass-producing the next version of these devices. Both us and our partners have years of experience producing and mass-producing software and hardware products.\nTeam\nThese products are a joint effort between Tweetonig and The Things Network.\n\nThe Tweetonig Team\nTweetonig is a product development agency with a lot of experience bringing connected products to mass production. The senior team working on this project are: John - general lead, Dimer - plastics engineer, Sven  - embedded system engineer, Maurits - software lead and Diderik - open innovation consultant. \nTweetonig has created mass-produced products like the Glimworm iBeacons and Tuna Knobs DJ Gear, which have already sold worldwide. Now they are bringing their know-how, production and design expertise to The Things Network products.\nJohan and Wienke during the launch conference of the network in Amsterdam\nThe Things Network was founded by Wienke as initiator and Johan as technical lead. Together with the community, they have developed the backend software running on the servers. Find out more about our amazing community here. Johan Stokking has previous expertise by running a sport time tracking company and Wienke Giezeman is a social internet entrepreneur. He successfully founded a video on demand startup (which was sold to a large publisher) and founded Startups for Net Neutrality as an internet freedom activist.\nYou will see us here\nhttp://schedule.sxsw.com/2016/events/event_PP58120\nYou have seen us here \nhttp://thenextweb.com/insider/2015/08/19/the-things-network-wants-to-make-every-city-smart-starting-with-amsterdam/ http://thenextweb.com/dd/2015/10/01/smart-cities-are-springing-up-around-the-world-as-the-things-network-goes-global/ \nhttp://postscapes.com/nonprofit-iot-infrastructure-the-things-network \nhttp://www.theinternetofthings.eu/wienke-giezeman-we-crowdsource-city-wide-covering-lorawan-network-amsterdam-its-inhabitants \nhttps://startupjuncture.com/2015/10/06/how-the-things-network-might-deliver-iots-break-out-use-cases-video/\nSo that\u2019s our Kickstarter project.

So the team knows what they are doing. Also, all things shown in the video or in the pictures do work. There are off course numerous ugly looking prototypes we kept in the shadow as well. And to make sure we are in the loop for coming changes we will become a member of the LoRa alliance network. \n\nTimeline:\nFrom earlier products we developed for customers we have a wide network of strong manufacturing, assembly and distribution partners. That being said in product development there is always a risk involved. We do our best to manage those risk while putting these high-tech products through production. Our shipment dates are targets and while we are sure we can meet them, they are still estimates. We will prove continues updates to give all backers a better understanding of the progress.\n\nComponent availability and FCC compliant:\nTill now LoRa WAN chips are still hard to buy in larger quantities and getting normal radio circuits through FCC regulations to make sure they are consumer safe is even harder. To make sure we can manage we found a great partner that produces these chips ready with FCC approval.

Don't be embarrassed when puling out that old bulky wallet anymore.\nWhy Trim Your Wallet?\nTrim is the perfect size to carry everything you need.\nEveryone has one favorite card to use; Trim will give you instant access to it.\nIn some instances, you won\u2019t be able to use cards, so Trim carries cash.\nPricing starts at only $20 for early birds. That's like a movie and popcorn.\nYour clothes will fit better.\nThey can fit in any pocket or purse.\nThey can better organize and distribute business cards.\nEveryday life can be chaotic. Perhaps this could help make it a bit simpler.\nHelp make loved ones' everyday lives simpler by gifting one.\nSaffiano Leather - Brown\n\nDesign & Construction:\nAgain, Dash brings you a design with a one piece construction that is folded and sewn strategically for the most minimal frame. Starting with the original design, we wanted to have a wallet that combined all aspects that you guys loved. We finally decided on the TRIM design and created a wallet that accommodates both the vertical and horizontal usage. \nMinimal one-piece design\nMost wallets have perpendicular slots, which isn't the most effective design. We modified the slots, to have them all at an optimal 30 degree angle, and a curve at the back. This design makes access to the cards easy, but also secure. We did the same for the cash compartment for this wallet. \nFirst prototype with a straight card slot\nThe saffiano leather in the Trim Wallet is stamped in a series of cross-hatch designs rendering it very resistant to stains and scratches. This gives us a slimmer frame for a durable construction to help trim your wallet. The edges are then oil-coated to provide more durability and prevent fraying of the ends. Finally, the cash slot is machine laser-cut in a uniform manner.\nSaffiano Leather - a pressed leather for a lighter, refined look\nWe are also providing a black vegetable tanned leather model for a more rugged wallet that builds character over time. This wallet features a thicker hide and thicker threading, with an ultrasuede lining interior. The edges and threading on this model are waxed and coated. There is also additional threading on the cash slot to reinforce the opening.\nVegetable Tanned Leather - Black\nOur Story:\nLast year, I created the first Dash Wallet project after I couldn\u2019t find the right wallet and I put it up on to Kickstarter. Fortunately, the project was able to get full funding and we were able to lift this venture off the ground. We then assembled an awesome team together and got to work. After months of production, site redesigns, wallet resizing, and logistics organization, we delivered you Dash Wallets, a wallet focused on making your life easier and more organized. We create for the minimalist and hope to slim down your bulky wallets. We do so with the integrity and philosophy of always doing our best to deliver on time, with the best customer service. \nThe Original Dash Wallets\nAfter launching the Dash project, we were able to learn a lot more about the many aspects of crowdfunding. We've been working to improve every step along the way from production costs to shipment methods. This time around, backer rewards can be offered at an affordable pledge for better materials and the process of fulfillment will be much more streamlined. We have always delivered Dash products on time and will continue to do so. And again, the design was inspired by you guys. That's the great thing about Kickstarter. Backers and creators can collaborate to create and deliver better products together. So thank you, Kickstarters.\nProduction:\nAfter numerous assessments on fabrics and blueprints, we have finished designing the wallet using only one piece of material to ensure a minimal frame and durability for a final prototype. We can now start production of the wallets for the public. If successful, the timeline will go as follows:\nWeek 1-2: Gather information through surveys \nWeek 3-4: Organize logistics to start manufacturing\nWeek 8 : Quality control and checkpoints\nWeek 9-12 : Shipment to Kickstarter backers\nNavy Saffiano Leather\nYour Support:\nThis is where Kickstarter comes in again. We need your support to launch this line of wallets. We are raising funding for manufacturing, packaging, and logistics for the TRIM Wallet. Your support for the production of these wallets will help to make wallets trimmer all around you. Thank you for taking the time to check out the project.\nSharing it with loved ones takes only a second, and it would mean the world to us.

Projects often have trouble completing production and meeting the expected deadlines for shipment. The project could face possible challenges if the quality of the product or packaging does not meet our requirements. However, I will personally be in charge of assembling and shipping all of the pledge rewards as soon as we reach our goal. We will not be outsourcing the post-production work to another company. Our team is experienced and has been preparing for nearly a year to ensure that post-funding will be like clockwork when the time comes. Although we do not see any direct risks and challenges, there are always indirect or unseen tasks that may present itself during the process of productions.

While there were issues with the original DASH, DASH 2.0 was a better product in that the leather added some stability and style to the original. The sole issue with the DASH 2.0 was that the slot to slide your card out was not reinforced and therefore made it look cheap.

I am backing the TRIM Wallet as I think the Black Vegetable Leather looks like it fixes the sole issue I had with DASH 2.0 (the reinforced slot).

Not able to find a wallet that lets us carry the \u2018in-between\u2019 coins, we decided to make Poquito. A front-pocket wallet that carries your essential: cash, cards, and even coins. A little more than most, yet just enough to maintain a slim profile.\nIt is precision machined from one solid piece of wood - with a custom molded elastomer strap that securely holds everything in place. Each and every Poquito wallet is hand polished, making it a pleasure to handle all-day everyday.\nWood Selection\nBlack Walnut\nGrains are usually straight but patterns such as curl, crotch, and burl can also sometimes be seen. With a moderate natural lustre that will develop patina shine with use. Colour can sometimes have a grey, purple, or reddish cast. Black Walnut is rated highly in terms of durability and decay resistance. Sustainably harvested in Ohio, Midwest US.\nWhite Oak\nColour can vary from nearly white to light brown. Olive cast is often seen with prominent ray fleck pattern. Grain is coarse with larger pores - a prominent feature on Oak. White Oak is very durable, and is often used in boatbuilding. It also has a mellow odour common in Oak, that most people find appealing. Sustainably harvested in New York state, US.\nBlack Cherry (Subject to Stretch Goal)\nClose grain and smooth fine texture. Mostly straight but curly grain patterns are not uncommon. Over time and with exposure to light, the wood will darken into deep golden brown. Black Cherry is well known for being an all-around wood in terms of durability and workability. With high resistance to decay. Sustainably harvested in Ontario, Canada.\nPoquito's quick access groove lets you get to a frequently used card with ease.\nWhite Oak & Black Walnut\nMolded elastomer strap to securely hold up to 6 cards and some cash (Inside and outside)\nPledging for Additional Strap\nEach wallet comes with one strap as a standard (unless we get to our 1000 backers stretch goal). If you'd like to get an additional strap/s please follow the guide to pledge the correct amount:\nCoins are inevitable. We made a little compartment for it - just in case\nPrecision machined wood interior\nThe Madera logo is debossed on the strap and laser-etched on the wood.\nOur Story\nA Modern Wallet\nFor us the ideal wallet is a wallet that we enjoy having in our pocket, feel in our hands, and that simply works. We want something to help us carry 'enough' of the essentials without bulking up our pocket. Poquito is the result of a year designing, prototyping, and refining every details. Making it something we truly enjoy using - everyday.\nBy backing this project you will help us to make our first order and pay for the tooling with an experienced manufacturer. Ensuring the highest of quality and control in production.\nWood & Sustainability\nWood apart from being one of the oldest material known to man, also leave behind smaller carbon footprint and in some cases negative footprint (trees use and store carbon to grow). Requiring less to process in comparison with leather or metal - and continues to store carbon until it is released by burning it.\nEvery Poquito wallet is heat treated, precision cut, hand polished and sealed - to ensure a wallet that will compliment you for years to come.\nMadera = Wood\nOur passion for wood drives us to challenge the convention of what is possible with wood products. We believe in simple and honest design that works to improve our everyday life. We want to make products that create lasting relationship with the users. Wood objects that are made to be loved and to last.\nProcess & Materials\nWe set out to create an open-back shell and rubber strap wallet with ultra simple construction that eliminates unnecessary dividers. With this we wanted to make sure that the cards will still be highly accessible. We prototyped countless straps to ensure the balance between elasticity and reliability. Opting to use molded rubber straps instead of woven elastics for better control in production.\nWalnut, Oak, and Cherry are well known for their workability and resistance to decay. An important factor for us to consider - as the wallet will be exposed to humidity, contact, and everyday wear.\nAn early aluminium sheet mock-up\nProduction Schedule\nAfter a few months of intensive prototyping, we have arrived at a finalised form/function that we are satisfied with. With a successful project at Kickstarter, we will rapidly move to manufacturing and delivery.\nDecember: Final product refinements. \nJanuary: Finalise manufacturing requirements & place order. \nFebruary: Quality control procedure. \nMarch: Final QC checks and delivery.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have dedicated countless of hours working together with an experienced manufacturer - trying to mitigate as much risks in all aspects of the product. Although we understand that there will be unexpected challenges along the way, we are confident that we will be able to deliver as per our projected plan.\n\nWith mailing in larger quantity there are always going to be risks. Despite this we will always keep our support line open, and let our backers know of where everything stand.\n\nWe'll keep things transparent and inform our supporters of any hurdles/delay along the way.

But wouldn\u2019t it be even smarter if it were yours?\nPLUGAWAY produces simple-to-use, super affordable Smart Plugs & LED Bulbs, that let you wirelessly control and monitor your home from your phone - Even better, it will be open & firmware free. \nPLUGAWAY hardware. It's everything our backers wanted and it's here! \nWe studied many of the smart home electronics available today and made PLUGAWAY more compact, more intuitive, more open, and most importantly, much more affordable than anything else out there!\nPlugaways already come with a pre-built, free app for the Android and iOS - it has all the basics and is so simple to set-up, it's anxiety-free!\nYet we've gone even further: We have decided to let everyone, including small firms, interior designers, developers, restaurant owners, even hobbyists, build an app in their own style with limitless functionality, share their skins on our website and brand the software with their logotypes. In short - to give it your personality. \nSimply connect it to any appliance(s) you want, and start Plugging Away!\nWithin moments of taking a PLUGAWAY out of the box, it syncs with your Wi-Fi network and gives you these basic, simple and clear functions:\nSome Practical Examples of using PLUGAWAY...\nYou're late for work and running out of the house. With PLUGAWAY you can relax. Why? \n\n-> Because with a single tap on your smartphone, you can switch off or on anything you want in your home - by category (such as living room or bedroom) or specifically \u2013 like the coffee maker burning that leftover brew in your kitchen!\nOr what if you keep receiving those electricity bills that just don't make sense, or your family restaurant really needs to be more economically efficient?\n\n-> Now you can know exactly what is costing you what, by hour or day or month\u2026we're already started looking at a 3-phase smart plug for those big pizza ovens, if you thinking what we're thinking :)\nOr what if you want to personalise various moods for different occasions like movie night, party time, or even something more personal?\n\n-> with PLUGAWAY, you can easily set any theme presets that you want, and by simply tapping that theme, your home will take on your personality. \nSelect (or schedule) any mood you've set up for yourself!\nHere\u2019s the BIG DEAL of being OPEN:\nWe're finalising the hardware (waiting for your feedback) and readying it for certification and production. But we'd like to go one dimension further. \nWe want to make this completely open - yes - that means\u2026\n1. Sign it and make it your own: Great for interior designers, restaurant owners, or developers who want to create their own brand. Have your own logo on the app.\n2. Bundle your own app: pre-select any features you want, or will ever need, from our open library - just drag&drop presets, settings, skins, and click 'compile app'. \n3. App sharing: Create you own rules and develop your own app to share with other Plugaway users!\n4. Integrate it: Link it with anything you can think of - this means IFTTT or pair it with your existing smart-home devices or systems (as long as they're open too)\n5. Secure it: As secure as it is, maybe you want additional settings or passwords, adding users - limited or full control - it's really up to you!\n6. Dream it: So, here's the real point. It's entirely up to you what you want to do with it. It's not about having a \"Plugaway\" brand on your smart plug or phone app. Give it your name, we don't mind - it's yours! :)\nHearing about our smart LEDs and open app, video production company Goldshore Media (GS|M) have already shared with us their thinking about where lighting can go. Check this out:\nAmazing possibilities of our open app and hardware!\nSome more examples... \nSocial sharing of themes/skins/moods/actions/firmware, and developers corner, will be available on www.plugaway.co. Look out for news of its opening!\nOur open software means two things. Developers are able to integrate other devices into the app and share their add-ins. The other is that Plugaway will also be compatible with other systems, so you don't even need to use our app unless you absolutely want to! Provided your existing system is open, you may use the Plugaway app's API to connect with your current home-automation system.\nKickstarter is all about empowering the entrepreneurial spirit and gearing creative ideas into real action. It does this by facilitating communication between creators, encouraging the sharing of ideas, and helping us to support each other. It\u2019s easy for a big business to consume and dominate a market. However, we believe that we have something here and we want to share it with you. We want our homes to be ours, and not some corporate machine's. And we believe that you want the same.\nWe don't want to govern the function on your app, that's why we're asking you to help develop it. We don't want to brand your home. We want you to be able to personalise your home.\nWe are doing Kickstarter because of you. Our goal is to raise $50,000. This money will not be used for covering protoyping, production, or material costs. Rather, we will be building on your Kickstarter comments, feedback and pledges, and reinvesting it into the project to make Plugaway the most awesome and open smartplugs and smart LED's on the market. This looks like:\n(60%) passing BS, CE, UL and more quality certification standards\n(20%) paying software engineers to continue improving the app and make it open\n(10%) developing an online library for sharing designs and ideas\n(10%) Kickstarter commission and tax \nWe also need you to help us share this dream. The only way for us to do this, is with your help and support.\n\nEvery comment and pledge counts. \nAs said in the video, smart homes are really amazing but many feel that existing systems are too costly, bulky and limited.Our journey starts from a humble beginning; from a married man with a dream. Encouraged by his wife to follow his personal passion for entrepreneurship, mobile technology, and Wi-Fi connectivity, Richard Cai invested his personal time and energy to free-up his home, and put it onto his smartphone.\nThese actions birthed the PlugAway Project. Initiated under a personal conviction and desire, PlugAway has changed from being a personal dream to a shared vision by a continually growing group of people. Now, we\u2019re inviting you to join the journey! That\u2019s why we are handing you a new, simple and transparent device that you can personalize and call your own. After all, it's for your home!\nOf course the pledges are important and we could not continue without them, but we also want to hear what you guys think about our product and ideas. Don't hesitate! Feel absolutely free to contact us with any questions, comments or ideas you may have. We will be grateful for any feedback and will do our best to answer any message as soon as we can.\nLooking for more app pics or insights into the hardware? We\u2019re going to be posting video updates on our Facebook and Youtube pages with more peeks into the real deal as it's happening.\n3rd November 2013, EVENT Update\nPRODUCT DEVELOPMENT UPDATE #1 - Setup\n 5th December 2013, Project Update\n 1. THE SMARTPLUG SHELL\nWe started by creating a big prototype. Shortly after that, we made it into a working smart plug! However, because our backers came with so many good ideas, we decided to pause our previous campaign, and implement all those suggestions. Think we've done it this time!\n[2012.12.10] From Conception to Creation!!\n[2013.03.15] Time to put the big thing into a smaller thing\n[2013.04.03] With all the components ready, we put it all together\n[2013.04.15] Our first version of the Plugaway - ver.1.0\n[2013.07.15] We took your feedback and returned to the drawing board...\n[2013.07.26] And we came up with this! The Plugaway ver. 2.0\n[2013.08.09] Then we modified our design for international markets\nWe've made Type-F, Type-I, Type-G, & Type-B plugs\nThe above pictures show hollow shells and for reference only. There'll need to be certain changes made, such as inserting the PCB! The pictures show appearance and dimensions, we'll need to add grounding pins and do some further work before the Schuko plug is ready.\nBecause of our backers support, we were able to make a black casing as well!\nOur aim is for the smartplug itself to run on only 0.2W and as we are still prototyping, this will need confirmed in a later update. Prototypes are supporting 2500W. In a home scenario with a regular small stereo with standby wattage at 6W, annual energy saving could equate to 53.2kWh at $4.82 saving. Larger appliances such as ACs and TVs can drain several dollars per day if not turned off. Modern appliances are increasingly energy efficient, however energy prices have risen 150% in the past 10 years (UK) and are continuing upwards!\nFridges and freezers may also be connected to Plugaway. Not that you\u2019ll turn them off. But if your freezer breaks down, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to receive a Plugaway alert message before you lose everything in the freezer? Depending how well you stock your freezer, that alert message could save over $100\u2019s.\nOur current Plugaway units are single input devices. You may connect a power strip into a Plugaway, though this will control all appliances at once. We are considering a power strip as a stretch goal. Though more on this in an update later.\n2. THE PLUGAWAY PCB\n[2013.02.02] We designed our first circuit board\n[2013.07.03] After our first Kickstarter campaign, we made it smaller\n[2013.08.03] We also incorporated your suggestions about adding an LED ring\n[2013.09] We all love the colour spectrum of the led-ring - so we've it the best with fiber optics!\nOur shell exterior is complete and we're finalising the PCB - making sure to take on board your comments as we do. We've already received some great feedback and will be considering some changes as follows:\nCAPACITOR: Our prototype pictures show a combination of capacitors (models: 1000U DIP_2.54, 100U X1210, and 1U X0603). However, as we will be applying for RoHS, which relates to the material composition of components, it also infers a consideration towards component quality. We recognise that this inference currently does not align with the quality of capacitor in our shown prototypes and feel that a higher grade capacitor will better ensure long-term durability. We shall confirm our final capacitor selection in a pending update\nCPU: For similar price optimisation, we have chosen the ATmega128 CPU as it utilises a low-power AVR 8-bit Microcontroller and offers a performance that satisfies all of the requirements for efficient control. During prototyping, we have emphasised design, quality and stability. Though we recognise that energy efficiency is important for providing maximum value to you as a user. We will be exploring ways to further improve its energy consumption before release. Our aim is for 0.2W, but this is subject to change depending upon further modifications. The question concerning balance between efficiency and affordability is a critical question, and we take great care when making our decisions.\nWIFI CHIP: The above pictures show connection to an 802.11b/g network via a Marvell 88W8686 Wi-Fi chip, originally chosen due to lower cost (meaning cheaper prices for you). However, our final model will connect to an 802.11n network to offer increased range. The exact Wi-Fi chip to be used is still to be determined. Furthermore, our choice for Wi-Fi technology over bluetooth permits increased range and allows each Plugaway to have a separate IP address, offering potential for 252 Plugaway\u2019s to be connected to a standard single household network. \n3. THE SMART LEDS\nThe internal LEDs are type 14x3528, and are shelled within an aluminum electroplated cooling housing with a silver finish.The bulb is custom made by Iwan to overcome common heating problems. \n\nA key component of this cooling principle is to use the ectoplasm aluminum due to its higher heat disapation and ability to direct heat away from the LEDs faster than other materials\n[2012.12] Iwan checks out the cooling body on his first prototype\n[2013.08] We explored the opportunities of making a Smart LED\n[2013.09.06] We made the PCB even smaller and tested it with LED bulbs..\n[2013.10.11] Our smart LED bulb, looking good so far...but more still to be done\nThe custom made frosted acrylic LED bulb is fully compatible with each of the out-of-the-box features above (scheduling, energy monitoring etc), the LED bulb uses just 6Ws of power and an estimated lifespan of 30,000 hours. At a 450-500lm output it compares to a regular 50W halogen bulb, thus able to provide energy savings of 85%. It also has an A++ energy label and its E27 fixture is the most regular and common bulb fixture around. What does E27 mean? Named after the designer, this 'Edison Screw' (E) tip bulb has a diameter of 27mm (27).\nIwan has been experimenting with a wide range of bulb designs since 2004, which has seen him work on some interesting projects including a car showroom, underwater pool lights, and just plain old weird architecture, as well as regular interior design projects. The bulb used for this project was first prototyped by Iwan in December 2012 (as shown above). Following Plugaway's first Kickstarter campaign, Iwan and the Plugaway team started collaborating together since June to produce the smart LED (name to be chosen by you!). Plugaway then utilised Iwan's LED design expertise and modified their wi-fi technology to fit the PCB inside the bulb, as well as offer a dimming function and are working on an RGB control option that will be fully revealed in a coming update. Footage from the first public demonstration will be uploaded on Youtube in mid-November. This Kickstarter bulb is just the first of many more designs to come. As further suggested below, we'll be looking together at integrating the LEDs into the default Plugaway app.\n4. SMART-PLUG POWER STRIP\nWhat's in the power strip?\n4X plug sockets (same geographical regions as regular smart plug)\n1X heat sensor (for monitoring room temperature)\n2X USB slots \n\nEach plug socket may be individually or group controlled from the smartphone app, or manually on the power strip. Each plug socket will have its own LED to indicate the socket state (on/off) Regular USBs use 500mA, but we\u2019ll look to offer up to 1.5A support (5volt and 7.5watt). As such, we\u2019ll have compatibility with an increased range of devices. The possibility of offering a USB data storage feature was also suggested. This sounded great. But to do this would require upgrading the CPU to handle data transfer, which would then require additional power for operation. As one of our key points is to reduce power consumption and facilitate energy saving, we seek to minimise our own power demands. There\u2019d also be additional security issues being raised during data transfer.\nFor the power strip, we won\u2019t personally be financing the development and will be looking for Kickstarter to cover the development costs. As such, we have budgeted a small margin into the pricing to cover arising costs. Equally, we\u2019re continuing with our theme of affordability, so we\u2019ll be noticeably cheaper than the majority of other smart power strips out there.\nThe general consensus has been favourable towards the classical power strip shape rather than a curved or cubed shape. We particularly like the succinct reasoning of Mark Rutledge, essentially highlighting factors including design speed, development cost and design complexity, as well as the regulatory environment, as favouring the classical strip.\nYou can read more on the progress in our updates\n5. APP DESIGN\nWhilst the Plugaway switch looks good, our free app is the backbone and central nervous system for everything that we're doing! We've spent (and are still spending) hours on optimising our app from a three-pronged approach that balances aesthetics, functionality and simplicity.\n[DIM/SWITCH] App Prototype ver 1.0, New concept, Prototype ver 2.0 (right)\nWe're currently developing for Android and iOS, but we aspire to have Windows available by summer 2014.\nYou can see from the above app shots that we have come a long way since our first prototype, and we're looking forward to showing you more as we progress throughout this campaign. \nOur summary schedule is:\nPresent - Jan 2014: Complete our freely downloadable app with core functions\nJan - Mar 2014: Develop a 'creative space' and open library on our website \nFeb - Mar 2014: Application to Google Play and the App Store\nApr 2014: App release...time to party!!!\nWe will also be providing free server access so that you can store your energy history. And just in case anybody is wondering, the smart plugs and lights will all be compatible with the app!\n5. FACTORY PRODUCTION\nThe Plugaway Project is overseen by Torrap Designs Limited, a public company registered in Australia. However, we're operating from mainland China. Why???\nOne of the biggest challenges for many hardware companies/projects is finding reliable, stable and suitable partners - particularly at the production level! We approached this challenge with simple logic, build a relationship with the factories. To do this, we set-up our office just a 45 minutes drive from two of Beijing's factory districts, employed locals, and make frequent visits.\nRather than frequently fly between continents, we changed continents!\nWe want our partners to work together to create a quality driven and sustainable supply chain. Being close to our future production partners is not merely enough. We require an Initial Factory Audit/Inspection as part of our factory selection process. The objective is to assist us with conducting due diligence throughout our supply chain; as we ourselves continually strive to meet our aim of being transparent and accountable to our multiple stakeholders. Our Initial Factory Audit/Inspection evaluates the capability of a Factory to produce products within a consistent and sustainable Manufacturing process.\nWithin the context of the above statement, sustainable refers to two areas. Firstly: a Factory\u2019s convergence with statutory United Nations (UN) and International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and documents on areas such as Safe, Healthy and Hygienic Working Conditions (ILO Convention No.155 and ILO Recommendation No.164); Adequate Wages and Compensation (ILO Convention No.26 and 131); No Excessive Working Time (ILO Convention No.1 and 14), and other areas as deemed appropriate.

In addition to our own onsite visit, this is importantly inferred through current receipt of relevant certification standards, such as ISO 9001.\nDuring prototyping, we have printed our PCBs with Beijing KDS Electronics Co., Ltd and our shell with Beijing Rapid Precision Tooling Co., Ltd. They are each well recognised and between them produce for companies such as Audi, Panasonic Electric, Sony and Volkswagen. Any changes to our suppliers will be disclosed within future sustainability reporting\nA note on certification: Assurance of quality goes well beyond receipt of certifications. However, we will still be applying for certification for each geographical market: America (UL498), Australia and New Zealand (AS3112), Britain (BS 1363), China (CCC) and Europe (CE 7/7). Note that some countries may not be covered under these certification standards. We will additionally opt for application towards a material certification standard (RoHS) and environmental standard (WEEE).\nFree Developer Kit to ALL!  \nWe're offering all of you an open-access zone where anyone and everyone can build their own styled and self-branded app. This will include an open access library that offers a range of presets for you to bundle together as you please, and also provides a space for you to show-off your app interface, skins, etc., and share it with other Plugaway users.\nPledge levels\nFor those who missed the early bird 20% discount rate, don't worry, Plugaway devices are still available at a great value.\nTimely fulfilment of our pledges to you means a lot to us!

Plugaway devices may be further protected by three rounds of passwords. First, your household Wi-Fi network password is required. Second, you can apply a password to your app. And thirdly, you can assign a password to any individual appliance. This for example, allows you to share control for all appliances with anyone you choose just by sharing your passwords; whilst, for example, also being able to prevent them from playing pranks and waking you by turning on your bedroom light during the night!\n\nMaintaining stability: Plugaway uses a server for three reasons. Firstly to allow phone control beyond the scope of your home network. Secondly, each device has a memory span of approximately 6 months. To ensure efficient operations, we upload information to the cloud and refresh the memory of your device. Third, few people have access to a personal server, so we provide server access for free. \nAlthough we'll be looking at renting space on international servers prior to launch (such as amazon), our current server is operated by WanWang (www.net.cn) in Zhejiang Province, China. This is for practical reasons as we have been developing the project in China. Well recognised as China's leading internet services provider, WanWang has one of the worlds\u2019 top IDC rooms with independent IP, optical access and line redundancy, INTEL multi-core server platforms and a DDT backup system. This is accompanied by its real-time monitoring system and equipment maintainance, supporting its 24/7 operational guarantee. Utilised by China's equivalent of Google (Baidu), Youtube (Youku), Twitter (Weibo) etc, WanWang's operational stability has a direct influence upon China's economic stability. As such, WanWang provide a 24/7 operational guarantee, and report 365 days of uninterrupted service annually. In the unlikely event of a server crash, your Plugaway devices will remain operational. However, we have programmed a default safety feature that will only permit recognised and secure networks to control your devices. This will usually be limited to your household Wi-Fi network. We shall review our international server selection before final launch and - in a similar style to above - provide rationale behind the decision. Note also that there's no obligation to use our server, it is simply there as a free service to regular users without their own personal server.

A physical switch to replace the app is not realistic as the device will general be stuck behind a couch or TV console.

Most of us still consider lighting in our home as a collection of lamps that produce light. But a collection of lamps doesn\u2019t necessarily create good lighting. Innr isn\u2019t about lamps. It\u2019s about great lighting, for every moment and every activity in your home. \nEver wondered how all those glossy interior design magazines manage to showcase these beautiful homes with the lighting just right?\nEver been put off by the price of a professional lighting plan? \nAt Innr we believe every home deserves great lighting at every moment of the day. It\u2019s why we\u2019re here: to make great lighting accessible to everyone. Outside you\u2019ve got the sun, inside you\u2019ve got Innr. \nHow does it work ?\nStep 1. The online Light Advisor\nAt Innr.com we'll create a personal online lighting plan for you, tailored to your home: \nSimply start by sketching the dimensions of your room\nIndicate where the room\u2019s fixed features are, such as doors and windows.\nAdd your furniture and any beautiful belongings you\u2019d like to accentuate.\nPress enter\u2026 \nand you have your personalised lighting plan. As well as all the products you need to make it happen, ready to be delivered to your home. \nGet your personalised lighting plan in three easy steps\nStep 2. Installation \nOnce your order has arrived you\u2019re ready for step two. Installation is quick and easy with the personalised lighting plan of your room and the contents of your order: state-of-the-art Innr LED spots, easy-to-install strips and bulbs, an internet bridge, and everything else needed to achieve the transformation of your room.\nStep 3. The Innr experience\nWith the installation complete, you\u2019re ready for the final step. After logging into your Innr account via the app on your smart device, you\u2019ll be shown tailor-made settings for different moods and activities, based on the personal lighting plan created for your room. \nWith a single screen tap you can adjust the lighting to fit your current mood or activity. For dining, relaxing, having friends round, working from home or doing homework with the kids. Innr provides great lighting for everything you do, including when you\u2019re doing nothing much and just want to relax. \nOther Innr benefits\nWhere do we stand ?\nWhat started with a vision to empower people to be able to create better lighting at home, has now materialized into fully functional software and prototypes that are ready for mass production.\nThe online lighting advisor has undergone numerous iterations and reviews with consumers and lighting designers to make sure that the interface is simple and the advice is top notch. We\u2019re happy with the results so we plan to release a beta version next month.\nWe've built many prototypes of the lighting products so we can be sure they deliver the lighting quality and ease of installation we promise. The designs have been finalized and the first tools have been ordered. We've been really fortunate to be able to work with an international team of outstanding design partners and suppliers who have thought with us every step of the way, using their experience gained from working for leading lighting and electronics brands.\nWhat's next ?\nIn four months' time we expect to deliver the first orders. While we continue to tweak the software, the biggest step now is to order tooling, start production and go through certification so that we can start shipping. Meanwhile we are working on brand development, marketing positioning, packaging, and all the other of other major details that are needed to bring Innr to life.\nThe planning:\nNovember: Tool making, pilot production & certification. Beta version light advisor live\nDecember: Start production. light advisor refinements\nJanuary: First shipments from supplier. Light advisor version 1.0 live\nFebruary: Start fulfillment Kickstarter rewards\nMarch: All Kickstarter rewards delivered\nWhy Kickstarter ?\nWe\u2019ve come a long way over the past year with the creation of Innr. We think it will revolutionize the way people light their homes. Your support will allow us to order tools and start up production so that we can make Innr available to you and everyone interested in personalised great lighting. More importantly, as part of the Kickstarter community, you'll not only be supporting us with crowd funding, but also with great ideas and feedback to help make Innr even better. We\u2019re keen to receive your sharp and insightful reviews. The claim we make is a substantial one, and we really want Innr to live up to it. Use it, test it, give us your thoughts.\nThe rewards\n The Innr team\nAn international bunch who all believe in the magical power of light to enrich homes and interiors. Our vision and passion lie in the desire to change the way people experience lighting.\nIn our 'office'\nThanks for your support !\nWe\u2019re delighted to be able to share the Innr journey with you, and hope you\u2019ll join us in our mission to change the way people think about lighting.

Innr, with its technical complexity, has been no exception. The good news is that some of the biggest risks on our journey in creating Innr now lie behind us. \n\nWe've had to develop software that can provide sound lighting advice and the results we believe in. We also wanted to develop top quality led products that are smaller than anything available on the market. To top it all, we wanted to develop a reliable wireless control system that could be programmed through the lighting advisor. We're proud to say we managed to achieve all of our objectives. Innr has been created thanks to a great team with the right experience and ambition and first-class suppliers who are ready to get going with manufacturing Innr for us. \n\nIn the next phase the main risks are in production delays, release test hiccups and software bugs. For the most typical risks, we have identified ways to minimize them and to resolve them if they should crop up. Nevertheless, you can never eliminate sheer bad luck. So we\u2019ve allowed for some slack in the production planning, if only to reinforce in our own belief that we\u2019ll be able to deliver on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "We are a step further in making our dream come true!", "update_content": "Hi Innr backers,\nThis is the update I\u2019ve been dreaming about for the last four weeks!

One night over drinks he taught her chess and shared with her his idea for a burlap, drawstring bag chessboard that he could easily carry with him anywhere. As a part of her \u2018homemade\u2019 Christmas in 2012, she made her version of his idea and together they decided to make this \u2018thing\u2019 happen. The name was easy, it was a chessboard you could stash and with her new found love of chess and her never ending love of mustaches, it was quickly named the Chesstache. Next the logo took shape; the rook being his favorite piece and the mustache, well... that was her. From there it was an evolution... Together they\u2019ve developed what they believe is a product that will change how the game is played because it will change WHERE the game is played. Without further adieu, this is Chesstache.\nOur mission at Chesstache is to introduce chess to a new audience or reintroduce it to those who may have forgotten. It is our goal to upcycle, reclaim, repurpose, and use minimal packaging wherever possible; convenience, style and mobility with an extremely low profile. Through the development of our handcrafted chessboards we believe we can make chess playable everywhere; from the coffee shop to the campground and everywhere in between. Each Chesstache will have its own personality and unique sense of culture-conscious style. Almost every step in production is done by hand and EVERYTHING is made in the USA. These points of difference will continue to be the driving force behind the development of our brand and goods.\nThe two boards currently available are made of cotton canvas. Specifically, repurposed Korean War and Vietnam War era military tarps and tents (The McArthur), and black cotton duck canvas (The Lincoln). We chose cotton canvas because of its durability and ability to withstand the test of time. We are looking to utilize additional fabrics in the development of future board styles, including mylar boat sails (The Hemingway) and leather (The Winchester), and we will continue to source other durable fabrics to make new boards from.\nThe squares are screen printed onto the boards using a flexible paint that will not crack or peel with the repeated folding and rolling of the board.\nDo you have an idea for a fabric you would like to see the Chesstache in? Are we missing your favorite color for the squares? Let us know (info@chesstache.com or post a comment here on Kickstarter), we\u2019d love to hear from you - you just might be the inspiration for a future board.\nIn order to make the Chesstache ultraportable we knew we had to rethink the traditional chess pieces. Originally inspired by Scrabble tiles, we set out to make our pieces out of round, flat, wood discs that we would stain and decorate with the shape or name of the chess piece. As our idea evolved we looked for a more substantial wood than the balsa, used for Scrabble tiles, and decided to source maple from Maine to make the Chesstache pieces. The final pieces will be stained, tumbled, and waxed with the shape of each piece heat branded into the wood.\nThe pieces are stacked in \u2018The Stache\u2019, a durable, soft-touch (rubberized) plastic tube with removable endcaps. The board is then wrapped around it and secured with a leather strap and buckle.\nThe images that you see below and on the video are only prototypes, The Stache and pieces are still in development and we are anticipating pictures of their final design in the coming days. We\u2019re really looking forward to sharing them with you.\nEach board will have a Chesstache label sewn into the side and include a leather strap  and buckle designed to match the style of board it will secure. The Chesstache will utilize minimal outer packaging, which will be consistent for both e-commerce and brick and mortar store sales.\nFrom the first burlap board that Laura made to where the product is today, it\u2019s been an evolution. We\u2019ve tested and retested, designed and redesigned. Below we\u2019ve shared a collection of pictures to illustrate the evolution the Chesstache has gone through.\nThe Chesstache has been busy, here are a few pics of its adventures...\nThe below graphic demonstrates how we will allocate your funding according to our business model.\nThe boards you may choose from are pictured below with renderings of the pint glass koozie and decals. You will notice a few levels of rewards seem to be the same. We've used what we call diminishing rewards to encourage early pledging. For example, on \"The Obchessed\" the first 15 backers at this level will get their reward for $65, the next 25 backers will get the same reward for $75, for the next 50 backers it's $85, and all other backers will receive the same reward for $95.

We will look to source as much as possible but understand that we do face some limitations and new fabrics will need to be found.

My exhibition will be at The Factory, a charming pop-up gallery/caf\u00e9 that serves amazing homemade ice-creams and mean fries! We plan for the show to last a month, featuring selected works from my 7 Elements series. \nMaking Between Earth and Void happen is really important to me. I\u2019m at the proverbial crossroads in life where I want to take that leap of faith and dedicate myself to professional art-making. Your support is crucial to giving me the courage to make this big step.\nI\u2019m a prodigal son who\u2019s returning to my art, having put it aside for 15 years - first to read psychology in university then for a career as a commercial writer. My homecoming was inspired by various friends who roped me into helping with their creative projects over the years. Their passion and energy fired me with a sense of possibility. The passing of a dear friend was the wake up call I needed to ask myself what I really wanted out of life.\nFor the past 7 years I\u2019ve been channeling time, energy, and effort into my art in the evenings while continuing with my day job in the office. I've now completed 2 series of works and have started working on the 3rd. (7 Elements is actually my second series although the first to be shown publicly).\nRen Zi working on \"7 Elements\"\nEarly experiments for the first series\n7 Elements is about how we are changed by memories. For me, elements are not fixed states but states of change. My works depict how we are affected by our memories and the changes wrought by time. I've been working on 7 Elements  for the past 18 months. After countless experiments with printing techniques and materials including aluminum, light-boxes and various mixed media, I\u2019ve finally completed a series I\u2019m happy with and produced a set of artist\u2019s proofs.\nHere are some of the works that you\u2019ll see in the show:\n\"Void #2\" (2012), digital print on bamboo paper, 80 x 80 cm, artist's proof\n\"Portal\" (2012), digital print on bamboo paper, 80 x 80 cm, artist's proof\n\"Earth #3\" (2012), digital print on bamboo paper, 80 x 80 cm, artist's proof\n\"Void #1\" (2012), digital print on bamboo paper, 80 x 80 cm, artist's proof\n\"Void #1\", gold leaf overlay (detail)\nNow comes the final phase of producing the actual prints and staging the show. That's where you come in. The funds raised from Kickstarter will go towards producing the final prints in signed and numbered editions of 6, and the costs of holding my first public exhibition at The Factory. Each work will be printed on archival-quality bamboo paper, measuring 80 x 80 cm. I chose bamboo paper for its beautiful texture. It brings out the soul of the works. It\u2019s also tough and resilient to humidity change, which preserves their beauty. \nI'm excited about bringing my works out of the studio into the public eye and getting feedback from the audience.\nMy dream is to devote myself to a full-time art practice.
