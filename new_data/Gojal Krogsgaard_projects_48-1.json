[{"backer": "Gojal Krogsgaard", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Retro Tea Breaks Vol.1 is a collection of interviews with pioneers who have helped shape the computer, console and video game industry.\nAs time passes, it is becoming more and more important that we record these voices and first-hand experiences while we still have access to them. That's my goal with the Retro Tea Break series, and within this book I hope to capture and share these fantastic memories and experiences with you all.\nThe first volume is completely written and ready for publication. The goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to raise the minimum amount needed to publish the book and put it in your hands \u2013 and there are some exciting extras too!   \nDigital impression (final product may vary slightly)\nComplementing the popular series of the same name on my YouTube channel,  I've carefully selected my favourite interviews to-date to be printed in a beautiful hardback book with a textured, foil-embossed cover, quality paper stock and premium finishing touches, including coloured head and tail bands in the spine of the book.  \nThe final book will have a head and tail band woven into the spine\nIn the book I introduce each guest and transcribe a conversation with them, exploring their life in the video game industry.\nThis volume includes 12 very special conversations with: \n The Oliver Twins (British 8-bit pioneers)\n Al Lowe (Sierra, Video Game Developer)\n George 'The Fat Man' Sanger (Composer, Freelance/Lucas Arts)\n Bill Volk (Developer, Activision/Avalon Hill)\n Francois Lionet (Developer, STOS/AMOS)\n Rob Hubbard (Composer, C64 Maestro/Electronic Arts)\n Stoo Cambridge (Artist, Sensible Software)\n Jon St. John (Voice Over Artist, Duke Nukem 3D)\n Mike Dailly (DMA, Grand Theft Auto/Lemmings)\n David Fox  (Developer, Lucas Arts)\nAnd \u2013 exclusive to the book \u2013 two new interviews with Chris Sawyer (Transport Tycoon, RollerCoaster Tycoon) and Ken Silverman (Build engine). \nI've worked with each guest to elaborate on their RMC channel interviews with footnotes and box-outs that further discuss points in more detail. I've also worked with a professional editor to present the interviews in a format that is enjoyable to read without removing the personality of each guest in the text, and the book features a glossy, full-colour centre section with photos provided by guests giving further insight into their time in the industry.\nThe result is a high-quality book that is designed to look great on the shelf but, more importantly, put in your bag and enjoyed on the go. This is not an unwieldy coffee-table book, but a handy reference packed full of first-hand experiences as told by the coders, artists, musicians and engineers who created the worlds we love.  \nDigital impression (final product may vary slightly).\nThe pixelated cherry on top is artwork by guest Stoo Cambridge of Sensible Software fame (Cannon Fodder, Sensible Soccer). I've commissioned him to draw portraits of each guest in his unique pixel-art style. They appear in each chapter of the book in greyscale, but will also be available in full colour as Tea Break collector's cards if you choose to buy the special set  available as a Kickstarter tier.  \nA pack of 12 Trading Cards illustrated by Stoo Cambridge\nAnd if you'd like to enjoy your own tea break while reading it, then why not pick up a limited edition 11oz mug with our guest portraits wrapped around it, hand pressed by Neil.    \nA closer look at the book and the mug! (design wraps around entire mug)\nAnd finally, for a limited number of backers,you can commission your very own Tea Break collector's card, drawn by Stoo Cambridge. You will receive five prints of your custom card and a digital file containing the portrait. It can be of you or a loved one you'd like to gift this unique reward to \u2013 just like this example featuring a picture of me!    \nA custom collector's card example.\nWe did it! We funded the production of the book! Thank you so much.  I've had a chat with the printers to come up with some goals to make it even better for you, so here are the stretch goals.\nIf we hit goal #1 I will add an as yet unseen interview with Mark Ferrari, formerly of Lucasfilm Games.  \nMark has a fascinating story to tell about his time creating art for such games as The Secret of Monkey Island and Loom. Tales from Skywalker Ranch, a near death incident and a life filled with adventure and good fortune can  be expected.  And yes, I did ask him about Loom(tm).\nIf we hit goal #2 a high quality ribbon bookmark will be stitched into the book at the printing press. Never lose your page again! I think this will really add to the overall quality of the production.\nI'd love to see us stretch to this goal. If we hit it I will design a timeline of key releases our guests have been responsible for. \nThis will be a full colour, double page fold out section (so twice the width of the book once unfolded). This will really help to see where the threads of the many stories come together, especially on those releases where multiple guests worked on the same titles.\nIf we stretch to this goal then I will take on the mammoth task of editing our interview with Richard Garriott into an additional, final chapter. \nRichard is a pioneering game developer who created the Ultima series, rode a rocket into space, visited the Titanic and so much more as a result of his success in the industry. This will be a huge and fitting finale for the first Retro Tea Breaks book if we can make it happen.\nAnd who knows, if Retro Tea Breaks Vol.1 is a success, maybe we can go on to create a whole series of future volumes that can take pride of place on your bookshelf and continue to document the lives of these historic figures while they are still available to share their stories with us.\nThank you for your help in making the publication of this book a reality.\nNeil - RMC   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk is minimal as the book has been written in full before starting this campaign.

This book starts at 300 pages. This art-book will be full of Nordic/Viking-age art, mainly from Scandinavia, but with some elements from other areas, such as the UK, where the Vikings had a lot of influence. It will have examples of the different styles, dissections of the styles and methods, and lots of new designs by Peter Blackhand.\nThere will be also be a chapter with the work of other Nordic artists, both illustrators, woodcarvers, tattooists and more.    \nVol II: The Historical Europa book, will be focused on other historical styles from all over Europe, with different chapters on the Celtic styles, Pictish, Anglo-Saxon, Petroglyphs and more. Some styles are geographically focused, such as the La T\u00e8ne, and the Pictish, while others more widespread. This book will hold most of the stretch-goals, including the Runes and Bindrunes. It starts on 60 pages, but will steadily grow as we proceed through stretch-goals.\nVol III: The manual on Nordic tattooing. A guidebook on how Peter Blackhand works, from easy-to-use designs and elements, to the methods on how to create a sleeve based on Norse designs. This will give you unique insight in his methods, and make any tattooist capable of creating Nordic and Historical tattoos with a great flow, and a level of precision unmatched. It will also be including segmented designs, so you can easily build a unique design of a dragon, wolf or wyrm. It should be mentioned that the skills and methods in this book will also be helpful to anyone into carving, woodwork, silver/metal-work and stonework.\nWho is it for? These books aims to become the books you must have if Vikings, Celts and ancient art is your thing, and for anyone interested in reenactment, tattoos, game-design, art, archaeology and history.    \nMock-up version of The Northern Wind Vol 1.\nWhen i started my career as a Nordic tattoo artist, I always hunted for that perfect book that could guide me on how to make better designs, how to understand the Nordic styles, how to be better at the runes and in general - How to master my trade. \nThis book, sadly, does not exist. Instead, i have a few shelf-meters of books on all these subjects, from museum catalogs to extraordinary books on the runes, in one of the Scandinavian languages.\nBut the lack of this book still nags me, and i know such a book could be of much use to so many artists and craftsmen out there, so with time the solution became rather simple - Make the book.     \nIf you choose to back this project, you have a wide range of choices when it comes to rewards: from minimal support, to heavy-end backing where you get both the book and tattoo time. We have added an overview below, to make it clear and simple.   \nAs of June 24th - There are now three more options to back, so we highly recommend that you have another look at your tier and ensure you make the right choice.\nPlease note - You can purchase more than one package, or several of the same, you just need to contact us and we will guide you through it.\nWhat if you cannot back it now? There will be an option to buy the book at a later date from my web-shop and hopefully from museums and bookshops, so have no fear. It will not be at these prices of course, and it will not contain the rewards, prints and stretch-goals that are available through Kickstarter as backer initiative items - but will retain all other core content.  \nMy tattoo-work has always been inspired by the historical art of the Bronze-age, Iron-age and early middle ages, mixed with the fantasy illustrations of my youth, playing Dungeons & Dragons and inhaling computer games.\nI ended up tattooing after a 7 year long career making props and monster-suits for theatre and LARP. It was wonderful to attach my skills for \"real 3D\" to something as dedicated as tattoos, but the change in career threw me onto a new path of learning. I began making ornaments that were more \"real\" and was figuring out how to re-apply the shapes and form-language of historical art to the dynamics of the human form and skin. \nSince then, I have been blessed with projects that have introduced me to everything from the obscure styles of small European tribes, to the madness of late Irish-Celtic scripture illustrations, on an on-going search for the wonderful form-languages of past civilizations.\nThe works of Paul Bonner, Alvaro Tapia, Colin Dale, Eric Reime, Brom and many many more has all influenced me in so many ways, not all of them Nordic, but each towards where i am today, and i hope to be able to gift this offering of inspiration back to you all, in the form of these books.\nSince we launched, we have already met a pile of stretch-goals.

Updated shipping info, Zestrea End of Kickstarter Party, special End Campaign deals & Campionatul Interna\u021bional de Zestrea p\u0103 Sate - read all about it here!\nZestrea is a marriage negotiation board game for 3-6 players about ridiculous Romanian traditions, arranging weddings, and surviving Hard Times.\nZestrea is an original Romanian boardgame developed over many iterations for the past year, playtested hundreds of times and polished relentlessly. Zestrea is READY and now we want to make it available to a worldwide audience.\nRemember that Zestrea digital glossary we said we're making? We will turn it into a gorgeous digital book, all ripe with Maria's art, much more funny stories and facts about our crazy Romanian traditions ... and lots of Romanian jokes!\n\nWho still reads nowadays? Toss the manual (well not really!) and let us make a high quality short video guide you can watch with your friends for a quick Zestrea onboarding. Infographic style, funny, short!\nWe already can promise superior print quality. But with this goal, we will go overboard! Sturdier Zestrea box, thicker cards and high quality, awesome feel print! We'll invest all the extra zestre you give us in the best possible print quality for everyone!\nTypical setup in Zestrea: villagers living on the player's Land.\nZestrea means dowry in Romanian and represents the wedding gift/inheritance, usually in the form of household goods such as bedding, plates and cutlery, carpets, etc., given to a young couple by their families, when they get married.\nNote: Zestre is the currency in the game, meaning \"one dowry\". ZESTREA with an \"A\" means \"The Dowry\".\nOne of these Boyars could be YOU!\nIn Zestrea, players take the role of Boyars (Boieri), who were nobles from the middle ages. The goal of the game is becoming the richest Boyar, while taking care of the villagers living on your Land. The way to do this is through honest work and deals, and not-so-honest scheming and backstabbing...\nZestrea may cause certain facial expressions and gestures\nThe Boyars are responsible for the welfare of their villagers, Lads and Maidens. They are the ones who work the Boyar's Lands, make babies and suffer hardships, all part of traditional village life. \nYou can play Zestrea right now at a few board game cafes: the Scout House Cluj, the Oldschool Cafe also in Cluj, Romania, and Bastard Cafe in Copenhagen, Denmark. We left prototypes there for people to enjoy ahead of launch. We are also showing Zestrea at Essen SPIEL Messe - Yay! \nZestrea in a real Zestrea hand made original & unique miniature box (included in The Earl's Dowry's reward and onward)\nAre these board game cafes too far away from you? While we manage to print and ship Zestrea games to more board game cafes, you can watch a marathon 3 hours session played by the Twitch streamer MoominFly and her friends right here!\nCheck out a short clip from the stream. WARNING. LOUD NEGOTIATIONS AHEAD. \n Help us spread the Zestrea word! We prepared a handful of pretty social media avatars for you to use if you want to! Become a Boyar, Lad or Maiden! We are adding just 3 here, but HERE is the complete pack!\nAre you a streamer, journalist or just have a nice YouTube channel? Contact us and we'll do our best to send you a Zestrea copy!\nAre you press who wants to play Zestrea? Reach out!\nZestrea contains the following cards and a die, and is played as a tabletop game with most cards on the table at all times:\n 84 villager cards (42 Lads and 42 Maidens)\n 80 Zestre/Land cards\n 35 Fate cards\n 15 Hard Times cards\n 3 Good Times cards\n 6 Boyar cards for quick info\na 6-sided die \na manual and a digital glossary \nZestrea unpacked - three player setup and box contents\nZestrea is a game for 3-6 players, for ages 12 and up. A session takes roughly 45-90 minutes, depending on player count and negotiation style.\nDownload a copy of the instructions manual right here, in English or Romanian.\nZestrea Instructions Book PDF (English)\nZestrea Instructions Book PDF (Romanian)\nNote: this is a near-final version of the rule book, so please send us your feedback! We will also add a digital Glossary (Glossariu) that lists all cards and terminology alphabetically\nPlayers compete against each other and the State/status quo, to become the richest Boyar, or rather sometimes, not starve to death... The tables can turn any time, up to the last round, if you have a good strategy and adaptive play style. \nThe different card stacks in Zestrea, representing The State.\nEach player begins with 3 Lands on their domain and a Couple made of a Lad and Maiden living on the first Land.\nThe initial Boyar's estate, for each player: One Couple (Lad and Maiden) and 3 Lands.\nThe initial couple will end up making some babies, who grow into villagers that must be fed and can get married, and that's where the troubles start.\nMultiple turns are played in a single Zestrea game, and a turn is divided in steps. You can tell how many turns are left by counting how many Hard Times are left in the stack.\nThe game starts off easy, with 3 Good Times, and everything goes downhill from there with 5 Hard Times. Events such as floods, invasions, communism or bandits can reverse the odds and make the game >>interesting<<. They are all humorously inspired by reality.\nDuring the Production step, each player rolls the die for each Couple that works the Land. Based on the roll, the Couple produces Zestre and babies (extra villagers).\n A Fate card is revealed from the State stack, and Boyars can bid on it by offering Zestre. First come, first served, whoever bids the most gets it.\n The main part of Zestrea. Here, players have free-form negotiations to marry their unwed villagers, in order to get more productive Couples or... simply to try to get rid of them before they cause too much trouble.\nThey also buy and play Fate cards on each other, which can create prosperity for one, create poverty for one's rival, and generally make and break friendships as the game shifts in unexpected directions.\nSome players steal Land... or steal the bride... While others try to produce moonshine, go trucking in Italy, or work another's Land, as a way to make more money. The villagers might also die in Bar Fights, get eaten by the dog, and for all that, the Village Preacher gets a salary... \nIn this step, many many promises are made, some of which the players actually keep... \nThe players feed their Lads and Maidens, by paying Zestre for the ones that don't have Land under their feet. When they run out of Zestre, they are forced to lose Land, and eventually villagers might starve to death...\nNote: the players cannot be removed from the game from playing it poorly (or from having bad luck), and there is always a chance they can recover from the lowest point, with one Land and one Couple.\nPictured are two Boyars suffering from pretty Hard Times (they each have nothing left, except the minimum one Land and one Couple).\nMarrying villagers is the core gameplay of Zestrea. It is highly engaging as only villagers from different estates can marry. Weddings attempts happen on dice roll, and they each cost 2 Zestre per roll - either paid by one of the players, or split between the two. Weddings can succeed or fail on a dice roll and certain Fate cards improve the marriage chances.\nSome Fate cards can give villagers roles: the Musician is valuable, while the Village Idiot makes life harder...\nThe Musician Fate card can be attached to any Villager, and players can use the Musician to make the roll more likely to succeed (1, 2 or 3), and they may ask for Zestre for this service to other players. Always hire a Musician!\nHere's what happens to Lads that don't behave...\nThe Hard Times happen once per turn and make life difficult for the Boyars and their villagers.\nHard Times. The Bandits steal all your girls.\nThere are 15 Hard Times in total (and 3 extra Good Times that are always played at the start of the game), but only 5 are played per game, making each session different than the next, and creating new stories players can role play for much added fun.\nHard Times are inspired from real life but not too seriously.\nFate cards are the Boyar's way of rebelling against the odds, and trying to take life into their own hands. Some are also schemes and tricks they can perform on other Boyars, but they are diplomatically dubious to say the least...\nThere are 35 unique Fate cards in the game, all inspired from funny little happenings and stories from our culture. The way they were designed usually begins with the story (\"What if you could work the land of another player while you were drunk?\"), and then a mechanic would be discovered that fit with the narrative on the card (\"The Boyar feels responsible to pay for the work, even if it's for nothing.\") and playtested until it works.\nA part of the Fate cards in the game. All unique, except for 3 Musicians (those are a central part of the game, and possibly the most fun interaction in the game)\nSome Fate cards are roles that can be applied to villagers for life (aka play session). The villagers gain abilities that can be used in the Boyar's favor, or make life more difficult.\nThe emergent storytelling that happens due to the Fate cards mechanic is a central part of the Zestrea experience, and makes the game surprising and unpredictable for every new play. It is inspired from roleplaying games as well as our personal history and humor - we tried to make a game that we love to play.\nThe villagers with a role have a Fate card under their card, and the role (for example, Midwife, or The Village Preacher) appears next to their name.\nThe Zestrea game is ready to go in production. It has been prototyped, designed, iterated upon, play tested and improved since September 2018, in Romania and Europe (Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Germany, with people from countries around the world via conferences and festivals). We feel the game is ready and we have the first finished copies in our hands. We want to start mass production and this Kickstarter grants you the chance to be the game's first proud owners.\nZestrea Box - pre-release printed hand-assembled edition [not final production quality]\nWe are self-publishing! We want to keep Zestrea authentic, to have full control on the message and theme - the Romanian touch, and also learn from the experience of launching it.\nOur tone and humor includes sensitive topics (marriages, sexuality, gender roles) - we have worked hard to tweak the game mechanics to support the type of interactions that are respectful and considerate to people from all backgrounds, while poking fun at the absurd and hilarious parts of history and tradition.\nWe prepared 10 reward tiers to satisfy any kind of Boyar! Most of them are physical rewards - we will ship you the game & goodies! - and besides the love and care invested in every printed Zestrea box, we will work with local Romanian artists to craft traditional Romanian items. All physical rewards are unique and hand crafted. \nA beautiful hand crafted Zestrea wooden box\nWhy SEK? Even though this game is made by a Romanian team, Kickstarter does not operate in Romania. Luckily, Hora\u021biu is based in Denmark and Laura co-founded her own gamedev studio based in Sweden. So we decided to host Zestrea from Sweden via Valiant Game Studio AB as a publisher. \nFunny note: What's with the wheat? In Romania, it symbolizes \"bel\u0219ug\" which means wealth - so besides the fact that we like the way it looks, we use it as a good omen for this campaign!\nLimited Celebratory Valiant Special reward!

There can only be 12 printed Boyars so this is a very special, very limited reward!\nA traditional handmade Romanian messenger bag to carry your Zestrea\nThis is super important: please be aware that all rewards DO NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING COSTS, which will be added when the campaign has ended. \nThe reason we chose to do this is because shipping is always super complicated and expensive, and we are really really struggling to keep shipping costs as low as possible. We can do that if we print in bulk, so if this campaign is wildly successful, we will be able to secure a much cheaper shipping - since we will have a large bulk to work with, and fulfilment and shipping companies are far less expensive per item, the more items you work with.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\nSince most the team is in Romania, we estimate that we will have the lowest shipping costs for Romania. Until we find the best fulfilment company and shipping services, here are our estimates on shipping costs. Please keep in mind that we cannot guarantee them, but we promise with all our hearts that we will work diligently to find the best shipping deals possible. \nThe game box has been designed to be small and portable so it's easy to take your Zestrea game anywhere and play with your friends! The size we are going for is 15x10x5cm, as seen in the hand-made prototypes in the images. \nZestrea box with all its contents tightly packed. Designed to be portable and easy to handle. [note: not final production quality]\nSo why do we want your real-life Zestre?\nThe main reason for which we decided to start a Kickstarter campaign for Zestrea is to be able to print the game. Most printing companies start an order at 1000 copies and we really hope we will find at least 1000 Boyars interested in our game! By pledging 25 dollars or more, you are essentially buying a copy of the game, with added benefits. The more money we can raise, the more copies we will be able to print, and the higher quality! \nThis is where your Zestrea will go!\nWe also hope to cover some expenses that we currently struggled to pay - particularly for marketing, including the events we attended to create awareness about Zestrea. Lastly, of course, we want to be upfront with you: it would be really nice if we get some Zestre for all the time we spent making this game! But the main priority is to deliver Zestrea into the trustworthy hands of as many Boyars as possible!\nZestrea started as a game jam project at Clujotronic Game Jam 2018. Inspired by the theme \"inheritance\", the game was about arranging marriages by rolling dice to see if the couples agree to get married, while the families starve due to catastrophes - floods, communism, Genghis Khan, etc.\nFirst Ever prototype of Zestrea at Clujotronic 2018.\nThe audience at Clujotronic played it extensively on the final day of the jam. Zestrea received praise for its humor and interaction mechanics. We won second place in the competition we did not know was happening, and our simultaneous reaction was \"We can print more prototypes!\"!\nA second old iteration of Zestrea, in November-December 2018, at BGCon T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219, a boardgame festival in Romania.\nLater, as we played it more, we created more depth and strategy by the addition of Fate cards, that the players can invest in during the game, to create more interaction, and use the mechanics in new ways.\nThe Pixel version of the prototype, made in winter 2018, seen here in Copenhagen, Denmark, Scout House in Cluj, Romania, and Nordic Game Conference in Sweden.\nThe game evolved from the early iterations towards having more streamlined mechanics that are easy to understand, and create fun interactions, not base their humor on jokes.\nZestrea with the pixel art prototype in Iceland, with the newest art in Gamescom in Cologne, Germany, and again in Copenhagen, summer 2019\n We have also thought about the type of humor we want to portray, and have adapted the game towards making it more inclusive and appropriate for a diverse audience. For example, in the early game, the sex of the characters was more imbalanced as a game mechanic, i.e. the maidens used to be less valuable than the lads, due to the way weddings were made in the game at that time. We tried to fix this because we did not want to represent this inequality, whether or not it accurately represented history. We succeeded (according to our playtesters and many people of various genders and backgrounds) to make that problem go away, by balancing the mechanics and giving Fate cards when Maidens get married, which improved the gameplay and interactivity at the same time.\nAll prototypes of Zestrea since its inception one year ago, presented at Clujotronic 2019, Cluj, Romania\nWe made a few iterations of the game over time, and at Clujotronic 2019 edition, we celebrated Zestrea's 1 year anniversary. We prepared five panels with the old game prototypes, see more on the blog.\nPlease note that you DO NOT have to get married if you want to play Zestrea!\n The team is made of Hora\u021biu Roman and Alex Pa\u021biu, the two game designers that met at Clujotronic Game Jam 2018 and came up with Zestrea, Maria Surducan who made the beautiful artwork that elevates the game to the next level, and Laura Bularca, who handles planning, PR, marketing and the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe Zestrea team after a good video session in September. We had to photoshop Laura in because we didn't manage to gather the full team yet in one place, only 3 at a time.\nDear Boyars! We - Hora\u021biu, Maria, Alex and Laura, the Boyars behind Zestrea - would like to say a big and warm Thank You! Thank you for being with us in this adventure, thank you for visiting our campaign, and THANK YOU for making Zestrea come to life!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf you're new to Kickstarter: You can support our game by selecting one of the rewards we prepared for you. If we reach our funding goal, you enable us to produce the game in every detail according to our vision, and cover our current expenses. The amount of money you want to spend will only be collected if we reach our goal and you will receive your rewards once the game is released. If we fail to reach our goal though, your account won't be charged at all.\n\nSince Zestrea as a game is ready, our biggest risk lies in choosing a good quality and reliable printing company. We have already selected a handful of production companies and are satisfied with the quality of the prototypes we have in our hands. Final negotiation will happen at the end of the campaign where we will settle for the amount of printed copies and we will try to maximize the quality of materials based on the budget.\n\nNote: the final box might differ slightly from the images seen on this campaign, as those were made by hand. Rest assured we will focus on a high quality box at portable size.\n\nOur other risk and biggest worry is making sure the games get shipped to you safely and affordably. For this, we are currently negotiating with fulfilment companies. Because the more we print, the lowest the cost to ship per reward, we DID NOT INCLUDE SHIPPING COSTS in your pledge. We will keep you up to date at all times here, on our social media and on direct channels about your product and you will be able to track your package. If there are any unexpected delays, we will be sure to communicate with you and be honest and transparent about our process.\n\nFor rewards, we depend on local Romanian artists whose artistry might take more time than planned.

It seems we are indeed the ones we've been waiting for.\nOnce again, THANK YOU.\nMax Lugavere and kNow Productions\nDementia is, without question, horrible. There\u2019s no way around it. It robs us of the essence of who we are. Currently, there are over 5 million people in the US who have Alzheimer\u2019s, the most common form of the disease, and it costs the nation $200 billion per year. Those numbers are expected to triple by the year 2050. Worldwide, there are 45 million with the disease, and a new case is diagnosed every 4 seconds. \nBut for me, dementia transcends statistics. It\u2019s personal. Three years ago, at age 59, my mom began having serious difficulty with her cognition. Scratching our heads in bewilderment, we did what anyone would do, and decided to see a neurologist. Because her symptoms were atypical, the diagnosis was unclear, and it sent us around the country to some of our nation's top neurology departments to figure out what she had.\nMe and mom, circa 2012, at NYU Langone Medical Center\nThe process was gutting, and left me with more questions than answers. To say I was in shock is an understatement. My frustration with the limited capacity for treatment I saw, and my intuition that something could and needed to be done, compelled me to action. My focus from that point on was two-fold: What, if anything, can be done to address the disease (rather than just the symptoms) of somebody who is already showing early symptoms of cognitive impairment, and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it in the first place? It was around that time that I encountered a groundswell of cutting edge thinking that stood in stark contrast to the vacuum of standard medical care as I had experienced it with my mom.\nShooting on C300s with Suzanne de la Monte, MD. Brown University, 2014\nThis is not another documentary exposing the hardships of dementia. There are plenty of those. BREAD HEAD (working title) will be the first documentary to investigate the empowering science that is happening in labs and clinics today to help us beat it. Because changes in the brain begin decades before Alzheimer's symptoms, the absolute best way we can move the needle on this disease is through minimizing risk when it matters most.\nI am an optimist. I believe in the ability of science to be utterly illuminating. While there is no cure for Alzheimer's yet, understanding of the disease has advanced exponentially over the past decade. And yet, JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association, recently printed that it takes on average 17 years for just 14% of what is discovered in science to be put into day-to-day clinical practice. We can do so much better. BREAD HEAD will be a soaring homage to the awe and wonder of brain science, liberate what insight is out there, and spotlight the luminaries in the field today.\nThe film will follow my journey to uncover ways of optimizing brain health and cognition, applicable to anyone and everyone, starting today. Lastly, BREAD HEAD will move past the present science to explore what the future may look like for both the prevention and treatment of these diseases.\nThis is a film about the future of us.\nWe will look at the impact of diet on brain health and explore with leading experts how \"low fat\" nutritional guidelines may have affected the wellbeing of America across generations, both generally, and from the perspective of brain health. Additionally, we\u2019ll cut through the noise to hear from leading voices at the front lines of medicine about the role that gluten, a source of much confusion lately, plays in our health. We\u2019re explore the gut-brain axis and \"microbiome\", an emerging new field of interest, which has stunning implications for our health. Lastly, we\u2019ll cover our \"always on\" lifestyles and its effect on our brains.\nOther topics covered:\nHow to minimize dementia risk factors, starting today\nHow you can control your gene expression, even if you have Alzheimer\u2019s in your family\nThe science behind why a common supermarket food may provide an alternate fuel source for ailing brain cells\nHow to protect and grow new brain cells at any age, and optimize memory and cognition\nThe newly discovered self cleaning mechanism in the brain and how to maximize it\nBoard-certified neurologists who are taking drug-free integrative approaches to dementia patients, and seeing stunning results\nThe future \u2013 What will brain disease look like 5, 10, 20 years from now? What are the most exciting developments underway today? Who is leading the charge?\nInterviewees:\n...and more.\nBREAD HEAD will be a journey to the cutting edge of neuroscience.\nShooting with globally-renowned gluten expert Dr. Alessio Fasano. Harvard, 2014\n\u201cLet food be thy medicine.\u201d \u2013 Hippocrates\nContrary to popular belief, dementia is not a normal part of aging. Also, it is not hereditary, although there are genetic risk factors, the influence of which can either be exacerbated or mitigated by lifestyle choices. Inflammation plays a role, and there is evidence pointing to an auto-immune aspect of the disease. Additionally, metabolic health is a chief concern for brain health as the brain at rest utilizes 20% of our energy needs.\nBecause changes in the brain begin decades before symptoms, the chance to really move the needle on this disease lies with making a big, empowering film to catalyze a movement around minimizing risk through diet and lifestyle, using the latest, safest, evidence-based science, aimed at a demographic not typically tuned in to dementia-related content. All movements begin with a good story, and this film will be that story. And as a millennial, I know that if there\u2019s one thing my generation doesn\u2019t like to do, it\u2019s wait.\n\u201cNew brain science has revealed remarkable ways in which our diet and genes interact to affect almost every aspect of our cognitive functions and our risk for future brain disease.  Few people are better suited to chronicle these findings than Max Lugavere, one of Gen Y\u2019s leading voices, and the dream team of scientists he has lined up.  I don\u2019t agree with all of Max\u2019s views, but my conversations with him have always made me think twice about facts I took for granted.  Controversial and deeply personal, this film aspires to do for brain health what An Inconvenient Truth did for climate science.  The debate is timely and much needed.\u201d - Murali Doraiswamy MD, Duke Institute for Brain Sciences\n\"I worked with Max on a series that we co-created, Acting Disruptive, which received a stunning 26 million views. Max has a captivating yet instantly relatable storytelling style and a very personal commitment to making this film. Combining Max's journey with fascinating science, this is a timely and important story for anyone with a brain.\" - Jane Rosenthal, Co-Founder, Tribeca Film Festival\n\"Max is a rare breed of young, passionate storytellers\u2014dedicated to bridging the worlds of media and social good.  This film crosses media & health, a combination I fully support.  Max's passion for communicating science can really help move the needle on this pressing global issue, at a time when it matters most.\"  - Marc Hodosh, Co-Creator, TEDMED \n All of our rewards are meant to support our contributors' brain-healthy lifestyle!\nKickstarter seed funding is incredibly important because it keeps the project moving at an early stage where little other funding is available.

Wonder no more!\nTwenty-five years ago, Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick created the game that introduced the world to 2D point & click adventure games. Maniac Mansion took the computer game world by storm with its compelling story, complex puzzles, cutting edge humor, engaging game play, and provided an entire generation with a new idea of what an adventure game could be. Blah blah blah...\nAnd now they are back together with an all new 2D point & click adventure game!  Ron is skinny again and Gary had that rash looked at \u2014 and they're here (finally!) to create the true spiritual successor to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.\nThimbleweed Park is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic point & click adventure games so special, and done by the actual people who spawned the genre.\nIt's deep, it's challenging, it's funny, it's everything you loved about adventure games.\nHoly crap is this going to be fun! And you can be part of it - right here and right now for $20 bucks which is like $1.52 in 1987 dollars.\nWhy do we want to make Thimbleweed Park? Because we miss classic adventures and all their innocence and charm. \nThey were fun and would put a smile on your face. We want to make one of those again and we want to do it right. We don\u2019t want to make a game \u201cinspired by,\u201d or \u201cpaying homage to\u201d classic point & click adventures, we want to make a real classic point & click adventure. \nThimbleweed Park is a game for true lovers of adventure games. This is a Kickstarter for fans who loved Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, and everything else that made that era great.  It strips away all the cruft built up over the years and is distilled down to what we loved about the genre.\n                                By popular demand and with thanks to the fine folks at Humble Bundle, we are now offering the ability to pay using PayPal. If you can back through Kickstarter directly, we kindly ask you to do that. It will make our lives a bit easier. But if you can't, then we're here for you. We got your back. \nAnyone who backs at $50 or higher will not only get their name in the Thimbleweed Park phone book (used for actual puzzle solving), but you\u2019ll also be able to record your own custom voicemail message when the number is called (subject to approval).\n               Please back our stretch goals and help us make Thimbleweed Park the best damn point & click adventure game you've played since that last point & click adventure game you played and liked.\nThimbleweed Park is the curious story of two washed up detectives called in to investigate a dead body found in the river just outside of town. It\u2019s a game where you switch between five playable characters while uncovering the dark, satirical and bizarre world of Thimbleweed Park.\nLost along a dusty stretch of highway, the town of Thimbleweed Park once boasted an opulent hotel, a vibrant business district and the state\u2019s largest pillow factory, but now teeters on the edge of oblivion and continues to exist for no real reason. It\u2019s a town that makes you itch and your skin crawl. It\u2019s a place no one ever looks for, but everyone seems to find. \nNot far from town, Delores and her siblings are gathered at the reading of her rich uncle\u2019s will where the backstabbing, intrigue and puzzle solving knows no end. How is this all connected to the dead body under the bridge? Good question.\nAt the long abandoned circus grounds, Ransome the Clown had been cursed and can never remove his make-up. How did he get into this situation? How can he get out? Does he really want to? What\u2019s up with that dead body slowly bloating in the water? Who knows!\nMeanwhile, on the 13th floor of the Edmund hotel, Franklin wakes up with no idea how he got there. But that\u2019s not the weird part. The weird part is that he\u2019s dead. Spoiler: He\u2019s not the body found just outside of Thimbleweed Park. Wow! That's confusing. Don\u2019t panic, we\u2019re just as confused as you are.\nWe like big pixels. Huge ones. Pixels that have their own Zip Codes. Pixels a family of six could live inside of and still have room for Uncle Pete when he drops in unexpectedly on his way to the coast.\nWe had a lot of fun building Maniac Mansion, there was a charm and simplicity to the art that let the game design shine and your imagination run wild.\nWe want Thimbleweed Park to be like an undiscovered classic LucasArts' adventure game you'd never played before. A game discovered in a dusty old desk that puts a smile on your face and sends a wave of nostalgia through you in the same way it does for us.\nRon Gilbert and Gary Winnick created and designed Maniac Mansion and have extensive experience making games over the past 25 years. Maniac Mansion was LucasArts\u2019 first adventure game and the point & click adventure game that spawned the genre we know and love today.\nRON GILBERT is a game designer, writer and programmer best known for creating and designing the cult classic adventure games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. Ron was the ninth employee at Lucasfilm Games, instrumental in their leap into adventure games, and creator of the SCUMM engine. He was the co-founder of Humongous Entertainment and made numerous adventure games for kids, such as Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam. His most recent work includes the adventure/RPG DeathSpank, The Cave and indie mobile games The Big Big Castle and Scurvy Scallywags.\nGARY WINNICK is an artist, writer, designer and art director. During his ten year stint at Lucasfilm Games he co-designed and created all the art for their first graphic adventure Maniac Mansion. Additionally, he created art for and art directed many other LucasArts games including Zak McKracken, Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monkey Island and Habitat. Gary created the original property Defenders of Dynatron City, co-plotted a six issue mini-series for Marvel and served as a producer for the animated TV special. He was a co-founder of Lightsource Studios and Suddenly Social. His most recent graphic novel Bad Dreams is currently being published by comic company Red 5.\nJust like they were on Maniac Mansion, Ron and Gary will be the core of the team building this new point & click adventure, co-designing and writing with Ron doing the bulk of the programming and Gary doing the art.  Good times.\nAn additional programmer and artist will be added 6 months into production, along with a part-time musician. Dedicated testers will join as the game nears completion.\nWe're fully devoting ourselves to Thimbleweed Park in the same way we did Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island and everything else we do. This is a serious full-time project for us. We want to make the best classic point & click adventure we can.\nFollow and participate in the game's development on our website, where Ron, Gary and other members of the team will discuss behind-the-scenes art, designs, information, cooking, gossip, answer questions, get feedback and generally have a lot of fun*. \n* Fun not guaranteed and void where prohibited by law.\nTons of other fascinating rewards can be found by looking to your right\u2026 over there\u2026 no, a little higher\u2026 scroll up\u2026 there!\n** Rewards icons are for reference, entertainment and gambling purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the final rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding games is always risky.

No, we probably will be late, but not by a lot and the game will be better for it. That's just the reality of making a game and we're going to be honest about that.

It seamlessly balances functionality, personal reflection and goal setting in one beautiful handcrafted planner.\nAt the end of 2013 I launched Passion Planner 2014 here on Kickstarter and it was a huge success raising more than $48,000 in 23 days. Since its launch it has helped many people find balance in their personal and work lives, change careers, plan and succeed in personal projects (even a few Kickstarters!), achieve their fitness goals, take the trips of their dreams, and also find a place of focus and balance when struggling with learning disabilities like ADHD. \nI decided to make an smaller version so you can take the power of Passion Planner with you anywhere. \nPassion Planner Compact measures 5.5\"x8.5\" (about half the size sheet of printer paper), it is printed on high quality, recycled, and bleed resistant paper, then lovingly hand bound in a durable and low profile soft faux leather cover complete with an elastic enclosure strap.\nInner Pages: \nAnnual goal setting guide to help you brainstorm, define, and create actions for your goals your lifetime, 3 year, 1 year, and one month goals. \nWeekly layouts (Sunday - Monday) that run from January 2015 - December 2015\nAnnual and monthly overview calendars  \nMonthly check in reflection questions to get you thinking about progress, gratitude and steps for improvement\n20 Additional blank pages\n20 Additional gridded pages\nWeekly Layouts:\nWeekly and daily focuses where you can ask yourself \u201cwhat is the most important thing that needs to get done?\u201d today or this week. \nA Sunday - Monday appointment calendar that runs from 6 AM \u2013 11 PM broken down into 30 minute increments \nGood Things That Happened section to keep you focused and looking for the positive in every week. \nA motivational quote and a matching challenge to encourage you translate those words into positive action \nDual personal and work to do lists organized by priority to encourage personal and work life balance because all too often we get caught up in work and put our personal needs on the back burner \nA blank section that you can use to take notes, draw, journal, brainstorm or customize to your needs of the week.   \nOuter Specs:\nSoft and durable faux leather cover; animal and vegan friendly! \nSuper smooth high quality 100 gsm thick paper, about twice as thick as a standard sheet of printer paper to resist ink bleeding from fountain pens \nPortable A5 size 5.5\u201dx8.5\u201d (about the half the size of a sheet of printer paper) \n About 190 pages (95 leaves)\nWeekly Layout Blank\nWeekly Layout Filled\nMonthly Layout\nMonthly Reflection Questions\nPassion Planning: A Step-By-Step Goal Setting Guide\nMap out your long-term and short-term goals!\nA Passion Plan I made for my Kickstarter!\nFaux leather embossing!

I'm doing this project to help people and not to make money. I think when you genuinely want to help people everything else will fall into place. \n Flip through Passion Planner! \nCan't decide which size to get? \nTest the Weekly Layout for FREE: Click Here for a Free PDF Download of both sizes! \nAt the beginning of 2013, while suffering from the feeling of \"directionless floating\" caused by post-college uncertainty, I realize that I was clearly not the only person facing this feeling. I felt like I had done everything right, graduated from one of the best universities on the planet, made \"proper career choices\", and followed my passions, but still something was wrong. I was stuck, I was scared, and I had no idea which way I wanted to go next.\nI thought about how this was possible, how the years of overachieving effort could leave me with such a feeling of emptiness so I sat down and reflected.\nI concluded that society, and more specifically how our educational system is constructed and how it rewards following rules, meeting deadlines, completing assignments in order to gain outside approval or to avoid punishment, and constantly comparing our worth and success to that of others, is what lays the foundation for this problem. But it is our fear of the uncertain that makes it grow.\nI realized that this feeling of emptiness and directionless runs rampant in us when fear is the primary motivating force that drives our actions and not love. It is fear from punishment, from not looking as good as someone else, from looking dumb, from not being see as \"good enough\" for someone else, from not being able to secure a good career later on, and so on that fuels our action. And this is highly problematic.\nFrom the first day we walk into preschool to the day we graduate college our lives are governed by these rules, standards and goals that others have placed for us; significantly handicapping and excusing us from creating goals that are self motivated and driven. In turn, when we are faced (for what may be the first time) to make our own choices, take action and face the uncertain consequences of our choices, we feel overwhelmed and we flip out.\nWe ask ourselves \"What if I don't make as much money as so and so?\", \"What if I make the wrong choice?\", \"What would blah, blah, blah, think of me?\", \"Will my parents agree with this choice?\", \"Am I thinking over all the possibilities and weighing the consequences?\" .. We think, we think, we think... and think some more but fail to ACT; our perfectionism paralyzes us; the fear of failure is too much; and the cons of making the wrong choice make us imagine and physiologically experience the stresses of what potentially could go wrong and we find ourselves feeling stuck, alone and lost.\nHow do I know all of this? I've done it myself. And why do I think I have a solution? Because I've made a product that I wish someone gave me when I feeling lost.\nI want to turn the system on its head. I want to make love, gratitude and self-motivation the primary force that propelled action. I wanted to help people pursue their passions; to pursue that thing that makes them excited to get up everyday because when you follow your passion you never have to work a day in your life. Work feels like playful experimentation, projects stop being scary and start looking like adventures, failures look like valuable experiences, and success are just the remnants of a beautiful process not the end goal. When you create your ideal reality through action the present becomes a gift, that you live every moment of your life.\nI might be idealistic to think that paper bound in faux leather, could be the answer to this huge problem wrecking havoc on my fellow peers... but I think it's a start.\nI wanted to help people overcome that feeling by making a tool that sat them down to clearly define their goals and dreams, break them down into more actionable steps, and then write them in a place that they would see and use everyday and a planner was PERFECT for this. I wanted people to use this planner as a compass that they could use to guide their daily decisions. It's simple. You ask yourself is what I am going to do today going to get me closer to my goals? Yes? Do it. No? Don't do it.\nAnd that's how Passion Planner was born.\nFor those creatives who need a little more structure: We all know someone who has amazing ideas, yet can't seem to follow through. This planner gives individuals the opportunity to not only have a place to brainstorm and create new ideas, but a to-do list and appointment calendar to encourage planning and action.\nFor those structured who need a little more creativity/spontaneity: We also all know someone that is a little too uptight who is all work and no play. Blank spaces, journaling, reflection and \"good things that happened\" sections provide the opportunity for reflection and new ideas.\nFor those who like to journal, reflect and the freedom of blank space: Journal spaces give the uncommon ability for someone to reflect, take notes, and write in the same planner they use to keep track of their daily to-do's and schedule. Also monthly, questions keep you checking in with yourself and your progress on your goals.\nFor those who feel overwhelmed with cluttered thoughts: We all know how it feels to have a brain itch; that feeling you get when you can't seem to remember what you have to do. Having a planner that is a calendar, to-do list AND a journal allows you to have one place to jot down information. It's like having a second brain on standby that stores information ready to use when you need it, no sooner no later.\nFor those juggling multiple lives: Whether you are a high school student juggling classes and extra-curriculars, a recent grad unsure of what to do next, or a professional looking to find ways to have more family time in the sea of work, this is planner is for you. It is structured enough to give you a solid planning foundation yet flexible enough for you to tailor it to your needs.\nThe money will be solely used in the first large scale production of Passion Planner Compact, including manufacturing and shipping.\nWhen I first came up with the idea of Passion Planner in 2013, I came up with this idea at the end of 2013 when thinking about what kind of tool I wish I had for myself when I was feeling a little lost. I got started and became a little overwhelmed with all the details that needed to be considered. I wanted to make this planner perfect and have all of the elements that I wanted in a planner myself, and for a few months my perfectionism paralyzed me. About a month ago after talking to a friend about this planner idea I had been thinking about for so long and hearing her enthusiasm I realized that even though it may have not have been perfect in my eyes, it was still lightyears beyond what was available in the market in terms of a planner that addressed all of the issued that mine addressed. For more than 9 months I\u2019ve been dreaming, planning, wishing, procrastinating, spending, reworking, scrapping, reworking (again), mind mapping, researching suppliers, tweaking, dreading, cutting, testing, protyping, asking, printing and so much more. In the last month, I've been \"test-running\" the smaller version of Passion Planner with a few of my friends to ensure its ability to be used across many different lifestyles, as well as to correct or improve the user experience. \nSome of the paper, sketches, mind maps, notebooks, other planners, and files I've accumulated while working on this project. (This doesn't even include the 150+ hours of work I did on my computer!)\nThe first mind map I did in January when thinking about what elements the \"Perfect Planner\" should have.\nA more in depth mind map of the specs, process, motivations, details, goals, features and benefits I wanted in Passion Planner.\nOne of my first major fails.\nFor the first few months I tried to create the layout on the computer first. This was really difficult because reformatting, rearranging and resizing takes a lot of time and energy on the computer. Note to fellow/future designers: Do your work first on the comfort and flexibility of paper and then when you are pretty satisfied with the layout and spacing then switch over to translating it into a computer file. If I would have done this I would have saved myself months of time and frustration. Haha\nI switched back to drafting on paper!\nOne of the dozens of drafts I made of the weekly spread. With its balance of space for the practical and the reflective, I eventually decided I liked this one in particular and moved forward with this general layout.\nI transfered the idea onto two sheets in order to get a general idea of the spacing and scale for each section.\nAfter one very very very long all nighter I finally had a printable prototype of the weekly layout! I was so happy!!!\nMy working prototype! I put the layout to work, using it personally as well as electing 10 friends to \"test-run\" it for a week. Then I collected feedback and did some adjustments. This is a picture of my actual schedule for a week.\nI sketched up and created a monthly overview for each month as well.\nThis is the annual overview. I used this one to quadruple check that all dates were in order and on the right pages (notice all the highlighting) haha\nThis is how I decided how many pages the planner was going to be.\nWhile preparing for this Kickstarter I stapled the template within a manila folder and used it religiously, enabling me to maintain my sanity. (It really works!) Haha\nBecause I am on a tight time schedule to get these to you all by Christmas, my manufacturer only had time to send me a prototype of what the notebook will look like in terms of quality of faux leather, ribbon, and paper.\nSo bear with me and just imagine my pages printed within a notebook just like the one on the left.\nI have teamed up with a book binding company who is one of the best companies in its field. They have had more than 13 years of book binding and journal printing experience and have maintained clients including Moleskine and Hugo Boss over the years. Their headquarters have industrial factories capable to print, bind and finish the planner from start to finish. Based on their reputation and past work I am completely confident that they will be able carry out this project in a timely manner without sacrificing quality.\nFor almost a month we have come up with the perfect prototype for this planner taking careful thought and consideration for all the details. We have already picked out the faux leather, paper color, weight, and quality, margin spacing, finishes, band and book marking ribbons color and widths. I have the files that will be used to create the inner pages complete and prepped for print. Currently we are at the point where once we receive funding we will be completely ready to finish production in order you them to you before Christmas at the earliest and early January at the latest. And that's where you wonderful backers come in! Once backed the manufacturing process will look like this:\n1) The print company will take the file that I have designed and do any modifications necessary to make sure all pages line up, are in the correct order and ensure that the file will look sharp and clean when printed. Then these pages will go to print.\n2) While the internal pages are being printed, correlated and bound into sleeves by the print company the book binding company will laser cut the faux leather to fit the planner exactly.\n3) The pages will then be installed into the planner at the same time as the bookmarking ribbon.\n4) Next the internal cover sheets are glued into place and the elastic band is installed into the back cover of the planner.\n5) Corners will then be rounded using a laser cutter.\n6) Lastly, each planner will be checked for quality and individually packaged in a plastic sleeve for shipment.\n7) Then the goods will be shipped to my door where I will carry out the fulfillment of the planners to their respective homes myself. I have already found a forwarder to ship them to my door as well as worked out a plan with USPS to have them shipped in a timely fashion.\nI am doing everything in my power to have it out and delivered to your door by Christmas 2014, but understanding that there are often unforeseen delays in the manufacturing and shipping process (especially around the holiday season). I am going to play it safe and say early January 2015.

In the game, you play as a carousel animal who wants nothing more than to escape the merry go round, and reach the outside world! The first player to reach an exit point on the board, is the winner!\nThe game is divided into 3 phases:\nPhase 1: In phase one, each player is given 5 movement tokens, and 2 special tokens. These tokens allow you to plan how you will move your playing token down the board. Each colored movement token, allows you to move your playing token onto a corresponding colored tile. If you are standing in front of a tile in the same color as your playing token, you can jump down for free!\nPhase 2: Next, the carousel will spin! Each layer of the board is spun one tile in a clockwise direction. \nPhase 3: It\u2019s time to carry out your planned movement tokens. You must move your playing token according to the order in which you arranged your movement tokens in phase one, form left to right. Each player carry\u2019s out their movements by turn. \nYou can read the full rulebook here.\nEasy to learn:  We have designed a comprehensive rulebook that outlines the phases of the game very clearly. An overview of the phases can also be found on each players ticket container.\nNo reading necessary!: All of the tokens communicate their purpose through fun illustrations, which can be easily understood without text.\nFast gameplay: Merry Go Round is designed to be played in no more than 20 minutes. If you have the time, play again! \nInteractive game board: Since the board has been designed to look, and act like a carousel, kids will have loads of fun taking turns spinning the game board.\nEducational & Fun Learning: Merry Go Round is both fun, and challenging - this allows the game to act as a great educational tool! Merry Go Round challenges kids to identify color, plan and think ahead.\nEasy to set up: In the video we have playing cards but for the finalised version of the game, we have replaced cards with tokens which will come in a shuffle bag (this has been calculated into the price of the game and shipping) Tokens will be easier to shuffle, ensuring the game is fair and fun, especially for kids!\nHi!

Without their support, ideas and insanely valuable feedback, the game simply wouldn\u2019t be what it is. In designing the game, we\u2019ve learnt the importance of working collaboratively with people, to be sure that we don\u2019t miss out on any great ideas!\nWhen deciding on the appropriate platform to take Merry Go Round further, we knew that kickstarter would be the perfect place for us to continue getting feedback and working collaboratively in completing the project.\nMerry Go round is approved by the Nordic Game Artisans.

Please help me replace it so I can complete my personal art project, Night Paper.\nI really messed up; I admit it. I was careless for a moment and my camera gear got stolen. And I regretfully did not insure for this kind of event. I'm not asking you to reward me for foolishness - not at all. I'm asking you to instead believe in my project, NIGHT PAPER, and show support for its completion. When you do, I can replace my stolen digital photo gear and move forward toward the culmination of this project, now working with couples. Without your help, and the help of the art and Kickstarter communities, it will take me longer to recover and continue the project.\nI've invested a lot of my personal money, immeasurable time and effort into creating and evolving my unique project, NIGHT PAPER. It's my biggest creative dream so far and I am dedicated to its success. It is an intricate and involved process and I am committed to the project, heart and soul.\nAnon in Studio\nClara in WIlliamsburg\nWhat is NIGHT PAPER? A surreal combination of handmade cut paper fashions, long exposures and portraiture at night. \nWho is NIGHT PAPER? Myself, my amazing Production Manager Mabel, and all of the courageous and creative volunteers: Skyler Donohue, Falana Fox, Gymnos Alithea, Sincerely Yours, Clara Coquette, Hard Corey, Bombazeen Bean, Heather Whatever, Matt Knife, Rosabelle Selavy and more. All have donated their time, enthusiasm and creativity.\nWhy NIGHT PAPER? Because it must be done. I am literally compelled to complete this project; over twenty years of working with paper, night photography and storytelling collide in my brain and are expressed in this project. It's my opus and makes me very happy.\nHow do I make NIGHT PAPER? Each cut paper fashion takes about eight hours to create. We consult with the volunteer models (who come from all walks of life) and learn more about them. Then I create bespoke paper fashions by freeform cutting paper or many types and then glueing, sewing or almost anything else that comes to mind to make  complimentary and somewhat revealing body pieces and masks.\nWe have one fitting prior to the shoot. I may make adjustments, or I may scrap the entire outfit and make something fresh. Mostly I look for the fashion to fall on and move with the body in ways that a good light source will make complimentary shadows and cool movements during the long exposures.\nI believe in giving back; at the shoot we often have a guest assistant who wants to learn more about night photography. I will teach them as I work through the location shoots.\nWe also shoot in a large variety of spaces, from private to very public. We have photographed in Gantry Park, DUMBO, Brooklyn Bridge Park, a rooftop in Williamsburg, an apartment on the 52nd floor in Manhattan and more. We are always very respectful of other people and somehow it always works out.\nWhat gear was stolen? Here is a specific list of all the things I can remember being in the bag:\nNikon D700 camera body S/N 2056827 $2,999 \nNikon D7000 camera body S/N 3084139 $1,499\nNikon AF-S Zoom Nikkor 14-24mm f/2.8G ED AF Lens $1,996 \nLomo Petzval 85mm Lens (I backed this on Kickstarter) S/N 00001896 $350\nNikon AF-S Nikkor 50mm f/1.4G S/N 633794 Autofocus Lens $425 \nNikonc MC-36 Remote Trigger / Intervalometer $160 \nfour spare Nikon EN-EL3E Rechargeable Li-ion Battery Pack $160 \ntwo spare Nikon EN-EL15 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery Pack $92 \nTwo SanDisk 16GB ExtremePRO CompactFlash Card $140 \nTwo SanDisk 16GB ExtremePRO UHS II SDHC Memory Card $130 Lexar Multi-Card 25-in-1 USB 3.0 Memory Card Reader $25 \nTenba Messenger Photo & Laptop Daypack, Orange $154 \nFlashlights for light painting (three) $150 \nRechargable AA batteries (16) $50 \nTravel Charger for Nikon batteries (universal) $46 \nTotal $8,376\nIf I were to ask for the full amount:\n+ Kickstarter fees @ 5% $8,794.80\n+ minimum Amazon fees @ 3% $9,058.64 \nHere is a photo of the police report - if you hear anything about this crime, please report it!\nPolice report\nHow much am I asking for? $6,000. I am asking only for enough pledges to help me get back into a full camera system with a few crucial lenses, backup batteries, memory and a trigger/intervalometer. Get me started again!\nWhy do I bring so much gear to a night shoot? Night photography requires patience. All the photos take minutes instead of fractions of a second. So having two camera bodies and lots of extra batteries is a necessity to be efficient and more productive. I also invested in this gear over 5-6 years and losing it in an instant is very painful.\nHere are some more images from the project.\nGymnos in Dumbo\nHeather in Brooklyn\nBean and Gymnos in studio\nSkyler in Denver\nFalana in Manhattan\nBean in studio\nClara and Corey on Randall's Island\nSee the entire gallery here.\nHere are some videos of the process for my cut paper art and fashions:\n Where will the NIGHT PAPER project go? \n1) Continue to explore the theme and to evolve it.\nThe project is now focused on loving couples by exactly that definition. If two people love each other and want to volunteer, you're in! See the very bottom for fuller details if you are interested.\n2) I also am looking to produce and sell a gorgeous coffee table book with an amazing publisher (to be found!). Contact matt@matthillart.com if you are an interested publisher.\n3) I am also seeking gallery representation for this project - someone who believes in me and will represent my art with the same passion I put into making it. Contact matt@matthillart.com. \nVolunteers? A final note about NIGHT PAPER - VOLUNTEERS - I have no preconceptions about who should be in this project. More specifically, I welcome anyone - any age, size, height, race or creed. If you want to volunteer for NIGHT PAPER, I will photograph you. Read more here.\nMost of all, thank you for taking time to read this and consider helping me get back on track. Your pledge, or even sharing it with others you think may be interested has my deepest gratitude.\nWarmest regards,\nMatt\nP.S. I am a big believer in Kickstarter and have backed many projects. \nI am hoping some of that good karma comes back my way. If I make my goal, then my first stretch goal will be to participate by giving back 5% of after-cost monies and Kicking it Forward.\nAnd special thanks to Triple Scoop Music for donating a licensed music track for my video. \nMore info about REWARDS:\nAre you backing for prints?\nAll images from which you can choose for NIGHT PAPER can be viewed here.\nAll images from which you can choose for night photography can be viewed here.\nExamples of my cut paper wall art can be viewed here.\nInformation about past and upcoming workshops and seminars cna be viewed here.\nUPDATE: In addition to backing this project, Eric Luden at Digital Silver Imaging offered ten 10x15\" Silver Gelatin Prints for ten lucky backers! Get them while they are hot! \nUPDATE 2: 11/6/2014 - We made it, but it's not over! STRETCH GOALS\nYesterday was one of the most amazing days of my life. The onrush of support and belief in my pursuit of making art really left me feeling uplifted and surrounded by love.\nI will do amazing things with your trust.\nTogether we got to my miminmum backing of $6,000 and beyond. It keeps growing and we have days to go.\nI'm not here for charity. I'm here to create the things in my head and then sell them to those who feel like it moves them, connects with them. It's an exchange of my energy for yours. And I am so deeply grateful for everyone that voted with their wallets to give me tools to make new images again.\nNow that we have exceeded what I desired as a minimum, I ask myself what I can do with the funds beyond $6K. Honestly, my wildest dream was to just make that amount, celebrate, make some art and grow. Now generous people are still giving and I want you to know that money means even bigger and better things for NIGHT PAPER.\nSo I am announcing Stretch Goals! How exciting!\nIf this project breaks $8,500, I will then pledge to be part of Brian Fargo's Kicking it forward pledge. What does that mean? It means that I sincerely promise to put 5% of my profits after buying gear, making prints and fulfilling them back into other Kickstarter projects. To be absolutely clear, these 5% will be taken out of my profit after the project ships and after I have paid all of my expenses. The 5% will not be taken out of the money pledged to be used to produce the art for backers. Not a bit. If you have any questions regarding this decision or how it works, or would like more information, please ask in the comments or via direct message.\nIf, by some act of divinity, this project breaks $10,000 then I will add to each backer package shipped an original sketch from my private sketchbooks, signed. These sketches are in my cut paper style and something I do when compelled to make shapes but have no paper or x-acto nearby.\nAnd if, and this would make me crazy happy, this project reaches $12,000 then I will add more previously-unseen photos from NIGHT PAPER and my night photography into the mix for selection by backers.\nAll the extra pledges above my minimum will be invested directly into the NIGHT PAPER project, including purchasing better and more excited papers, site fees, permits, film for my archaic view cameras, processing, materials for carbon transfer printing, chemicals and much, much more.\nSo if you are in the fence about whether to pledge or not, it's ok! I am very happy to have made my minimum goal to get back on my feet. But know that if you do sign on, it's going to be straight into making more art and expand my capabilities.\nWarmest regards, Matt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I see it, there is no risk outside of (heaven forbid) injury or death on my part.

Unlike other books, Commodore Amiga: a visual Commpendium will focus on the visual side of the computer; from in-game pixel art to game maps to box artwork, the book will be crammed full of beautiful high-resolution, full-colour imagery. My years of owning an Amiga were some of the fondest gaming memories I have: from the endless hours sunk into Monkey Island and Premier Manager to running home at school lunchtime to boot up X-Copy, the Commodore Amiga played a huge part in my life, and still does to this day. The chance to design this book is hugely exciting for me.\nThis will be the second book from publisher Bitmap Books which specialises in high-end computer game publications. Our first book, Commodore 64: a visual Commpendium was released earlier this year to huge critical acclaim. This is very much a follow up the C64 book in the Commpendium series of books.\nEach spread in the book will focus on a different game, and each game will be represented with a striking visual, along with short reviews, developer quotes, and behind-the-scenes trivia. I am very pleased to announce that at this early stage I already have the support of several industry legends such as Paul Cuisset (Flashback), Ron Gilbert (Monkey Island), Dino Dini (Kick Off), Martin Edmondson (Shadow of the Beast), Dan Malone (The Chaos Engine), Jim Sachs (Defender of The Crown) and Gary Penn (The One Magazine) along with many other developers and journalists who will be contributing to the book. \nThe Book\nThe final book will be printed lithographically to the highest possible print standards and be 332 pages long. It will be 230mm x 170mm in size and come with a soft cover with flaps that fold in to double the thickness. It will use thread sewn binding which is a special type of bind that has two main advantages: the first is that you are able to open the book flat (without the usual glue cracking); and second is that it is much more durable. Glue ages over time and cracks but thread sewn binds last forever. The book is also available as a limited edition hardback option (only 25 available) which will be individually numbered and signed by Stoo Cambridge and Jon Hare (Sensible Software). \nCommodore Amiga: a visual Commpendium will be printed on high quality paper in full colour. I will be using a local printer who I have used and known for many years. By using a local printer I will be able to monitor the quality, resulting in a far superior product than if printed cheaply overseas.\nThe text will be edited and overseen by industry legend Steve Jarratt, a veteran computer games journalist who has edited countless best-selling publications including Amiga Format, Total!, and EDGE. The foreword will be written by ex-Sensible Software graphic artist Stoo Cambridge, who made his name creating the artwork for classic games such as Cannon Fodder and Sensible Golf.\nThe different games and utilities featured throughout the book will flow in chronological order, starting with the Amiga\u2019s launch in 1985, right through to latter-day AGA and CD32 games. It will also feature illustrations from renowned artists such as Roger Dean (Psygnosis) and Bob Wakelin (Ocean), printed in all their full-colour glory!\nAdditionally, there will be plenty of game maps throughout the book. I have gained permission from Hall of Light to use their maps, and the book will also feature brand new maps created exclusively for the book by veteran journalist and 'mapping supremo' Andy Roberts (Thalamus/Commodore Format). Also contributing to the maps will be Daniel K\u00fcrsten from the excellent Amiga Graphics Archive.\nAlso in the book will be six developer profiles. Each profile will be 1000 words and legendary companies such as System 3, Cinemaware and Sensible Software will be profiled. \nThroughout the book will also be five 500 word interviews with Amiga artists such as Jim Sachs, Dan Malone and Tobias Richter.\nThe demo scene will also feature in the book, celebrating the best of the best in Amiga demos. This section will be put together in collaboration with ex demo scener Matt Wilsher. Matt is also in touch with other ex sceners who will be contributing to this section of the book. We have also produced a set of five demo scene postcards to accompany the campaign. Each backer will get a handwritten postcard with each pledge and there is also the chance to buy a full set of the five postcards.\nBut it\u2019s not just about the games! We will also profile five of the top software houses, documenting the origins, successes, and legacies of some of the best-loved creators of Amiga games. Each profile will be written by Steve Jarratt and run across two spreads.\nLast but not least, there will be photography for each of the major Amiga models throughout the book. Matt Wilsher, who also did the photography in the C64 book, will be shooting his way though some classic Amiga hardware once again. Also helping out with photography will be C64.com frontman, Andreas Wallstr\u00f6m.\nContributors\nFor the last six months behind the scenes I have been busy recruiting contributors to the book and am pleased to say that there are already some HUGE names signed up to contribute with many more to follow...\nAndreas Wallstr\u00f6m (Photography)\nAndrew Hewson (21st Century Entertainment)\nAndrew Morris (Crazy Cars, Lotus)\nAndy Roberts (Map supremo)\nBob Wade (Amiga Format)\nBob Wakelin (Artist)\nDan Malone (Bitmap Brothers)\nDavid Broadhurst (Assassin/Overdrive/Bubble Bobble)\nDavid Perry (Supremacy)\nDino Dini (Kick Off, Goal!)\nFranck Sauer (Agony)\nGary Penn (One Magazine)\nGlenn Corpes (Bullfrog)\nHugh Riley (Aladdin/Last Ninja Remix/Hammerfist) \nJacco Van 't Riet (Boys Without Brains)\nJacob Andersen (Banshee)\nJames Leach (Amiga Format)\nJamie Woodhouse (Quak, Nitro)\nJason Perkins (Ruff 'n Tumble)\nJim Sachs (Graphic artist)\nJohn Twiddy (System 3)\nJon Hare (Sensible Software)\nMartin Edmondson (Reflections)\nMartin Iveson (Core)\nMatt Bielby (Amiga Power launch Editor)\nMatt Wilsher (Photography)\nMevlut Dinc (Vivid Image)\nMichael Dailly (Lemmings)\nMo Warden (Damocles)\nPaul Cuisset (Flashback/Cruise for a Corpse)\nPaul Docherty (Apocalypse/Last Ninja 3/Myth)\nPete Lyon (Graphic artist)\nPhil Thornton (System 3)\nRaffaele Cecco (First Samurai/Stormlord)\nRichard Weeks (Microcosm)\nRobin Levy (Ruff 'n Tumble)\nRon Gilbert (LucasArts)\nSimon Phipps (Core)\nSimon Woodroffe (Simon the Sorcerer)\nSteve Jarratt (Amiga Format)\nStoo Cambridge (Sensible Software)\nTeoman Irmak (First Samurai)\nThe Target\nA large chunk of the \u00a325K target I have set will cover the postage and printing of the book and what little is left will cover the other costs associated with the project (not forgetting the Kickstater fee!). This is slightly higher than the target for the C64 book, because the Amiga book will have more pages and extra editorial content. More content = more pages = more weight = higher print and postage costs.\nRewards\nSpecial rewards include a limited edition hardback book (25 available), signed by Stoo Cambridge and Jon Hare (Sensible Software), and also the chance to create your OWN spread in the book (you choose the game to be featured and even write your own mini-review!). Please note that if you purchase this reward you will need to suggest five games and I will choose one of them with you to avoid duplication throughout the book. I have tried to create a series of well priced rewards that will hopefully suit all backers. These range from \u00a35 right up to \u00a31000. Each and every backer will get a 'demo scene' postcard from me personally thanking them! There are five in total to collect.\nAs part of this campaign we will also be offering a game that was never released on the Amiga. Once regarded as the Holy Grail of unreleased Amiga games, Putty Squad famously never saw the light of day, apart from a demo version. Last year, Fairlight cracker Galahad revived John Twiddy's original Amiga code and produced a full version. I have permission from System 3 and Galahad to produce 100 replica copies of Putty Squad on actual floppy disks in authentic packaging exclusively for this Kickstarter campaign. I am working with Phillip Thornton and System 3 closely, to make sure the packaging is as authentic as possible. 50 of the 100 copies will be signed by the original development team, making this a highly sought-after collectible.\nOther rewards include signed The Amiga Works CD's, Monkey Island glicee prints, signed Lemmings bead art and loads more...\nCheck out some of the rewards available below:  \nGamesYouLoved \nA special thanks to GamesYouLoved who have been major supporter of me and my books.

Each book will be securely packaged in a corrugated book wrap and every care will be taken to ensure that the book arrives with you in perfect condition!\nTimings \nA chunk of the pages are already designed and I will carry on the design throughout the duration of the Kickstarter. Design of the books is due to be finished in February and will be printed and ready for postage in March 2015. I will however aim to get it done sooner if I can. Those who backed my C64 book will know that the design was finished on time and I will provide lots of updates all along the way.\nAny questions, please ask! \nSam Dyer\nWhat people said about the C64 book \n\n\"This is a fond trip down memory lane, a great book full of high resolution colour pictures of your favourite C64 games with comments from the creators themselves.

You will soon rediscover games you had forgotten about and be wanting to set up your old C64 once again! Brilliant book, get it - it will be a collectors item one day.\" Steve Sharples\n\"Absolutely fantastic book filled with C64 gaming nostalgia! The pages are high quality and the screen shots are all beautifully printed. You can tell a lot of care and thought went into this book. The little quotes and blurts were excellent and the addition of cover art is lovely. It was a wonderful romp down memory lane and I do believe I'll be buying a second copy for my father as he's the one that really got me hooked on the C64 :)\" Hope Marie\n\"Fantastic high quality book, packed cover to cover with stunning C64 screen shots which are sure to bring the memories flooding back, and all accompanied by fascinating comments and insights courtesy of big names from the industry at the time. A must-have coffee table book for everyone of a certain age.\" Chris Wilson\n\"What a high end product. Beautiful colours. Its wonderful to get a close look on all those pixels. Theres a lot of in game pictures, which gives me goosebumbs of joy, because of all the memories of great c64 gaming.\" Jakob Kj\u00f8ller\n\"This is such a magnificent book and brings back so many memories. The design and artwork is just wonderful and I'm so pleased it's been such a success. I was one of the proud backers on the original Kickstarter and was thrilled to read it when it arrived yesterday. Get it if you have even the slightest memory of a C64.\" David", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen producing a book there are normally certain risks associated with it which hopefully I have minimised. As a Graphic Designer by trade I am perfectly placed to deliver this project to a very high standard. I have over ten years\u2019 experience in design and print so am used to seeing through books and brochures of this size. Also, having successfully delivered a Kickstater campaign before (on time), I have gained considerable experience from this.\n\nThe other risk could be quality control of the print. However, by using a local printer, I am paying more but I can guarantee the print quality.

I only use two colors for every print. I mix the colors and try to get the biggest range of colors possible. I paint with guache paint using a brush and sometimes a toothbrush and an airbrush. I have made three prints so far, and I want to make a total of at least 10 prints.\nI am fascinated by weird and disgusting themes. Eyeballs, tentacles and slime are ongoing themes in my drawings. I hope that my prints will amaze and disgust you at the same time. These 10 prints will be a roller coaster of thrilling disgust and weird emotions.\nRisograph\nAll prints are made on a Risograph. Risograph is a stencil duplication process, meaning that it is in the same family as Screen Printing. The machine, from the outside, looks just like a photocopier, but the guts are entirely different. Like an offset press, Risograph printers use Plates, or Masters (made from wax paper), which means that it prints one colour/one layer at a time. Each additional layer requires an additional pass through the machine.\nRISO PRINT\nThe 7000 Danish kroner is enough to print the remaining seven prints. If I get more than that I will be able to make some alternative prints like the orange slime giant. If I reach 10.000 kroner I will add an alternative DIY print. And if I reach 20.000 danish kroner I will add one extra surprise print for everybody who bought a physical print.\nI would like to invite you into the creative process. Please feel free to ask questions and leave comments on the Kickstarter page. During this campaign I will be posting pictures on my Instagram profile to show how I work. \nDIY!\nThe DIY print is exclusively for backers on kickstarter. You will get two image files, one for each color, and you will have to run them through the printer two times. You should be proud of yourself if the two prints are not perfectly aligned, every print should be unique. You will also get instructions to write edition numbers in the corner of the print.\nThere will be added more prints and rewards throughout the campain.\nThank you so much for your support!\nSLIME GIANT / CYAN-YELLOW / OPEN EDITION\nSLIME GIANT / MAGENTA-YELLOW / LIMITED TO 50 COPIES\nEYEBALL BABY / CYAN-YELLOW / OPEN EDITION\nPIMPLES / MAGENTA-YELLOW / OPEN EDITION\nThe SLIMEBABIES is not yet made into a print, but it will be one of the 10 prints you can buy!

Kickstarter has been there for us from the start; now we need you again! Thanks to our first Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019ve travelled the world filming incredible insights from some of the most intriguing indie developers and industry figures, and we\u2019ve returned with some amazing footage.\nYou can help in this last stretch to make GameLoading look and sound amazing!\nGameLoading: Rise of the Indies a feature-length documentary which explores the vibrant global community of indie game creators. These unique voices, of all backgrounds and nationalities, are disrupting the traditional models of game development, making personal, innovative experiences.\nIn the spirit of movements like the French New Wave, the Punk scene and the Grunge scene, hundreds of indie auteurs are emerging and finding success with their own unique voices and artistic goals. GameLoading: Rise of the Indies aims to capture this exciting moment in time.\nIt\u2019s been a long journey, but we\u2019re finally on the home stretch. \nGameLoading: Rise of the Indies has been in production since 2011, when filmmakers Lester Francois and Anna Brady discovered the innovative, creative games coming out of the indie scene.\nAfter a year of research, we ran a successful Kickstarter campaign in July 2013, and secured funding for our primary film shoot. Late last year, we visited eleven cities in eight countries over three months, and shot dozens of interviews with indie developers, academics, journalists and industry figures. We returned to GDC in March this year, as well as visiting Japan and revisiting Europe to collect the last vital pieces of the puzzle.\nWe are currently deep in the process of editing the film from a rough cut, finalising our distribution arrangements and marketing strategies, and preparing supplementary content. The light at the end of the tunnel is racing towards us \u2013 and we couldn\u2019t be happier with how well the project is coming together.\nWe couldn\u2019t have filmed GameLoading without the support of our original Kickstarter backers and now we\u2019re turning to Kickstarter again to raise funds to put the finishing touches on the film. All original Kickstarter backers who back us a second time get a special Double Backer reward.\nView more images from our journey here: https://www.facebook.com/gameloadingtv/photos_stream\nGameLoading would never have been possible without the support of our Kickstarter backers and we\u2019re incredibly grateful. These pledges enabled us to meet with some of the industry\u2019s brightest and most fascinating developers, and pick their brains to put together a comprehensive and entertaining window into the global indie game community.\nAnd now, we need your help once again. We\u2019re asking for just a little more to help us polish the final product into something we can all be proud of.\nPost-production is expensive. But without it, GameLoading would look like a parents' home movie. Editing takes months, then there's colour grading to make each shot look great, computer graphics and titles, game footage, archival footage, music, sound mixing and a whole lot of other stuff needed to bring the film to cinema quality. Your pledges will go towards our colour grade, sound mix, original music by Tim Shiel, archival footage, motion graphics, overheads, plus legal and accounting fees. \nGameLoading will be finished regardless of further funding but it won\u2019t be a polished product.

Youropeans aren\u2019t gravity defying which means that if you jump while walking on walls or on ceilings you will fall. You can use this to get to new places and conquer obstacles.  \nYou can pick up smaller objects, and use them to activate buttons, panels, hit targets or throw at enemies. Since you are able to carry the objects around you can even drop objects from above to hit either enemies or different interactive objects. Some things have multiple purposes, so be sure to pick up and play with everything.\nA true puzzle platformer needs mechanical object. We have a lot of different things you can activate and play around with. Many of the objects are multipurpose. Which means you can use them from floors, walls and ceilings. \nPaint is central in the game. You need a coat of paint to survive. If you fall from the level, get hit by an enemy or you get in contact with water you lose paint on your body. If your character is stripped of paint, it\u2019s game over. The same goes for your enemies. \nSpray cans are hidden around the levels. Use them to add colour to white graffiti, activate certain objects, or maybe even revive enemies. Using spray cans in the right place at the right time opens up special areas, abilities and levels in the game. \nEnemies can be defeated in many different ways. Sneaking around them undetected is almost always possible, but what will you do if you get in direct confrontation? Go head to head in a fist fight? Trick them into falling off the level? Throw stuff at them? Or maybe set a cunning trap for them?\nCharacters\nYouropean\nA short (1m) humanoid with a large bubble head and suction cups instead of feet. Having suction cups allows the Youropean to walk up walls and up-side-down on the underside of the levels. The Youropean is keept alive by the color on his body. If his body is stripped bare of paint he dies.  \nOnesider  \nYour main adversary. A tall (2m) muscular beefy, but slow thinking, humanoid. For reasons unknown the Onesiders head has merged with its upper body, giving it a distinct thug like look. They have a short attention span, and will forget what they were doing or where they are going after even the slightest distraction. They do however pack a powerful punch, so it\u2019s best to avoid them whenever possible.\nDog\nThese ferocious pets have been inbred a little too much by the Onesiders. The result is an overly aggressive abomination of nature, which will try to snack on any Youropean it can. The Onesiders are using them for patrolling areas and as guard dogs on a leash.\nCustomization\nAre the Youropeans made of wood? Are they sneaky ninjas, or bizarre spacemen? Are the Onesiders monstrous muscle men, or are they really raging green cyclops? It\u2019s all up to you!\nColor brings life, and especially life to the characters of Youropa. In fact, without colour they can\u2019t survive. But exactly which colors and patterns adorn them is up to you. A built-in \"character paint shop\", takes character customisation to the next level. With it you can design the skin of the characters exactly the way you want it. There are no predefined hats, haircuts or shirts, only your unbound creativity!\nLevel Creation\nWith an incredibly easy to use level editor, built right into the game, you can create your own unique levels in minutes. In fact, it\u2019s exactly the same editor we are using, so we are not cutting any corners. As you play through the game you will unlock all the building blocks we've used to create Youropa. Blocks, trees, doors, tennis raquets, you name it. If it\u2019s in the game, you can use it to build your own levels.\nDecorate your levels with paint, vegetation, graffiti, and all manner of props, to make it just perfect.\nWe are giving you all the tools we're using to build the levels, so there is no stopping you. Go nuts and create incredible levels! We can't wait to see what you come up with!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have been working on Youropa as a spare time project for a long time, and a lot of the core game mechanics and graphics are well on the way. But to really achieve our vision for the game, we need to invest all our time in it, and we need to bring in more people to help us complete the project. We know exactly what we want to do, and how to approach it, and we would love to do it with full creative freedom. So for us Kickstarter is the perfect match, and we are certain that crowd funding is the best way to finance the rest of the project.\nThe Budget\nThe diagram below shows you how the pledged money will be spread out.\nKickstarter fees, taxes and your backer rewards take up around 1/3 of the total amount, while the remainder is spread fairly evenly on hiring extra people for doing audio, graphics, programming and level design.\nIn short, we are looking to spend the money on hiring 4-5 additional people (2 graphics people, 1 programmer, 1-2 audio people) to help us finish the game. We are reasonably far in development, but we need additional wizards to help us finish both the things we cannot do on our own, and the things we simply won't have time to do.\nWe can handle around 50% of the coding and 50% of the remaining graphics work in the timeline outlined below. That's why the budget is skewed towards audio and level design, which we cannot do (well) on our own.\nAnd, yes, we have included a small buffer amount, because we've worked on enough projects to know how budgets work. We would rather come up short now, than come up short in 8 months, and tell our (potential) employees that we can't pay their salary. Call us stupid.\nThe Plan\nOur plan is to implement final features from January to mid May 2015. After that we will spend a month and a half making sure that every thing is working as flawlesly and looks as good as possible. July is reserved for optimizing every bit we can, to make sure that the Alpha version in August is running smooth. After Alpha comes Beta, during these months we will be collecting feedback from all you guys, and make sure we fix and tweak anything you find to be broken or less than ideal. Come November and we should be good for launch!\nWe think this is a very feasible plan to execute on time, with four-five extra people on board to take care of all the things we cannot do ourselves.\nThe Team\nYouropa is being developed by frecle, an independent game and media agency founded in 2006 by Mikkel Fredborg and Lasse Cleveland. We have worked on more than 30 published games and successfully completed 200+ consulting jobs on time and budget. Our clients include Microsoft, Siemens, Unity, Discovery Channel, Kodak, Novo Nordisk, as well as a bunch of lesser known brands.\nOn Youropa Mikkel handles coding, shaders, lighting, effects, interface design, vegetation, textures and a bit of 3D modelling. Recently he has been helping PressPlay create Max: The Curse of Brotherhood and Project Totem as Technical Art Director.\nMeanwhile, Lasse produces animation, sketches, concept art, 3D modelling, texturing and level design. Lately, he has also been working on Max: The Curse of Brotherhood and an unannounced project for Kiloo doing 3D graphics. \nFor the past many moons we have been spending far too much of our spare time building Youropa. Now it's time to get to the finish line!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working on the project in our spare time for 7 years now and we are certain that we will deliver a wonderful game.

Put it in your purse or pocket, and you're good to go. Then, when you need it, it can be popped open for up to 10 hours of non-stop protection. As small as it is, one Lily Cup Compact can do the job of 1625 tampons!\n FOLLOW US ON:           FACEBOOK           TWITTER           YOUTUBE\nAS FEATURED ON:\nWe are pioneering this new design in order to make menstrual cups truly user friendly, and help women say goodbye to irritating tampons and pads. But we need your help to make it happen. With your support, we can finally make menstrual cups a mainstream choice for period protection.\nP.S. a menstrual cup is a soft, flexible cup worn internally to collect menstrual flow, rather than absorbing it.\nLily Cup Compact can go everywhere with you!\nHelp the Environment \nDid you know that on average a woman will use and dispose of 12,000 tampons or pads in her life time? Add on all the packaging and wrappers, and you get a LOT of waste polluting the planet.\nBecause Lily Cup Compact is reusable and lasts for years, you'll greatly reduce your eco-footprint. It feels great to know that you're reducing your contribution to environmental waste! \nSave Money  \nThe disposable nature of pads and tampons doesn't only impact the environment - it's a strain on your wallet too... you're throwing money away! One Lily Cup Compact can last for years, so you'll save up to 75% of your menstrual care expenses and never have to run to the drug store again.\nStay Healthy \nPads and tampons may seem harmless, but they can contain nasty chemicals like dioxins and furans, pesticide residues, and fragrances. And did you know that most tampons are not made from cotton, but rayon, which is chemically treated wood pulp?\nAnd, because tampons are absorbent, they can cause dryness, irritation and can mess with your intimate balance.\nLily Cup Compact is made from 100% medical-grade silicone. It is hypoallergenic, latex-free, phthalate-free, and contains zero toxins. Silicone is non-absorbent, so it respects the pH and flora balance of the vagina. \nForget about your period\nWhen inserted, Lily Cup Compact stays in place to keep you protected all day, and gives you up to 10 hours of non-stop protection*. The silicone of the cup has an incredibly soft and smooth finish; you don't even feel your cup when you're wearing it. \n\n*On a medium flow day, on heavy days you will need to empty it more often. \nNow, we know that switching to a reusable menstrual cup can seem like a big change. But once you try it, you won't ever want to go back! \nUsing Lily Cup Compact is actually very simple. Because it is so soft and flexible, it can fold very small, so inserting it is not much different than a non-applicator tampon. \nLily Cup Compact comes in two sizes for the perfect fit. It is best for light to medium flow. \nYou will have the opportunity to choose your size via a survey once the campaign is successfully completed.\nDid you know that menstrual cups have actually been around since the 1930s, the same time as the first commercial tampons were introduced? But cups have always struggled to gain mainstream attention, relegated to specialty health stores. We want to change that.\nChoosing the softest, most flexible silicone\nWe found a medical grade silicone that is so much thinner and more flexible than the silicone used in other cups, and used it to create the original Lily Cup, which we launched in 2012.\nLily Cup 'Classic', launched in 2012\nWith the original Lily Cup, we redefined the look and feel of a cup. We had, at the time, the biggest evolution in menstrual cups with the Lily Cup. But we pushed ourselves to create something revolutionary, to truly make menstrual cups the leading choice for menstrual protection.\nThe 3D design process\nOur brand manager, Amandine Pranlas-Descours, was struck by inspiration while in Japan when she saw an elegant, collapsible drinking cup. After 2 years of development and collaboration between our designers and gynecologists, we had Lily Cup Compact. \nLily Cup Compact - a revolution in menstrual cup design.\nWhat we've done is create a menstrual cup that is so comfortable and convenient that it no longer needs to be seen as an alternative to tampons and pads, but as the very best choice in period protection. \nIf you are new to Kickstarter, here is how it works: If you like Lily Cup Compact and you want to help us make it available to women everywhere, you can make a pledge by clicking the green button on the top right of the page. In return for your support you will be among the first to receive a Lily Cup Compact and other great rewards, but only if we reach our funding target! So please spread the word and help make our project happen. \n*You will be able to choose which size cup: A (light pink) or B (dark pink) you would like via a Kickstarter survey at the end of the campaign.\nAdditional products:\nTriple Action Feminine Wash is the only intimate cleanser specially formulated for long-lasting freshness during your period. The ultra-gentle wash cleanses, deodorizes and soothes.\nMonthly Spa Tablet is a soothing effervescent bath bomb ideal for those discomforting days of menstruation. Infused with calming aloe vera to nourish and restore the skin.  \nLily Cup is the original new generation menstrual cup with a soft flexible shape that can be rolled as thin as a tampon.\nLaselle Kegel Routine includes three Kegel exercisers of varying weights that can be used individually or combined to effectively build pelvic floor strength and tone.\nFeminine Moisturizer is a water-based solution enriched with aloe vera to supplement your body's intimate moisture. \nIntimate Accessory Cleaner is an easy-on, alcohol-free spray for cleaning products intended for intimate use.\nProduction Costs: \nWe've trialed small scale distribution in Europe, but the research and tests for this product have been prohibitively expensive. Your contribution will help us to scale up manufacturing and logistics for a proper, period changing launch. \nAwareness:\nToday, only a small percent of women are aware that there are alternatives to pads and tampons. Pad and tampon manufacturers make huge profits from the guaranteed monthly repurchase of their disposable products, which fund massive advertising campaigns that we can\u2019t compete against. Right now, no major US drug-stores stock menstrual cups on their shelves - we want this to change.\nBy making a pledge today, you are showing that there is a demand for menstrual cups and that women want more choices about what goes in their bodies.

Incredible!! Thank you so much.\nNow, with only days left in the campaign, we're pushing for $50,000, and if we hit it, we're proud to offer this additional reward to EVERYBODY who's pledged $20 or more:\nThree NEVER BEFORE SEEN Jerome Bixby screenplays!\nThese are three unproduced scripts from Bixby's personal archives, selected by Emerson Bixby as some of the finest examples of his father's work. Included will be:\n\"The Sea Demon\" (1964) -- A millionaire playboy converts an old slave ship into a pleasure yacht, only to learn on the maiden cruise that the boat is haunted by the ghosts of murdered Haitian slaves.   \n\"One Million Years and a Day\" (1966) -- American & Soviet scientists working at the South Pole discover an ancient military base which may not be of human origin.  \n\"The Solomon Ordeal\" (1980) -- A demon has taken possession of an engineer who helped developed a doomsday machine, and intends to use it to destroy the world. The only people standing in its way are the man's wife, and a priest who knows that exorcism would only evict the demon -- not destroy him.  \nThe scripts will come to you within a month or so of the completion of the campaign as .pdf files.  \nThis is a remarkably rare opportunity to see further into the mind of the man who not only wrote \"The Man From Earth\", but also several classic Star Trek episodes, \"It's a Good Life\", and of course the sci-fi classic \"Fantastic Voyage\", just to name a few. Don't forget that he also wrote \"It! The Terror from Beyond Space\", which everyone knows formed the basis of \"Alien\". \nSo, please dig deep, and help spread the word in these final days!\nAnd now.... back to our original \"story\":\nFirst, a little background... \nJerome Bixby's The Man From Earth (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttzKqb1ydBw) was produced by Eric D. Wilkinson (\"Paranormal Movie,\" \"Sparks,\" \"The Unwanted,\" \"Mischief Night\" and \"Subterranea\") and co-produced & directed by Richard Schenkman (\"The Pompatus of Love,\" \"Went to Coney Island on a Mission from God...Be Back by Five,\" A Diva's Christmas Carol,\" \"Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies\" and \"Mischief Night\"). \nIt started out as a very small, completely independent, ultra-low budget film, but in the weeks before its release something happened. Somebody somewhere posted a copy online, and people all over the world started downloading and watching the film. What drew their interest? The sci-fi pedigree of the cast? The legendary writer whose last completed work it was? The simple but powerful concept of the story? We don't know, but within weeks tens of thousands of people had seen the film, and within months, millions. It has inspired countless discussions, arguments and repeat viewings. Some folks think it's a pile of crap, others proclaim it to be their favorite movie ever, like this guy: \nVery Nice. So Why Are We Here? \n Over the last few years people have approached us, requesting the rights to turn the piece into a play --- and indeed there have been productions of the theatrical adaptation all over the world (see: http://www.samuelfrench.com/p/2782/jerome-bixbys-the-man-from-earth). Others suggested we make a sequel, or a prequel, or even a TV series; in any case, they sought more chapters in the life of the lead character, John Oldman. \nAfter much brainstorming, we came up with so many story ideas that we realized the best way to proceed would be not with a second movie, but with a series that would honor the tone, content and ideas of the original film while telling bold new tales. We're thrilled to be able to turn directly to the film's fans to help fund the pilot episode, which once again challenges long-held beliefs in a dramatic and compelling fashion.\nWhen our pilot episode begins, it\u2019s seven years since the events shown in \u201cJerome Bixby\u2019s The Man From Earth\u201d and John Oldman now calls himself John Young. No longer with Sandy, he\u2019s contentedly teaching at a small college when a group of devoted students seem to stumble onto his secret. Taking no chances, John prepares to leave the school but his plans go awry and he finds himself in a crisis.\nWe also learn that Art Jenkins wrote a book about the fateful night when John told his friends the truth of his existence. Insisting that it was a not a novel but a true story, Art was discredited and has grown bitter and resentful, anxious to once again confront John, if he could only find him. And thanks to Art\u2019s book, there are other people who want to know more about this mysterious \u201cimmortal.\u201d\nSoon John finds himself in the heart of a terrible conflict between what he knows to be right, and the limits of any man's humanity.\nJohn has spent so many years\u2026 centuries\u2026 with his head kept down, keeping his profile low while teaching students and helping people when he could. But what if the changes in recent years have made that more difficult, even impossible?\nWhere could John go to hide? In a world where security cameras and social media track our every move, how do you remain unseen, especially when there are people looking for you? How do you continue to teach, to help\u2026 to do the things which are essential to your humanity?\nHow does a man who values privacy above all deal with the loss of his anonymity?\nAnd beyond that -- what if the changes to the Earth have taken an unexpected toll? What if, after fourteen thousand years, John Oldman is... aging?\nWhat's the Plan?\nIt is our intention to begin pre-production in September of this year, and start shooting in December, most likely in the Los Angeles area. Ultimately, we hope to present the finished program to the world by summer, 2015.\nAs for distribution, there are several possibilities. One is that we license the series to an established entertainment service like Netflix or Amazon\u2026 another is that we license the show to a cable channel like SyFy\u2026 and yet another might be a more experimental route, using an online pay-to-view service like Vimeo or Vodo\u2026 and there are many more possibilities beyond. But first, we need a pilot episode.\nIt's Kickstarter. What about the Rewards? \nWe want everybody who loved the original film to be able to participate in this project. Therefore, the primary, basic reward is simply the opportunity to follow us on the adventure of making the show, to be among the very first people to see it, and to join us for a discussion following the online world premiere.\n\nRewards which involve seeing the completed program will hopefully take place in summer 2015. We intend to produce a full-length \u201cmaking-of\u201d documentary and this program will be exclusively available on the DVD for those supporters who pledge at that level. DVD's will be sent when they are produced, coinciding with the program\u2019s commercial release or will be custom-made for supporters of this campaign.\n\nHere's a look the front of the very, very rare \"Man From Earth\" mini-poster signed by the director and several cast members back in 2007:\nFinally, a note about our goal: \nAs stated in the video at the top of this page, we already have a portion of the production budget secured. Our stated goal for this campaign is the number of dollars that will bring us to the bare minimum total amount needed to create the show.  \nBut if we beat the current goal and raise $50,000 or even more, it will be enormously helpful. As any cinephile knows, when it comes to film & TV production, time is money. With more time to prep and shoot, plus more time in post-production to hone the sound, enhance the look and enrich the music, we will simply have a better show. And if this campaign is wildly successful, we could even consider shooting a second episode right away. \nSpeaking of which -- it's time announce a STRETCH GOAL:\nIf we hit $45,000, EVERY supporter who has pledged $29 or more will ALSO receive a .pdf of the shooting script for the original film \"Jerome Bixby's The Man From Earth\" AS WELL AS an .mp3 download of the COMPLETE SOUNDTRACK to that motion picture.\nAnd what happens if we hit $50,000? Wait and see.... Or better yet:\nPlease dig deep and, more importantly, spread the word! This is a central truth to ANY Kickstarter campaign: your help writing, posting, calling, tweeting, texting and chatting about this endeavor is at least as important as your financial pledge. We literally cannot do it without you. The fact is that if only a tiny fraction of the millions of people who have seen Jerome Bixby's The Man From Earth donated a mere $5 to this campaign, we'd be funded several times over! \n Thank you for taking a look at this campaign, and thank you for your support of The Man From Earth: The Series!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are endeavoring to independently make a low-budget TV pilot, and of course there are risks inherent in such an undertaking. But we -- the filmmakers -- have between us a strong track record of completing and releasing our projects. While we may face delays, setbacks or disappointments over the course of prepping, shooting and completing this show, we are confident that at the end of the day, we will have a challenging and entertaining program that will be worthy successor to Jerome Bixby's The Man From Earth.\n\nBut, what if it all goes wrong and despite succeeding at this stage of the plan we somehow fail to complete the program?

For the latest, go to rimworldgame.com.\n-------------------------\nRimWorld follows three survivors from a crashed space liner as they build a colony on a frontier world at the rim of the galaxy.\nFor Windows, Mac, Linux. The game will be distributed by DRM-free download and backers will also get Steam keys. If you can't back here, there are PayPal buttons with the same rewards at rimworldgame.com.\nSo far this has been a one-person project. I'm Kickstarting now so I can hire specialists to do music, sound, and art for the game.\nThe AI Storyteller\nI've always thought the best part of games like Dwarf Fortress and The Sims was the stories that come out of them. That's why RimWorld is designed as a story generator. It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.\nTo keep things interesting, the game creates events like pirate raids, trader arrivals, and storms. But these events aren't random. RimWorld uses an AI Storyteller (modeled after the AI Director from Left 4 Dead) who analyzes your situation and decides which event she thinks will make the best story. There are several storytellers to choose from:\nCassandra Classic aims to create a rising curve of tension over the course of the game. Early on, the most dangerous thing she'll do is send a psychotic squirrel after you. Later on, bands of scavengers will arrive. In the late game, look forward to combined-arms attacks from mercenaries mixed with lightning storms and crop blights. If you want a traditional tension and difficulty curve, go with Cassandra.\nPhoebe Friendly is for the player who just wants to build and watch a colony grow. She'll occasionally create minor disasters, but nothing that would threaten the existence of the colony. If you want a more relaxing game about growth and success, choose Phoebe.\nRandy Random follows no rules. He may give you some amazing stroke of luck, like a trader selling an advanced weapon for a low price or a group of helpful immigrants, followed by a near-unbeatable pirate attack combined with an electrical fire. If you think losing is fun, you might want to try Randy.\nAnd we're considering other AI Storytellers, too. High population storytellers, starvation storytellers, seasonal storytellers, moody storytellers, and anything the community thinks up are all on the table.\nAn aboveground colony at night.\nA motley crew\nIn RimWorld, your colonists are not professional settlers \u2013 they\u2019re survivors from a crashed passenger liner. They'll be accountants, homemakers, journalists, cooks, nobles, urchins, and soldiers.\nEach character has a background that affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (for recruiting prisoners or negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically-engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\nYou\u2019ll acquire more colonists by taking in refugees, capturing people in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, rescuing them, or taking in migrants.\nOver the course of long games, players develop a motley group of refugees, pirate raiders, purchased slaves, and crashlanded survivors. The diversity of people makes each colony unique.\nYou won't get hundreds of colonists - we want to keep the number small enough that you can know each one individually.\nRaiders burn out some walled-in colonists.\nThe Tactics Engine\nRimWorld uses an engine that I originally developed to power a tactical sim similar to Jagged Alliance 2. This means it has a lot of features designed to make small-team firefights interesting. For example:\nThere's a cover system that models low cover and leaning around corners.\nThere's a really nuanced algorithm for determining and reporting hit chances based on distance, skill, weapon, lighting, angle, and cover.\nWeapons have some pretty deep stats.\nThe AI plans and executes tactical moves like flanking while trying to stay out of the enemy's line of fire. It uses a number of heuristic algorithms to analyze the battlefield and use the space effectively. It works with allies and avoids bunching up.\nI think most base-builder developers wouldn't put this much effort into a tactics engine, but having inherited from that earlier project, RimWorld benefits greatly in unexpected ways.\nBecause of how important cover and positioning are in gunfights, our combat interacts deeply with the colony's layout and structure. This means players have to think about how they want to position their constructions to maximum advantage in future firefights. Combat in general is a lot more interesting than the traditional trading of blows you might expect in a base-building game. And it's possible to build a wide variety of base configurations for maximum tactical advantage against diverse foes.\nRaiders assault from the north. The colonists have fallen back from their frontline sandbag positions. (click to expand).\nThe teaching system\nThis kind of game can be really hard to learn. So we've created an adaptive teaching system that watches your actions to figure out which parts of the game you understand, and teaches the parts you're missing. If you don't understand a control, the game will notice and help you out unobtrusively. If you already know something, the game won't interrupt you.\nRimWorld also uses a notification system to make sure you don't miss anything that needs looking at. If you're low on food, or a colonist is about to go berserk, a message hovers in the corner of the screen informing you of the fact. No more getting annihilated because you missed some little detail. If you get annihilated, it'll be for a totally legitimate reason.\nPsychology\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. You can inspect a character's psychology at any time to see what they're feeling and why.\nWhen a colonist becomes too stressed, they may suffer a \"mental break\". Some will give up and wander the colony for a time. Some will leave. And some will, in dwarfish fashion, become psychotic and throw a violent tantrum.\nSheckley the miner thinks about a recent battle while rescuing a wounded friend.\n  The universe\nThe flavor of RimWorld is a mix between hard sci-fi and the Old West. It's a rim world at the edge of the galaxy, far from the civilized core worlds. The planet is vast and mostly empty, and there are no strong civilizing authorities anywhere nearby. You're on your own.\nThe core idea in the RimWorld universe is diversity. In the this setting, humanity is spread across the galaxy, yet lacks any way of traveling or communicating faster than light. Combined with the fact that stellar civilizations regress (due to war or plague) as often as they progress, this means that someone traveling between stars may end up interacting with people at any level of development, from pre-agricultural tribes to transcendent machine gods.\nYour starting colonists in RimWorld are at a technological level in the middle of this span. But you may end up interacting with people at much lower and higher levels, as well as acquiring and using their tools and weapons. In RimWorld, a single fight can involve a bow and arrow, a revolver, a charged-shot pulse rifle, and a near-magical teleportation device.\nA developed underground colony with a large hydroponic grow-op.\nIn its fiction, RimWorld draws a lot from Firefly. This is where it gets its subtle Western vibe - frontier living, an arid environment, sparse law enforcement, and the constant threat of outlaws. We're also heavily inspired by science fiction novels like Dune and Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series (which both Alistair Lindsay and I are huge fans of). The Warhammer 40,000 universe also forms part of our inspiration.\nIn terms of game design, the game draws most from the 800-pound gorilla of the simulation genre, Dwarf Fortress. We also take ideas from indie hits like FTL (our semi-random event format) and Prison Architect (its way of presenting a complex world in a comprehensible, interactive way). And, there are many others.\nWe're in the gaming press!\n\u2022RockPaperShotgun: (Space) Colonial Ambition (September 18)\n\u2022 The Jace Hall Show: Former Bioshock Infinite Developer Goes Indie With Space Colonization Sim: RIMWORLD (September 18)\n\u2022 BeefJack: Dwarf Fortress in Space: RimWorld (September 19)\n\u2022 RockPaperShotgun: Outer Limits: RimWorld Lands On Kickstarter (October 4)\n\u2022 WorthPlaying: RimWorld announced, seeks crowd funding (October 4)\nRimWorld's development is arranged into \"modules\". The plan is to work until one module is finished, release it, and then choose the next based on what people want. This way, the game will grow organically according to the feedback of the community, while remaining playable at all times.\nAs a Kickstarter backer, you'll be one of the voices with the most influence over which direction we take the game. Perhaps you'll like some of the modules I'm interested in below. And if you've got an idea for another, please let us know.\nNote that this list of modules isn't a roadmap or a plan. These may not all ever be finished. They're options I'm offering to the community. Which way should we take the game after the Kickstarter?\nProposed Modules\nTynan Sylvester - Design and programming\nI've been making games over ten years. The first were Unreal Tournament mods, followed by my four years at Irrational Games working on BioShock Infinite, followed by the indie projects I've worked on since. I also wrote a game design book called Designing Games and published it with O'Reilly Media. There's more about me at my website, including various articles I've written on game design.\nAlistair Lindsay - Audio hero\nAlistair is perfect for this project. He did audio on games like DEFCON (haunting!), Darwinina (quirky!), and Prison Architect (engaging!), so he knows how to work with this kind of game and he knows how to handle an indie sound project top to bottom. He's been working game audio since 1999 when he started with Rare. \nAlistair doesn't just try to make an effect in a game sound like what it represents. He thinks about how his audio will make players feel on a subliminal level. He's going to be doing magic like adjusting ambience, interface, and game sounds to match the AI Storyteller's desired mood, to make you feel tense or relaxed or excited just as he wishes. I'm almost scared of him.\nThe dude is legit and I'm really happy to have connected with him. As a first sample, Alistair was good enough to do the audio for the RimWorld trailer. I think he did an awesome job of nailing the sci-fi/Western feel.\nTo Be Determined - Art\nWe're still in talks with some artists who are ready to help develop a unique and effective look for the game.\nIs there more info?\nYes. See our development blog, and the forums, where testers have been discussing their play experiences. To keep updated, you can also follow me on Twitter.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe game is getting to the point where I (Tynan Sylvester) can't do everything it needs myself. It needs audio, and it needs art. This means I need to contract people to do these things, which takes money.\nIn addition, there are basic costs to setting up a corporation, software licenses (e.g. Unity costs $1500), and so on.\nIt looks a lot like Prison Architect. What's up with that?\nBlame my (Tynan's) lack of art skill - especially with characters. I made the character art you see in the trailer as a stopgap, and borrowed the Prison Architect style because I'm not a good enough artist to develop a new one. They were never intended to be final. With this Kickstarter, we'll be able to get a real artist who can sit down and develop an original style for RimWorld.\nI've talked with the original Prison Architect artist, Ryan Sumo, and he's fully supportive of RimWorld. We didn't share any art or code with the PA guys.\nWhen will the game be available?\nThe game works now. If you're in the influencer tier, you'll get access to the current pre-alpha as soon as the Kickstarter ends and we work out the payment and download details (which could take a few days after November 1).\nI've run several playtests and verified that real people can pick it up and enjoy it. It is, however, a bit light on content, and there are bugs. I'd like to squash this stuff as fast as possible.\nI think we can have the first more stable and well-rounded public alpha (with audio and art contributions) out in January 2014.\nWhen will it be completely done?\nAfter the public alpha in January 2014, I'll continue development based on what people seem to want. I don't know how long after that the game is finished. Development could continue for a long time, depending on community response. This is really the kind of game that could expand forever. Regardless, everyone who gets the alpha will continue to get updates right up to the final game.\nDRM?\nNope. No DRM.\nPlatforms?\nRimWorld is currently being tested on Windows and Mac. Unity (the technological base for the game) also supports Linux, so we'll be releasing for that too. There may eventually be an iPad version, depending on how the Kickstarter does, but this isn't planned in the next few months.\nHow do we know this isn't vaporware?\nYou should be concerned. Kickstarter projects often don't get finished. But this one will be. Here's how you know:\nThe game already exists, and the testers are already having good experiences with it. We've got a small crew of testers on the Ludeon forums sharing their experiences with the game. Take it from them, not from me.\nI have a history of finishing projects. I wrote a book and got it published with O'Reilly media. I'm a professional with experience at a major studio. I know how to schedule a project and handle design risk.\nI wasn't willing to make this project public until I knew it was on the path to being a real game. That's why I made so many prototypes before settling on this concept. Most game ideas don't work well. But this one does.\nThere are still risks in this project, but they are about individual features, not the project as a whole. Some ideas will fail, and some parts will need to be redesigned. But RimWorld will not become vaporware. We've already got a game here, and it's a good one - we just need your help to make it as great as it can be.\nAre there multiple Z-levels?\nNo. RimWorld isn't really about digging the way Dwarf Fortress is, and there are tons of interesting story things you can do with no Z-levels. We're focusing on the story-generating parts of the game. Z-levels may come eventually, but not soon.\nWill there be multiplayer?\nIt's possible; and if the community asks for it consistently I'll gladly put it in. But it's not immediately on the to-do list and it would be a significant amount of effort to do. For the near future, I want to work a lot more on fleshing out the library of events and the AI Storytellers.\nIs there a community?\nYes! There's tons of good discussion on the Ludeon Forums. You're invited to contribute your ideas as well. Fans have even created a RimWorld subreddit. I maintain a development blog at the Ludeon Studios website.\nFor the creative rewards, what are the constraints?\nTo keep things consistent, there's a whole set of documents about this. Please check the creative rewards guidelines.\nCan I make YouTube videos/interview you/try the game for press purposes?\nProbably. If you're a journalist or a YouTuber who gets at least 1000 views per video, please email me.\nLightning strikes during a rainstorm.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee the FAQ above: How do we know this isn't vaporware?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Alpha 13 - Trapped With Your Ex released!", "update_content": "Here\u2019s Alpha 13 \u2013 Trapped With Your Ex!\nTo get your update, you can re-download from the same link as last time.

Now you must gather them up and restore civilization to a ruined city, one building at a time.\nRebuild is a strategy sim game, a little like Sim City or The Sims, with a bit of Choose Your Own Adventure and a heap of dark humor. It's a thoughtful, slow-paced game that will make you fond of your survivors before you have to send them to their deaths. You'll manage food, morale and supplies while fending off illness, wild dogs, crazy cults and raiders. And the dead are still out there wandering the streets, hungrier than ever.\nRebuild 2 (aka Rebuild Mobile) has been called \"unputdownable\" by Touch Arcade, graced Kongregate's top games and has been played by millions in their browsers and on their phones. But the fans want an even better, bigger Rebuild. And just like your own personal zombie butler (spoiler??), I am here to serve.\nRebuild 1 was almost a prototype; I used my own stick man art and only released it as a free Flash game. People liked it, so a year later I teamed up with artist EvilKris to make Rebuild 2. It had gorier graphics, deeper characters and more story, and was the first game I sold on iOS and Android where it's known as simply \"Rebuild\".\nStill, fans asked for a third game and filled my inbox and the Rebuild 3 ideas wiki with awesome suggestions. How could I not make a third Rebuild game? They were practically writing it for me! But this time I wanted to make it much more epic than the first two games.\nRebuild 3: Gangs of Deadsville will be the first PC downloadable game in the series, released on Steam for Windows and Mac. To give an idea of scale, I've already spent more hours working on it than Rebuild 1 and 2 combined, and it's only half done. I've hired two artists and a writer this time and we're working to make Gangs of Deadsville the most engaging, deep, and fun game possible.\nMore screenshots here!\nWin/Mac on Steam as well as iOS and Android\nNPC faction forts you can trade, compete, ally or go to war with\nUnique faction leaders with their own personalities, motivations and stories\nCampaign story mode that takes you from small towns into the heart of the big city\nOption to play in real-time for a more fast paced, natural experience\nAll new events, storylines and secrets with enough text to fill a novel\nNew graphical style featuring a ton of unique survivors and event illustrations\nNew interface with drag & drop survivors, squads, zooming, and ginormous cities\nSurvivor perks, background stories and individual happiness\nNew system for determining the politics and priorities of your fort\nA glorious big branching tech tree for your engineers to research\nNew systems for skills, missions, and fort defense\nNew equipment, buildings, and resources\nNearly every UI improvement that fans have asked for\nSee? It's a lot. The core gameplay will still be the Rebuild that players know, but everything else is significantly embiggened.\nMy biggest expense for this game is the art. I want to bring Gangs of Deadsville to as many new players as I can, which means focusing on how the game looks and feels as much as how it plays. I've hired lead artist Adam Meyer of Steamroller Studios, who defined the new style of clean vector art and iconic characters.\nI also recently brought on Sara Gross (aka Two Bit Art) to help with illustrations for the game's hundreds of events. Most of the stories in Rebuild are told via snippets of interactive fiction, so these pictures will pull you in better than text alone.\nThis is where your money's going: Adam, Sara and Stephen are doing great work on the game so far, and I want to pay them to make even more awesome content for it.\nI'm also going to \"Kick it Forward\": pledge 5% of the profits to future Kickstarter projects, because there are an awful lot of cool games out there that deserve to get made. kickingitforward.org\nDepending on how high we go past the initial funding goal, I've got some extra content stretch goals I'd like to put into the game to make it even more awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere's no question I'll be able to finish Rebuild: Gangs of Deadsville. There's already a lot riding on it in terms of my personal investment, and all the faith and effort that fans have made to send me their suggestions for it. Everyone's excited about this game, and I won't let you down.\n\nThe question is just how awesome will it be. Since most Rebuild fans have only played the free Flash version, will anyone pay for a more fully-featured downloadable Rebuild game? Can I afford to make it truly epic? This is what I hope to answer with this campaign.\n\nThe game's release goal is May 2014. I can't guarantee we'll make that, but I can guarantee you'll be able to play a beta version by then. The digital artbook will ship shortly after the game launch.

In the beginning it was pretty bad; hell, you can still see my earliest videos if you don't believe me! \nSoon after, I got my act together and threw up The Super Indie Spotlight and Top 5 FREE Indie Games to cover everything from latest indie game commercial releases, to the unfinished and obscure titles in a more enjoyable and resolute format. \nDevelopers started to take notice and I began filling a gap that existed on YouTube; giving EVERYONE the opportunity they deserved to shine.\nHere, take a look at a couple of my videos:\nTop 15 Roguelikes for Beginners and Experts Alike:\nTop 10 Indie Games of 2012!\nSuper Indie Spotlight - Wanderlust: Rebirth!\nIndie Statik is a website and YouTube show, and community that focuses on discussing indie games and the culture surrounding them.\nOh, now it's my bit. Hi, I'm Chris Priestman. In the Summer of 2012, I was looking for somewhere to write about indie games but wanted to do it on my own accord...because I like strange games that not many publications cover or care for.\nIt was decided that I would head up an Indie Statik website. Josh and I then tried our best to round up a few like-minded people to help out our cause, too. We did that and you can see them all here. Then, we were able to soft-launch the website in November 2012 and have been going ever since!\nOur roots are pretty punk, I suppose; covering obscure games, asking questions that others aren't, not being afraid to investigate shady dealings in the industry, and discussing niche topics with an interest in exploring the full potential of the medium.\nWe've not even been around a year yet, but we're told that we're doing things right by readers and developers. We attend conventions across the world, and enjoy hanging out at various indie game events, where we're encouraged to keep up what we're doing with great big smiles. It feels pretty great!\nOh, and Static with a 'K' was Josh's handle way back in the days of playing competitive Counter-Strike in the 1.1 - 1.5 era.\nWHAT IS THE MONEY GONNA BE USED FOR?\nKeeping Indie Statik chugging along and push it to a point that it's self-sufficient, paying content creators, and covering necessary costs.\nTo continue following our passion, we need some resources. This thing I've created has become much bigger than I had ever anticipated!\nUntil now, we've been running the website and YouTube show with our personal savings, and the limited funding that we were lucky enough to receive. \nSadly, that just isn't enough to keep us going any longer. So, in order to continue covering indie games daily, and provide more quality content than you can handle, we're asking for your generosity (in return for some really cool stuff).\nWhile it's true that we already have a website that is operational, there are some things that are holding us back from being as great as we know we can be. \nPaying content creators is very important to us, and with financial support we're able to continue doing what we do, and more! As you can probably guess, the more content we can produce, the more the site will grow and the more we are able to give back to the indie games community. \nAs it is now, most people contributing to Indie Statik (Including Josh and Priest) have to work day jobs to pay rent. Which is fine, but not always ideal, and certainly not in the best interests of Indie Statik.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS IF YOU SURPASS YOUR GOAL?\nA free indie games arcade on our website, more staff, more website features, an indie games travel show (we go to developers get-ups), and even an Indie Statik booth with cool games at various conventions and shows.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Statik has been operational for almost a year now, but it\u2019s reached the point where it can no longer sustain itself at its current rate without additional support.

Our Drifter is haunted by an insatiable illness, traveling further into the lands of Buried Time, steeped in blood and treasure hoping to discover a way to quiet the vicious disease. Echoes of a dark and violent past from the dead eras resonate throughout and he can't help but listen.\nHyper Light Drifter is a 2D Action RPG in the vein of the best 8-bit and 16-bit classics, with modernized mechanics and designs on a much grander scale.\nVisions for this game have been fluttering in my skull for ages; something dark and fantastic, with giant forests to navigate, huge floating structures to explore, deep crumbling ruins to loot, massive throngs of enemies to rend, and behemoths both flesh and mechanical to overcome. I want it all to be as beautiful as possible, forging color with the dark and eerie wastes and intimidating landscapes. It plays like the best parts of A Link to the Past and Diablo, evolved: lightning fast combat, more mobility, an array of tactical options, more numerous and intelligent enemies, and a larger world with a twisted past to do it all in.\nRip through enemies with responsive, fun combat; engaging and brutal. Upgrade weapons, discover new equipment and trek deeper than ever.\nTraverse a dark, detailed and interconnected world with alternate paths and secret loot. Miyazaki films have taught me that beautiful animation and design add life to a world. From characters to background elements, everything is lovingly crafted while I hum show-tunes and squint suspiciously at the flickering pixels until they perform as intended.\nA challenge - The game is accessible and easy to pick up, but difficult to master and complete; enemies and hazards become more vicious and numerous, so players must use clever tactics to avoid death. (Some yell hurtful phrases at players simply to bring tears to the cereal bowl below.)\n  Core Mechanics\nPrimary weapon - Composed of phase shifted Hard Light (also known as Solid Light), your sword acts as the primary means of offense; it's quick, brutal, and can slash through most anything. Best of all it never runs low on energy.\nSprite Companion - An indispensable personalized drone, the Sprite manages your inventory virtually, maintains your shields, seeks out hidden paths and lights the way in the darkest of times. Functionality may be expanded with new modules.\nSecondary items - You'll come across a variety of advanced weaponry, items and gear throughout your travels; Light Rail Pistols, Heavy Rifles, various hi-power explosives and enemy-aware Seeker Drones. All of these are powered by limited batteries, found scattered throughout the world. \nDefense System - A rechargeable Hard Light Diamond shield which offers total protection from attacks for a short burst of time. If timed correctly projectiles can be reflected back at enemies for extra damage. Can be upgraded to extend duration.\nDash Module - Multi-use gear that enables a triple speed dash; can be used to evade attacks, cut across gaps and chasms, break through certain blocks and rubble and even stun enemies.\nRifle\nRoly Poly\nFrom Sean Ward\nEnemy Sprites\nFrom Nick Wozniak\nFrom Ian Schlaepfer\nBoss Reveals\n#1\nSprite work: Johan Vinet\nName: Rivan The Tamer\nAttributes: User of searing RedShift light, causing great destruction when attacking. His companion beast adds to his already fierce tactics.\nDomain: The Deep Red Keep, roaming the Barren Halls.\n#2\nMusic Reveal\nFrom the Masterful Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) here's the first sample track:\nNotes on $160,000 Goal:\nI want this game to shine. I want to fully indulge this vision, so I will use the funds to further the quality of the game rather than bolster any after-thoughts.\nOn $180,000 Goal:\nThere are so many great artists, illustrators, writers, wonderfully creative people that I'm surrounded by and I want them in on this! I plan to commission small pieces of art to flesh out the world; they can create new character that live in this world, write new lore, and punch out some rad art, all within the limitations of the history and style of this world. All work will be collected in the Companion Art Book and their pieces featured on our site once they start producing!\nOn $200,000 Goal:\nThe Companion Art Book is a physical compendium of knowledge and reference materials, high res unused art assets and never before seen art works for the project. It will also include commissioned pieces and extended lore for the world and characters within created by several artists throughout the community as well as a collection of some of the fan art that has been and continues to be posted. (Love it all!) this will be available for purchase after the campaign has ended, once everything has been commissioned and compiled. \nNotes on PS4 + Vita + Wii U + OUYA support\nREVISION! I'd like for everyone to be able to get the version they want. If you have already contributed at the $10 tier, simply pledge an additional $5 and I'll compose a survey after the campaign is over to determine which version you would like a key for. Cross-buy is undetermined for right now. If you have already contributed at $15 or more, you will be given the choice of PC, Linux, Mac, PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA. That's as simple as I can make it for now!\nDetails on the Challenge Mode\nThis mode will have several mix-up mini quests for you to test your skills at; you'll have wave-based challenges where you fight off increasingly difficult hordes to see how long you can survive as you level up, boss rush runs, speed runs and other odd modes that wouldn't typically fit in the main game. All will have a scoring mechanism that unlocks achievements, plus we are working on local co-op for this mode.\nPhysical Box and Manual\nWe will be able to provide and ship out a slick designed SNES style physical box and manual to go with your digital download! Both printed in full color and shipped directly to you. This is NOW a Reward Tier AND you can get it as an add-on for any Tier if you add $35 to your pledge! The Stretch Goal allows us to offer it outside of the Kickstarter for any who would like to nab it down the line.\nThe game is in a prototype phase, planned initially for PC, though I would love to expand to other platforms. \nHaving worked with Beau Blyth of Samurai Gunn fame on the programming side, the framework for the game is in place - remaining mechanics and the body of the game will slot nicely into current systems. All will be refined until it feels sleek, satisfying and fun. \nThe venerable and talented Disasterpeace (Rich Vreeland) has been gracious enough to jump on board to compose the soundtrack!\nThe bigger task ahead is asset generation; enemy sprites (which use dozens of frames of hand drawn art, including the major Boss encounters), new level designs (plus fancy lighting!), and sound design.\nIf I reach the $64,000 stretch goal, I will be able to hire a secondary animator/designer which will allow more time to sink into expanding the world.\nThe $75,000 goal will allow for an even deeper soundtrack with bonus tracks plus a SFX pro.\nI have planned for a potential release date in mid 2014, with beta access at least two months prior, allowing time to tweak and bug-fix and adjust according to player feedback. A more solid schedule will become apparent for backers once resources have been assessed.\nThis project has rapidly evolved into a much larger world and story and needs the help of the community in order for it to thrive.\nCompleting this game by mid 2014 requires focus and time; the initial goal will afford me these two (current) luxuries.The higher stretch goals will allow a fully realized version.\nPaying outside help - This is a passion project for me, but other friends and professionals (such as Beau and Rich) need to be compensated for their tremendous talents. Having a sound effects producer/musical talent as well as an animator to assist would lighten the workload considerably and allow me to concentrate on the overall structure and scope of the game, as well as fine tuning all of the time consuming little things.\nCompany and operation costs - In order to begin selling through any platform I'll need to establish Heart Machine as a full game company, which takes a fair chunk of money and time, plus licensing, living costs and bills factor in.\nImproving and fixing - Getting testers, implementing community feedback, using every ounce of my soul to produce a game I've been dreaming of for decades.\nAccess to the Game \nI have been researching distribution methods. Now I have PC, Mac, Linux (DRM-Free or Steam), PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA.\nThe closed Beta will surely hold some valuable insight, and in order to implement that knowledge delays may happen. I will do my best to keep Backers informed of progress on all fronts.\n  Concepts\nAlex Preston (Heart Machine) -alxpreston.com, @HeartMachineZ\nLead Designer + Animator + Secondary Programming\nI've been an illustrator and designer for a good long while now. Developing games has been a passion of mine since I was a child, though I've never had the courage and support until now to actually release something into the wild. Spread your neon wings you sweet pixelated bastard!\nBeau Blyth (Teknopants) -teknopants.com, @Teknopants\nLead Programmer + Tremendous Hair\nDeveloped loads of rad fast-paced arcade style games including the upcoming super bad-ass Samurai Gunn.

Is producing another track for the game during production.\nTeddy Diefenbach (TeddyDief) -teddydiefenbach.com, @TeddyDief\nA thoughtful soul who created The Moonlighters and Shove Pro, co-founded Rad Dragon, is a programmer and game designer extraordinaire. Dives deep into things such as systems design, narrative design and his ultimate mission of recreating the golden age of late 90s Squaresoft.\nThe Game\nAll copies will be sent out upon release 2014. Planned platforms are Windows, Linux and Mac OSX and now PS4, Vita, Wii U, and OUYA. PC copies can be DRM-free or Steam keys (thanks to our backers pushing us through Greenlight!). Everyone in the $10 tier will get the PC/Mac/Linux game on release, $15 and above will net you an option for PS4, Vita, Wii U, or OUYA, and the $25 tier receives a Kickstarter exclusive version of the game with bonus side quest.\nInstruction Booklet\nA nifty little booklet to bring you back to the days when manuals meant something; revealing a little known move, a secret passage, or simply bolstering the story and context of the world outside of the game. This particular Instruction Book will include all of those items and more, with illustrations to accompany important sections.\nCompanion Book (Art and Stories)\nThis beauty will contain tons of concept illustrations, sprites, sketches, notes on characters and the world, plus revealing knowledge of the finer details of this realm. This process has already generated a lot of assets that won't be used in game, so I'd like to provide a look behind-the-scenes of a project like this. Plus silly drawings of cat creatures and Pork-Peoples will be stuffed into the pages for pure entertainment purposes. Much mocking of lowly creatures shall be had!\nOriginal Soundtrack\nThe master Rich Vreeland (Disasterpeace) will be composing the eerie OST for this game! I'm jazz-handin' all around this room with excitement at this very moment, nearly unable to continue typing! The full OST will be included in digital form at the $40 Tier with bonus tracks. Boom!\nAlternate Drifter\nReceive a Kickstarter-only alternative main playable character to destroy and explore with. He might have a variant weapon, glowing eyes, and sinister intentions.\nResplendent Print\nA 18x24 archival quality print of the main character posing in a fantastic manner (probably with creature parts flying about) will be yours to man-handle or gently place in a frame. Hand signed and numbered, with a lovely thank you note on the rear to haunt you in your sleep.\nImmortal sprite\nYour name will be translated to the in-game rune system, thus immortalizing your very being into this world beyond. These symbols will be used in special locations. Real names only, please. (No, Crack McButtson is not a real name.)\nDesign a dastardly enemy\nPut your skills to use and help design the look, behavior, name and location a new enemy will appear.

That was the biggest hurdle to overcome. The second was exposing this to the public eye, as that can be a terrifying prospect; and here it is.\n\nCreative endeavors like this are difficult and often unwieldy beasts with many mouths to feed and razor-tipped claws to bind. I've written and planned as much as I possibly could up to this point, and with the framework in place I have the bulk of the more difficult obstacles conquered. Issues will come, as they always do in any long-term project, but I feel thoroughly prepared; I have the proper tools and skills and a large support network through our shared community space Glitch City which is bursting at the seams with excellent developers with vast wells of knowledge and years of experience prototyping, building, and releasing games. I feel incredibly lucky to be tapped into this community and to have such reliable friends willing to lend a hand with resources I may need in the future to complete this game.\n \nI've done what I can to get this far through some rather extreme health struggles, and I don't plan to stop.

Look at them!\nFootage #1 - Quick look at stealth\nFootage #2 - Landscape. Separate write-up here.\nPart 1 and Part 2 of the game's birth, with some mutterings about level design here. Alex also goes into how language in Tangiers affects the gameplay.\nTangiers is a dark, uneasy game - an exploration of broken cities and landscapes.\n\"...Tangiers must see the light of day, and I trust in Mr Harvey's passion to see that happen.\" - Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\"...striking art style and bold ideas have certainly left me hungry to find out more.\" - Eurogamer\n\"I don\u2019t know where Tangiers has been hiding, but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s finally emerged from the shadows of its stark industrial environment...\" - PCGamer\nTangiers is a blend of stealth and exploration for Windows, Mac and Linux built within the Unity engine.\nUsing the sandbox stealth of Looking Glass Studio's Thief series as the base of Tangiers, we're looking to build a world inspired by, embodying and adapting the darker avant-garde of the 20th century.\nWriters such as Burroughs and Ballard, artists within the Dada movement and the music and textures of Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and David Lynch all drive us. They are our motivations - often oblique, sometimes in open reference.\nYou play an outsider to the world, an entity with a singular, enigmatic goal - to find and dispose of five other beings. Your arrival here has fractured the world; the city that these other beings resided in is now broken into shards  across a broken, bleak landscape.\nYou must infiltrate these cities, searching to discover your marks - investigating both precisely who, and where.\nKeeping to the shadows is to be encouraged - reality here is a fragile place. Your interactions with the world cause it to fall apart. In homage to Burrough's cut-up technique, the world collapses and rebuilds itself the more you interact with it - future areas rebuilt with the fragments and personality of places you mistreated. From this every play-through will, subtly or drastically, be unique to you.\nThe fragile state is inherent in the entire setting. The spoken words of its inhabitants materialize physically - collect the frustrations of a guard unable to locate you and use them to distract, mislead and spread disinformation. Gather the intimate words of an illicit conversation and use them to unveil secrets, hidden pockets within the city. Turn them into reality - a character mentions rats and you can turn his words into a devouring swarm of them.\nTraditional rules are lost. Buildings ignore gravity, ignore the constraints of space. Architecture adopts the mind-state of its inhabitants, who are in turn physically and violently changed in response. This is a world that is as horrific as often as it is absurd and inane.\nSome, but not all of the features you'll find in Tangiers are:\nShadow based stealth engine.\nSandbox environments: choose how you'll proceed through areas and the manner in which you do so, be it ghosting unseen or methodically disposing of all you come across.\nExpansive external landscapes full of side-narratives and hidden areas to discover. \nLanguage becomes reality - collect other characters' spoken word to utilize as a tool to your own ends. Use words and combine them with your standard abilities to distract, mislead or create new effects based on their meaning.\nNon-linear progression: Entirely up to you as to the order in which you approach each levels.\nReactive difficulty: The depth of challenge in areas is set based upon your overall progress.\nReactive game world: The world of Tangiers rebuilds itself as you progress, based upon what you do and where you do it.\nWindows, Mac and Linux versions.\nAt its heart, Tangiers sits on a traditional stealth engine. Keep to the shadows, keep quiet and use your abilities to manipulate a hostile environment. Levels are open ended - plan and choose your approach, infiltrate any number of routes, keep to the shadows and stay quiet.\nWhile we're keeping closely to this style of game and indeed aiming to go back to the genre's roots, we don't just want to repeat what's been done before. A lot of similarities, yes - but almost all your interactions with the world, and the world's interactions with you will be viewed through the concepts and ethos of our creative inspirations.\nWe're Andalusian, a Bristol based two-man team and friends aiming to render games that are both off-kilter and mature: games that look to a wider range of cultural influence than you'd normally find in the medium.\nThis is our debut game - while we are perhaps inexperienced, we've scrupulously designed Tangiers from the ground up to take that into account. From holding off fundraising until the core game-play was satisfactorily implemented, to designing the aesthetics and workflow to accommodate a rapid development of the world, we're confident that we're well-placed to see this through to success. But who are we?\nThere are two of us in the core team of Andalusian: Alex Harvey and Michael Wright.\nAlex is the lead of the project. He orchestrates the whole operation, managing and coordinating everything, as well as spending far too many sleepless nights scripting the game and modelling up the art assets.\nMichael is the number two of the studio. He's our workhorse; While Alex focuses on making sure everything works and looks pretty, Michael sets to grinding through the bulk work of texturing up the cities and making the coffee.\nWe're not alone on our journey though!\nCatt Stewart is our concept and character artist. Formerly from Bristol, Catt now lives in Barcelona, a few hours from the real Andalusia.\nContinuing the theme of our colleagues living in different timezones to us, Joseph Rubio is in Texas while he takes care of all audio duties.\nWe'll be putting up a \"Meet the team video\" soon to let them introduce themselves better.\nThe sound design of Tangiers is very much the cornerstone of our atmosphere, our world. \nJoseph Rubio will be producing us a textured, industrialized soundscape for the project. The audio will be exploring a range of emotions, from suffocating, tight mechanical drones to light, alienating atmospheres, the soundtrack will co-exist perfectly with the game's visuals.\nBut we're not stopping there - we're taking an approach of mood and tone to all the games sounds. Footsteps become percussion, the echoes and reverberations blend, merge with the ambiance.\nWe've been working on Tangiers both part and full time for close to 8 months now - but we've got to a position where further funding is necessary to continue development.\nDespite the sensible choice being \"don't do it\", Alex left his job to pursue his long standing dream of developing such a game. Michael put himself in a similar position, so as it stands currently, the two of us are working full time without anything approximating an income. It's all very utilitarian and DIY in the Andalusian office - the so called \"office\" is Alex's bedroom, Michael's laptop is far too old and held together by duct tape and his office chair is missing a wheel.\nTo continue work on the game full time (and to give development the attention it deserves), Andalusian needs your support.\nIf we're successful with this, the money raised will be split between allowing the two of us to work on Tangiers full time, as well as pay for the time and services of Catt, our concept/character artist, and Joseph, our musician. It'll also go towards replacing Michael's laptop with a device that is free of duct tape, on producing and delivering the Kickstarter rewards, as well as on the omnipresent shadow of taxes, software licenses and business overheads.\nGetting funded on Kickstarter would not only garner a new wheel for Michael's chair, but it gives us the capability to see the game through to completion, to finish a project that is a bit too niche and off-beat to fund through most other avenues.\nWorking with you, we can produce a daring, original game - one that wouldn't be possible otherwise.\n\u00a335,000 is the minimum amount of funding that we can get away with. Our fingers are firmly crossed about getting more - from our angle, more money means the chance of a better working environment than Alex's bedroom, a third full time developer and more resources to spend on external art and music. For you, that all means a deeper, richer Tangiers.\nNext to making everything better, let's look at what else is possible:\n\u00a340,000 - Commentary\nIf we hit this mark, we'll be able to put a commentary into the game. It'll be an optional toggle - in the Valve style of activated talking points dotted around the game.\nTangiers is a sometimes esoteric, sometimes enigmatic project. While we won't be spoiling or explaining any of the narrative, with the commentary we'll discuss the thought process behind a lot of ideas and the nature of how our influences directed certain parts of the world and design.\n\u00a345,000 - Extra Difficulty\nHere we add a \"hardcore\" difficulty mode. Not for everyone, but for players that want their life to be a bit more difficult. Hardcore difficulty will not only restrict the camera (still third person, but you'll lose the extra awareness), but your enemies will have heightened awareness and a greater aptitude for searching you out. This mode will force you to constantly think tactically and make best use of everything you come across.\n\u00a352,000 - Reality Tears\nAt this level, we incorporate reality tears into the cut-up and collapse of the world. Dorways and fractures into pockets of alternate existences. Similar to the portals in Prey (or Portal!), you step through them into alternative fragments of the world. Built up from memories of already visited places, they act as bridges across the map, areas to fall back on or - if you can find a way to close them, a place to lure and trap other characters.\n\n\u00a358,000 - Reactive Music\nThe music takes on the properties of the cut-up - reflections and echoes of visited locations find their way into the audio as do you current actions and some more targeted influences of the current environment. Using the audio compositions as a base, we'll pull and push it in directions unique and driven to every playthrough.\n\u00a364,000 - Enhanced Character Dynamics\nWe can build upon the AI in the game. Two factions will be apparent within the characters, and there will be a strong tension between the two.\nAs you spread disinformation and paranoia amongst the inhabitants of Tangiers, these tensions will flare up - push things even further and you may even manage to have the world's characters deal with your targets for you.\nEventually in the late stages of the game, events will lead to conflict. As you hide in the shadows, pitched brawls and combat will emerge around you. You're faced with the further challenge of an unpredictable environment, of waves of hostility flaring up and dying down. The ambiance of Tangiers will of course be maintained during this - but it opens up a whole new creative avenue for exploring the game's parameters.\nAll listed in the side bar, check 'em out!\nWe're approaching our Beta access slightly differently to normal though. We've got a strong, single player focus on Tangiers, and the game is something that we really want you to experience as a whole. To find balance and to be able to provide a satisfying early access offering, our beta will come in the form of a prequel to Tangiers' main narrative.\nThe beta will be approximately a fifth of the size of the main game - equivalent to one of the city-shards and its surrounding landscape. It's the perfect opportunity to showcase and give an early look at all our mechanics and narrative techniques without spoiling all the surprises we have planned in the full game.\nWe should probably also show the Tangiers shirt - it should look something like this:\nFeel free to give us feedback on this - we'll be refining the design so shout us out :)\nAdd-ons\n\u00a37 - Second Copy of Tangiers\nDo you have a friend that might be interested in the project, or perhaps know someone whose unsure as to whether it's their sort of thing? An extra download of the game, discounted to the early-bird rate as a thank you for the extra support! Limited to one extra per backer.\n\u00a310 - Early Poster +\u00a32 for international shipping\nSome backers might not want to wait for all your rewards to come through, so we'll be getting this poster printed and sent out as soon as the money comes in! As a memento of your support, they'll be signed and have a thank you message written to you.\nA3 Glossy posters. To keep the cost reasonable, we'll be (gently) folding them in half and keeping them safe between two sheets of rigid card. If you would like to have them sent out rolled in a tube, it's a bit pricey but add \u00a34.00 on top.\nThe design will be based on this image, though I'll be reworking and polishing the textures, lighting and composition on it (that skies looking a bit too plain...).\n\u00a320 - Postcards from Tangiers +2 for international shipping\nA pack of ten, high quality glossy postcards of various landscapes around the world. \n\u00a325 - Digital Only Credits Mention\nWe've had a few bits of feedback asking about a credits mention without the physical rewards. Fairly self explanatory - this is the end credits mention found in the \u00a380 tier.\nwww.TangiersGame.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo - we've not shipped a game before. But we are well aware of the massive effort involved in building a complete game, just as we've played Boiling Point enough times to see what happens when games get too ambitious. \n\nTangiers has been designed from the ground up with our experience and limitations in mind. From the workflow surrounding level design and testing to the low-fidelity art-style, we're positive that completing Tangiers is well within our reach. \nWe've been holding back from fundraising until we got to a point where the biggest hurdles are passed. The areas that we considered the highest risk are now robustly implemented - the stealth engine and the AI. Our work now is expanding these platforms and building the game world. \n\nThere is of course the risk that we overrun against schedule. With the exception of overheads and collaborators that we'll be paying at the start of the project, all of the work is being done by the two of us at Andalusian - if we do overrun, we'll simply tighten our belts and carry on working. The chance of Tangiers being cancelled for whatever reason is negligible.\n\nWe've put a lot of effort into planning ahead with Tangiers to make sure everything is set to a realistic scope and schedule, and hope that you'll be happy trusting us to deliver.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "2021-May: Design Talk #1; Tangiers\u2019 Soul", "update_content": "It has been a long time since we began development on Tangiers.

The film takes a personal and holistic look at this international creative community who are disrupting the traditional video games industry.\nGameLoading is about game developers, specifically indie game developers. Without them the games we love would not exist. Our film explores the lives of developers around the globe and we strongly feel this is a story that needs to be told in detail. We want to demystify their craft and how they are working on the cutting edge of entertainment. We want to show their infectious passion for making games. Right now there is a global renaissance in indie game development and GameLoading aims to capture this moment time.\nVideo gaming is still a young medium, ready to explode in ways we are yet to imagine. The democratisation of game development has enabled independent developers to express themselves like never before. \nLike DIY musicians and film-makers, indie game developers are working without the big budgets and huge teams of mainstream studios, giving life to their own visions, on their own terms.  In the process they are pushing the limits, challenging the status quo of what games are and bringing a new language to the medium. \nGameLoading aims to take a snapshot of the worldwide indie game subculture, by following the pioneers of indie development to see how they are changing the industry and even our views on what video games can be. \nWe will get a personal glimpse of the endless hard work, risks faced and sacrifices indie developers make to bring their creations into the world.  What drives them?  What does it mean to succeed?  Will they make it?\nWe are gamers ourselves, excited by the creativity and innovation of the indie gaming subculture. We want to make our film personal and holistic; indie developers at all stages of the process telling their own stories, in their own words.\nWe have been working, planning and researching for a year and have shot over a dozen interviews with developers from different parts of the globe at different stages in their careers.  We are closely following a handful of development teams in Australia.\nRight now we are now ready to travel to film the next round of interviews we have lined up. Firstly to the USA for PAXPrime and IndieCade, and then to Europe to do interviews in Stockholm, Belgium, France, Italy and Romania.\nAfter Europe we will explore the burgeoning indie game scene in Japan. Finally we will come home to Australia and continue filming the teams we have been following for the last year.\nSo far we have spent our own money on the film and now we are reaching out to you to help us with the next phase of filming.\nLike the developers we are following, we are also totally independent and running off our own passion and commitment in getting inspiring people to tell their stories.\nWe have done a huge amount of work already but we can\u2019t do it all alone! So we are asking for support to help us get to the finish. If you share our passion for the world of indie games and filmmaking, please pledge towards the project and help make it happen. If you are a game developer at any level and you want to see the culture of game development nurture and grow then please show your support.\nWe are excited to have a bunch of great games included in the rewards. This selection will grow throughout the campaign. \nHere is a trailer of all the current games:\nFree Games Bundle\nOPENCLONK - Beautifully nuanced side-scrolling adventurer and builder. Full of antiquity, rich landscapes and flowing weather patterns. \n\nQBEH - A gorgeous first-person puzzler with a lovely minimalist aesthetic - this one's incredibly addictive.\n\nA.R.C.S. - Super retro tower defense game with a modern polish. Big guns. Big bombs. Big old-school arcade destruction!\n\nZombie Grinder - Bust some block-headed zombie brains to the sounds of an awesome analogue soundtrack. Very cool and cute pixel-art multiplayer zombie survival with heaps of fun mods. \nPremium Games Bundle\nLivalink - Solid, wave-defense FPS with tons of atmosphere and a more than few nods to the pioneers of the genre. The deadly Progeny are eerie and terrifying!\n\nSpyleaks - Sophisticated, brain bending puzzle game. Fully retro-fit spy saga that swings effortlessly between beat-the-clock covert conundrums and trenchcoat shootouts. \n\nUbinota - A wistful, cloud-born wonder. These French auteurs' deceptively simple tale of a colourful painter thinly veils a deeper tragedy of complex gravity. \n\nUnderrail - Gritty post-apocalyptic isometric RPG that feels like an obscure forgotten gem from the shadowed shelves of a 90's wargaming store. It's dark, complex and awesome.  \n\nRecruits - Gung-ho top-down shooter with a full swag of firepower and explosives. Bred from hardened Cannon Fodder stock, the environments are beautifully natural and the gameplay kicks some serious ass.\nThese stretch goals will help make the best film we can. We have been relying on friends donating their film gear but we would love to start paying people and using our own equipment. \nWe have been borrowing sound equipment and lenses from friends throughout the production. We would love to buy our own equipment for the shoot - sound gear, lenses, a camera bag, tripod and a light panel. \nSo far we have been shooting the film mostly on our own.

Getting a global snapshot of the indie developer scene involves a lot of travel, coordinating and scheduling. Getting this global perspective is one of the points of the film but also one of the biggest challenges.\n\nA lot can happen during production but our experienced team working behind the scenes at home and on location are well equipped for whatever is thrown at them. Previous shoots in the wilds of Sri Lanka, the craziness of Tokyo, the outback of Australia and the streets of San Francisco have given us the experience to deal with unexpected surprises during filming. \n\nShooting the film is one thing but finishing the film to the standard we are striving for is another beast altogether. Luckily we are editors with years of experience on documentaries, TVCs, large corporate videos, music video clips, feature films and TV shows. Editing is in our blood and completing a dynamic 90-minute film is well within our skill set.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "International Rewards Now Shipping", "update_content": "Hi Backers,\nGreat news!

You control a team of four agents, each with distinct and unique abilities, collectively battling for control of a fully simulated, living cyberpunk city.\nThe game world is designed to facilitate emergent gameplay, giving you the tools and freedom to play how you want to play, so you can create strategies and scenarios that not even we had anticipated!\nCustomise your team with the strength to destroy your enemies head-on, or hack into their facilities to manipulate their infrastructure without them ever knowing you were even there.\nWill you take down your enemies with brute-force? Covert espionage and infiltration? Or will you use propaganda to influence the citizens of the city and overthrow the controlling powers?\nSatellite Reign will be released on Windows, Mac OS and Linux.\nThe world's governments are controlled by mega-corporations, democracy to the highest bidder. Society is structured for the benefit of those in power. The poor exist in the dark squalid underbelly of the city, while the wealthy swim in opulence and luxury on the upper tiers, and the vast middle-class are too comfortable with their lives of convenience to see the world for what it really is. Corporate police patrol the streets, brutally maintaining the status quo, all under the guise of keeping the people safe.\nThe time for change is now, as a mysterious organisation rises from the slums of the city. They'll have to bribe, steal, hack and augment their way through the barriers between them and their ultimate goal...but what are they trying to achieve?  To free the masses from the corporate stranglehold, or to take control for themselves?  That, is up to you.\nThis is one big, open, living metropolis. The city isn't just a cool location (although it is pretty cool), it actually functions like a city; the streets are bustling with people by day, and controlled by criminal organisations by night. Power grids actually power the city, information and finances flow from one district to another, and you can use all of these things to your advantage.\nThe entire game-world is designed around emergent gameplay. Civilians, police and corporate soldiers will all react uniquely to your actions. Power conduits, communication networks and security systems are there for you to hijack, modify or destroy. Learn how the city and its inhabitants operate, then exploit them all to advance your agenda.\nThe city is huge and you can move around and tackle objectives however you want to. You won't be spoon-fed one mission after another, you'll be able to use whatever means you can to get to your final goal. Bribe scientists to advance your technologies, and kidnap doctors to augment your agents. Steal money from the banks to fund your war against the corporations, and exploit neural implants to bend the will of others. Or, try to take your objectives through good old-fashioned brute-force.\nDistinct character classes give you total control over how you approach a situation. Different classes with different combinations of augmentations, gear and weapons gives you the ability to customise your team and your experience.\nNot every problem is easily solved by shoving a gun in its face. Sometimes the situation requires a bit more subtlety, a bit more finesse. Try siphoning cash out of the corporate account, bribing a bank manager to \u201cmisplace\u201d his security pass, or steal the identity of a corporate soldier to pass through security checkpoints unseen.\nFrom our previous experience with the Unity Engine, we could look no further. Its flexibility, ease of use, and quick turnaround on development means less barriers between the creators and the creation.\nIts robust scripting system and one click approach to deployment allows us to simultaneously develop releases for Windows, Linux and Mac.\nFrom Left to Right: Dean Ferguson, Chris Conte, Mitchell Clifford, Brent Waller and Mike Diskett.\n5 Lives Studios is an independent developer. Our core team consists of five dedicated industry professionals with many years of experience. Not only are we all industry veterans, but we also have a long history of working together, allowing us to make games like a well-oiled machine. Some of us have worked together for nearly a decade! Collectively, we have worked on a wide range of genres and notable titles including the Syndicate series, GTA IV, Darksiders II, Star Wars, L.A. Noire, and many more.\nKickstarter is continually proving itself to be a utopia for creativity. It gives developers like us the chance to get back to our roots, so we can make the games we want to play. We\u2019re free to explore and implement ideas without publishers demanding that we reshape our vision for broad, generic appeal.\nAnd most importantly, it gives you the opportunity to have your say. You get the chance to bring back the types of games you loved. Not only that, but you're also in the unique position to give input on the actual development. This new age of developers and gamers being able to work together paints an exciting, bright future for the industry we all love. \nWe will be thrilled to meet our initial funding goal. Doing so will allow us to achieve our core vision for Satellite Reign, but should we be fortunate enough to exceed our target, every bit extra will go into expanding the experience even further. We've got loads of great ideas on how we can expand Satellite Reign, which we'll reveal as the campaign continues. \nOur first stretch goal will allow us to bring on Russell Shaw, the composer from the original Syndicate series. He'll bring a truly authentic soundscape to the world of Satellite Reign.\nNote: Currency Conversion Rates are an estimate based on exchange rates in June 2013. Final conversion rate may vary.\nBackers who pledge for the \"Transistor\" tier or higher will receive an exclusive Kickstarter-only Satellite Reign t-shirt!\nT-Shirt designs are not yet final, so feel free to tell us what you think!\n\"Bob\" Miniature Figurine available in the \"Bobbylicious\" tier and above.\n\"CTO\" backers who claim the right to design and name a weapon in the game will work closely with 5 Lives Studios to ensure proper balancing of the weapon within the overall structure of the game. The final results are subject to the approval of 5 Lives Studios. All rewards that entitle the backer to naming an in-game character or item are subject to review and approval by 5 Lives Studios.\n\"Hammerhead\" Oil painting by Duncan Mattocks\nThanks for supporting us! And in turn we pledge to support other Kickstarters through http://kickingitforward.org/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n5 Lives Studios is a small team and our ambitions are high, but we have extensive experience delivering quality games with limited resources and in short time frames.\n\nOur design is truly scalable. Our initial goal will allow us to produce a game which retains the core gameplay and design concepts without sacrificing the depth of the simulated city.\n\nThe structure of the simulation systems and design means minimal bespoke code and scripting of events. The simulation systems are fully modular and independently operating, while at the same time interlinking to build a complex and believable world. This allows us to build new systems and simulations which can easily slot into the core systems at any time without breaking the overall structure of the game and code.\n\nWe carry the same modularity across to our art pipeline. The environments are built with modular building blocks, which gives us the flexibility to iterate quickly, and allows for a large range of variety in the game world.\n\nTogether, based on our experience as individuals and as a team, we're confident that we will achieve our goals for Satellite Reign. Our initial funding goal will allow us to deliver a rewarding and engrossing gameplay experience which can be expanded in both depth and size if we are fortunate enough to exceed our immediate funding goal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "Unity Awards and Mod Support!", "update_content": "Greetings Agents!

You don\u2019t ever need to worry about what platform it\u2019s on!\nBut even in that world, we've developed a reputation for being a bit different at Days of Wonder:\nwe focus on developing board games with the coolest components, best theme and gameplay, not on producing the cheapest games possible;\nwe develop digital versions of our games ourselves, in-house, rather than licensing them to third-parties;\nand we never, ever, discuss new products and future plans ahead of their actual release.\nBut this time, we'd like to Play Different!\nThe Project: Small World 2\nA year after the launch of Small World - the Board Game, on the first day the original iPad became available, we launched Small World for iPad, pioneering a whole new world of board games on Tablets! \nThe game earned critical acclaim and hordes of devoted players, but soon took a backseat to our own Ticket to Ride - the train game that pays the bills at Days of Wonder.\nThe game didn\u2019t die though. While fans kept playing the original iPad version, deep in a corner of our Paris office, a dedicated team started creating the next generation of Small World.\nDevelopment of Small World 2 is now well underway...\n... and it will ship later this year, no matter what!\nSmall World is about to get A WHOLE LOT BIGGER, in Small World 2. \nComing soon to a screen near you?\nFor the first time, the game will accommodate not just 2, but 3, 4 and 5 players, each players configuration with its own map, just like the board game!\nSmall World ain't so small anymore - just a bit crowded (here, with 5 players!).\nMore players also means more ways to play: Beyond its original Solo and 2 players Face-to-face mode, Small World 2 will now also support Pass'N Play, Local Play and a true Turn-by-Turn asynchronous online mode that lets you play with friends across different platforms and multiple time zones, while remaining fast enough to support real-time play.\nPlay alone or with friends, on one device or multiple ones, even on different platforms!\nThere will also be more Races and Special Powers than ever competing for world domination in Small World 2, now. In addition to the original Cursed! and Grand Dames expansions, Be Not Afraid will be available as an In-App Purchase. \nAnd if this campaign gets funded, all backers at the Tritons level and higher will automatically unlock and receive The Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack, a set of 3 new Races and 3 new Special Powers that Philippe Keyaerts has developed specially for this release.\n\"Be Not Afraid...\" - Famous last words of a Small World Pigmy about to roll a die\nEven better, all these expansions will be playable under a generous \"boardgame-like\" policy, where as long as the person who initiates a game owns an expansion, all players in that game get a chance to play with it; no risk of waiting for opponents with the same set of expansions you own!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe're committed to releasing Small World 2 on iPad no matter what; but we've also heard those of you clamoring for a port onto Android and Steam. \nFor a small company like us, especially one doing all its development in-house, creating versions for these platforms is a non-trivial project, and one that will divert significant resources away from our Ticket to Ride mainstay. \nIn our forums, on Facebook and on Twitter, enough of you have told us you\u2019d like to spend some hard-earned cash on Android and Steam apps to make it worth our while. Now is your chance to prove it. \nAnd to sweeten the pot, we've come up with some very cool swag to help you decide to pledge!\nThe Rewards\nThe Online game and Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack\nPhilippe Keyaerts has designed 3 new races and 3 new special powers specially for Small World players who choose to back us with their pledges during this campaign. These new races and special powers will be unlocked through a special achievement linked to each backers (at the Tritons level and higher) player account, when Small Word 2 for Android and Steam ships.\nPledge at the Skeletons level if you want the bonus races & powers along with a copy of the game on the platform of your choice.\nIf you already own Small World iPad, and are interested in getting a copy of the game on another platform, no problem - Go ahead and pledge for this new platform, and your Bonus pack will automatically appear and be playable on all platforms you own Small World 2 on!\nIf you already own Small World iPad, but don't care about the Android or Steam versions, pledge at the Tritons level instead:\nPhysical board game rewards for higher pledges\nIf you're a committed player of the board game, you might also be tempted by the rewards for some of our higher pledges, such as...\nThe 6 Player cardboard Map of Small World that Philippe is designing for this campaign.\nFeaturing Small World on one side, Small World Underground on the other, this reward will ship with all the additional tokens (mountains, lost tribes, monsters, etc.) required to play with 6 players around the table.\nIf you already own Small World on the iPad, and don't care about any of our other digital versions, but choose to pledge at the Goblins level to get this map, you will be given a chance to donate the digital copy of the game you receive as part of your pledge to a friend, while still choosing to keep the Kickstarter Backers digital Bonus Pack for yourself!\nFinally, if you don't care at all about any digital versions, but still lust for this map, we hope to offer some for sale on our web site, at a later date and slightly higher retail price.\nWe're also busy designing The Small World Pocket Encyclopedia, a 110x140mm hard cover notebook filled with 84+ full-color pages of concept art, illustrations, strategic advice and trivia surrounding the denizens of Small World.\nTo receive the Encyclopedia, simply up your pledge to the Orcs level.\nThe same comments as for the Goblins pledge apply, if you're interested in the Encyclopedia but don't care about digital versions of the games (or already own the iPad version, and have no friends to donate a digital copy to ;-)).\nAnd last but not least, for the most committed, crazy, extravagant or dedicated of you, we are offering a very limited number of opportunities for you to design your very own Small World race or mini-expansion! \nWe will professionally illustrate this expansion, lay it out, print it, and who knows? - maybe even publish it or code it into the game, if we really like it!\nSome all important Add-ons...\nBut it wouldn't quite be Small World if we'd stopped there, right? It's a Board game after all, so we thought we should have some things for those of you who still live in the digital dark ages and couldn't care less about tablets, phones and other strange electrical contraptions.\nSo we've come up with some very special add-ons; physical rewards that you can receive by simply adding the corresponding $ amount to the pledge of your choice. \nFor instance, if you wish to get yourself our sure-to-be-cool 'I Backed a Troll' T-shirt, simply add $ 21 to the pledge of your choice. We will ask your choice of T-shirt size (S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL) once the campaign ends.\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 14 in shipping fees to your pledge (i.e. $ 35 in total), to receive this t-shirt.\nIf you only care for some of our add-ons but none of the digital stuff, just pledge at the $1 Kobolds level:\n... and add the $ amount of the physical rewards you want to receive to your pledge. \nFor instance, $ 10 ($1 Kobolds pledge + $9 for the Royal Bonus) will get you a cardboard version of the 3 new races and 3 new special powers Philippe designed for this campaign, along with all the race tokens and markers needed to play them in Small World the board game.\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 5 in shipping fees to your pledge (i.e. $ 14 in total), to receive the cardboard races.\n...and a very special Designer Edition!\nFor those of you who wish to go even further, we've come up with a very special add-on: The Designer's Oath version of Small World's upcoming deluxe Designer Edition. \nThe Designer Edition - A truly deluxe version of Small World the Board game\nSmall World's Designer Edition is a spare-no-expense version of Small World the board game that will ship in 2014; this version of the game is true to Philippe Keyaerts' original wooden prototype.\nPhilippe's original prototype of Small World featured delightful wood tokens; we've finally managed to reproduce them for this very special Designer Edition!\nThe Designer Edition will feature: \n307 deluxe wooden tokens covering all races from the base game and its Cursed!, Grand Dames and Be Not Afraid expansions + the Lost Tribes\neach race will comes in its own individual, lavishly illustrated box\nthe banners, special powers and markers that complement the deluxe tokens will all be heat-printed on wood, matching the tokens neatly\nthe victory coins will all be distinctive metal coins specially forged for Small World\nthe maps will be super-sized copies of Small World's 2-5 player maps, and include a new 6 player map specially designed by Philippe Keyaerts for this campaign\nThe Dragon, the Catapult, the 2 Heroes will all be represented by custom resin miniatures\nWe are still in the early design stages of the Designer Edition; Back us now and we'll work hard to make your own copy even nicer...\nLiving outside the USA? Add + $ 50 in shipping fees to your pledge.\nBy adding $ 320 to your pledge now, you'll receive a Kickstarter exclusive version of our Designer Edition, that will include:\nA deluxe wooden version of the 3 new Races & Special Powers in the Kickstarter Backers Bonus Pack\nA signed plaque - numbered and engraved in your name\nShipment 3 months ahead of the actual retail release\nAn $ 80 discount off the $ 400 retail price of the Designer Edition\n\nInternational customers please add $ 50 to your pledge, to cover for our additional shipping fees; If you live outside the US, you must be prepared to take responsibility for custom or import fees, as well as taxes (including VAT) your home country may impose when we ship you your Designer Edition. International copies will ship through the US Postal Service - Priority Mail International.\nWe are investigating the possibility of shipping Designer's Oath versions to European customers from our European warehouse.

Our primary objectives are to tell a story even more compelling than Ultimas IV-VII, create a virtual world more interactive than Ultima VII, develop deep rich multi-player capabilities beyond combat akin to Ultima Online, and offer a bold new approach to integrate them with \u201cSelective Multi-Player\u201d.\nShroud of the Avatar is infused with rich storylines, deeply integrated into game play, developed by Best Selling Author Tracy Hickman and RPG legend Richard Garriott.\nPlayers will adventure in an interactive world where their choices have consequences, ethical paradoxes give them pause, and they play a vital part in weaving their own story into the immersive world and lore surrounding them.\nShroud of the Avatar is a Selective Multiplayer game, allowing players to choose how they want to play! Whether in Single-Player Offline mode or any of three online modes, the main quest line will provide greater than 40 hours of focused, story driven content.\nShroud of the Avatar can be played as an offline DRM free solo experience or online, where our servers will enable player to player transactions, group finding, patching, streaming of dynamic content, and exploit prevention.\nBuilt using the Unity Game Engine, Shroud of the Avatar will support Win/Mac/Linux for official launch.\nPlayers can specialize in a wide range of combat and non-combat skills, provided by a robust, classless skill system, and full-featured crafting and housing mechanics.

We are constantly adding new bonus rewards to our existing pledges, so please review this section regularly for any changes!\nSpecial thanks to Vamp at http://forsakenvirtues.com/ for putting this awesome chart together for us!\nPLEASE NOTE: Pledge rewards contain ALL of the rewards of lower level pledges (with the exception of houses, which are 1 per pledge)!\nRichard Garriott guided the Ultima Series from its inception in 1980, through the \"trilogy-of-trilogies\" of solo player games and later, the highly successful Ultima Online. Under his leadership, RPG's evolved from simple dungeon crawls to immersive worlds where you could easily suspend your disbelief. You cared about the world and its people, and you cared about the actions and deeds you accomplished within that world.\nSince then, most every other RPG has focused more on level grinding than on \u201crole playing\u201d, which has been reduced to a few initial character choices. While advancements in graphics and sound have been phenomenal, in many ways the virtual worlds we play in have become less real. Less open. Less immersive.\nWith Shroud of the Avatar, Richard and his team will again reinvent the classic fantasy role-playing experience. Using state-of-the-art tools and technology, the game will focus on what made his seminal Ultima Series great. Once players are introduced to the game, they will discover their own story woven into the immersive world and lore surrounding them. Players may choose to follow the life of the adventurer or, if they prefer, focus on exploration and discovery. Players may even choose the life of a homesteader; either nestled within the safety of the settled lands, or on the dangerous but potentially lucrative frontier. The world is full of opportunities and challenges!\nThe familiar psychological profiling used to create your character, organically derived game-play responses to player behavior and fundamental virtues and consequence of actions will all play a huge role in Shroud of the Avatar. Players will be free to choose their path, but must then live with the consequences of their actions.\nShroud of the Avatar general features:\nFrom Lord British's Treatise on \"What is an Ultimate RPG?\":\nFully interactive virtual world - If it looks usable, it should do something\nDeep original fiction - Ethical parables, cultural histories, fully developed alternate language text\nPhysical game components will be available: Cloth map, fictional manuals, trinkets\nMultiplayer Online Game - which can also be played solo player / offline\nClassless character system:\nUnlike most RPGs, players will not be limited to the class they select at the beginning of the game.  We will be discussing this feature in more detail during an upcoming Developer Blog.\nPlayer housing:\nPlayer housing will live in the persistent shared world, so real estate will have location value. \nThe least expensive housing can be found in Villages, which offer the highest density of low-cost housing.  The core of a village will include basic services that will encourage players to both visit and settle in the area.  Villages are a great place for an ambitious adventurer to hang their hat. (Only a few thousand Village homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nTowns on the other hand, offer more protection and amenities than Villages. The larger amount of available services will further increase traffic flow to your home or business. Plots of land will be larger as well, allowing players to build bigger houses. Towns are an excellent place to start a business while affording moderate levels of safety. (Only a few hundred Town homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nA City provides substantial protection for players, with large, vital services to draw players to visit and spend their coin. Cities can be protected by large defensive structures like Tesla towers, and offer luxuries not found in Towns or Villages. Cities also have the largest and most valuable homesteads. Be aware though, that the most valuable properties are available to very limited number of players and will likely be in high demand! (Only a few dozen City homes will be available to players in-game.)  \nOnce a house is purchased, players will need to pay regular taxes on it of course. But as a special thank you to select Kickstarter supporters, all housing obtained by making a Kickstarter pledge of Citizen, Lord, Baron, Duke or Lord of the Manor will be tax free for life!  \nCrafting system that avoids busy work:\nCraft as a hobby or as a career! The results of all crafting elements have value as consumables and components in the combat system, as well as maintenance and upgrade elements for housing and cities. The crafting system will be a topic of discussion in one of our upcoming Developer Blogs.\nMeaningful PVP that also minimizes griefing:\nAn incentive-driven system will draw players into the challenge and intrigue of the PVP experience, whether they become the hunter or the hunted!\nScene based encounters:\nIn a nod to Garriott's early RPG works, Shroud of the Avatar is split up into a high-level overland map and adventure scenes. Scenes are generally re-playable and can be experienced solo or with others.\nVersions:\nShroud of the Avatar is currently planned for downloadable PC, Mac, and Linux.\nTo help Richard build his new masterpiece, a team of proven industry veterans has been assembled. The average team member has more than 10 years experience and a half-dozen shipped games to their credit. More than 50 titles have been shipped between the team, including almost a dozen games that reached number one on the sales charts.\nWe're not the only ones who are excited about Shroud of the Avatar!  \n\"As an Ultima fanatic, I'm kind of jittery excited about what's happening here.\" ~ Felicia Day, actress, writer, and producer of the web series The Guild\n\"Richard was an inspiration for our guild and has been a friend and supporter of ours for years, and us of him. We will definitely have a SotA presence.\" ~ Sean, aka Dragon, Guild Leader for The Syndicate\n\"So I'm hoping you will join with me in taking Richard up on this offer. That we should back him in SotA in creating and pioneering a new way of experiencing story in game.

I can not WAIT to play it!\" ~ Ernest Cline, author of New York Times Bestseller, Ready Player One\n\u201cRichard and I have known each other 26 years when I first joined up with a small little company called Origin Systems. We had a lot fun being the small rebel upstart company and made some games that are still remembered for defining or creating genres even today.  It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen Richard this energized about the world and game he is creating. Shroud of The Avatar, feels like the kind of game we would have made in the old days of Origin when we didn\u2019t answer to anyone and just made the best game we could with no interference. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about Crowd funding. I\u2019m backing and looking forward to being part of Lord British\u2019s next great adventure\u201d  ~ Chris Roberts, creator of the best-selling Wing Commander game series\n\"When I read that Lord British was going back to his roots to make \"The Shroud of the Avatar\" and kickstart it with the community, I was really excited and you should be too! SotA looks like it's going to be an incredible game!  ~ Min-Liang Tan, Chief Gamer and CEO of Razer/Edge\n\"I know how much Richard Garriott respects story, and that will set this game apart from the others. I know Shroud of the Avatar is going to tell a great story! \"I guarantee I will play. Try and stop me!\" ~ Warren Spector, renowned game developer and force behind the critically acclaimed and award winning games Ultima Underworld, System Shock, Thief, and Deus Ex.  \nAnd from our Friends at Ultima Codex!\nBe sure to pledge your support today and join our Champions in making Shroud of the Avatar a success!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEntertainment software development is always difficult. A successful game must work well feature-by-feature and be compelling and fun at all times to sustain player interest. \"Fun\" is very hard to define on paper, and is further complicated when tasked with integrating complex features that the players will find fulfilling. This iterative experimental process creates inherent risks in game development.\n\nWe are managing this risk with a number of careful processes. First our team is built around a core of industry experts, who individually have up to 30 years of game development experience. Additionally, we are using powerful, proven tools to mitigate development risks. Finally, we are staging development so that the most important and most risky features are developed first, while carefully containing the scope of the initial release so that feature bloat does not bury the project.\n\nWhile game development remains inherently risky, this team is qualified and dedicated to drive this project to successful conclusion with skill and passion.

The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

The game is inspired by a few of my favorite games; The Bard\u2019s Tale, SSI Gold Box series games, Baldur\u2019s Gate, and Neverwinter Nights (1 and 2). The intent is to create a game engine that results in a virtual table top, Pen and Paper type feel in a single player computer game. The game engine will be free once completed, but the toolset will initially only be available to backers of this Kickstarter project. The toolset will allow anyone to create their own adventures to share with the rest of us. Please help us complete this wonderful project. We really appreciate any support you have to offer. Thanks again!\nFeatures\nMap travel: The game engine uses a grid-based system for movement and distance determination. From these maps you can transition to other maps, start conversations with other NPCs, encounter enemies, discover hidden locations, etc.\nConversations and Narration: The conversation system is designed to create an engaging story where the player's actions actually make a difference. To accomplish this, we are creating a conversation system (similar to that from Neverwinter Nights) that allows the player multiple dialog choices and the NPCs will react according to your actions and choices.\nTurn Based Combat System: Encounters take place on a grid-based map in a separate window. Combat is turn-based and functions similar to the way it was with the SSI Gold Box games. Each player and enemy takes a turn to move, attack, cast spells, launch arrows, or run away screaming.\nEncounter Scaling: NO SCALING of encounters or quests\u2026 don't try and take out the local dragon threat at level one... bad, bad decision.\nRaces, Classes, Skills: The races are the basic ones. You can play a human, elf, or dwarf. The classes available will be a fighter, rogue, priest and mage (we would like to add more through stretch goals). Most classes will have class only specific skills so building a party is not a trivial activity.\nInventory: Inventory is handled at the party level similar to the way it was done in games like Dragon Age Origins. We feel that this is a convenient and quick way to deal with equipping and using items.\nToolset: A toolset will be included with the game that will allow you to create your own stories to share with others. The toolset is designed to help you easily create and edit areas, conversations, narrations, encounters, containers, items, creatures, etc.\nStretch Goal #1 ($1,000)\nAdd four more classes (eight total)\nAdd two more races (total of five now)\nStretch Goal #2 ($2,000)\nAllow for the creation of custom classes, races, skills/talents, spells, etc. This will require a significant change to the code to make them data driven.\nAdd editors to the toolset for creating custom classes, races, skills, spells, etc.\nStretch Goal #3 ($2,500)\nCreate a quest/plot wizard for the toolset that will allow for quick and easy creation of basic quests.\n  Stretch Goal #4 ($3,000)\nCreate a script generator for the toolset that will allow for quick and easy creation of custom scripts that are not already available in the stock scripts that come with the toolset.\n  Stretch Goal #5 ($3,500)\nWe will create a custom AI wizard. This wizard will allow for quick and easy creation of custom AI scripts for NPCs and Creatures without needing to know how to code or create your own scripts from scratch.\nAllow for plugin use with the IceBlink Toolset. You can create your own plugins that become part of the toolset's functionality to allow for custom editors, wizards, new features, automation functions, etc.\n  The IceBlink Engine is a simple 2D, grid-based and turn-based engine. The intent is to create a game engine that results in a virtual table top, Pen and Paper (PnP) type feel in a single player computer game.\nThe game engine is designed to be flexible and customizable in many ways. For example, you can change the portraits of your character and companions and their map token/icon at any time. The portrait sizes used are the same as those used in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights. The conversation system is the most important feature of the game engine. It is designed to allow players to interact with the world in a meaningful way. There is a narration system as well which helps describe events and areas similar to the way a DM or GM would. Combat takes place on a grid map and is turn-based. The encounter system allows for strategic and fun combat to take place. It functions similar to the way the SSI Gold Box games did.\nWe are big fans of games that allow us the ability to create our own adventures such as Forgotten Realms Unlimited Adventures, NWN 1 and 2, and Dragon Age Origins. We wanted to give people the same opportunity, but with a much simpler system that does not require such a high learning curve or take years to produce a final product. The goal is to give writers the ability to easily, quickly and effectively tell their story. Is this better than those other games? Of course not, it is just different in many ways. So what does the toolset do? See the list below:\nMap Creation: Currently, game maps are 800x800 pixel images so they can be anything from hand drawn maps to elaborate 3D modeled scenes rendered out to 2D. You could even use any of the many free tilemap makers out there if you so choose. For the demo adventure module, we will be creating all the maps in GIMP with a top down view approach.\nLevel Editor: Import maps that you created and easily place encounters, NPCs with conversations, define walkable and non-walkable squares, area transitions, containers, traps, OnEnter scripts, etc.\nConversation Editor: The conversation editor is the heart and soul of the game. Conversations are created one dialog node at a time. Each NPC dialog line can have multiple responses for the player to choose from. Each node can be assigned multiple conditionals and actions such as checking for variables, items, class, race, giving XP, gold, or firing off a custom script.\nEncounter Editor: Encounters are very easy to set up. Just drag and drop a creature from the creatures list onto the encounter map. Also, you can define the loot drops for each encounter.\nCreature Editor: Creature editing is done through the use of a property grid form which is very simple to use. You can use the creatures that we made and/or create your own. All creatures are shown in a tree view type layout for easy organization by creature categories (which you can define).\nItem Editor: The item editor functions identically to that of the creature editor.\nScripting: the scripting language used for the engine is C#, the same that was used to create the game. This is a very powerful feature. Scripting is being designed so that it can be easy for beginners to use, but still very powerful for the experienced coder.\nSystem Requirements\nThe game is being developed using C# and Microsoft\u2019s .NET Framework 3.5. What does this mean? This means that it will run on any Windows 7 machine. It will also run on any Windows XP machine if you have installed or download and install the 3.5 .NET framework from Microsoft's website.\nBree Arts currently is a husband and wife team of Jeremy (slowdive_fan) and Tamara. Tamara is the lead artist for the project creating all the original artwork that will be part of the demo adventure module. Jeremy is the lead programmer and writer. I\u2019m also known as slowdive_fan (on various internet sites); I am a Hall of Fame author and a Mod of the Month winner on the IGN NWN Vault and The Neverwinter Nexus respectively. I am the creator of the Chronicles of Charnia series of modules and campaigns in both Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2 that offer over twenty plus hours of game play. I have hundreds of hours of experience working in both NWN toolsets. I also created many 3D models and metatiles for NWN2. See the following links for my modules housed at the IGN NW Vault and The NW Nexus:\nhttp://nwvault.ign.com/View.php?view=User.EntriesListing&id=78052\nhttp://neverwinter.nexusmods.com/users/4147088\nCurrently, the IceBlink Engine is in a working basic state. We wanted to get some of the main functions, systems, features and two classes working before expanding to an advanced version. For the funded project at $500, we will complete the advanced version of the IceBlink Engine and Toolset and create a demo adventure module that will have roughly 1-2 hours of game play. If we are fortunate enough to reach our funding goal, we have plans to add additional classes, skills, features and functions to the engine and toolset.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, there are always risks and challenges to some degree. Although I do not foresee any major risks or challenges with this project, there are a few minor risks and challenges involved.\n\nThe difficulty with the greatest potential, although small, is completing this project in time. There is always the risk that the due date can slip. Major bugs, having a full time job, family responsibilities and unexpected life emergencies are all things that can delay a project\u2019s completion. When writing code or adding new features to a program; there is always the possibility of breaking existing functions. Bugs happen. We are giving ourselves more time than originally estimated in order to fix any unforeseen major bugs that could slow things down. There is a possibility of completing earlier than April 2013, but we want to make sure that the game is well polished and all feedback from the backers has been addressed. Also, we are constantly backing up the source code in multiple locations both locally and in the cloud just to be safe. I have a great day job so this is a part time endeavor and I have allotted a specific amount of time each week to the project in order to meet the April release date. We have done our best to anticipate any possible delays and to add the necessary contingencies to help ensure that we meet our due date. Although it is important that we meet our due date, we also want to make sure that we release a well-polished game that is virtually bug free.\n\nOne major benefit is that we do not need to outsource any of the work involved so there is no risk in someone dropping out or not completing their task.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "IceBlink Engine and Toolset (Android)", "update_content": "Hi IceBlink backers!

Outside their influence, in the vast majority of the galaxy, anarchy reigns supreme and spectacular discoveries await the bold.\nIts dog-eat-dog out there \u2013 you need to keep your friends close, and your enemies closer.\nWhether you want to trade for profit between systems, take part in multiplayer co-op mission alliances, free-for-all group battles and team raids to bring down planetary economies, even tip the balance of power in the galaxy (for your own advantage, of course..), or simply explore the wonders of the galaxy (and who knows what you\u2019ll find out there..) is up to you.\nYour second-to-second actions could have you taking the roles of trader, pirate, bounty hunter, leader, team player, opportunistic assassin, grand schemer, and more. You are at the centre of the action any time, any place and any way you choose \u2013 each action has a consequence, and influences the galaxy around you.\nStarting with a few credits and a basic starship, carve your own path through the richest, largest gaming sandbox ever created, set against a backdrop of raw anarchy, galactic powerplays and intrigue.  Do whatever it takes to upgrade your ship\u2019s hull, engines, weapons, defences, cargo hold; constantly improve your capabilities and influence on your journey towards the most coveted rank in the history of gaming - \u2018Elite\u2019.\nFight, trade, hunt your way across a giant galaxy of billions of star systems, starting with a basic starship and a few credits. You can make money from trading goods between the many star systems, by destroying pirate ships (and collecting bounty), or even by attacking traders and collecting their cargo (which in turn will get a bounty on your head!). There will be missions too, and exploration. Most people will do some combination of these things. Upgrade your ship and specialise in one activity - have a trader with a huge cargo bay, or use the space for weapons and maneuverability.\nReal Freedom - Go where you like, be what you like - pirate, bounty hunter, trader, assassin, or some mix of all of these.\nTrade - Buy low, cross dangerous space lanes, evade or destroy pirates en route, then sell high, if you make the journey!\nFight - Take on the pirates or be one yourself\nProgress - Get your pilot rating all the way from \"Harmless\" to \"Elite\"\nExplore - Head out to the far reaches of space and discover amazing sights\nAnd the best part - you can do all this online with your friends, or other \"Elite\" pilots like yourself, or even alone. The choice is yours...  \nIn \"Elite: Dangerous\" you fly a spaceship using a first person from-the-cockpit view, building on the elements from the previous games, with sumptious graphics enabled by the performance of modern PCs - all made possible using procedural techniques (see video on 'Procedural Generation' below). \n Scavenger Hunt Teaser\nDev Diary Video #1: Multiplayer - showing unedited work-in-progress gameplay footage:\nDev Diary Video #2: The Galaxy and How it Evolves:\n Dev Diary Video #3 - More multiplayer footage and discussion of player roles in the game:\nDev Diary Video #4  - Trading\nElite: Dangerous Development Plan\nPodcast Part 1- Gary Whitta interviews Chris Roberts and David Braben about Kickstarter, Star Citizen, and Elite: Dangerous:\nPodcast Part 2:\nPodcast Part 3:\nPodcast Part 4:\nPledge upgrades are unlimited and available to all tiers of \u00a330 or more.

To add a gift pledge follow the same procedure as for the pledge upgrades.\nWe have announced a stretch goal for a Mac version of the game. If we reach the stretch goal of \u00a31.4 million through the Kickstarter we will release a Mac version approximately 3 months after the Windows PC release.\nNew stretch goal announced, if we reach \u00a31.5 million then we'll add another 10 playable ships to the game.\nThe initial release of Elite: Dangerous doesn't mark the end of development. We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images. They can be found at higher resolution here:\n http://www.frontier.co.uk/elitedownloads/wallpapers/\n*All names must not be offensive, trademarks, or in any way problematic for us to include in the game, and must follow our naming guidelines.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStating the obvious, all projects, whether building a bridge, making a film, studying for an exam or whatever, carry risk. Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

Venture Capitalists only want to back mobile or social gaming start ups.\nWe say they're wrong. We say that there is a large audience of PC gamers that want sophisticated games built for their platform. And inside this audience, a significant group of people that have always loved space games, and if given a quality one again will be happy to play it.\nAsk not what your genre can do for you, but what you can do for your favorite genre.\nLet's put high-end PC gaming and Space Sims back on the map!\nStar Citizen brings the visceral action of piloting interstellar craft through combat and exploration to a new generation of gamers at a level of fidelity never before seen. At its core Star Citizen is a destination, not a one-off story. It's a complete universe where any number of adventures can take place, allowing players to decide their own game experience. Pick up jobs as a smuggler, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, or enlist as a pilot, protecting the borders from outside threats. Chris Roberts has always wanted to create one cohesive universe that encompasses everything that made Wing Commander and Privateer / Freelancer special. A huge sandbox with a complex and deep lore allowing players to explore or play in whatever capacity they wish. That universe is Star Citizen.\nThe Reasons You'll Want to Play Star Citizen\n A huge universe to explore, trade and adventure in\nSpace is unending, endless and so are your opportunities. Strike out to make your fortune amongst the Stars or sign-up for a tour of duty in the UEE Fleet.\nConstantly expanding and evolving universe\nWe\u2019re committed to making Star Citizen a living, breathing universe that is its own entity. It will be a constantly shifting and evolving place for players to explore and affect.\nMicro updates rule!\nWe\u2019re not interested in having yearly updates. Once live, we will have a team of people adding content on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. So we\u2019ll always be adding data, stories and campaigns as well as reacting to the needs and actions of the players.\nSquadron 42 - A Wing Commander style single player mode, playable OFFLINE if you want\nPlayable offline or online, co-op with friends, you sign up for a tour of duty with the UEE fleet, manning the front lines, protecting settlements from Vanduul warbands.\nLife during wartime\nIf you distinguish yourself in combat, you might be invited to join the legendary 42nd Squadron. Much like the French Foreign Legion of old, they can always be found in the toughest areas of operation and always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, regardless of the odds.\nThe conflict never ends\nUpon completion of your tour you\u2019ll re-enter the persistent Star Citizen universe with some credits in your pocket and Citizenship to help you make your way.  But in the universe of Star Citizen when one conflict ends, another is just around the corner.  You\u2019ll have opportunity to spend more time with your squadron mates as additional Campaigns are released as part of the content update plan.\nActions of the players impact the universe and become part of its history and lore\nThe universe will change based on the players' actions and adventures allowing them to become part of the history of the universe. As an example, players can scan for gravitational anomalies while out in space. If one is discovered and the player manages to successfully navigate this uncharted jump point, they\u2019ll be able to sell their Nav- Computers recording of their jump flight path for a great profit to a space company for other users to download. But the real prize is getting the system or jump-point named after them!\nAllowing user generated content is a key design goal\nOur modding tools will allow players to design new ships for both submission to the persistent RSI ship dealer network or to build custom ships and items for the self-hosted multiplayer mode.\nIt\u2019s about the gameplay and your interactions with others\nWe plan to put a lot of social ideas in the universe. Since the universe is dynamic, it will create some divisions and factions. For example, it\u2019s a perfectly valid choice not to be a Citizen and operate outside the protection of Earth. We think there will be people that gravitate to crime or helping enforce the law or defending the galaxy from the alien raiders or just accumulating as much money as possible. We want to include all these social divisions so players will gravitate to one or the other much like the real world operates. \nFully dynamic economy driven by player actions\nIf too many people fly iron ore to the smelting plants of New Pittsburgh, steel prices will drop. Buy low\u2026 sell high\u2026 you hope.\nThe cost of society\nIn game trade landing and trade tariffs pay for law and order in the civilized systems. Want to make a bigger profit? Try the outer world - outside earth\u2019s infrastructure and protection. The downside? No military or local police to protect you from an opportunistic pirate!\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYou could be a trader, a miner or an industrial magnate. Amass great wealth or just run enough missions to earn a comfortable living and upgrades for your ship.\nSpace is empty but you\u2019re never really alone\nIf caught alone in an online ambush, send a distress broadcast to your friends and if they\u2019re nearby they can jump in-system to save your bacon. In each combat instance player slots are reserved for your friends so you can rally forces to join you in combat!\nBigger ships offer bigger multi-player action\nOn larger ships, friends can join you to man turrets, repair systems, or switch with you on the pilot\u2019s chair. Think the Millennium Falcon with Han-Solo piloting and Luke on the turret.\nFull rigid body simulation of all spaceships\nYou wanted proper Newtonian mechanics. You got it! Spaceships adjust their trajectory and orientation just like the real thing.\nIntelligent Flight Control System (IFCS)\nLike a modern day F-35, the ships have fly by wire systems which take the player\u2019s inputs and then translate them into the commands for the ship\u2019s engine and thrusters to articulate and deliver the required thrust to achieve the pilot\u2019s request.\nDynamic Ship Maneuverability\nShip\u2019s performance is calculated dynamically based on various physical variables and the ability of your jet maneuvering to deliver thrust towards a requested vector. What does this mean? Infinite customization with component damage, mass or energy changes affecting maneuverability on the fly \u2013 allowing for endless combat strategies and results.\nShip Components matter!\nBecause we are fully simulating the physics and flight dynamics, the actual components matter. If a port thruster is damaged, it will affect your maneuverability organically.  If you upgrade your thruster package with enhanced thrusters that gimbal faster and deliver more thrust it will affect your performance. Dump cargo, you may be able to get the edge in turning in a dogfight.\n10X the detail of current AAA games\nMost current gen \u201cAAA\u201d games have around 10,000 polygons for a character and 30,000 or so for a vehicle. In Star Citizen, the characters are detailed at 100,000 polygons, the fighter at 300,000 and the Space Carrier 7 million! This allows unparalleled detail, making the visuals more immersive than has ever been achieved before.\nEverything you would imagine would move or articulate on a spaceship or a device \u2013 does!\nEvery spaceship is built from 100s of sub-components, many of them moving and articulating just like they would in the \u201creal\u201d world. If a component gets damaged during combat be prepared to feel the effects on your ship.\nRange of scale never seen before in a game\nFrom a vast 1km long carrier to a 27m fighter, to your 1.8m tall pilot, Everything is rendered and to the same level of detail. Zoom in to the paneling of the carrier and its texel density is the same as the 27m fighter. All without a load screen or loss of visual fidelity.\nReally feel the scale of ships and space battles\nBecause of the ability of the game to scale seamlessly you could be looking out the windows on the bridge of a carrier watching the battle unfold or jump into a cockpit and take the fight to the enemy.\nJoystick, gamepad, mouse, keyboard are all supported.\nWe\u2019ve all got our preferences, so why be forced to choose?\nAdvanced peripheral support\nAs part of commitment to high end gaming we are dedicated to supporting the more exotic enthusiast peripherals; HOTAS, flight chair, rudder pedals. It\u2019s all about the immersion and if you've got the equipment we want to support it!\nVirtual Reality is here!\nWe have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?\nNext generation, TODAY\nBuilt on top of Crytek\u2019s award winning CryEngine3 technology, Star Citizen\u2019s engine is built to scale for the PC\u2019s of today and tomorrow.\nA PC gaming enthusiast\u2019s friend!\nAs you upgrade your PC, Star Citizen will take advantage of your extra processor cores, memory or GPUs. This is why you\u2019re a PC gamer \u2013 you love being on the cutting edge, not stuck in the past!\nToday\u2019s game publishers, like their Hollywood counterparts, want predictable returns from sequels to last year\u2019s hits. A game in an out- of-favor genre, set in an original universe is viewed as a bad investment. And the concept of developing a new product exclusively for the PC sends publishing executives and most Venture Capitalists running for the exits.\nAnd that hero is you, the unappreciated PC gamer. The ignored Space Sim fan.\nThis is your chance to have your voice heard. To tell the world that high end PC gaming lives. That you want to sit in the cockpit of your space fighter defending the galaxy or making your fortune as a wily entrepreneur.\nStar Citizen is meant to be everything you ever dreamed you could have in a Space-Sim, all in one glorious ever-evolving package.\nWe know it may not look like this, but we do!\nWhat you've seen was put together by a very small team over the past year. We felt that this vision needed to be shown rather than talked about so we invested our own money to build the technical and visual prototype that shows just how Star Citizen is going to push the limits of PC games.\nInstead of taking this prototype to a publisher for a green light, we are cutting out the middleman and taking it to you.\nYou as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.\nWe have investors that have agreed to contribute the balance we need to complete this game as long as we can validate that there is a demand for a high end PC space game. By meeting or surpassing our target on Kickstarter you tell the world that you want a PC based Space Sim and allow us to make this game.\nBut we're offering more than just the chance to support the platform and genre.\nAs an early backer, you\u2019ll also be getting a lot more than just the finished game.\nFor the people who pledge for their spaceship in the Star Citizen universe, you\u2019ll be part of a select club that has exclusive access to early gameplay and behind the scenes development updates.\nThe people who pledge for their spaceships will get to test-fly them long before the general public. 12 months in, we will allow the early backers to play the multiplayer space combat Alpha, and then 20-22 months in they will get to play the Star Citizen Beta, adventuring around the huge open galaxy, well before the general public. We are going to limit our alpha slots to 200,000 as we want to stress test the game with real users, but will not be ready for the full load until we have finished Beta.\nIn addition, part of the money we are asking for is budgeted to maintain the Roberts Space Industries site with constant updates. Our goal is for the game\u2019s website to be live from day one, constantly giving information about what\u2019s happening in the galaxy even before the game is live, sharing interesting insights into the development process and canvassing the early backers for their opinions. Roberts Space Industries should be the first stop into the Star Citizen universe. When we say we want to involve the community, we really mean it!\nFinally we are offering the pledge slots a discount to what the final digital price will be. Like Guild Wars 2, the basic game will be $60, but for the very early backers we are offering the entry tier at $30. But hurry! Slots are limited!\nOur hope is that these benefits are compelling enough for you to pledge for your spaceship today.\nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion. An amazing Interstellar adventure waits!\nCan't use Kickstarter?

I have an incredible opportunity to record and perform ORCA live with the world renowned Das Karussell Orchestra (featuring members of the Bruckner Orchester) at Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria on October 28th, 2012 and with your involvement and support, we can make it happen!\n\nMany of you know my work in rock music, between System of a Down and my solo album releases.  While I have rearranged some of my past rock compositions to be performed as orchestral pieces, such as the Elect The Dead Symphony in 2010, ORCA is the first 4 act symphony that I have composed, a mix of early 20th century compositional styles combined with the powerful range of film scoring. I decided to name my symphony ORCA because orcas \"appear to have no parallel outside humans\" in terms of their cultural faculties.  An orca is really a dolphin with much darker tendencies.  I see this dichotomy as a great metaphor for humanity.\nLast year, I wrote and recorded a professionally sampled studio version with the goal of being able to record it properly with a full orchestra\u2026.this was not something I could capture in a small home studio.  I was able to play with The Das Karussell Orchestra at Brucknerhaus during the Elect The Dead Symphony world tour, which was an amazing experience.  I shared my sampled recording of ORCA with them, and together we made plans for the live performance and recording to fully bring the work to life and share and distribute it to as many people as possible.\n\nWe have put together many different ways for fans to get involved and be a part of ORCA from the ground up, all of which are outlined in this Kickstarter campaign. We tried to think of ways to give you every bit of music possible, and interactive, personalized experiences for those who can attend the show on October 28th, and for those who can't.  Our goal is $25,000.00, which is the minimal cost for the recording.  Any additional funds will be used to cover the expenses of mixing, mastering and promotion.  We will keep you updated with news and progress so you are able to see what we do as this project grows.\n\nPlease check it out and I hope to share this journey for ORCA with you all.  Thank you for the support.\n\nPeace,\n\nSerj\n\n**Any and all questions can be directed to Orca@serjicalstrike.com\n**WE JUST FINALIZED THE T-SHIRT DESIGN - CHECK IT OUT BELOW**\nORCA T-SHIRT", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving already worked with the Das Karussell Orchestra at the Brucknerhaus, I feel confident that they are the perfect orchestra for me to record ORCA with. I have heard other classical albums made with this orchestra that have been recorded at Brucknerhaus and they sound stellar. We have taken all the appropriate measures to insure that the recording equipment and engineers used are consistent with achieving a recording of the same highest quality. Every recording session has it's list of challenges, but we've made all the necessary arrangements to minimize any bumps in the road. This will be a challenge, but a very manageable one that I feel very confident will be handled with the utmost level of professionalism. \n\nThe goal fund of $25,000 will cover the necessary recording costs of the actual session itself, but nothing else. From a risk/challenge perspective, this is our biggest one. Mixing and mastering will need to commence thereafter, and usually there are considerable funds that are required to make that happen. Fortunately, I have my own studio that will be mixing and mastering in, so I will be able to effectively manage costs associated with this process. Also, I feel very confident in my abilities to effectively mix and master the album as I have had plenty of experience in my studio. In fact, I just mixed my most recent full length rock album 'Harakiri', that has received great reviews for it's audio quality. Additionally, I will be working with the same engineer who helped mix my previous live album recorded with an orchestra, \"The Elect The Dead Symphony\". We have plans to mix and master the album upon our return from Europe after this concert on October 28, and the timeline that we have mapped out to complete the mixing is very manageable.\n\nWe are also working towards finding a well respected classical music label partner to up with for the official release of ORCA. This has been an ongoing process that is showing much promise. Since no official agreement has yet been made, there also exists a challenge here with respect to timeline of official release date of ORCA. However, I have taken this into consideration and have allotted for the appropriate tentative release date of June 2013 for the physical cd of ORCA to be delivered. If no agreement can be reached, I have a backup plan. Since I do have my own record label in Serjical Strike Records, I would self release ORCA myself. This is also a very manageable challenge as I do have years of experience releasing records and have the ability to produce and release my own music as physical products.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Orca CDs are here!", "update_content": "Just received the shipment of Orca cds.

Project Eternity (working title) pays homage to the great Infinity Engine games of years past: Baldur\u2019s Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape: Torment.\nProject Eternity aims to recapture the magic, imagination, depth, and nostalgia of classic RPG's that we enjoyed making - and playing. At Obsidian, we have the people responsible for many of those classic games and we want to bring those games back\u2026 and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here - we need your help to make it a reality!\nProject Eternity will take the central hero, memorable companions and the epic exploration of Baldur\u2019s Gate, add in the fun, intense combat and dungeon diving of Icewind Dale, and tie it all together with the emotional writing and mature thematic exploration of Planescape: Torment.\nCombat uses a tactical real-time with pause system - positioning your party and coordinating attacks and abilities is one of the keys to success. The world map is dotted with unique locations and wilderness ripe for exploration and questing. You\u2019ll create your own character and collect companions along the way \u2013 taking him or her not just through this story, but, with your continued support, through future adventures. You will engage in dialogues that are deep, and offer many choices to determine the fate of you and your party. \u2026and you'll experience a story that explores mature themes and presents you with complex, difficult choices to shape how your story plays out.\nWe are excited at this chance to create something new, yet reminiscent of those great games and we want you to be a part of it as well.\nWallpapers:   1280x1024 | 1650x1050 | 1920x1080 | 1920x1200 | 2048x1536\nWe are an independent video game developer specializing in role-playing games.  We were founded in 2003 by five industry veterans from Black Isle Studios: Feargus Urquhart, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, Chris Avellone, and Chris Jones. While at Black Isle we worked with BioWare, the creators of the Infinity Engine, on the development of the Baldur's Gate series, and were responsible for the creation and development of the Infinity Engine-based Icewind Dale series and Planescape: Torment game. Also at Black Isle we created the first two titles in the award-winning Fallout series: Fallout and Fallout 2.\nAt Obsidian we have created great games like Fallout: New Vegas and have many amazing people who will work on Project Eternity, including Tim Cain (Fallout, Arcanum, Temple of Elemental Evil, etc.), Josh Sawyer (Icewind Dale 1 and 2, Fallout: New Vegas), Scott Everts (Level creator on Fallout, Planescape: Torment, and Icewind Dale 1 and 2 and Fallout: New Vegas), Brian Menze (Vault Boy artist extraordinaire, Artist on Planescape: Torment, Creator of Darth Nihilus), Dan Spitzley (Lead Programmer on Planescape: Torment) along with dozens of other talented artists, programmers, and designers.\nTogether we have been developing computer role-playing games for a very long time, and to this day there is still nothing we love making and playing more than RPGs.\nWe have wanted to go back to our roots and create an epic PC role-playing game adventure for years. But, it's been almost impossible to get funding through traditional methods for a game like this. The great thing about Kickstarter is that we can go directly to the people who love to play RPGs as much as we love to make them. Plus, we don\u2019t have to make compromises with a publisher. We make the development decisions, we market the game, and we don't have to answer to anyone but you \u2013 our fans.\nOur relationship with you can be even closer with Kickstarter. We can be more transparent with development and give you an inside look to what goes on day-to-day with the programmers, artists, and designers of Project Eternity. We want to give you a behind the scenes look at the game's development, and we have fun stuff planned like developer blogs, web broadcasts, dev chats, and much, much more.\nWe need to raise $1.1 million to fund an experienced team to do this right. We are asking for more than a lot of the other Kickstarter projects and that\u2019s because we are not only making a game, we are creating a whole new world. That means a new RPG system, entirely new art, new characters and animation and whole lot of lore and dialogue. We\u2019ve also designed the game to have a flexible budget and scope, so if we reach our target budget goal, we have a list great stuff we can add into the mix through stretch goals. And, additional money we raise will go straight into the game to add new levels, companions, NPCs, features, and even entirely new parts of the world which will add hours and hours to the adventure.\nBaldur's Gate and Athkatla are big cities. Spanning multiple large maps with a ton of interiors, characters and quests, big cities are a lot of fun. Like strongholds, they also take a lot of work to do well. We're going to have one big city in Project Eternity. Would you like two? If you take us on an exciting adventure to $3.5 Million, we will take you on an exciting adventure to another big city.\nOK! After much team deliberation we have one final ultimate stretch goal. At $4.0m we will be enhancing the whole game. We will use live instrumentation for the soundtrack, add developer in-game commentary, and use every dollar between $3.5m and $4m to enhance the game. Also at $4.0m Chris Avellone will be forced to play Arcanum.\n\nThe Endless Paths started with three subterranean levels, but it can grow larger with your help. For every 2,500 additional backers, the depths of Od Nua\u2019s castle become deeper, which means one additional level will be added to the vaults. Continue to spread the word about Project Eternity, and let's see how big we can make The Endless Paths!\nWe're also pleased to announce we're supporting the Kicking It Forward initiative.\nLooking to customize your reward tier a bit?

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

BusinessWeek! The Verge! Wired! IGN! The New York Times! Time!\nWe love console games.\nThere's something about a big HD TV and digital surround sound that fills up a living room. Shooters, platformers, sports games, arcade classics and experimental indie games just feel bigger on a TV screen. It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you.

Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others. The more we raise, the more we can do. \nOUYA: THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 29371, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console", "project_name": "OUYA: A New Kind of Video Game Console"}}, {"backer": "Gojal Krogsgaard", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Live in USA? Look here too! http://ThoriumPetition.com/\nUntil 1974, the United States government funded research into THORIUM as an energy resource, in a radically different type of nuclear reactor. Despite incredible progress (on a meager budget), the project was cancelled due to political power favoring the inferior reactors we see today.\nLFTR is today's incarnation of this superior design, the Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactor. It addresses common concerns about nuclear power, with inherent stability and plentiful fuel. Virtually no transuranic waste is generated, and the waste that is produced can be easily partitioned for life saving medical isotopes, and other valuable materials.\nI recently created a documentary to communicate the science behind LFTR, it is called THORIUM REMIX 2011. It took loads of time (including an unpaid volunteer), and a thousand bucks. I think the end result is very good... for a $1000 documentary.\nPlease help me drastically improve it.\nI've learned that a documentary which consists primarily of lecture footage will be overlooked by many digital distribution chains.\nI'm sure we can craft a message which can more effectively communicate the technical details to a wider audience. It can be communicated (primarily) in non-lecture format. And made clearer-still with the aid of computer animation.\nI'm not starting from scratch here. At the very least I can incorporate improved elements into THORIUM REMIX. An improved THORIUM REMIX is the very, very least I will possibly achieve.\nBut for $20,000, I do believe I can create an far better, almost invaluable documentary.\nSomething suitable as a free educational tool for schools.\nSomething that will go exponentially more viral on YouTube.\nSomething that non-computer folks will be able to access outside of YouTube.\nSomething that will help rapidly accelerate western society's thorium dialog, so that we do end up developing this technology ourselves, and not end up licensing it from China.\nThe $20,000 will be used for travel, videographers, licensing music, and paying for computer animation. I'm not above asking people to donate such assets for free (crash on couch, grovel for assistance, try crowdsource video assets). But my past experience with THORIUM REMIX 2011 was that I was unable to crowdsource all the assets I asked for.\nInstead of 2011's ask for free assets, I can put up bounties and pay for best submissions. Need CGI animation depicting energy conversion from fission to turbine to electricity? Offer a bounty, see what I get. Assets will be Creative Commons licensed, so I would be in a sense paying artists to populate the Creative Commons universe with the assets I need. Everyone wins (artists and remixers not just viewers of this doc). It should be easier for the NEXT person to come along and make a thorium documentary too, not just myself. You can see I've already contributed hours of footage from 2011 for this purpose.\nI view THORIUM REMIX as a documentary constructed in Web 2.0 style: Release early, release often. Share the source code. If I can NOT finance THORIUM REMIX 2012 via Kickstarter... I'll still make one. It just won't be an order of magnitude better than THORIUM REMIX 2012. It will be the best I can do with whatever resources I have. And I'm projecting that to be a very incremental improvement at this point.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

It features a blend of exploration, discovery, ship management and real time strategic combat that creates an experience quite unlike other games in its genre.\nEDIT: But don\u2019t take our word for it...\nThe OnLive demo is over!\nFor the first 2+ weeks of the Kickstarter, a demo of FTL was featured as part of OnLive's Indie Showcase.  It was an event coinciding with GDC that allowed people at home to try a number of the IGF nominees and honorable mentions.  It was hugely successful: FTL was one of the most played demos of the event.  At one point it was the 2nd most played game on the entire OnLive service*!    For now we will be working hard to get the game ready for the beta in May.  In the meantime we will be putting up some more gameplay videos to let you get a better feeling for the game.\n*Or so we were told at GDC.\n\nThe Game\nFTL has been described as \u201cFirefly by way of Spelunky.\u201d  Many games have tackled the goal of recreating the feeling of space operas, but few have focused on the inner workings of a single ship. How does the crew react when their ship takes a heavy missile barrage and the shield batteries shut down?  Do you reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape?  Do you power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky before they can breach your hull?  Or do you teleport a boarding party onto the enemy ship and take the fight to them directly?  FTL allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.\n\nA setting of intergalactic war:  The player is tasked with a mission vital to the survival of the Galactic Federation currently threatened by a nearly victorious rebellion.\nA story that engages, but does not dictate player experience:  The setting provides direction but the real story of FTL is created by the player and it evolves organically during each play-through.\nAn arms race: The locations and enemies grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.  To survive you will need to find and purchase equipment; hire and level up crew; and upgrade the ship\u2019s systems.\nExploration is key:  Every location you Faster-Than-Light travel to contains a text based event.  This includes scenarios like attempting to help an infected space station pleading for help; slavers demanding your surrender; hunting pirates through a nebula; and surviving an uncharted asteroid field.\nA random galaxy:  Each play-through will feature different encounters, events, choices, and results to your decisions. \nPermadeath is at the core of FTL:  Knowing that your crew\u2019s lives are in your hands and that each battle could mean the end of your trek fills the player with a sense of urgency and desperation that adds importance to every decision.\nSleek and focused gameplay:  FTL focuses on the development of your ship, recreating the atmosphere of space operas without the countless menus and confusing interface that frequently go hand in hand with ship management and galactic sim games.  Currently each game lasts between 15 and 90 minutes.\n\n\nThe Combat\nShip-to-ship combat is a large focus of the game.  Check out this older gameplay trailer to see it in action: \nEDIT:  There are new gameplay trailers to watch.  Check them out in Update #4 and Update #5!\n\nThe Final Game\nA lot of these elements are fully functional and can be experienced (briefly) in the demo... so what will we be adding between now and release?\nShip Customization:  Choose & name your ship; outfit it with weapons & equipment; and hire & name your crew.  \nAlien Races: We are working on 5 playable alien races that have unique abilities, ships and implications during exploration.\nCrew Development:  Your crew will gain skill over time, allowing survivors to have improved combat and operate ship systems to increase their potential..\nAn Ending:  The current game is infinite (play until you lose), but we want to have a more controlled game mode that gives the player a final goal and rewards for completion.\nDeep Meta-game: Unlock playable ships, unique crew members, weapons and equipment to be used in subsequent play-throughs.\nCustom Soundtrack:  We have two songs so far, but our sound designer will be working hard to give us a soundtrack that greatly enhances the experience. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nYou may be wondering, \u201cif the game is so close to completion, why do you need our money?\u201d   When we quit our jobs last year, we intended to work on a small project for a few months.  During development we received such overwhelmingly positive feedback that we changed our plans.  We decided to bring FTL up to a finished game quality.  However, releasing a game takes money and our funds are starting to deplete.  Your generous pledges will go towards:\n\nBusiness Costs: To officially start selling the game we have to set up a company, deal with licensing and other expenses.\nPaying Our Sound Designer: It is fine that we\u2019re working out of pocket, but we will need to have money to pay our wonderful sound guy, Ben Prunty.\nPolish & Improvement: Making FTL as good as it can be.\n\n\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $10 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released.  We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux.  See below for estimated system requirements.  We're aiming to be content complete within a few months and then release the game by the end of summer.  This is subject to change and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nPledging $25 or more will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain but we will attempt to start it within a couple months of the end of the Kickstarter.  Here is what we know now:\nThe Beta will initially require Windows and have only English localization.\nIt will initially be available only to backers.\nEDIT: The beta will be organized through Steam!

What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.

Start the clock.\nThere are only 2 basic choices for who issues a nation\u2019s money:\n1. we the people; or\n2. banks.\nThe second alternative -- believe it or not -- is the case today -- for nearly every nation on earth.\nThink about this. Which do you want?\nThe issuance of the nation's money is the most important power \u2013 even the very definition of sovereignty.\n\u2022 Without it, a nation CANNOT be sovereign.\n\u2022 Without it, a nation must borrow.\n\u2022 Without it, a nation must borrow all its money from bankers; and yes, they do charge interest on it.\nRemember what Proverbs warns:\n\u201d\u2026 the borrower is servant to the lender.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why nations can never get out of debt under this system, because all our money is borrowed from bankers. To reduce the National Debt is to quite literally reduce the national money supply; in other words, create a money shortage. Politicians tend to ignore \u2013 or don\u2019t understand - this embarrassing fact.\nGovernmental \u201causterity\u201d measures will not work. Why? It\u2019s the interest \u2013 the interest on the U.S. National Debt is growing faster than any likely cutbacks in spending. This never-reported fact is what is overwhelming every governmental budget everywhere around the planet. That's why 2011 in the U.S. will be the year of municipal and possibly even the first State bankruptcies in American history. Why? Because as interest rates rise on municipal bonds, interest payments owed by States are going to skyrocket. This is in addition to declining state tax revenues and certain reductions in Federal contributions to state budgets.\nIn 2011, we will reach the tipping point. Nothing can fix this short of a basic restructuring of our debt-based money system. No More National Debt.\nOk, 60 seconds is up. That's the content side; here is the high-tech implementation side of this project.\nThe world\u2019s global economy is still collapsing, despite what you hear on TV, and now, more than ever, we need to use technology to enhance important books with multi-media elements. Now, for the first time, printing a new, second-generation UPC scan image on pages allows paper books to enjoy a revolutionary new life -- to be updated \u2013 in real time! That\u2019s why, with your help, my new book, \u201cNo More National Debt,\u201d will become one of the most important books of the Information Age.\nBy embedding my book with HyperScan\u00ae QR codes, sound and motion leap from the pages, adding important timely elements to each chapter. By scanning these HyperScan codes with any QR code scanning application (such as AT&T Code Scanner, QR Reader, Code Scan, ScanLife, or many more) on your iPhone, Android phone, Blackberry, or other smart phones, you will launch vital breaking information, right in the palm of your hand! Don't worry if you don't have a smart phone. We will include the actual URL address under each Hyperscan so the supplemental info will be available to everyone.\nYou'll immediately see why this book project is absolutely unique and a book publishing game changer -- and that's before we got to the content.\nTry it - the HyperScan code (in the window above) takes you to the following 8-minute YouTube of my keynote address at the most prestigious monetary reform conference in the world, at Bromsgrove, England on Oct. 29, 2010. The speech pretty well summarizes what I'm up to in this book:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch...\n\"No More National Debt\" will have around 50 HyperScan QR codes embedded in it. I'll have one for every color picture, so the book, itself, can be printed in black ink only (with your phone providing full color photos and videos!). I'll have HyperScan QR codes linking to my series of 17 \"Still Reports on the Economy\" YouTube videos, and have spare HyperScan QR codes which I can assign future content to, as well. This is not just emerging technology; the trademark owner is working day and night to get this up and running to meet my needs (see below for more information).\nThis is a completely new, never-before-done technology, but it is up and running, as you can see. Note: In case there is any trouble with Kickstarter properly displaying the HyperScan code, I will put one up on my website, www.SecretofOz.com.\nABOUT ME:\nMy passion is monetary reform; it\u2019s an important issue that unfortunately only comes to light when there\u2019s a lot of pain \u2013 like we have now. I\u2019ve been delivering educational books and videos about this subject for over 20 years; in fact, one of the videos I produced, \"The Money Masters\", is in the top 15 most watched free movies in Internet history.\nMy recent award-winning documentary, \"The Secret of Oz,\" really helped get me on the map. In 2010 alone, I have spoken in Germany, Sweden, England and Iceland on monetary reform.\nBut oops, then on Nov. 30 I got laid off from my day job just as I was starting to write this book, so now, everything is being compressed. I'm moving fast before I run out of money. This financial support will keep me going for an additional 2-3 months, plus print the first run of books before I can start getting a revenue stream going.\nI expect it to do very well. I will probably end up selling it to a big publisher, but it's hard to sell a really big, new idea until you have the first one made and sitting in the publisher's hand. I hope to have this out by Feb. 1. I have several big conferences in February. Plus, I've been invited to Ireland, Greece, Germany, Sweden, Holland, Cameroon, and Dubai, just as soon as the book is out, to talk about this solution in their respective nations.\nThe first chapter is really short and sweet, but reveals just how simple, yet effective the monetary reform concept is. In fact, download a QR scanning application now (such as AT&T Code Scanner, QR Reader, Code Scan, ScanLife, or many more), and you\u2019ll see how visually stunning a black-and-white page can become!\nCHAPTER 1 \u2013 The Magic Isle of Guernsey\nOnce upon a time, there was a little island in the English Channel \u2013 much closer to France than to England \u2013 called Guernsey. Yes, that\u2019s where the Guernsey cow came from. Guernsey cows are famous because their milk has a golden color due to an exceptionally high content of beta-carotene, a source of Vitamin A. And you thought this was to be a book about money? Hold on, we are getting there.\nDespite the fact that island of Guernsey has only 30 square miles and a population of only 65,000 people and very little in the way of natural resources except cows, their per capita income is $40,000 per year, 9th highest among the 200 or so countries of the world. What gives? Guernsey has used a money system since 1817 that can serve as a model for the rest of the world to use to escape the ongoing great depression of 21st century.\nDespite its proximity to France, Guernsey is actually a British Crown Dependency and, to its credit, has never joined the European Union. After the Napoleonic Wars, Guernsey was in dire economic straits. The island\u2019s road were mere cart-tracks, only 54-inches wide. In wet weather they were virtually impassable. There was not a vehicle for hire of any kind on the island. There was no trade, nor much hope of employment among the poor. The sea was washing away large tracts of land due to the sorry state of the dykes.\nGuernsey, like most nations at that time (as well as today) had borrowed heavily from banks. The States Debt was \u00a319,137 with an annual interest charge of \u00a32,390, but the gross national revenue of the entire island was only \u00a33,000, leaving only a paltry \u00a3610 per annum to run the entire island. In other words, interest paid to banks consumed 80% of the GDP, thus reducing the populace to a state of pitiful serfdom.\nIn 1815, a Committee of well-respected, public-spirited elders was assembled to finance the building of a Public Market near the main harbor, Saint Peter Port, so the farmers could more easily sell their products for export. The cost of the new facility would be \u00a36,000. In addition, fixing the dykes would cost an additional \u00a310,000.\nFurther taxation of the impoverished island was impossible. Borrowing the money from the banks would result in even higher interest charges that could never be paid. The Committee made a historic recommendation to remedy this dire situation.\n\"The Committee recommends that the expense should be met by the issue of States Notes of 1\u00a3 Sterling to the value of \u00a36,000 \u2026 and that these notes will be available not only for the payment of the new market, but also for Torteval Church, roads to construct, and other expenses of the States\u2026. \"\nThe Committee argued that there was little to fear from inflation because the local banks already had \u00a350,000 of their money (Notes) in circulation. As a further protection against inflation, the overly-cautious citizens of Guernsey placed redemption dates on the notes of April 1817, October 1817, and April 1818. In other words these notes were good for payment of taxes and good as regular money in circulation until the expiration date was reached. At that time, the notes would no longer be legal tender and the State would destroy them.\n\"In this manner, without increasing the States\u2019 debt, it will be possible to finish these works, leaving sufficient money in the Exchequer for other needs.\u201d\nOnce the good citizens realized that these notes would work without the skies falling on the gentle island, additional issues took place in 1820 and 1821. By 1821, some \u00a310,000 of Guernsey Notes were in circulation, all created without debt.\n\"[It was] the most advantageous method of meeting debts, from the point of view both of the public and the States finances. Indeed, the public seemed to realize this fact, and, far from being averse to taking the notes, they sought them out eagerly.\"\nThe citizenry clearly understood that these Guernsey Notes were clearly government financing in the public interest. They also realized that if there were to be any inflation as a result, at least it was better than no money at all, and at least they would all shoulder the inflation equally.\nIn 1824, another \u00a35,000 notes were issued for the markets, and in 1826 \u00a320,000 to erect Elizabeth College and certain other schools.\nBy 1829, \u00a348,000 worth of Guernsey debt-free Notes were in circulation, and by 1837, over \u00a355,000.\n\"In the Billet d\u2019Etat it was a frequent subject for congratulation; and it was stated over and over again by eminent men of those times that without the issue of States\u2019 notes, important public works, such as roads and buildings could not possibly have been carried out. Yet by means of the States\u2019 issue, not only were these works accomplished, but the Island was not a penny the poorer in interest charges. Indeed, the improvements had stimulated the flow of visitors to the island, and with increased trade, the island enjoyed its new-found prosperity.\"\n\nIn 1826, however, the first signs of opposition by the banking community began. A complaint was lodged with the British Privy Council that Guernsey had no right to issue debt-free notes. However the Guernsey (also known as the \u201cStates\u201d) Financial Committee explained the situation to the satisfaction of all, the matter was closed.\nThe next year, 1827, surprise, surprise, a new commercial bank opened, called \u201cOld Bank\u201d. They began printing up their bank notes in such quantity that the island became flooded with money. A few years later, Guernsey feared that inflation would set in \u2013 or worse \u2013 that their own debt-free money experiment would be blamed for the inflation somehow. So a Committee was appointed to confer with the banks. The result of these meetings remains a mystery to this day; \u00a315,000 of Guernsey Notes would be withdrawn from circulation and the government would heretofore be limited to issuing a grand total of only \u00a340,000 of their own notes. This agreement remained in force for the next 70 years.\nIn the wake of World War I, the banks came under severe restrictions on how much money they could issue. All bank money was being directed towards the war effort. But Guernsey was under no such restriction, probably because its experiment was unique, and perhaps forgotten.\nGuernsey made good use of her opportunity. By the end of the war, in 1918, Guernsey had issued \u00a3142,000, and 40 years later, that had grown to \u00a3542,765. Today, private bank notes no longer exist. British money circulates side by side with State Notes.\n\"Naturally, there is a greater demand for the States Notes; no sane citizen of Guernsey wishes to have his taxes increased to pay debt charges! To enlarge on this theme: In 1937 the States Note money, about \u00a3175,000, cost the States only \u00a3450 for printing and handling. A loan of the same dimensions would have cost about \u00a311,383 annually. So can you blame the Guernsey taxpayers for preferring their own money since, under their sensible and benevolent financial system they pay hardly any income tax.\n\"During the entire experiment in Guernsey, from 1817 to date, there has at no time been a threat of inflation from the creation of States Notes. At all times, the States were very careful in the issue and cancellation of notes according to their ability and requirements. \"\nIn other words they carefully controlled the quantity of their money in circulation.\n\"Any visitor to Guernsey is immediately impressed by the vast difference in prices between the island and the mainland in Britain. Thanks to the exceptionally low taxation and import duties, Guernsey enjoys low prices, plenty of money, and a high standard of living. In fact, Guernsey can afford to leave worries about inflation to the debt-ridden mainland! \"\nFortunately, the Guernsey experiment is not an aberration. It has been tried time and time again, always with success. The bankers, however inevitably attack these in-the-public-interest, debt-free government issues of money. Debt-free money is in everyone\u2019s interest except bankers\u2019. Typically, they will use their money and influence to create some financial emergency, then bribe sufficient politicians to convince them to vote for legislation giving them a monopoly an issuing all the nation\u2019s money as a loan.\n------------\nSo, there you have it \u2013 the first look at this ground-breaking new book. This type of theme will be a recurring theme in this book: There is a way for citizens and their governments to take back the money-creation power of the banks. Yes, bankers are experts with money, but they are experts in maximizing their profit and rarely have much interest in the public interest. Freeing your government from borrowing money from bankers is the first, and most important step for national freedom and prosperity. It is also THE most important step to limiting governmental overspending. If a government cannot borrow, it MUST live within its means. Guernsey printed a small amount of additional money to create infrastructure projects in the public interest. Debt-free, government issued money -- where the quantity is properly controlled -- has worked to promote low taxation and maximize freedom for the majority of a nation EVERY TIME IT HAS BEEN TRIED.\nThat\u2019s why I hope you\u2019ll help support me \u2013 at the grass roots level \u2013 in getting this message out to the world. And please \u2013 tell you friends about it, too. After all, in a very real way, your supporting this effort makes it YOUR message, too.\n---------\nAbout HyperScan: HyperScan is a registered trademark of Media IP Holdings, LLC.
