[{"backer": "Stefin Sun Hehman", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Official Selection HP Lovecraft & Cthuluthon\nOfficial Selection Little Rock Horror Picture Show\nOfficial Selection Northwest Animation Festival\nRETURN TO MAD GOD  \nIn 2012, after sitting on the shelf for 20 years, artists at Tippett Studio implored Phil to revive MAD GOD.\nIncorporating footage shot before the surge of CGI with new puppets, scenes, environments, and in-camera effects, Phil ran a Kickstarter Campaign and raised the necessary funds to direct his film while mentoring a new generation in traditional stop motion animation and creature fabrication.   \nThe crew was entirely made up entirely of volunteers, including artists from Tippett Studio, students from local art schools, and industry veterans who remember the \"good ol' days\" when effects were made by people on sets photographing puppets one frame at a time.\nTom Gibbons and Chuck Duke animating MAD GOD\nGLACIAL\nMad God is an experimental, hand-made, animated film, set in a Miltonesque world of monsters, mutants and mad scientists. \nThe inspirations for the film span from Bertold Brecht & Hieronymous Bosch to Buster Keaton.\nMaking a stop motion film is a \"glacial\" process.  It takes forever.  24 pictures to make 1 second on film, moving puppets by hand in every pose.\nAdd to that, the film is only worked on outside of \"working hours,\" meaning evenings and weekends.  \nBUT WE DID IT!\nThanks to the money raised from our Kickstarter Backers, and their patience to get the film... we were able to complete our goal to make and deliver a 12 minute chapter of the series called MAD GOD: Part 1.\nSO WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?\nIt's just what you think it is -- MAD GOD: Part 2!  A NEW 15+ minutes (or thereabouts) of stop motion mayhem and murder, following the continuing journey of \"The Assassin\" as he explores the increasingly mysterious and maniacal depths of the MAD WORLD.\nSLOW DOWN, I'M NEW HERE. WHAT?\nMAD GOD is a movie.  A Series of contiguous short movies, directed by legendary visual effects and stop-motion artist Phil Tippett.  The sets, creatures, effects and spirit are, in every way, independent and created from the heart. Sometimes that heart is bursting with love for the craft, while other times it's punctured and bleeding all over the place... 24 frames per second.\nMAD GOD is a mature film made with technology that spans the history of cinema.\n\"The final form of Mad God isn\u2019t the film itself, but the memory after you watch it. It\u2019s bringing you to that moment just after waking up from a dream, frozen, exploring fragments of your feral mind before they fade back into the shadows. That\u2019s the moment. Mad God is just a way to get you there. \" - Phil Tippett\nWHERE DID IT COME FROM?\nPhil Tippett was raised on the fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien; films that fueled his and other youngsters' imaginations with creatures brought to life using stop-frame animation. As a young man, he was further influenced by European experimental filmmakers Karel Zeman, Jan Svankmajer and Vladislav Starevich, who used similar techniques in surreal and experimental ways.  \nWith his work on the \"Star Wars,\" \"Robocop,\" and \"Jurassic Park\" movies, Tippett carved his own niche as a modern master of stop motion. In 1984 he created his own studio where he continued to explore and innovate using stop motion.  \nMAD GOD began with several minutes of stop motion animation in 1990, before the explosion of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies. But as his studio blossomed into a powerhouse of computer-assisted visual effects and animation, the MAD GOD project fell on the back burner.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?  \nIndependent films cost money, and MAD GOD is no exception.  \nJust like with MAD GOD: Part 1, all the money raised through Kickstarter will be used to finance the hard costs associated with making the second chapter of this film, including materials for making molds, armatures, rear and front-screen projections, lab services, hard drive storage, power, and studio rental space among other costs...  \nIn short, your money will finance the supplies needed to bring the film to life. Your contributions will ensure that the next chapter gets completed, and you will have a front row seat to the making of this spectacle.  \nWe were blown away by the fan support we received with the first part of this project. It's so encouraging to know that independent animation fans and consumers can make a project as unlikely and non-commercial as MAD GOD a reality. Your financing facilitates this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision like few have ever attempted.\nABOUT THE PROJECT  \nOver an 12 month period, a small team, under Phil Tippett's direction, will complete another, approximately 15-minute (or more), chapter of the stop-motion/live-action/mixed-media creation called MAD GOD, using hands, tools, molds, clay, toys, garbage, blood, and whatever else we can get our hands on.  \nOnce this chapter is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice (determined by which rewards level is chosen).\nFUNKY ELEGANCE\nAs sound designer Richard Beggs has observed, not much happens in Mad God: Part 1, but there's a LOT going on.  Mad God: Part 2 is larger in scope and scale, and longer than Part 1.  The adventure is building, and we hope you will join us in supporting this creation.  \nREWARDS \nA flat backer contribution of $10 gets you into the \"MAD GOD CLUB,\" with access to view the process on the www.madgodmovie.com website and through exclusive backer-only updates as it unfolds and a copy of the second chapter of the film when it is finished as a digital download. \nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond that, we have a list of fun, premium, rewards available including:\npostcards with art of the film\nDVDs, signed by creator Phil Tippett &\ncustom-created sculptures\nFor More Information, please visit www.madgodmovie.com or email kickstarter@madgodmovie.com\nPRESS ABOUT \"MAD GOD\"\nFangoria Magazine\nCinefex Magazine\nSan Francisco Chronicle\nTested\nI Am Phil Tippett: Dinosaur Supervisor - Ask Me Anything\nHOW YOU CAN HELP\n1) Pledge -- It is only through your support that we can make this a reality.  If we surpass our goal, we will send all backers \"stretch goal\" bonus rewards.\n2) Share -- We need your help to get the word out! Email/ Tweet/ Publish/ or Skywrite about this Kickstarter Project!\nWHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE $ FROM THE FIRST KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN?\nOur original target for Mad God: Part 1 was all of $40,000.  Thanks to All 2533 backers, we blew past that goal and ended up with $123,000!   \nWhile that seems like a nice bonus lump of money, here are some \"actuals\" for what things cost, and why we couldn't \"just make 3 movies\" with the money we raised...  \nThe actual money spent to create part 1 totalled $225,000.  The added $100K was put in by Mr. Phil Tippett, who sold items from his own personal collections and historic film artifacts to invest in this project.  \nthe budget went primarily to:\nFulfilling the rewards (printing, postage, shipping supplies, materials for casting/mounting sculptures, etc)\nDirectly into the production of the project (materials, molds, armatures, paint, etc).\nFees for Amazon and Kickstarter (roughly 9% of the money pledged)\nRent on the studio space being taken over to construct and film\nFood (a volunteer army marches on it's stomach!)\nEvery dollar we raise to and above the target goal will be put on screen. The last campaign was far above what we aimed for, and the result shows all the extra efforts in the detailed sets, environments, and puppets.\nWHAT ARE THE REWARDS?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPart 2 of MAD GOD involves much more post-production than Part 1. As the crew remains primarily volunteers, this could mean delays, but we will do our very best to stay on schedule. \n\nWe are proud to have delivered the (digital delivery of the) finished film as well as the hard-printed rewards for Part 1 on time (per the \"expected delivery\" dates in our first Kickstarter). \n\nWe have learned (from doing this before) how challenging the fulfilling of rewards can be - and we will make every effort to meet our targets to get all backers everything they expect in as timely a fashion as we can produce them.\n\nIt's impossible to guarantee everything will come together exactly as planned, but we are gung-ho about this movie. As Phil says, \"I'm not making this up as I go along. Honestly.\" \n\nYour rewards for helping us make this possible are created and sent out by human beings who have other full-time jobs, and who choose to work on MAD GOD because they believe in it. We do make and attempt to stick to fulfillment schedules, but things do get delayed. When this happens, we will communicate why and for how long. \n\nThis fundraising campaign is all subject to applicable Kickstarter rules/regulations and applicable laws.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Exciting MAD GOD News", "update_content": "Dear Team MAD GOD, \nWe have exciting news to share with you... \nAfter more than 30 years in production, and thanks in EVERY WAY to you, the backers of this project over the past decade, Phil has completed the feature length film version of MAD GOD!

Thank you! Keep up the support and let's hit our next goal soon!\nWait... What are Stretch Goals?\nStretch goals are extra content that we can accomplish if the funding goals are met. For instance, if we hit 200,000, then we will have enough resources to implement a 4 player battle mode! It\u2019s not to say we will won\u2019t see these features in the future some time (don\u2019t be too worried! ), but if we reach the stretch goals, we can promise them with confidence! Here is a description of the stretch goals:\nMusic Player\nSound Test! Adds an in-game music player that lets you listen to all of your favorite Shovel Knight tunes. Collect song scrolls in the levels and take them to the bard, who will play them for you with perfect accuracy! We might even have some special, hidden songs... You\u2019ll also be able to hear all the SFX samples, but we don\u2019t know how the bard does that.\nAchievements\nWe tend to like achievements because they change the way you play the game! This stretch goal will add a bevy of achievements to ALL VERSIONS of the game.  These aren\u2019t just going to be stock achievements; they will be creative and wonderful. Can you beat Shovel Knight without losing a life? Prove it!\nNew Game Plus\nStart the game over with your weapons and items fully upgraded. However\u2026 enemies are going to be tougher, resources more scarce, and new challenges may arise. With new game plus, it\u2019s like a whole new game! Kind of! +!\nPlayable Boss Knight\nPlay the full game as a member of the Order of No Quarter! If we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019ll hold a vote to see who it will be. Expect the game to play differently! For example, Propeller Knight could have the ability to hover for short distances, but would be a low health \u2018glass cannon\u2019 of sorts. Even the story and dialog will change a little bit to reflect the changes!\nLinux / Mac Versions\nWant to play Shovel Knight on your weirdo computer? Many folks have asked for Linux and Mac versions. We hope to support Mac and Linux either way, but this goal makes it happen for sure, and in a more timely fashion (hopefully in 2013!).\nGender Swap Mode!\nWe want Shovel Knight to be enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages, everywhere. With this mode, the main characters\u2019 genders will be swapped, giving us a chance to do it before the internet has a chance to. The story will also change a bit to reflect the changes. Can you defeat the Evil Enchanter?\nChallenge Mode\nAdds a comprehensive batch of challenge rooms  to Shovel Knight. In this mode, Shovel Knight will be tasked with a variety of mini-quests like \u201cdefeat all the enemies!\u201d or \u201creach the goal in time!\u201d. Expect things like pacifism challenges and other rules-benders\u2026 and expect some tough-as-nails challenges too!\n4 Player Battle Mode!*\nWe\u2019ve talked a ton about multiplayer for Shovel Knight. While full-on multiplayer is out of the scope of this project, we could totally do 4 player couch co-op battles! Imagine playing as Shovel Knight ( or any of the extra playable knights ) and duking it out in the arena! Several modes would be ideal:\n\u00b7         Cash collecting, where you fight for treasure that appears in the level. Knock your buddy to make gems fall out and collect them!\n\u00b7         Racing, where all players would have to make their way to the end of a stage\n\u00b7         Last man standing, where the only goal is to slash mercilessly\u2026 to the bitter end!\n*This is couch co-op only, not online. We hope to bring this feature to all platforms, but the 3DS isn\u2019t guaranteed because multiplayer is Wi-Fi only.\nPHYSICAL.ACTUAL.REAL.BOX.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, then we will make a physical box of the game, which will be mailed free to backers pledging at the $50 tier and above! Plus, ALL backers will receive the digital version, to print or view at your leisure. NOTE: This box art is only a mockup. We might have a surprise or two for the final box art! Johnny Vila, your prayers have been answered :P\n3rd Playable Boss Knight!\nCall this goal unoriginal, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re too excited to play as another boss knight! Let\u2019s get to this pledge level and have one more knight (who will be chosen by the community) make the cut! Rally! For the Order of No Quarter!\nAll Bosses Playable in Battle Mode!!\nIf we reach this goal, the entire Order of No Quarter (including the Enchantress herself!) will step into Battle Mode, for the ultimate battle royale. Wild new combat styles abound! Play as your under-appreciated favorite and beat up the more popular knights that got voted into the main campaign!\nShovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old that may remind you of Mega Man, Castlevania, or Dark Souls! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost.\nIf you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, and real heart\u2026 Shovel Knight is for you! If you don\u2019t, then what? How could you not be into that stuff? Keep reading, you\u2019ll come around!\nEvery great game needs a great set of baddies, and Shovel Knight\u2019s are a doozy. Shovel Knight\u2019s Nemesis is The Enchantress, a mysterious and powerful conjurer. Her Order of No Quarter has swept over the land, stationed in locations Shovel Knight is sure to visit. In order to get to the Enchantress, he\u2019s gonna have to beat them all!\nWe love themed bosses and themed levels; this love is on full display in Shovel Knight! Each knight in the Order has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality. These epic boss battles are really going to shine! We already love our villainous bunch, so let us share them with you.\nThis is Polar Knight: the Sabretooth to Shovel Knight\u2019s Wolverine. He\u2019s guarding a stranded ship in the frozen south. Titanic and terrible, he is the largest and most brutish of the Order of No Quarter. Some time in the past, Shovel Knight and Polar Knight have crossed Shovels before...\n\u2022 Pros: Wields Snow Shovel, Doesn't feel cold but is quite considerate!\n\u2022 Cons: Annoying laugh ( it's like water torture )!\nAnd Propeller Knight! He commands the Enchantress' flying machine with the cocksure attitude of a sky pirate! With his Heli-Helmet, he can zoom short distances with ease. Shovel Knight encounters Propeller Knight on top of the aircraft as it zooms through the sky; earth fights against air in a true battle of elements!\n\u2022 Pros: Talented Fencer, Mechanical Heli-Helmet, Debonair!\n\u2022 Cons: Arrogance, Lightweight, Outrageous Accent!\nSometimes, the bomb is mightier than the sword. Deep in the recesses of his alchemical lab, Plague Knight perfects concoctions both poisonous and explosive. Toxin, disease, and death are his playgrounds. Even his comrades give Plague Knight a wide berth, because he spreads more than just the common cold. With an array of mysterious and magical bottles at his side, Plague Knight could be considered the black sheep of The Order of No Quarter.\nPros: Maniacal scientific mind, fearlessness bordering on recklessness\nCons: Physically weak, short stature, shy at parties\nMole Knight... the shovel may rule the confines of man-made gardens, but in the wild, the titan of tunneling is the mole! Mole Knight embraces this truth wholeheartedly. With his modified drop-forged armored claws, he mockingly tears through the earth with brute strength! Mole Knight calls the subterranean Lost City his home... an ancient abandoned metropolis. Shovel Knight must pass through the Lost City, but chances are slim he won\u2019t be challenged to see who is truly the master of digging.\nPros: Great eyesight, shrewd, high endurance\nCons: Obsessive personality, gets sweaty in armor\nTinker Knight! Some knights love rushing into the glory of battle, ready to crush the skulls of their enemies! Tinker Knight is not one of those knights. He does his fighting before the battle begins, laboring on diabolical devices that do his work for him. The wrench is the tool of his trade, doubling as an engineering device and a melee weapon. Some are quick to dismiss Tinker Knight\u2019s lethality... usually just before falling victim to one of his mechanical monstrosities!\nPros: Gregarious demeanor, hard worker\nCons: Rough hands, works long hours, always out to prove himself\nWe\u2019re going to be sharing more of the Order of No Quarter as the Kickstarter proceeds, so check in often!\nShovel Knight is rendered in a pumped-up 8-bit style. We are adhering to the NES color palette, but adding many modern touches. For example, We have tons of scrolling background layers, giving a real illusion of depth.\nOur pixel animation and attention to detail is top-notch. Every character, even minor foes like these wizards, have painstakingly crafted animations and personalities.\nDetailed, living backgrounds and animation! Big, beautiful pixels! Just look at the screens!! With Shovel Knight, we are developing a next-gen 8 bit game!\nLike all of our favorite games, Shovel Knight has been designed gameplay first! We are especially dedicated to precise control. Pixel-perfect hit boxes, toenail jumps, and mobility mastery are our obsession. That wonderfully elusive 'feel' of great control.\nWhen thinking of the initial concept, we started by saying \u201cwhat if we built a whole game around a downward sword thrust? It would be great to sink into dirt, attack foes by stabbing from above, and maybe even bounce on hard ground! Ok, digging as a major mechanic\u2026 how about it\u2019s a shovel instead of a sword? That way, we can have him use the flat blade of the spade to flip things over and slash!\u201d\nFrom that gameplay concept sprung all of the ideas for Shovel Knight. We've learned from games like Mother 3 that a game becomes much stronger when graphics, story and tone work together to unify the gameplay experience!\nGreat music is central to great games, so it\u2019s with incredible excitement that we can announce that Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman is composing the soundtrack for Shovel Knight! For those of you who don\u2019t know, Jake is one of the most talented audio guys in the game biz, contributing on games from Mighty Switch Force to Contra 4 to Shantae. His most recent work on Double Dragon Neon has garnered as much praise as the game itself!\nNugget love\nTrue to our sense of collaboration, our team likes to involve audio early and often in development. For Shovel Knight\u2019s music, we\u2019re taking an NES+ style approach, adding sound channels and detail for a fuller sound that\u2019s still authentic. In addition to the main theme highlighted in the trailer, check out the track written for Pridemoor Keep, the level we\u2019ll be debuting at PAX!\nIf you liked that, you should just go listen to everything on his website (virt.bandcamp.com) because it\u2019s amazing. And check out the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack Album backer reward below! WE LOVE JAKE! \nYacht Club Games is an independent game developer started in 2011 by Sean Velasco and a crew from WayForward. We are a fun-loving bunch of gaming geniuses who have dedicated our lives to video games ever since we saw our first pixels. However, our serious and solemn goal is to make really awesome original games that fuse modern and retro sensibilities, and we have the pedigree to prove it! Our team is comprised of top talent that has worked on some amazing titles, including Contra 4, A Boy and His Blob, Thor: God of Thunder, Mighty Milky Way, BloodRayne Betrayal, and most recently, Double Dragon Neon.This is our maiden project as Yacht Club Games, which means we are determined to impress.\nSo what are we all about? We want to create fun and challenging gameplay. We want to both tug at your heartstrings and delight you with levity and charm. We want to make games that you play together with friends and family. Most of all, we want to give everyone the same collective types of game experiences that have defined our generation. It\u2019s such an exciting time to be a fan of games; the industry is experiencing a renaissance and creativity is flourishing. We are so, so excited to develop games that we love, in hopes that you love them too!\nShovel Knight is currently nearing the end of preproduction. This means that the game design has been written, the main character designs and story have been created, and we have a plan for moving forward. We have an early build of the game that proves out our game mechanics and technology; you can see some footage in the trailer and we'll also be at PAX East!\nHowever, many things are still up in the air. Enemies and objects need to be designed and drawn. Audio, Animation, and Backgrounds need to be crafted. Lastly, we need to polish everything to a mirror sheen. Basically, we have what you saw in the video. Now we need to make the whole game.\nSo, we think this is a great time in the process to involve the community. We have a skeleton to build on, but we want you to be the meat!\nVideo games are expensive and time-consuming to develop, so the usual way to get one made is to acquire funding from a publisher. We have had great partnerships with publishers in the past. However, working with a publisher has its drawbacks; you are beholden to them, and they are generally risk averse. We wanted to go to the community, because Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where fun and quality are always the top priorities.\nWe believe in Shovel Knight. We know that the final game is going to be great. We\u2019re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We\u2019ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it\u2019s not enough to finish the game. In order to make Shovel Knight a reality, we need you!\nWe have amazing rewards that we are as excited to give out as we are to make! Check \u2018em out below!\nThe Game!\nGet a digital PC copy ( PC, LINUX, MAC, STEAM ) of Shovel Knight, hot off the digital presses! Digital!\nAlso, ALL pledge levels $15 and above will be able to choose on which platform they want their stalwart blue hero!!!\nInstruction Booklet\nThe final Instruction book will have illustrations, not sketches!\nAh, the Instruction Booklet\u2026 the comfort food of books. We still have a few of our favorites, the pages worn and cramped with notes. Together with you, we can bring the lost art of instruction booklets back to the limelight! The Shovel Knight Instruction Booklet is full of important safety information, awesome character art, enemy lists, hints, and space for notes. We are taking the utmost care to make sure that these booklets are true to their predecessors, right down to the way they smell.\nWe want the kids of today to feel the excitement of reading the booklet in eager anticipation of the game\u2019s release, so we are going to send you the booklet FIRST, so you can read it and reread it, and go crazy with anticipation!\nShovel Knight Coffee Table Book\nThis is a Book of the Game! The goal is to make something fun and funny, an entertaining compendium of the whole Shovel Knight production. Design Discussions and sketches! Concept Art and Illustrations! Game Maps, pixel animation sequences, and work-in-progress versions of everything! As we develop Shovel Knight, we\u2019ll be chronicling the process and we want to put it all here on display. As a crazy indie startup, you know there is going to be a lot of juicy stuff!\nShovel Knight Official Soundtrack\nWe already told you how awesome Jake Kaufman's music is. Hopefully you are thinking that Shovel Knight is looking pretty awesome too. Well, now you can own the combined awesome with this pressing of the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack! Laid delicately into a bejeweled case, this CD and accompanying liner notes will be adorned lovingly with customized art. This is what you want. It\u2019s what we want! It\u2019s what we all want!!\nOfficial Shovel Knight Dirt Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is the best product photo ever, bwahaha!\nOwn a real piece of the Shovel Knight Saga! At this reward level, we will hand-sign and deliver a handsome, wax-sealed envelope filled with Official Shovel Knight Dirt. We have obtained dirt ( at no small expense, mind you! ) from each area of Shovel Knight\u2019s Kingdom; Gearwork Dirt from the base of the Clockwork Tower, Besmirched Dirt from the Village of Plague, and more! The dirt you receive will be chosen at random, but trust us when we say that all of the dirt is very special. Get it fast, because when it runs out, it\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not made out of dirt here!\nDesign Hangouts\nNow you can take part in our design process! We will be broadcasting on a private video channel available only to our beloved Kickstarter backers! You can be a fly on the wall and listen to us as we hash out the finer details of the design and work through problems, or you can jump in and tell us what to do! There is no guarantee we will listen, but many can attest to our receptiveness to ridiculous ideas. Budding game designers, armchair directors, and trolls can all have lots of fun!\nOriginal Concept Art / Game Design Card\nSuper Design Index Cards!\nThe Yacht Club loves index cards: we use them to quickly communicate ideas! Puzzle setups, boss patterns, and sketches of new enemies; they are hastily scribbled onto cards and passed around! It\u2019s completely awesome, and it also means that by the end of a project, we have a lot of really cool index cards lying around. We are going to send you an original one of these cards! You can specify if you want a design card or an art card. Maybe you\u2019ll get the very first sketch of an enemy that's in the final game!\nYour Likeness In the Game\nAppease your ego by having us painstakingly hand-craft a pixel version of you, which will appear somewhere in Shovel Knight. Send us a photo and we will recreate you in 8-bits and immortalize you forever\u2026 but where will you appear in the game? We know where we are going to put you, but it\u2019s a secret for now!\nSuperDeluxe Canvas Poster Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is a really super high-quality 24x36 poster, signed by the team and sent to you. Suitable for framing ( you had better frame it! ), this poster will feature the classiest art we have by the end of the project.\nDirector For A Day!!\nAs Director for a day, you will get to design a major character, boss, midboss, or scenario. We\u2019ll take you through the whole process from conception to completion, helping massage your design into the game with probably hilarious results! Check out the details below! NOTE: ( Actual implementation time may be longer than one day )\nYacht Club Sleepover!\nCome to sunny Southern California ( or if you are already here, just drive over to us ) to meet and spend the day with the Yacht Club! We\u2019ll do a studio tour, get a fancy meal (or drive-through if you don\u2019t have a collared shirt, but you can order whatever you want and we'll get like a whole extra bag of hot sauce), and then go back and play games for as long as we can stay up! Maybe we could also wear our jammies and talk about who we have a crush on! Oh, or if you would rather not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026 we\u2019ll take our cues from you I guess.\nYacht Party with the Yacht Club\nIf there is anything the Yacht Club loves as much as making games, it\u2019s partying hard to celebrate a game launch. At this reward level, you will join us in SoCal with other Yacht Club superfriends on an hours-long voyage in celebration of Shovel Knight\u2019s release! All of this is going to be on a Real Yacht on the Real Ocean, which we will be renting for the occasion ( the yacht, not the ocean ).\nListen as we regale you with tales of the game dev trenches! Stumble about as you try to get your sea legs! Sing karaoke and be merry, because tonight, my friend, we are all superstars!\nDid I mention our special musical guest Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman, who is going to play live?\nIt\u2019s gonna be epic as hell. You should totally come.\nFollow us on Facebook! If you'd like to support us, liking and sharing us would be very appreciated!\nFollow us on Twitter! We always have something dumb to say!\nWatch our YouTubes! New videos and other excitement will be posted here.\nHelp us get on Steam! We need your votes!\nLastly, if you want to reach out to us for ANYTHING, hit us up at: kickstarter@yachtclubgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking great video games is hard. Like, really hard! Art, design, and technology have to be blended seamlessly to create a cohesive experience. On top of that, it takes time to iterate and expand on ideas. There is a reason lots of awesome games take forever to come out!\n The biggest risk is that Shovel Knight would take longer than anticipated. If production were to go late, cash would be the biggest problem. If catastrophe truly struck, our backup plan would be to pool our remaining funds and partner with venture capitalist or publisher to get the game done.

It is extremely low budget, and relatively high concept. How is a story of space warfare between two high-technology civilizations to be achieved, doing justice to its original, on a super-low budget?\nPartially because most of the work will be done by students -- ideally my production students at the University of Colorado (you can see samples of their extraordinary work here) -- under the occasional supervision of professionals from the industry. But mainly because Harry Harrison's original novel - his counterblast to STAR$HIP TROOPERS - has to be made this way. It's told not from the flight deck but from the engine room: or to be more exact, the fusebays, where ranks of expendable Fusetenders Sixth Class wait to replace burned-out fuses, or die.\nProduction Artwork\nHarry's story of grunts - and one grunt in particular - in the lowest echelon of the war machine - can readily be recreated in an academic environment. ATLAS, home of the University of Colorado's Film Studies Program, features concrete staircases and windowless basement corridors which already resemble the corridors and fusebays of the Good Ship Fanny Hill. The Visual Arts Complex features asymmetrical hallways and strange machines. Tunnels beneath the campus provide us with the bowels of Helior, the Imperial Planet. The Engineering Dept. has space suits and a mock-up Space Shuttle replacement.\nNCAR\nBut no one location is essential to the picture! Bill's one trip \"above ground\" to Helior's Walled Gardens, can be recreated at a venue like the NCAR (seen above - and also featured in the sf comedy Sleeper).\nProf. Dave Klaus dresses me in one of our costumes\nVeniola, the swamp planet, where Bill is sent to a penal colony, will be shot in an appropriately green location.\nSome sixty pages of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be shot live action, with space-suited actors, on 35mm black and white film. About ten pages will be shot on a stage using front or rear projection.\nPurple Dart with Coal-sack Nebula Cluster\nThere are about ten (overlapping) pages of model shots and special effects, including glimpses of the Voids of Space. We will build our own models, under the supervision of visual effects pros from Tippett Studios (ROBOCOP, STARSHIP TROOPERS, MAD GOD) and Collateral Image (who created the visual effects for REPO CHICK and STRAIGHT TO HELL RETURNS). My colleague Victor Jendras will, I hope, supervise the creation of the medals, and the production design.\nBILL THE GALACTIC HERO begins and ends as an animated cartoon. The anime department, run, I hope, by my colleague Chris Pearce, will also create Eager Chinger, the tiny reptilian spy.\nThe live action - actors in space suits in staircases, sound stages, and swamps - can be accomplished within twenty days. But the \"VFX\" part of the project does not unfold quickly. This is an old-fashioned science fiction film of the technological level of ICARUS XB1: it will use real models, and matte shots.\nSpacesuit sketches\nSince we're outputting a digital version of the film - your DVD or BluRay disc, or download - post production will involve some CGI - computer generated images. How else to achieve our ray gun blasts, or interplanetary lasers? But we aim to keep our technology rooted in the mid 1960s, when the greatest of all science fiction films (DR STRANGELOVE, ICARUS, and 2001) were made with three-dimensional analog models, and when Harry Harrison conceived and wrote BILL THE GALACTIC HERO.\nOur model-building, plate-shooting and costume work will be done this fall The main shoot of BILL THE GALACTIC HERO will be in early spring. But post-production will take longer than that! One of the things I try to teach my students is the \"impossible triangle of quality\": the one whereby any manufactured item - including a film - can be made good, and fast, but not cheap; fast, and cheap, but not good; or good, and cheap, but not fast. A quality independent film aims for the last of these three. We will endeavor to post a rough cut - viewable with a unique download key - in the Summer of 2014, and to ship the more important costumes and models when we're sure they aren't needed. BILL THE GALACTIC HERO - its sound design and music under the supervision of Academy Award winner Richard Beggs and film composer Dan Wool - will be finished by December 2014.\nHonorable Enlistment Award\nBILL UPDATE #1 - STARSHIP TROOPERS PRODUCER JOINS UP!\nWhat a pleasure to report that Jon Davison has signed up both as a project backer and to come and supervise BILL's preproduction, here in Boulder. Jon and I first worked together on a project called WAR BABY (unmade); for years we struggled with our own original version of MARS ATTACKS! (unmade also). We finally managed to make a film in 2007 -- SEARCHERS 2.0. So this will (I hope) be our second successful collaboration! Jon has even refused to accept money for gas. He will drive here from Telluride in the fall and guide us as we set up our production plan.\nBoss Jon Davison and team, on the set of Searchers 2.0\n(That's Jon in the dead centre of the above photograph, against a magnificent backdrop of buttes.) I remember talking to him on the phone as he was leaving Hollywood for STARSHIP TROOPERS' location shoot in Wyoming -- at the head of the biggest convoy of grip and electrical equipment trucks the industry had ever seen. Far from the grandeur of leading his wagon train, he will be welcome at our humble campfire.\nThanks for reading this -- and please, if you can, support this authentically independent independent film! I shall be grateful for your backing at any level, and look forward to sharing the details of BILL's progress with you as the film unfolds. Only backers will know the true and grisly details of this production. Only with your support, can BILL be made!\nForward to Victory Starburst, designed by Victor Jendras", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks associated with any film project are two-fold: that the film may not be completed. and that the film will be bad. The first of these risks is minimal: a filmmaker's reputation depends on his or her ability to deliver a finished film; all the features I've directed have been completed and distributed, in theaters, on television, or on DVD. The schedule we've established for BILL gives us the lengthy post-production period which a good science fiction film needs (and which the panicked schedules of contemporary Hollywood no longer permit).\n\nThe danger of making a bad film is always there! In the project's favor is the original material - Harry Harrison's amazing book - and the screenplay, which Harry and I were working on when he died, and which is available for your perusal as a $10 Kickstarter reward. The risk-averse might also worry about the budget, which is by Hollywood standards amazingly low. But I'm used to making low-budget pictures: you might want to check out my book, X Films, which deals with ten features I directed, and goes into detail as to the budgets and how they were spent. \n\nRaising our funding now gives us plenty of time to buy film stock, buy and doctor our costumes, and prepare for a fall/spring shoot. I'm confident in the talents of student crews and actors -- and my confidence is reinforced because professionals I've worked with many times will also be around to keep things up to our usual exacting standards!\n\nCould BILL, THE GALACTIC HERO run late? Given our decent post-production period this seems unlikely. Will fulfillment of the rewards be delayed? Highly unlikely. Once the shoot is officially over we can release the leads' spacesuits and regalia. When the visual effects photography is done we can release the spacecraft and refreshment robots.

Having it based on Monte Cook's Numenera makes me want to play it even sooner \u2013 so make it now, guys!\"\n- Feargus Urquhart, CEO, Obsidian Entertainment; formerly president of Black Isle Studios\n\"I have a lot of respect for the folks [on the Torment team] and I've worked with many of them, including Kevin, Brian, Colin, Adam, and more, across several projects and across several companies, including Interplay, Obsidian, and more recently inXile on Wasteland 2. I believe they'll do Torment with the right aesthetic and justice it deserves.\"\n- Chris Avellone, Creative Director, Obsidian Entertainment; lead designer of Planescape: Torment\n\"10K. Mostly because awesome.\"\n- Markus \"Notch\" Persson, creator of Minecraft and owner of Mojang, on his pledge to Torment: Tides of Numenera\nTorment's Four Pillars\nFour pillars undergird the Torment name and, despite all the shake we'll do of RPG conventions, we'll stay true to these throughout the development of Torment: Tides of Numenera.\nA Deep, Thematically Satisfying Story. The philosophical underpinnings of Torment drive the game, both mechanically and narratively. Your words, choices, and actions will be your primary weapons.\nA World Unlike Any Other. The game has a fantastic, original setting, with awe-inspiring painterly visuals, imaginative locations, truly offbeat items, and massive feats of magic. In Numenera, however, \u201cmagic\u201d is actually something surprisingly different.\nA Rich, Personal Narrative. The story is thoughtful and character-driven\u2014epic in feel but a deeply personal narrative, with nontraditional characters and companions who have their own motivations and desires that drive them throughout the game.\nReactivity, Choice, and Real Consequences. The game emphasizes replayability and reactivity, and your choices will make a real difference. You can play the game with a different approach and discover entirely new pathways. Most important, we won\u2019t tell you how to play. The best ending is the one you choose, flowing naturally from your actions throughout the game.\nClick this header to learn more about our story at our tumblr site\nThe original Torment was a novel experience, a genre-defying game that helped redefine what was possible in RPG storytelling. We mentioned our Four Pillars above, and describe them in greater detail at our tumblr site.\nHere\u2019s a brief summary of our story:\n\nYou are the Last Castoff, the final link in the chain of the lives of the being they call the Changing God. He once was a man who discovered a way to use the relics of the ancients to cheat death and skip across the face of centuries in a succession of bodies. But he never knew that his bodies lived on as his consciousness fled, a new consciousness arising in each. Now he has awakened an age-old enemy, the Angel of Entropy, and his days of change are gone as the Angel hunts him and all his works. That includes... you.\n\nWith the ever-present threat of oblivion looming over you, you must find your sire before he\u2014and you\u2014are eradicated by the avenging Angel. You will find allies and enemies among the other castoffs. You might inhabit their minds for a time through the devices called \u201cthe Meres,\u201d turning their lives to your advantage. You will travel across the face of the Ninth World, and above and below it, with your companions at your side\u2014or alone, if you wish. Your quest will take you to alternate dimensions and distant worlds under strange suns; particular Meres might afford you even more bizarre experiences, such as folding time itself. And you will build your legacy as you find your answer to the question:\n\nWhat does one life matter?\nSojourner of Worlds (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about gameplay at our tumblr site\nTorment will have a strong emphasis on story and character development, which will permeate other facets of gameplay, such as combat and exploration. The Ninth World is a place of great mystery and wonder, all waiting to be discovered. To read more details of our gameplay plans, including information on Combat, Dialogue, and Companions, please visit our tumblr site.\nYou'll play the role of a specific individual. At the game\u2019s start, however, you are a blank slate and have control over the path you take through the story, and you will also make choices to customize your abilities and skills. We\u2019re taking the approach of having you role-play a specific individual so that we can focus on telling a very personal tale \u2013 yours.\nDust and Water (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nWhat Are the Tides?\nThere are unseen forces in the Ninth World, forces that have profound and lasting effects for those attuned to their motions. Like gravity or magnetism, the Tides are invisible, powerful, and with the right tools, perhaps controllable.\nThe Tides represent complicated concepts that aren't entirely definable by language. Those who acknowledge the Tides have given them symbolic colors based on how they appear to correspond with emotional and psychological reactions. For example:\nThe Tides reflect your choices, the subtle currents of motivation that ripple through your life.\nThe colors are important, because a word like \"justice\" (for example) is too simplistic. The Indigo Tide represents not only justice and fairness; it might also mean a desire for the greater good or an \"end justifies the means\" mentality. The Gold Tide can represent false philanthropy as well as martyrdom\u2014it's the actions that matter, not the motivations. In the game, the Tides serve as a kind of alignment system\u2014but a more nuanced one, and one that does not judge actions based on whether they are good or evil. You'll learn more about the Tides as you explore Torment. And the Tides will gradually change based on your actions and decisions, ultimately determining your Legacy.\nWhat Do You Mean by My Legacy?\nThere's your legacy, the stories others tell about you and the inspirations they find in your life, and your Legacy, which we're systematizing here. Your Legacy is determined by which Tides you manipulate the most. Do you use your wisdom to help others? Do you seek power for the greater good? Maybe you're an avenger, taking whatever action is necessary to aid those around you. Perhaps you're just in it for the prestige. (Or money. People are always in it for the money.) As your choices move the Tides, your Legacy will be revealed.\nYour Legacy also influences the world around you. Weapons and relics may have different bonuses for characters with certain Legacies. Some of them might respond positively if you've revealed yourself to be a thinker or an artist, while others might help you only if you're moved by passion and power.\nYour Legacy opens new potential abilities. Some Legacies can change the very structure of your body, giving you superhuman powers: the ability to read the past in the minds of the dead, for instance, or a nearly supernatural affinity with weapons.\nSagus Cliffs at Dawn (by Chang Yuan)\nClick this header to learn more about our team at our tumblr site\nTorment is being developed by inXile entertainment, a mid-sized independent game developer located in Newport Beach, CA. inXile was founded by Brian Fargo in 2002 and is best known for its action-RPG The Bard\u2019s Tale. The Android version of that game was released in fall 2012, topping the charts and winning several awards. \nWith inXile, Brian has embraced the crowdfunding approach. He is a vocal advocate of circumventing the traditional publisher-developer business model, with developers instead communicating and working directly with the players.\nOur experience with crowd funding has been wonderfully positive for us at inXile and has opened our eyes to the power of a direct relationship with the gamers. We want to create RPGs in a fashion and style that helped to make the true classics. And along these lines we've abandoned the typical developer/publisher model and placed our future in the hands of RPG gamers. We've embraced the crowd in every aspect. YOU are our publisher...and you are the best publisher we've ever worked with!\nThis process allows us to create the games exactly the way you want to see them. There is a purity of development when we can spend 100% of our efforts making the game with an open dialogue throughout the process. We'll start with a strong vision document that details our sensibilities, and from there we'll stay in sync with you, from concept through the execution of the ideas.\nWe've discovered that the best way to create a deep and rich RPG is to begin the pre-production process long before the production team have finished their current project. If we waited to begin the design work for a large scale RPG until after the programming team has completed their work, our budget would increase by 50% or more.  This would result in the hiring and firing process that happens all too often in our industry. We want to break that model and keep our great team together. This is why it makes sense for us to begin work on Torment now rather than later. The process has served us well in the past and allows us to bring you the best RPGs. If you have any concerns about our ability to deliver a great one, we encourage you to review our first look video of Wasteland 2 that was released just a few weeks ago.\nWe're grateful for all the support and look forward to bringing you the kind of role-playing games that we all love to play.\nWith Torment, Brian pledged to personally add $100k to the project if we reached the $900,000 goal but fell short of a million. And if funding beat $1 million, he pledged to instead contribute 10 cents from every $1 pledged from the $1 million to $2 million mark. Brian is thus kicking in $100K of his own (this is not reflected in the Kickstarter total and all will be applied directly to the development budget). Torment superfan Steve Dengler (@Dracogen) picked up the torch when we reached $2M, matching 10% of every donation from $2 to $3 million, and thus also putting in $100K of his own. These matches will be added post-Kickstarter to help offset failed pledges, and do not count towards stretch goals.\nThis product is participating in Brian Fargo\u2019s Kicking It Forward initiative, promising to pledge 5% of its post-release profit to other Kickstarter projects. We are proud to join the over 200 successfully funded Kickstarter projects whose founders share Brian\u2019s vision of supporting the independent efforts of others.\nThe Ascension of Kex-Lianish (by Andr\u00e9e Wallin)\nBy pledging at an amount above the Tier you have selected, you can include Add-Ons.

Fortunately, we collectively have more than 80 years of experience in managing them. Given our great progress in developing Wasteland 2, our experience with the technology, and our approach to Torment\u2019s design and production, we are confident in our ability to provide our backers with a quality game deserving of the Torment name.\n\nTorment\u2019s schedule has been designed to maximize both planning (preproduction) and polishing. This extended preproduction period controls costs and increases quality because we\u2019ll have a very well-defined product before production begins. Our target release date of December 2014 allows us 14 months for production and finalization. (In comparison, Wasteland 2 had 12 months, and Mask of the Betrayer had nine.) Furthermore, various systems and tools developed for Wasteland 2 will be used or adapted for Torment, saving development time and budget.\n\nWith a longer schedule, you might wonder how we\u2019ll be able to create Torment if it receives less funding than Wasteland 2 did. First, Torment's story is being designed to be highly modular and scalable. This approach not only lets us increase game reactivity and replayability, but it also let us keep the game's scope flexible. At our target funding, we\u2019ll be able to deliver a complete and satisfying game and as funding increases above the target, Torment will continue to grow in depth and size. But, as resources allow \u2013 if Wasteland 2 is a commercial success, for example \u2013 we are ready to expand the modular story. \n\nAlso, inXile has established secondary revenue streams that will bolster Torment\u2019s development budget. For example, last September, The Bard\u2019s Tale was released on Android, winning many awards and selling hundreds of thousands of copies in just a few months. While this doesn\u2019t provide enough money to create a game like Torment, it lets us invest in Wasteland 2 and Torment to improve their quality. Although Torment would not be possible without your support, we are self-funding a portion of the game as well.

People who make content learn to like it, because they want to make content, and they also want to eat food and sleep under a roof, and the opportunity to do both at the same time seems like a pretty good idea. \nAfter the \"dot com bubble,\" we ran the site entirely on donations for over a year. The word crowdfunding hadn't been invented yet; back then, people simply called it \"begging,\" but I think it's clear that those days are long past. We look back on that period with incredible fondness, and I don't think we're the only ones. It was just two of us then, not the juggernaut that it is now; we have mouths to feed, as it were. I think we had assumed it wasn't possible to do it that way anymore - to operate a site at this scale without advertising dollars - but it occurred to us that we'd never actually asked. People often want to know how they can support the site in a way that doesn't involve t-shirts or looking at advertising, and I think we may have a way. What I'm saying is that we want to sell out, and we would love to sell out to you. \nHow Do You Intend To Do That\nBy doing this. \nLeaderboard Ad Removed, $250k Goal\nThat's for the amount you see on the right. If it turns out to be something people want to see, or not see as the case may be, we'll add stretch goals to restore old services we used to offer, convert the entire site to a Creative Commons license, and ultimately remove every ad from the site for an entire year. We intend to be a company that succeeds by making things, specifically things for you, and are orienting ourselves toward that goal. \nAll ads on homepage removed. $525k goal\nSo, we're turning to you. Would scouring ads from Penny Arcade, with everything that entails, be something you\u2019d be willing to reach into your pocket for? The more we considered it, the more we agreed it might just be. Not only would you no longer have to look at advertising when browsing Penny Arcade, but not having ads would create a chain reaction that would lead to a bunch of other interesting stuff. Without the almighty \"pageview\" to consider, why not populate the RSS with full comics and posts? Why not enable and even encourage apps, first and third party, for people to read it however they damn well please?\nThat seems pretty compelling to us, but in keeping with Kickstarter tradition we\u2019ve greased the wheels with a buffet of backer rewards and stretch goals. This is an amazing experiment in our opinion. If it doesn\u2019t work Penny Arcade will be fine. We\u2019ll keep going just like before with no interruption in service and nothing will change. But if it did work, I mean, wow.\n\nThat would be something. \nStretchgoals:\nUpdate #1: $550k Stretchgoal\nOne of the things that excited us most about the idea of trying an ad-free model was the amount of time it would give us to actually make comics. Currently, we do all kinds of creative services projects that are part of the existing model, but in their absence, that's all time we can put to work for you. We have a ton of weird settings, and ideas for more, that are simply not possible with the schedule the current system imposes. What we're talking about would be new projects, in settings you already like, that run ALONGSIDE the week's comics, not in their place. Like, oh, I don't know... THIS?!?\nWe have quite a year planned, if you're game.\nCW(TB)\n-----\nUpdate #2: $325k Stretchgoal\nAdditional Revelations! \nWe're just revealing things right and left around here. It would be our great pleasure to acquaint you with Automata: Silverside in lieu of our typical \"creative services\" work. The first of these projects unlocks at $325,000, and we're chomping at the bit. Or champing at it; I can never remember if you chomp or champ. In any case, there won't be anything left of this bit by the time we're done. We're going crazy on it!\n(CW)TB\n-----\nUpdate #4: Penny Arcade Leaderboard Stretch Goal Unlocked! Stretchgoals up to $999k revealed.\nIt's unbelievable, but the campaign has reached our first funding goal of $250k in four days. We've been blown away by the support thus far, and the interest from people outside the industry makes us think we might be on to something here.\nAs promised, we are revealing the stretch goals up to $999k ... behold! (check out the updated list up top!) The new goals we've revealed are:  \nJerry Cosplay: Jerry has agreed to Cosplay as the character of the community's choice (by vote) for one day at both PAX East 2013 and PAX Prime 2013. \nStrip Search Web Show: Discussed in a flurry of tweets, Penny Arcade: The Series Season 4 will be our version of America's Next Top Webcomic titled... STRIP SEARCH. This incredibly ambitious and expensive production will bring together over 10 up and coming webcomic hopefuls for a week of grueling challenges and horrifying social experiments, hosted by Mike and Jerry. For what? A considerable cash prize and integration into the Penny Arcade offices for one year. \nTwisp & Catsby Children's Book (free online): Mike and Jerry will create and publish online (for free) a Twisp & Catsby Children's Book. \nOriginal Tabletop Adventure: Mike and Jerry will write a completely original tabletop adventure, not tied to any particular system, to be released for free. \nFree PA Comic Reader developed for iOS and Android \nPA Blanks/Creative Common License: We will release, with each Monday, Wednesday and Friday strip, a blank version of the comic (art without word balloons) for your editing and remixing enjoyment. In addition, we will open the ENTIRE PA archive to a Creative Common License under CC BY-NC-SA. \n-----\nUpdate #5: Automata Project Unlocked, More Lookouts Info, Comic Sketch Reward and Additional Q&As!\nWe\u2019ve just crossed the $325,000 mark, meaning the Automata strip for 2013 is LOCKED IN. As a teaser, Mike created this image to give you an idea of what\u2019s in in store:\nOur next goal is to make Jerry cosplay as whatever you want him to, which for those in the office is VERY EXCITING. If that goal is met, we\u2019ll first open submissions via an online survey, and then select the top 5 choices by raw #s. From there, we\u2019ll have another online vote-off.\n\nLooking down a bit further on the stretch goal list, Jerry also wrote this piece to go along with a new sketch by Mike for the Lookouts, Daughters of Eyrewood:\n\ndaughter, daughter,\nkilled her father\nlook at what her\nblood has bought her \nNew Reward - Original Comic Pencil Sketch\nThis isn\u2019t a reward you\u2019ll find on the right side but is actually one that applies to ANYONE that contributes more than $2,500. You will receive in the mail, one of the original pencil sketches from the Penny Arcade archives (and for those donating $5k, you\u2019ll receive two, and so on). \nThese sketches are what are scanned in and digitally inked, so each online strip has ONE pencil sketch associated with it. These are the ORIGINALS. (please note, the strip you receive will be at random) Since Mike no longer does the pencil sketches ahead of time, this part in the process no longer exists making these extra rare.\nWe've also updated the FAQ with some additional questions. Please check them out below!\n-----\nUpdate #6: $350k reached, new rewards added!\nWe crossed the $350,000 mark over the weekend, so it looks like this thing has some legs. After listening to a ton of feedback, we have a few more rewards that may interest you!\n\nPrecipice Promotional 1 GB Flash Drives - $250 (30 available)\nWhen we made Precipice of Darkness, Episode 1, we had manufactured 50 USB Credit Card drives (seen here) for media kits, etc. With this reward level you\u2019ll receive this Flash Drive in the mail filled with the digital versions of Books 1 and 2 and the remastered Jerry tracks! We have two versions of the drive (Gabe and Tycho) \u2013 which you receive will be picked at random. Add $10 for International addresses.\n1 lb of Jerry\u2019s Coffee Roast - $300 (10 available)\nJerry will ship to you a one pound bag of his signature coffee beans that he roasts himself. Add $10 for International addresses.\n\nLogo Design by PA Design - $1500 (10 available)\nGive Kiko and Erika the name of your company and a synopsis of what exactly it is you do, and delivered to you will be the one-colour AI/PDF/PSD files for your further manipulation. This is the team that designed the PAX Logo, the Trenches Logo, the Child\u2019s Play logo, etc.\n\nBrew with Jerry - $2500 (4 available)\nIt\u2019s no secret Jerry loves brewing, and this reward gives you the opportunity to brew with Jerry in Seattle. You only need to handle your transportation, and Jerry will take care of the rest. Must be 21 or older.\n\nPing Pong. Your Team vs. Team Inferno - $5000 (1 available)\nInvite you and up to 9 of your friends for an officially sanctioned match against Team Inferno in Seattle, WA.

You just need to handle transportation.\n\nPA will crash your birthday party - $5000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry and possibly some other people will crash your party and totally eat all of your food and drink everything in your fridge. Must be in the Seattle area.\n\nKhoo will plan your bachelor party - $7500 (1 available)\nThis is for planning and day-of execution only. Robert Khoo will take whatever your pre-determined budget is and plan a\u2026 uh\u2026 experience for you and your friends. A more detailed description to this reward would be against the code. See PA:TS S02E28 for reference.\n\nMike and Jerry DM - $8000 (1 available)\nMike and Jerry will be your DM for you and 3 of your friends, running an adventure just for you. You just need to handle transportation to Seattle.\nWe\u2019ve also been getting some really interesting ideas for stretchgoals from readers \u2013 if you want to suggest some before we announce our next set of them, send an email to ks@penny-arcade.com. Thanks!\n-----\nUpdate #8: The Final Cosplay Vote + More details on Strip Search\n(Note: Skipped #7 since it was just the initial cosplay vote)\nWe've crossed the $375k mark, meaning Jerry is on the hook for cosplaying as the character of your choice. We did open submissions in Update #7, and after over 15,000 suggestions, here are the top 5 to vote on:\n\n1. Bayonetta\n2. Sailor Moon\n3. The Fruit Fucker\n4. Tycho\n5. Yummy Chan\n\nHonorable mentions go to Strawberry Shortcake and Lollipop Chainsaw. ;)\n\nAlright, vote here!\n\nGabe also just posted an update on Penny Arcade about Strip Search, but you can read it here as well:\n\nI admit to being a huge fan of reality tv style game shows. I love shows like So You Think You Can Dance, Hell\u2019s Kitchen, and Master Chef. I even watch shows like Ink Master and Shear Genius. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s singers, chefs, fashion designers or gardeners. I love watching groups of people pushed together to compete at something they are good at. I don\u2019t know a thing about cooking or dancing but I can\u2019t get enough of these game shows. I\u2019m always amazed when the challenge is something like \u201cmake a fruit tart\u201d and one guy says \u201cshit I\u2019ve never made a fruit tart before\u201d and then he proceeds to make a fucking fruit tart. I could never do that and maybe that\u2019s why I love watching it so much. Could you pull a theme out of a hat and then write and draw a comic strip about it? Probably not, but I\u2019m guessing you might like to watch people who can.\n\nThat\u2019s the idea for our new show Strip Search. It is the next goal in our Kickstarter and It is a reality game show for web cartoonists. Like any of these other shows I mentioned it is about watching incredibly talented people face off in a competition with a reward that could change their life.\nIn the case of Strip Search we are talking about ten people. Each one of them a talented cartoonist. They will all live together in a house here in Seattle. They will compete in a series of challenges that will test their skills and we will slowly whittle them down until we are left with one winner. This cartoonist will win a cash prize along with integration into the Penny Arcade machine. That means a studio in our office but it also means access to our business people, our merchandising operation, our designers, and our ping pong table. The winner will get plugged into the Penny Arcade family for one year. We will not own any of their work, and there will be no evil contract to sign. We will just be there to support them and help grow their comic in a way that very few other organizations could.\n\nTycho and I will be the hosts and participate in the judging but we won\u2019t be alone. We are very lucky to have friends in every corner of the industry from syndicated newspaper comics to book publishers, and web comic pioneers. We\u2019ll be bringing these folks in as guest judges and mentors throughout the competition. You\u2019ll also see everyone here in the office working with these contestants. It\u2019s a huge undertaking for us but incredibly exciting I think.\nThere is something magical about watching a comic strip come together. I think Strip Search is a show that could appeal to a much bigger audience than anything we\u2019ve done before on PATV. So if you could help us get the word out I\u2019d appreciate it. Tell your friends who like reality TV and tell them to tell their friends. I\u2019d love to see Strip Search get funded and if it does we are very close to the goal of all ads removed from the home page and our Daughters of the Eyrewood Lookouts comic.\n------\nUpdate #9: More Lookouts Art, a New Reward, FAQ Update, Jerry Cosplay\nWith 15 days left, we've raised almost $400,000, which is nearly a half-a-million dollars, which is basically a million! Right? Or...? Listen. We don't have time to thrill you with our incredible mathematics right now. It's time to reveal the terrifying revelations of Kickstarter Update 9!\n\nMore Lookouts!\n\nGabe drew more concept art for Daughters of the Eyrewood to further entice you:\nI know this level seems out there, but we still have 15 days! We are also adding another reward level at $50 for a hi-resolution, 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the above Lookouts image sent to your door. Please add $5 for international addresses. (this level also includes all previous rewards!)\n\nJerry Cosplay Poll Results!\nI'll be honest, I'm actually a little shocked at the result. The winner is... the Fruit Fucker? I just feel like... that doesn't have a lot of shame-factor to it. This was an opportunity to really get some ridiculous photos of Jerry, and the community chose the Fruit Fucker? All right, we'll try to do something with it that will maximize embarrassment.\n\nOh! And I forgot to mention in the last update with honorable mentions that we also got a lot of Dr. Bunsen Honeydew suggestions, which would have also been really funny.\n----\nUpdate #10: Kickstarter Shirt Revealed!\nWe\u2019re less than $40k away from hitting our Strip Search stretchgoal, and we figured you would want to see the Exclusive Kickstarter T-Shirt commemorating the campaign! \nThis is at the $150 reward level and also includes The Dickstarter Print, Digital Versions of Books 1 and 2, Remastered Digital Singles of Jerry\u2019s PA musical works, an 8.5\u201d x 11\u201d print of the Lookouts image from Update #9, a copy of Rainslick 3, names for your band AND your pet by Jerry, thoughts of you during coitus from Mike, and of course, the glue that holds this whole campaign together, Mike chasing a duck around while he shouts your name.\n----\nUpdate #11: Strip Search UNLOCKED! Call for entries begins NOW.\nWe\u2019ve just hit the $450k/Strip Search stretchgoal! We move fast, so it\u2019s time to get the process rolling. May I present to you, the initial call for entries.\n\nAs mentioned in previous updates, the winner will get office space (for free!) at Penny Arcade HQ in Seattle, WA AND access to all of our facilities and resources (Mike, Jerry, Biz Guys, Merch Guys, etc) for one year on top of a $15,000 cash prize.\n\nThe deadline to submit is midnight, 8/24/2012 (TWO WEEKS FROM NOW). What you\u2019re applying for is to be on our new reality show, Strip Search, later this year. The process to get to our final participants will be incredibly thorough, so please know this is only the first of many steps.\n\nSome quick notes on the show:\n\nThere will be no cost to you, other than your time.\nYou will be asked to sign a video release.\nYou will be asked to sign an NDA.\nYou will NOT be asked to sign anything regarding the rights to your existing or future works.\nYou need to be 18 or older and legally be able to enter the United States.\nYou will need to take about two weeks of your life later this year for this and this alone.\nIf there are any other questions, please ask them below, and I'll get them answered.

Sometimes that heart is bursting with love for the craft, while other times it's punctured and bleeding all over the place... 24 frames per second.\nMAD GOD is a mature film made with technology that spans the history of cinema.\nTHE MOVIE\nPhil Tippett was raised on the fantasy films of Ray Harryhausen and Willis O'Brien; films that fueled his and other youngsters' imaginations with creatures brought to life using stop-frame animation.  As a young man, he was further influenced by European experimental filmmakers Karel Zeman, Jan Svankmajer and Vladislav Starevich, who used similar techniques in surreal and experimental ways. \nWith his work on the \"Star Wars\" movies, Tippett carved his own niche as a modern master of stop motion.  In 1984 he created his own studio where he continued to explore and innovate using stop motion. \nMAD GOD began with several minutes of stop motion animation in 1990, before the explosion of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) for movies.  But as his studio blossomed into a powerhouse of computer-assisted visual effects and animation, the MAD GOD project fell on the back burner. \nUNTIL LAST YEAR\nAfter sitting on the shelf for 20 years, artists at Tippett Studio implored Phil to revive MAD GOD. \nIncorporating footage shot before the surge of CGI with new puppets, scenes, environments, and in-camera effects, Phil is directing while mentoring an entire new generation in traditional stop motion animation and creature fabrication.\nThe crew is entirely made up entirely of volunteers, including artists from Tippett Studio, students from local art schools, and industry veterans who remember the \"good ol' days\" when effects were made by people on sets photographing puppets one frame at a time.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nEven independent films cost money, and MAD GOD is no exception. \nThe money raised through Kickstarter will be used to finance an abundance of the hard costs associated with making the first chapter of this film, including materials for making molds, armatures, rear and front-screen projections, lab services, hard drive storage, and studio rental space among other costs...  \nIn short, your money will finance the supplies needed to bring the film to life.  Your contributions will ensure that the first chapter gets completed, and you will have a front row seat to the making of this spectacle.\nWe've been emboldened by a number of incredible Kickstarter success stories to believe that independent animation fans and consumers can make a project as unlikely and non-commercial as MAD GOD a reality.  Your financing will facilitate this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision like few have ever attempted. \nABOUT THE PROJECT\nOver an 18 month period, a small team, under Phil Tippett's direction, will complete an approximately 12-minute chapter of the stop-motion/live-action/mixed-media creation called MAD GOD, using hands, tools, molds, clay, toys, garbage, blood, and whatever else we can get our hands on.  \nOnce this chapter is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice (determined by which rewards level is chosen). \nREWARDS\nA flat backer contribution of $10 gets you into the \"MAD GOD CLUB,\" with access to view the process on a password-protected section of the www.madgodmovie.com website as it unfolds and a copy of the first chapter of the film when it is finished as a digital download. \nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond that, we have a list of fun, premium, rewards ranging from postcards with art of the film to DVDs, signed by creator Phil Tippett, to custom-created sculptures. \nFor More Information, please visit www.madgodmovie.com or email kickstarter@madgodmovie.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "Exciting MAD GOD News", "update_content": "Dear Team MAD GOD,\n\nWe have exciting news to share with you...\n\nAfter more than 30 years in production, and thanks in EVERY WAY to you, the backers of this project over the past decade, Phil has completed the feature length film version of MAD GOD!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #37", "update_userinfo": "Phil Tippett's MAD GOD Instagram is now a thing!", "update_content": "Hi Team MAD GOD!   \nLet's make this short & sweet - Phil Tippett now has an Instagram!  \nHis feed chronicles adventures in imagining, fabricating & animating all the parts & pieces that go into the glorious world of MAD GOD.  \nFollow him @madphilg on Instagram, won't you?  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/madphilg/  "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "VIP Pre-Tip: MAD GOD Kickstarter 3 is Now Live", "update_content": "Greetings Team Mad God!\nWe are inside of 24 hours for our latest project - the Augmented Reality Hologrid: Monster Battle game, featuring Phil's creatures, brought to life for you to play with!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Final Push for \"Hologrid: Monster Battle\"", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "Collector's Edition for Hologrid Game", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // Live on Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "HoloGrid: Monster Battle // News from Phil Tippett", "update_content": "Good morning beloved backers of Phil Tippett's Mad God Pt1!\nLast week, we shipped out replacement DVD-Blu-Ray sets to all backers who reported having not received a DVD, whose DVDs arrived creased or damaged, or whose DVDs were reported having been seized by customs or lost in the post.\nThese were mailed to those of you who emailed us privately or responded to our Doodle Poll to report your DVD missing.

Please take a look and get the full description in Update #9.\n\n\"The Banner Saga looks to take everything that was great about the heyday of animated motion pictures and crams it into a strategy game that looks almost too good to be true.\" - Gamezebo\n\"...the art speaks for itself. The developers describe it as \"painstakingly hand-animated,\" and it shows. The colors are lush, and the stylized scenes and characters as crisp and vivid as in any animated film, perhaps more so.\" - Kotaku\n\"It's a beautifully hand-drawn, animated adventure with turn-based tactical strategy set in a post-apocalyptic Viking world. If you didn't start throwing your money at the screen six words into that last sentence, then you're either completely dead inside, or else you enjoy things that are different from the things that I enjoy, in which case you are dead to me.\" - Cracked\n\"We got a few glimpses of that hand drawn artwork when the Banner Saga site went live recently, but it looks even better in motion. The turn based combat in particular looks livelier for that hand-drawn touch. Lovely stuff.\" - PC Gamer\nWHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT BANNERS AND SAGAS?\nThe Banner Saga is a role-playing game merged with turn-based strategy, wrapped into an adventure mini-series about vikings.\nTravel through stunning landscapes straight out of an animated film. Battle painstakingly hand-animated foes in strategic, turn-based combat harkening back to the classic \"Tactics\" days of gaming. Make decisions with consequences in conversations with people you'll truly care about.\nAnd throughout the whole thing record the history of your people on your banner where it will be remembered, because soon there might not be anything left.\nThe Banner Saga is a mature game aimed at gamers who appreciate art, story and strategy.\n\nTHE GAME\nOur first priority has always been to make a role-playing game that feels and looks fresh, and plays like the classic tactical strategy games of our childhood. It's not about defeating the villain and saving the day. It's not about grinding to get past the next fight. The Banner Saga throws you into the end of the world and asks \"how do you deal with this\"?\nDRM-Free, and available on PC and Mac\nNot another generic fantasy: Drawing heavily from Norse culture while creating its own identity and mythology, The Banner Saga takes a low-fantasy approach to viking themes. Giants: yes. Horned helmets: no.\nStrategic combat: Recruit a large roster of unique characters throughout the story, each with different abilities that interact in combat in a deeply tactical way and personalities of their own. The Banner Saga harkens back to classic turn-based gameplay with a strong emphasis on tactics over brute force and endless grinding.\nTravel across gorgeous landscapes: The choices you make as events arise have a huge affect on how the story plays out- who survives, who dies, and what's worth saving. Add people to your caravan as you travel, or lose them when tough decisions arise. You're not just fighting to save nameless strangers, you're fighting for your neighbors, your family and your way of life. We want you to care what happens to them.\nAn emphasis on story: Your choices in dialogue and throughout the game truly affect the story and the people around you. A mature story for adults means forming relationships and making tough decisions; not sex, violence and swearing.\nPlay online: Though the single-player campaign is our focus, The Banner Saga provides a deep multiplayer game; build a unique party of characters and battle friends and enemies in multiplayer combat. Upgrade your party over time and devise new strategies.\nRisk in gameplay: A lot of modern games play it safe- you know you'll defeat the evil and save the day. In The Banner Saga you can't take anything for granted. We want it to feel like a good tv mini-series; the world doesn't revolve around you, it's about how you deal with change.\nWhat does \"Chapter 1\" of the full game mean? We've added an explanation in the faq below.\nDON'T YOU NEED MILLIONS TO MAKE A GAME LIKE THIS?\nWith 30 years experience between us in the games industry, and after working as leads on The Old Republic; one of the biggest projects in gaming history, we know what it takes to make a top-tier game.\nWhen we decided to go independent we knew it would mean making some hard compromises, but it was never our goal to make something small and casual. We designed a game that, at its very minimum, would cost us $100,000 while still focusing on our top priorities - story and strategic combat - at the highest possible level of quality.\nOur promise to you is that all the support we receive goes right back into the game to make it the best it can be. Your donations don't just let us tack on more stuff, they let us return to the full scope of the game we've always wanted to make.\nAdditional funding allows us to give you:\nA bigger, richer world. More characters in combat, more animation, more diverse landscapes, more music, engaging animated cutscenes, and more multiplayer options. We have a huge story we want to tell and this will let us deliver it in the most compelling, meaningful way.\nPorting to more devices. Our first release will be on PC and Mac, but funding would allow us to convert the game to iOS, the Kindle Fire, consoles like XBLA and PSN and maybe even portable gaming devices like the Vita.\nLocalization (translation) in more places. Viking culture is huge in Europe and turn based strategy is big in Japan. We'd love to bring The Banner Saga to both of those places and anywhere else we find significant interest.\nThe game the way we think it should be. By crowdfunding this project we won't be tied to publishers telling us to change the giants to orcs or dumbing the story down for children. We think this means a better game for everyone.\n\nBEHOLD, THE PRIZES\nWe're absolutely over the moon to be able to offer prizes not just for a game, but as an art project. Scroll down to see everything we have to offer!\nThe Wallpaper\nA sleek, stylized background for any size computer or portable device. Get it with or without the game logo. Obviously we can't show it here, but it's exclusive to Kickstarter backers and never seen before.\n\nThe Guild Crest\nThis is your chance to get in the game. In both single player and multiplayer, when the player starts the game they choose a crest to represent their family or guild. We'll give you a template, and you give us whatever symbol you want to see in the game. It could be your family crest, your guild emblem, or a drawing of your dog. It's not just for you, though; everyone who plays the game will be able to see your design. If you donate at this level be sure to check out the FAQ for some simple guidelines. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Game Poster\nA full-sized 24 x 36 inch movie-style poster featuring official artwork for the game and featured on the cover of Indie Game Magazine. Each poster is personally signed by the team at Stoic! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe T-shirt\nA t-shirt designed exclusively for the Kickstarter campaign and only for backers. Carved into the horn is the history of the world. Once the campaign is over they'll never be seen again! We'll be making the t-shirt available in all the major sizes (s, m, l, xl and xxl) and both genders. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Button\nAll prizes at the $80 and up level come with a free pin based on the brooch worn by a key character the game, which can be seen in the animation cel below. Use it to hold together your sheep-skin cloak in the icy winds! Show off your viking spirit in public! Or whatever! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Score (Special music promotion)\nAustin Wintory, composer of the hit game \"Journey\", will be providing limited edition physical copies of the soundtrack, hand-signed by the composer himself. Different from the official soundtrack, once the campaign ends these special edition CDs won't be available again. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\nThe Animation Cel\nThis is a throwback to the golden age of animation. A cel is a single frame of animation on a transparent sheet that is laid on top of a painted image. If you're a huge classic animation nerd like we are, you can own a signed and numbered 8.5 x 14 inch animation cel from the game the way they used to do it in the good old days of Disney and Don Bluth. Includes all previous rewards. Pick one of two pivotal characters below:\n\nThe Signature (Special music promotion)\nGet an autographed copy of the performance parts from the recording sessions; the SHEET MUSIC used by the actual musicians who play on the score. Needless to say, this prize will be a limited run. As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score for the game, recorded in a live studio! Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Landscape\nWe're thrilled to offer our take on works of art inspired by the incredible paintings of the American master Eyvind Earle. This is an image that defines The Banner Saga's art style. Get this framed 36 x 12 inch lithograph with no logos, no gimmicks, signed and numbered by the artist in limited supply. Your friends won't even know it's from a game unless you decide to tell them. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Relic\nImmortalize something meaningful to you in The Banner Saga that other players will find on their own adventures. Send us a photo of your own heirloom, memento or just something you'd like to show your friends and we'll turn it into a relic of value and power. We'll work with you to come up with a unique name and description that could include anything from a mysterious inscription to giving off a certain aura. You'll personalize it and make a coveted piece of gameplay by choosing from a list of rarities and in-game bonuses it provides. Doesn't look very viking-themed you say? That's ok, the marketplaces trade in items pillaged from all over the world. Check the FAQ for more info. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Shadowbox\nWe'll be creating a piece of art with true depth that replicates the way the game parallaxes and overlaps. It comes in a 2-inch deep glass-paned frame at a hefty 20 x 16 inches. Below is an example image by the artist who will be creating the shadowbox (not the actual image!). Rest assured that we'll be doing something special for this piece. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Transcendence\nBECOME A VIKING GOD in the game itself. The gods may be dead but that doesn't mean they're not an important part of The Banner Saga. We'll work with you to create a unique deity with your likeness which will be seen all over the game in various forms of effigy and as an integral part of the lore, all in strong Norse themes. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Performance (Special music promotion)\nYou are invited to personally ATTEND the music's recording sessions in Los Angeles or elsewhere later this year. This will include a day of hanging out with all of us at the recording studio, and lunch (on us). You will also receive a signed, leather-bound book compiling all of the game's music (produced as a one-off and therefore never commercially for sale) and earn a Music Associate Producer credit in the game and on the album. Not enough? Austin will personally compose an original 30-second ringtone, just for you! As part of the special music promotion, the donations we receive from this prize category go directly to help fund an all-out, full orchestral score in the game recorded in a live studio! Please note: this is a special case prize. While it does include the signed CD and the sheet music, it does not include any of the previous rewards. This one's for serious music fans. You must be able to travel to the Los Angeles area or elsewhere. If you're interested in this prize you must contact us to make arrangements before the end of the Kickstarter campaign: stoic@stoicstudio.com.\n\nThe Motion Shoot\nCome on over to our high-tech motion capture studio and we'll put YOU (yes, physically you) in the game, doing an animation for an attack or special skill. Think you'll look silly? Don't worry, by the time we're done you'll look a bad-ass viking warrior. After the shoot we'll take you out to lunch and chat about the game. Male or female, no problem; we've got plenty of characters to choose from. We can honestly say there will probably never be another chance like this. Must live locally or be able to travel to the Austin, TX area. If you're interested in this prize please contact us via email. Includes all previous rewards.\n\nThe Executive\nWe have so many prizes now we had to compile them all into one final, huge mega-prize. The Executive gives you every prize we have to offer (except for the rotoscope shoot), including the viking god and attending the recording session. On top of that, you will be given an Executive Music Producer credit in the game and on the album. Lastly, receive a framed copy of the Banner Saga main theme, each note inscribed by hand by Austin Wintory, who will also be kind enough to sign his work. Has anything like this even been done before? Please contact us before donating at this tier.\n\nAnything else?\nThat's not enough? If you have any questions about the prizes or are interested in making some kind of arrangements for a private donation, please feel free to contact us at stoic@stoicstudio.com\n\nWHO ARE YOU, TO PROMISE SUCH THINGS?\nStoic is made up of three industry veterans with over a decade of experience each, and from all walks of development.

Conserve Ammo. And Never Cut a Deal With A Dragon.\nJordan Weisman, the creator of Shadowrun, is back and Shadowrun Returns (for Apple & Android tablets and PCs) is the game that Shadowrun fans have been waiting for a long time. A graphically rich 2D turn-based single player game with deep story interaction, meaningful character development, and highly-contextual tactical combat, Shadowrun Returns is not only going to make some old geeks (like us) very happy but it will introduce new players to a dynamic gaming universe that is beloved around the world. \nCreated almost 25 years ago, Shadowrun remains one of the most original and cherished role-playing settings. The game world\u2019s origin story mashes-up the dystopian Cyberpunk future of a Blade Runner with the high fantasy creatures and races of a Lords of the Rings in an organic way that produces iconic characters, environments, and situations.\nHere's how it works:\nAccording to the Mayan Calendar (and lots of tabloids), the world will end on December 21, 2012. It\u2019s part a 5,200 year cycle of death and rebirth that, in Shadowrun, actually charts the ebb and flow of magic from the Earth. So, on 12/21/12 magic will return, end this world, and wreak holy havoc while starting the next. Aboriginal cultures, who maintained their mystical traditions, are the first to feel the return of magic and use their newfound power to reshape the political, financial, and physical world around them.  As the magic increases, Elf and Dwarf babies are born to very surprised parents who carry the right combination of long-dormant genes. But all of these events pale in comparison to the horror of \"goblinization\", which painfully reshapes the teenage bodies of those unlucky enough to carry dominant Ork or Troll genes. And then the first Great Dragon rises from its 5,200 yearlong hibernation and circles over Tokyo, signaling that the world has truly AWAKENED.\nFast forward two generations, to a world transformed not only by the growth of magic but by the acceleration of cyber technology\u2014a continual effort to improve upon the gifts that nature gave humanity; by the inevitable maturation of the World Wide Web into the Matrix\u2014a network directly accessible by the human brain; and by the near elimination of governments as they are replaced megacorporations\u2014monolithic entities who see only customers, not citizens.\nAnd moving through the dark shadows cast by the gleaming towers of the corps, are Shadowrunners \u2013 disposable assets and corporate pawns scratching out a living using a combination of technology, magic, and street smarts. Shadowrunners live between the cracks and operate outside the law, doing the dirty work that corporate wage-slaves won\u2019t soil their hands with and occasionally acting as the only protection the citizenry can turn to. \nWelcome to the world of Shadowrun, where man meets magic and machine.\nThere are a couple of key ideas at the core of Shadowrun Returns.\nDeep, Interactive Stories \nWe intend to follow a braided anthology structure for our story. Jordan, his partner Mitch Gitelman and Mike Mulvihill, who led Shadowrun game development at FASA Corp. will craft and structure the meta-story, then supply key information for a group of writers to weave into their own short stories, which we'll then use as the basis for our missions. To ensure an authentic tone, we'll incorporate the storytelling skills of many Shadowrun authors and designers who've been carrying the flame over the last 23 years such as:\nMichael A. Stackpole\nMike Mulvihill\nTom Dowd\nMalik Toms\nMel Odom\nJason Hardy\nStephen Kenson\nThe result should be an overall narrative that is layered, textured, and satisfying. \nOne of the many innovations in Data East\u2019s Shadowrun Super Nintendo game was a unique conversation engine that opened up new avenues of conversation based upon information you learned through interactions with characters and objects. We intend on taking a similar path with a new twist or two.\nContextual Gameplay in Four Realities\nFour realities overlap in the world of Shadowrun (the Physical, the Digital, the Mystic, and the Astral) and associated character classes such as the Street Samurai, Hacker, Combat Mage, and Shaman, each have the ability to view and interact with the world in ways the others can\u2019t.\nHere are some ways that selecting each character type allows you to see the map from a different perspective:\nStreet Samurai see a threat assessment overlay of the environment that notes enemy appraisals, options for cover, potential weapons, and statistics for drawn weapons.\nCombat Mages see magical auras, granting them the ability to locate magical items, identify spells being prepared, and find the intersections of magic lay lines where they can recharge their power.\nHackers/Deckers see the digital control circuitry that allows them to manipulate the physical world via the digital one.\nShaman see the \u201ctrue world\u201d that lies in the astral plane, distinguishing the true nature of people, plants, creatures, and magical objects while buildings and other \u201cdead\u201d objects appear as mere shadows.\nMissions (aka \"Runs\") in Shadowrun Returns can require interaction with all four realities simultaneously, requiring you to use information learned from each character\u2019s perspective to coordinate their context-sensitive actions to get the job done. . . and survive.\nThat\u2019s why we decided to make Shadowrun Returns a turn-based game\u2014so we can offer you a wide range of context-based gameplay options from which to craft a your plan.\nThe Streets Tell a Million Stories\nOne of the things that we feel most strongly about is that the world of Shadowrun was created for all of us to tell stories within. That\u2019s one of the beautiful things about in-person tabletop role-playing\u2014the stories are extremely relevant to you and your friends because they were made by you and your friends.\nIn honor of that tradition, we plan to release our PC-based level editor when we release Shadowrun Returns so that everyone can create their own Shadowrun stories & \u201cruns\u201d. When you upload your stories, you can make them available to your Friends Only or the entire Shadowrun community. \nThe game we want to make is very humble by modern blockbuster game standards but it is still way beyond the ability of a small start-up to fund by itself. The restraints on the license from Microsoft made it impossible to get established publishers interested in Shadowrun and so it remained just a dream for a long time until Jordan saw the recent successes of some other veteran designers on Kickstarter.\nCrowd sourcing to fund creative content represents truly profound change to the status quo. While we watch financial models for the creation and distribution of creative content continue to erode, Kickstarter charts a direction for how fans can directly impact development of creative content they want by funding its creation.\nWe hope that Shadowrun Returns is a creative concept you want to help make into a reality and we thank your consideration and support.\nIt is strange to be required to license your own game in order to make a new version of it but that\u2019s what can happen when you\u2019re old and keep changing companies. Here's the fast-forward version:\nAnd so, our favorite game has come full circle and Jordan is again leading the development of a world he started oh, so many years ago.\nAnd for those of you that have been around since the very early days, we want to make sure that YOU understand that WE understand and that we'd love to see things like this (and more) in the game. \nAres Predators and Ruger Super Warhawks (yes, with smartlinks), Maglocks and Doc Wagons, datajacks and  credsticks, dermal plating and wired reflexes, \u201cchummer\u201d and \"drek\", Ares and Fuchi and Aztechnology (Oh my!). \nBut that's not all. \nMr. Johnson(s), Lofwyr  (can\u2019t leave him out can we?), gangers, toxic spirits, Renraku Arcology, The Sprawl, the Redmond Barrens & the Ork Underground (oh yes), UCAS, Tir Taingire and even the Sioux Nation, but most of all you WILL be saying (or is that screaming?). . . \u201cNever EVER Deal with a Dragon!\u201d", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #87", "update_userinfo": "Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter Now LIVE!", "update_content": "We\u2019re excited to let you know that the Shadowrun: Hong Kong Kickstarter has launched.

We\u2019re in the process of making the film, but need your help in order to complete it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reaching out to all David Lynch fans to lend a hand.\nIn return for your support, we've created some really cool rewards that we think reflects your help in breathing life into this film: a special limited edition DVD of the completed film that includes bonus material only available through this Kickstarter campaign.  As an extra bonus: all rewards of $25 or more will receive an exclusive 45 minutes of special \"behind the scenes\" audio interviews with David Lynch and the LYNCH THREE team (as a digital download)\nHaving been given unparalleled access, we are thrilled to have the opportunity to tell David Lynch's story. We'll take you along as we dig deeper into a world that is uniquely his. We'll ask how the last 60 years, with all that's come and gone, has helped to shape him as an artist.\nIn order to do this, we need to cover the enormous expense of acquiring licensing rights to what we consider significant elements of his story. From an emotionally raw painting by Francis Bacon to a mesmerizing photograph by Diane Arbus or a distinctive song by Roy Orbison, the list goes on and on. These are just some of the pieces we need in order to weave the story that we want to tell. Along with the heavy weight of acquiring licensing rights, come all the immense prerequisite costs of putting together an independent film of this size.\nDAVID LYNCH'S ABSTRACT SELF PORTRAIT\nDavid has been gracious towards our efforts and has per our request created a unique piece of art to help support the making of this film. He knows that we struggle daily to raise funding, therefore we\u2019re indebted to him for his generosity.  We\u2019ve come a long way since first starting this project, but now we need a little extra momentum.\nThis high quality print of David Lynch's abstract self portrait measure 23 inches x 33 inches  (58 cm x 83 cm) and is available along with the special edition DVD and your name in the credits.\n                                                                                                     March, 2012\nWhy should you help us make this movie?\nBecause we would like to see a film about David Lynch as much as you would. We\u2019ve put all of ourselves into making a film that we\u2019re proud of. We think it\u2019s important that David Lynch is preserved on film; sharing his thoughts, telling his stories and showing us a side of himself we rarely get the opportunity to see.\nHow can I donate and be a part of the film?\nJust click the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button in the upper right-hand corner. Email us if you have any problems or questions. Because David Lynch fans are scattered around the world, we would like to remind you that anyone can donate. The rewards will be shipped to wherever you live.\nWhat is our Kickstarter goal?\nWe\u2019re trying to be conservative, so we\u2019ve set our goal at $30,000. You might be scratching your heads and asking why such a low figure.  We would like to raise a lot more than that because all the money will go towards making the film that much better. There are a lot of things we\u2019d like to do if we had the funds, there\u2019s no question about that. We just like to have a grounded approach and fly a little higher if we exceed our goals. Every bit helps.\nUpdate: Though we have surpassed our initial goal of $30,000, it's important to keep in mind that this is only a fraction of the costs involved in making this film.  The more we raise, the more options we have to tell David's story.  Please lend your support. Every extra penny helps!\nHow much is shipping?\nAbsolutely nothing, zero--we'll take care of the costs. Whether you live in Missoula Montana, Paris or Japan- we'll ship it there!  But if you\u2019d like us to send it through the time warp with FedEx, then we\u2019ll have to arrange that separately.\nHow can I contact you?\nYou can reach us at lynchthreeproject@gmail.com Feel free to email us with any questions or comments you may have. We know how important it is to have all your questions answered, so just get in touch! We'll answer ALL emails promptly.\nHow do I follow the project?\nWhen we initially launched the project, we had thought about making special footage available to anyone that supports the film. We\u2019ve decided that it would be better to use Social Media to connect and share, therefore in the future\u2014all our behind the scenes videos, audios and thoughts, will be freely shared to all the members of our Facebook page. No need to make a donation to gain access.\nCan you tell us a bit more about the signed and numbered lithographs?\nThis artwork was made exclusively in support of the LYNCH THREE PROJECT. David Lynch will personally sign and number each lithograph. We\u2019re going to create a lithograph of the original art work (11\u201d x 9 \u00bc\u201d) on the same handmade paper that David used. Arches paper has been milled in Lorraine, France since 1492. It has been used to publish the complete works of Voltaire and Napoleon\u2019s Description of Egypt. Each and every sheet of Arches paper is hand inspected to ensure the most consistent, durable and beautiful paper available. We've gone to great lengths to create the highest quality print, that is why we have selected one of the worlds leading lithographic ateliers (based in Europe) to print this limited signed and numbered edition.\n*Please keep in mind that the posters are not the same as the lithographs. The posters are in a large format (23\" x 33\"), while the lithographs are the same size as the original piece (11\" x 9 1/4\")  The lithographs are made on heavy handmade fine art archival paper.\nWhat happens if the money isn\u2019t raised in time?\nEvery Kickstarter project must be fully funded before its time expires or no money changes hands. Your credit card or debit card will not be charged.\nIf I become Executive Producer, how will we find out about the festivals to attend as part of your rewards program?\nWe\u2019ll contact you personally. We\u2019ve attended a ton of them in the past, so we will be able to give you the full low down after we\u2019ve had a chance to talk to you.\nPlease visit our Facebook page for all the latest updates and behind the scenes photographs.\nBelow is Jason S's portrait of David Lynch.

FTL will be on Steam!\n\u201cI\u2019ve been playing an early build of the game, and it\u2019s amazing.  When it comes out... you should play it because it\u2019s amazing.\u201d - Graham Smith - PC Gamer Preview\n\u201c...fighting to stave off the inevitable destruction of my ship and crew as we make a mad dash through the cosmos gets my blood pumping every time.\u201d - Nathan Meunier - Gamespy Preview \n\u201cThis game is brilliant, and brutal, and different every time.\u201d - Tom Francis - PC Gamer Preview \nFTL: Spaceship Simulation Roguelike-like\nFTL, Faster than Light, is a game coming to Windows, Mac & Linux made by Justin Ma and Matthew Davis.  It features a blend of exploration, discovery, ship management and real time strategic combat that creates an experience quite unlike other games in its genre.\nEDIT: But don\u2019t take our word for it...\nThe OnLive demo is over!\nFor the first 2+ weeks of the Kickstarter, a demo of FTL was featured as part of OnLive's Indie Showcase.  It was an event coinciding with GDC that allowed people at home to try a number of the IGF nominees and honorable mentions.  It was hugely successful: FTL was one of the most played demos of the event.  At one point it was the 2nd most played game on the entire OnLive service*!    For now we will be working hard to get the game ready for the beta in May.  In the meantime we will be putting up some more gameplay videos to let you get a better feeling for the game.\n*Or so we were told at GDC.\n\nThe Game\nFTL has been described as \u201cFirefly by way of Spelunky.\u201d  Many games have tackled the goal of recreating the feeling of space operas, but few have focused on the inner workings of a single ship. How does the crew react when their ship takes a heavy missile barrage and the shield batteries shut down?  Do you reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape?  Do you power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky before they can breach your hull?  Or do you teleport a boarding party onto the enemy ship and take the fight to them directly?  FTL allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.\n\nA setting of intergalactic war:  The player is tasked with a mission vital to the survival of the Galactic Federation currently threatened by a nearly victorious rebellion.\nA story that engages, but does not dictate player experience:  The setting provides direction but the real story of FTL is created by the player and it evolves organically during each play-through.\nAn arms race: The locations and enemies grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.  To survive you will need to find and purchase equipment; hire and level up crew; and upgrade the ship\u2019s systems.\nExploration is key:  Every location you Faster-Than-Light travel to contains a text based event.  This includes scenarios like attempting to help an infected space station pleading for help; slavers demanding your surrender; hunting pirates through a nebula; and surviving an uncharted asteroid field.\nA random galaxy:  Each play-through will feature different encounters, events, choices, and results to your decisions. \nPermadeath is at the core of FTL:  Knowing that your crew\u2019s lives are in your hands and that each battle could mean the end of your trek fills the player with a sense of urgency and desperation that adds importance to every decision.\nSleek and focused gameplay:  FTL focuses on the development of your ship, recreating the atmosphere of space operas without the countless menus and confusing interface that frequently go hand in hand with ship management and galactic sim games.  Currently each game lasts between 15 and 90 minutes.\n\n\nThe Combat\nShip-to-ship combat is a large focus of the game.  Check out this older gameplay trailer to see it in action: \nEDIT:  There are new gameplay trailers to watch.  Check them out in Update #4 and Update #5!\n\nThe Final Game\nA lot of these elements are fully functional and can be experienced (briefly) in the demo... so what will we be adding between now and release?\nShip Customization:  Choose & name your ship; outfit it with weapons & equipment; and hire & name your crew.  \nAlien Races: We are working on 5 playable alien races that have unique abilities, ships and implications during exploration.\nCrew Development:  Your crew will gain skill over time, allowing survivors to have improved combat and operate ship systems to increase their potential..\nAn Ending:  The current game is infinite (play until you lose), but we want to have a more controlled game mode that gives the player a final goal and rewards for completion.\nDeep Meta-game: Unlock playable ships, unique crew members, weapons and equipment to be used in subsequent play-throughs.\nCustom Soundtrack:  We have two songs so far, but our sound designer will be working hard to give us a soundtrack that greatly enhances the experience. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nYou may be wondering, \u201cif the game is so close to completion, why do you need our money?\u201d   When we quit our jobs last year, we intended to work on a small project for a few months.  During development we received such overwhelmingly positive feedback that we changed our plans.  We decided to bring FTL up to a finished game quality.  However, releasing a game takes money and our funds are starting to deplete.  Your generous pledges will go towards:\n\nBusiness Costs: To officially start selling the game we have to set up a company, deal with licensing and other expenses.\nPaying Our Sound Designer: It is fine that we\u2019re working out of pocket, but we will need to have money to pay our wonderful sound guy, Ben Prunty.\nPolish & Improvement: Making FTL as good as it can be.\n\n\nAccess to the Game\nYour pledge of $10 or greater will get you a copy of the final game when it\u2019s released.  We do not know what will be our primary method of distribution, but regardless we will give you a DRM-free copy for Windows, Mac and/or Linux.  See below for estimated system requirements.  We're aiming to be content complete within a few months and then release the game by the end of summer.  This is subject to change and the closed Beta will likely cause delays.\nPledging $25 or more will also give you access to our closed Beta. The exact date and details are still uncertain but we will attempt to start it within a couple months of the end of the Kickstarter.  Here is what we know now:\nThe Beta will initially require Windows and have only English localization.\nIt will initially be available only to backers.\nEDIT: The beta will be organized through Steam!  This means you will need access to a Steam account to join the beta.\nSystem Requirements:\nThe requirements are all subject to change. We're doing our best to accommodate as many machines as possible, but with our currently limited testing we're unsure of what the final requirements will be.\nOS: Windows (XP/Vista/7), MacOS, or Linux\nProcessor: 2ghz Core 2 Duo\nMemory: 512 MB \nGraphics: OpenGL 2.0 Support, 256 MB (dedicated card preferred)\nMinimum Resolution: 1280 x 720\nThank You\nFTL\u2019s website can be found at www.FTLgame.com\nIf you\u2019re confused about the game, check out our FAQ\nYou can voice any questions or concerns to devteam@FTLgame.com\nSign up for the newsletter on our website.\nFollow us at @FTLgame\n\nAnd of course, thank you to the girlfriends, friends, and family who have been with us every step of the way:  finding bugs, vetoing bad ideas, and feeding us.

Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance.

You can use Javascript, C#, and Python-like Boo to write games that run on everything: Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, XBox 360, Playstation 3, Wii, Web player, Flash, Native Client... You can put what you make into the App Stores and have your creations for sale to start your own indie game company! Master the Unity3D game engine from the inside out to make games of your own and become the next code hero!\nWho We Are\nI'm Alex Peake the founder of Primer Labs and I've spent the last year building Code Hero as an indie game with the Primer Labs team so you could play it. I've taken it as far as I can on my own and I need your help to make Code Hero the game that can turn you into a game programmer. i have some of the most talented people in the world ready to work on this to take it way beyond what I could do by myself.\nWhat we need funding to do\nMost games cost millions of dollars to make. Code Hero is more ambitious than most games. Code Hero is carefully designed to be achievable for much less money by having 4 programmers and 2 artists work for six months to predict a carefully planned new kind of game that is made possible by the quality of these people, the brilliance of the Unity game engine and the release of each version so you can help us improve it continuously.\nThe New Artist\nCode Hero's new led artist is Gizmo of Farbrausch demo crew and Gamebrausch Studios, a legend amongst creatives who has produced tech that was often 5 years ahead of the commercial game industry such as Kkrieger, a Doom 3-level engine and game in 95K.\nThe Coder Challenge: Kickstart Your Game Making!\nMake your own game and make something awesome to submit to kickstarter yourself! We'll send a Primer Labs lab coat to everyone who posts their game on Kickstarter!\nThe 1 K12 Code Hero School Challenge\nGive your children more than a game: Give their whole school programming peers that will engage and inspire each other. A parent, teacher, student, administrator or entrepreneurial youth can pledge to give a school of their choosing a special school-wide Code Hero access. All their students will receive school accounts for Code Hero. \nTeachers will be trained by the Code Hero team to be able to mentor students who can mentor each other. Code Hero School will feature advanced metrics and collaborative gameplay that will allow teachers to integrate it into making projects for every subject and class in the school. Art classes can produce game art for history projects that become simulated historical worlds with math class showing how engineering created disruptive new industries that economics class analyzes for modern parallels [HINT HINT]. \nCheck out Hack The Future and Unityversity to see how we teach large groups of kids already to make and present games on their first day. \nPETITIONERS WELCOME. You can pledge at this level to petition your school to try it: Call them, ask them if they will accept it on behalf of all their students. This doesn't require a school approval process or a strategy session: It just opens the door for a new kind of education through games that kids actually want and enjoy! \nUNCONDITIONAL GIVING: If you can't get a school to accept, you can give it directly to the students of the school to form a Code Club to provide the power of one good example: a school where every student can code fluently and create games as group projects as easily as presentation poster boards and science fair exhibits. \nEvery state needs at least one representative that will take up the Code Year challenge to show there is no state that is not ready to become an economic powerhouse, that there is no district that can't emulate Silicon Valley, and that there is no school that can't become a flourishing entrepreneurial hotbed of student-created startups!\nTesters Trying Code Hero\nHere are two of our first testers to try the beta in their own words. They had played just a cakeslice of what we were buiding, but they made us realize immediately that Code Hero makes sense to people who have played Portal and Minecraft, two of our favorite games. We think in the future, every school will buy an educational bundle through Steam for Education with a Minecraft for Schools / Portal Science / Code Hero package. We'd love to talk to Mojang and other edutech games about collaborating in schools!\nSteampunk Computing: Babbage & Lovelace\nOne of the worst investment decisions in human history was cutting funding to the inventors of computers, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace. Computers turned out to be a pretty keen idea after all, yet less than 1% of humans can code.\nCode Hero includes steampunk missions where you help Ada and Charles Babbage construct a 3D replica of the Difference Engine whose replica is actually built and working in its entirety at the Computer Histroy Museum.\nGiving everyone the gift of code literacy is the first step towards investing in our creativity and setting ourselves free to invent the future!\nAlex at Humanity+ @Caltech: \nAs we make game AIs to be our machine mentors teaching us to make better game AIs, what happens when we make machines that make us make them make us into them?\nThank you for your support!\nYou can find more details about Code Hero on our site:\nhttp://primerlabs.com\nPAST UPDATES:\n\nUPDATE 1: Congratulations to Tim Schafer!\nUPDATE 2: Pledgers click here to download Mac & Windows game beta\nUPDATE 3: Read about what we plan to make with your help: Multiplayer sandbox creativity, comptitive Codefoo and more!\nUPDATE 4: IT'S OVER $16000!

What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.  We believe that beyond the reward of receiving the finished game, the ability to be a participant in the project makes this a unique opportunity.  \n\nFor anyone who wants to contribute above and beyond the call, we have a selection of premium rewards ranging from a download of the full documentary series in splendid 1080p HD video with bonus footage, to unique posters, original concept art, and even a mini painting of yourself done by the game's artist!   \nFor those of you who want to be really special, check out www.doublefine.com for details on super premium high level rewards!\n\n\n\nClosing\nFor anyone interested in the inner workings of the game industry, either professionally or as a fan, this project will be a landmark in exploring the art of development.  For people that just love great games, this is an opportunity to help bring one to fruition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Your Final Rewards are coming + Double Fine Adventure: Definitive Edition", "update_content": "Hello, Backers of Adventure!\nI love you!\nSorry, I got a little emotional there.
