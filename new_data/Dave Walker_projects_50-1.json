(We also use them to prevent the camera getting scratched on things like our iPads and phones.)\nCyber security is a big deal these days. We've all heard the stories that range from companies being hacked and vast amounts of data being stolen, to mass surveillance recording and gathering data on everything we do. Along with protecting the files on your devices, protecting yourselves (and others) is just as important!\nHeld securely in place with 3M adhesive backing, the CarbonCovers will fit to a vast range of devices - be it laptops, all-in-one desktops, tablets or even smartphones. A quick swipe of the finger will slide the cap to either reveal, or cover the camera lens. Fitted in seconds and easy to remove without causing any damage. They're made from the same premium materials as our last campaign, which really helps set them apart from the rest. Why use plastic when you can use carbon fibre?\nSuper easy to install \nOpen or close the cover whenever you need with one finger\n2 part carbon fibre construction\n3M adhesive backing\nAt 1mm thick you're able to close your laptop lid on it no problem\nOur aim was not to create 'the thinnest webcam cover in the world', but rather, the best. (And the most carbon-y.)\nWe're fully aware that there is nothing new with the concept of covering up your webcam. Many people (famously including Mark Zuckerberg and former FBI head James Comey) use a little square of tape - as do many people that are interested in cyber-privacy. \nThe problem with tape - as we've discovered for the last year or so of using it - is that it's not very practical. It needs to be removed when you want the camera and leaves a residue when you peel it off. They also ruin the look of your devices...\nAlready use tape? Go for a practicality and style upgrade with the CarbonCover! \nThe CarbonCover fully blocks the webcam when closed, but a handy feature (tested on Apple devices) is that the LED indication light remains exposed - so whether a program you're using, a dodgy website or a hacker activates the webcam, you'll be aware of this even though they're not recording any image. \nBut why do I need to cover my webcam?\nPrograms often sold as 'spy on your ex-girlfriend software' are available on the internet and allow people to spy on you using the webcam or front-facing cameras built into your devices. Simply put, if someone can control your webcam and record anything they want - isn\u2019t this something you\u2019d like to prevent? With access to a webcam, people can capture everything and privacy no longer exists. Closed door meetings at work, your children playing in the living room or even things far more intimate can all be targets for users of this type of software. (more on this at the bottom!)\nDoing things differently. \nThere have been several campaigns for webcam covers that have come and gone on Kickstarter before ours, with many of you probably having backed them! Unfortunately, it seems that there have been numerous issues with them. Everything from flimsy construction and unfeasibly small/thin components, through to supply chain issues, rewards simply not turning up and no communication from the creators.\nWe hope our simple approach to the design, and great track record of delivering a large volume of high quality carbon parts to backers all over the world will inspire a bit more confidence and keep as many of you safe from webcam hackers as possible!\nDesign & Prototyping.\nWith dimensions of 16.5 x 11 x 1mm, the CarbonCover is tiny. It's small enough to be completely unobtrusive, and yet its rounded edges and glossy carbon twill compliment the design of your device and really set itself apart from other webcam covers on the market. The best selling covers on sites like Amazon are also 1mm thick and in all the testing we've been doing we're yet to find an issue with closing a laptop lid on it.\nThose rulers look familiar...\nTo develop these covers we began by speaking to our fantastic manufacturing partners. With their advice on board, we made sure the design wouldn't be an issue for the manufacturing tolerances we've come to expect from them - a key area we feel many other campaigns have failed on due to designs that are unrealistic for accurate and consistent machining in large quantities. \nA few 3d printed prototypes later we were able to order our first batch of CarbonCovers to carry on testing. The comparatively large surface area for the 3M adhesive backing ensures the CarbonCover stays firmly in place on all your devices. The sliding lens cap is really easy to open and close with a single flick of the finger. No messy glue or magnets involved here! While the adhesive will remain sticky if you choose to remove the cover and apply to another device, we include a spare adhesive ring for just this eventuality! \nRewards and Incentives.\nThey say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so it's in that spirit that we're 'imitating' the superb incentive we've recently seen on the Universal Lens Cap campaign. If you like the CarbonCover, back it at whatever quantity takes your fancy - then share it with your friends and followers on social media to receive 1 FREE ADDITIONAL COVER! (Don't forget to post the link in the comment section above!)\n Will the CarbonCovers fit my devices?\nCarbonCovers can be secured to any device with a camera of up to 4.6mm in diameter. We have come across some larger webcams on old laptops, but the CarbonCover still works just fine. In these instances the edges of the cover may be just visible when you're using the webcam, but it will still be perfectly usable for skype/etc. When in the closed position, the lens is fully covered. \nA few of the comments from happy backers last time around!\n Tell me more about webcam spying!\nAt just over a minute in length this video perfectly demonstrates why you want to have your webcam covered. It is now common knowledge that intelligence organisations around the world can access a webcam without the user ever knowing. However, the bigger privacy threat is actually from hackers, blackmailers and cyber stalkers - thanks mostly to the software being so easy to get hold of and install. If the CarbonCover isn't for you, and you don't fancy buying any of the alternatives, at least grab a bit of tape and get those cameras covered! \nA webcam cover gives peace of mind during intimate and private moments.

But, the problem we face is that those tiny button cell batteries that generally power our flashlight are to be replaced frequently. In some instances, it takes very longer for us to replace the old button cell batteries as they are too small.\nTough job for your big hand to work on such tiny battery.\n    Can you imagine carrying a keychain flashlight that is just equivalent to the size of a paper clip that comes with rechargeable battery? Yes, such a light called as PISA light in attractive colors is launched by us at RHEEA Tech. Welcome to our Kickstarter Campaign for this small colorful rechargeable EDC flashlight. This practical, trendy and minimal light is not just a light. It is in fact, a stylish and the most useful modern accessory for carrying along every day. \n What is Pisa Light\n        At RHEEA Tech, we have meticulously crafted this small light. This miniature light is most elegantly designed. The small size will make it your best companion besides ensuring your safety during darkness. We are happy to share that we have taken your convenience to the next level by creating this light as a rechargeable light. So, you can save your money on frequently changing the battery. As it comes with a keychain, you can\njust attach your keys that you should carry along with you.\nPISA LIGHT is designed  both a trendy accessory and a practical EDC item.\n    At RHEEA Tech, we have meticulously crafted this small light.

So, you can save your money on frequently changing the battery. As it comes with a keychain, you can just attach your keys that you should carry along with you.     You can recharge this gadget on your mobile phone using a USB cable. Even, you can charge it on a power socket using your mobile adapter or on your computer. The colorful designs will make it the best companion if you are highly particular about your style.\nUser Friendly, Stylish Design, It's PISA Light\n Excellent and Attractive Set of Features:  \n   This key chain light will turn out to be special as against other such lights available in the market because of its excellent set of features. Here, let us introduce the features:  \nIt's A Light For Night Time, And Is A Decoration In Day Time. \nPowerful Brightness:   \n    You can compare the brightness provided by other such tiny lights that come with 4 button cell batteries. Yes, our light will bring you 5 lm additional brightness without requiring you to change the button cell batteries that cost you more. Yes, when normal flash lights bring you 10 lm as the utmost brightness, you will get 15 lm brightness from PISA. \n15 lm is powerful for such a small light.\nWater Resistance:  \nIn some instances, you might get caught in the rain when you carry the light. To make sure that the rain does not affect the brightness of the light, we at RHEEA Tech have designed this light as a water resistant flash light. So, you can stay confident about having a companion even in rainy season when power outages are common to happen.\nWater Resistance Is Necessary For Outdoor Using.\nSmall Size and Light Weight:  \nIn addition to being smaller in appearance, the light is also designed as a lightweight model. Most people do not want to carry a heavy and large flashlight. We have rightly understood this requirement and so we have managed the technical limitation of size of rechargeable flashlight. Yes, this is the world\u2019s smallest rechargeable flashlight at the present situation. Even though you carry it along with you wherever you go, you will never feel it.\nPISA Is The World's Smallest Flashlight Now.\nCharging Indicator:  \nThis small flash light comes with a charging indicator. This will ensure that the light is not over charged or undercharged. Yes, charging indicator is attractively designed in such a small body by our technicians. Once charged, the indicator light will switch off automatically.\nRed Light Indicator Built In. \nRechargeable: \n    This is a feature that is highly worthy.

Many thanks again to everyone who has supported us so far!\nWelcome to the world of John T. Draper, better known as Captain Crunch, the original \"Phone Phreak\". From his early days of facing off against Ma Bell to his current role in public speaking and privacy advocacy, it\u2019s hard to overstate his impact on the world of technology. Along the way, he developed some of the most influential tools of the computer revolution, from the first working word processor in the seventies to the first effective firewall in the nineties. The road hasn\u2019t always been smooth, however, and for every success there have been setbacks and hurdles of literary proportion. Let\u2019s just call it Draperism. \nThis \"warts and all\" biography features Draper's own telling of stories from the past fifty years, as well as commentary and other memories from his long-time friend and collaborator. It is the story of an eccentric genius who went from being a penniless hacker to a millionaire and back again, a man so consumed by his vision that the real world around him has always played second fiddle. Featuring a foreword by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and cameos by the who\u2019s who of early computing, this Kerouacian journey gives us an inside look at the birth of modern computing through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneers.\nNow we are in the full campaign, and after the first week of Early Bird support, the 2600 Club Bronze level is still available, and we've unlocked all the other levels. Add-ons can be added at checkout at the end of the campaign.\n2600 CLUB\nEarly bird backer level carried forward to the full campaign\n2600 Bronze: Ebook; Vector of book artwork; VIP website access\n   \nEASYWRITER CLUB\nSigned, soft-cover copy of the book; Vector image of book artwork\n  \nHOMEBREW CLUB\nSigned, hard-cover copy of the book; Vector image of book artwork\n  \nCRUNCHBOX CLUB\nVIP will include access to downloadable book art, deleted sections and more.\n  Exclusive Blue Box styled Collector box with a signed soft-cover copy of book; Vector image of book artwork; Exclusive replica of the infamous whistle; Mouthpiece Bookmark; VIP website membership\n    HACKERS, HEROES AND DRAPERISM\nThis level is a replacement for our \u2018Old School Hackers\u2019 level. It contains an exclusive, limited edition (50) \u2018DRAPERISM\u2019 T-Shirt, signed by Crunchman and numbered (e.g. 4 of 50).

You get TEN of each item found in the Blue Box Club, plus a 1 on 1 with The Crunchman himself. This is also absolutely transferrable. The 1 on 1 can either be, you coming to meet Crunch, or Crunch coming to you. So, you can band together with a bunch of your buddies, or if your philanthropy hat is on, you can purchase this tier for an underfunded group or project.\nYOU CAN CHOOSE how to use this tier.\nSome ideas from us:\n(1) You and some buddies pitch in and get this reward level. Each of you gets schwag, and Crunch can come to you for a meet and greet.\n(2) You back this level and donate it to the local community college IT department, or local non profit, and they can set up a Crunch related event. Sell tickets! Have a Party!\n(3) You back this level yourself, go to Vegas, have dinner with Crunch, maybe see a show, etc. Then give away/sell/donate all extra items to local groups you think need to know about Crunch. (or you keep it all for yourself!)\nAnd there's more! For our Kickstarter we've created some additional goodies that will not be found anywhere else. T-shirts, posters and our extra little exclusives are available as add ons.  As we are using BackerKit, you can add these items, and manage your add-ons after the Kickstarter is finished.\n*Disclaimer: Actual items may vary slightly based on stocks and supplies from manufacturers.\nT-Shirts\nT-Shirts: 'Phreak', 2600 and Old School 'HACKERS' - $25 each\nPrints\n18\" x 24\" Book art prints, printed on premium semigloss (170gsm): Book cover and 2600 - $20 each | Bookmarks - $1\n Book bags\nJute book bags: 'Phreak' and 2600 - $18 each\nExtras\nBlack Anonabox Pro - $85 | VIP Membership - $10 | Exclusive replica of the infamous whistle - $8\n   Level Specific Stretch Goals\nIf we sell out of the Blue Box level we have a one on one zoom conference.\nFinancial Stretch Goals\n$26,000: Everyone gets a signed thank you letter from Mr Draper.\n$52,000: Everyone gets interactive pdf that links parts of the book to corresponding anecdotes, photographs and materials on the VIP section of the website.\n$78,000: Unlocks a 'udemy' style seminar with Mr Draper.\n$104,000: Unlocks a book signing event in Las Vegas with Mr Draper and special guests.\nFor those of you who don\u2019t know who Mr Draper is: John Thomas Draper (aka Captain Crunch) was an early pioneering developer at Apple Computer, in the mid to late 1970s. Among other things he developed the 'Charlie Board', an early version of a PC modem predating the DC Hayes modem. He also wrote the first word processing program, EasyWriter, for the Apple II and beat Bill Gates to the punch when it was bundled with the first IBM PC.\nIn the decades that followed Mr Draper worked with various notable people. In the 1980's he worked on Advanced 3-D Graphic Design Systems at Autodesk. In the 1990's he developed a revolutionary computer security system, considered un-hackable at the time.\nBefore all of that, he was an outlaw. In the early 1970's he was one of the 'Phone Phreaks', a group of enthusiasts who found various ways to hack the phone company and get free calls. Mr Draper became the most infamous member, and taught a lot of other people what he knew. He introduced Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs to the \u2018Blue Box\u2019, the device he used to perform some of his crimes. Steve Jobs is quoted as saying that without the Blue Box, there would be no Apple Computer. Mr Draper was hunted by the FBI for years, and went to prison three times.\nIn the last decade he has toured the world, telling his story, and speaking publicly about security flaws in telecommunications, online privacy, and encryption.\nThe Narrative\nThis book recounts stories from my years of knowing John T. Draper personally, interspersed with collected memories from his friends and relatives, and John\u2019s personal history in his own words. It spans his 74 years on the planet, and my 22 years of knowing him.\nI have been John's roommate several times, business partner, and close friend over the years. I have always considered him a very interesting case for character study, and an unfathomable wealth of complexities and paradoxes.\nI hope to have portrayed him in an honest but affectionate light. A balanced portrait of the incredible story that is his life.\n- Craig Wilson Fraser\nJohn T. Draper & Craig Wilson Fraser, Spain, 2015\n  The Foreword\nThe foreword to the biography was written by renowned inventor, electronics engineer and programmer Steve Wozniak. Mr Wozniak, along with Steve Jobs, co-founded Apple Computer. Mr Wozniak has worked with Mr Draper a few times over the years, and has remained a long standing friend and ally.\nJohn T. Draper & Steve Wozniak, 2004\n   The Excerpts\nChildhood anecdote by brother, Ron Draper\nThere was this \u2018mom and pop\u2019 super market at the end of Edith St. in Petaluma, called 'The A & B market'. It had light bulbs and licorice. John wanted bulbs. PR-2\u2019s, PR-4 flashlight bulbs, and batteries, but as usual we had no money. Our mom would not concede to John\u2019s wishes this time (these 'wishes' turned into outright demands when he became a teen), so we resorted to theft.\nI can honestly say it wasn\u2019t my idea. We had never stolen anything up to this point. I think I was blackmailed actually, but my dim memories don\u2019t have the details. We thought we would use my calm demeanor and appointed me to actually steal most of the stuff. So, I was the one caught by the store manager as we were walking out.\nWe were asked to empty our pockets. I don\u2019t remember what John had, but my pockets were loaded. I mean really loaded. 110v light bulbs, Christmas tree light bulbs, flashlight bulbs, AA batteries for my pen light (well, I thought, while I\u2019m at it). I remember the store clerk adding up all the charges and it came to quite an amount.\nJohn and the Phone Phreaks\nI got a phone call from someone calling himself Denny San Jose, who told me he knew about various methods of making free phone calls. He also said there was this whistle that blew the magic tone that disconnects long distance calls, and that he had a spare. He asked me if I could drive him to San Francisco so he could show me how it worked.\n---\nI began to realise there was more to these guys than I first thought. They were a connected and organized group, and seemed to be inviting me to join. When the discussion got around to our trip to Burlingame, we talked about what my \u2018handle\u2019 should be. Most people had just chosen their first name and city, like \u2018Denny San Jose\u2019 or \u2018Bill from New York\u2019. Well, \u2018John San Jose\u2019 was already taken, so I said \u2018how about Captain Crunch?\u2019\nThe first bust\nI suspected the FBI knew about me even before the Esquire article was released, but I had no idea how much they wanted to collar me. Up to that point all they had was the name Captain Crunch, but no way of finding out who I actually was. Most of the blind kids didn't know my phone number, and those who did had no need to write it down, but of course eventually I made the mistake of giving my number to the wrong person.\n---\nI made sure that I had removed all of my 'forbidden equipment' from my car, and stashed it in my gym locker. I took a non-working Blue Box out of my locker to take home and fix, put it in the back of my car then started the drive home. I stopped at a 7-11 to get a soda. I parked in a small parking lot next to a middle school, and just as I got out of the car, four FBI agents swooped down on me, handcuffed me, and read me my rights.\nLompoc Prison\nIn the 70's and 80's, they called Lompoc a Country Club. It was even home to Nixon's sleazy Watergate lawyer for a while, as well as many other celebrity prisoners. Contrary to popular lore however, it did not have a swimming pool, but it did have a nice gym, tennis courts, and Volleyball courts. I\u2019m not sure that it still has those facilities these days. Apparently the whole place was turned into a medium security prison in the 90s, with proper fences and razor wire.\n---\nAfter a few weeks I was promoted to landscaping. It mainly consisted of cleaning. My supervisor was a guy named Easton. I used to watch this guy while I was outside cleaning his windows. He had this habit of sucking on his walkie-talkie 'rubber duck' antenna. I'd giggle as I imagined him as a suckling baby pig, wiggling his ears in pure bliss. One day I was in his office emptying his trash bin, and he got called out of his office. I couldn't believe he left me in there. I went looking through his files, but didn't find anything of much worth, then I checked out his phone to see if I could access anything outside of the prison.\nJohn Thomas Draper - Co-author\nMr Draper is a computer pioneer, privacy advocate, and public speaker. He rose to prominence in the early phone phreaking movement of the 1970's before working on some of the most ground-breaking projects of the emerging computer era. He has lived in several US states and travelled extensively, often for months at a time. He currently lives in Las Vegas, Nevada, and is involved with various projects concerning privacy, piracy, and security.\nCraig Wilson Fraser - Co-author and editor\nMr Wilson is an author, artist and graphic designer. He has been close friends with Mr Draper for over twenty years, and they have enjoyed many adventures together. Originally from the United Kingdom, he spent several years in the United States and currently lives with his family in southern Spain.\nWe are keeping this as simple as possible. Six tiers of backer support with six simple reward packages. There is a support level for every budget.\nFor early bird backers there are Ebooks, pre-released ahead of our publishing date. If you pledge the second tier of $20, you\u2019re basically pre-ordering a first-edition signed paperback copy of the book. At the other end of the spectrum for the most devoted Crunch fans, there are some very special rewards, including some 1-on-1 time with Mr Draper himself.\nThe funds raised in the Kickstarter will be used towards printing and shipping your book. The books will be printed by Friesen Press in Victoria, Canada, shipped to our authors to be signed, and then sent for distribution to our US base.\nThe funds will also be used to pay for the costs incurred in producing the rest of the backer support level items. Every time we exceed one of our goals, we've added stretch goals in order to provide each backer with more and more value to their backer kit.\n    Reward Fulfilment, Project Timeline, & Shipping\nWhen this campaign ends on December 5, all backers will get a final check out survey sent via email. We'll collect your shipping/fulfillment information. Here you'll be able to choose from available add-ons, such as T-Shirts, Book Bags, Extra Copies of Books and other items. Until then just sit back and relax and thank you for your support! We have every intention of producing and shipping our rewards starting shortly after our funding campaign ends.\n***Please note:  Shipping costs are fully calculated at final checkout.  You are responsible for shipping and any applicable taxes, if applicable.  Book-only orders may be shipped via media mail within the continental US.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING:\nWe will use either USPS or UPS and each order will have insurance and a tracking number.\nThe books are already written and just in final editing phase.  On the last day of the campaign, we'll have a pretty good idea of how many copies we're ordering for print and we'll order them as soon as our final check out surveys are completed.  We estimate lead time and manufacture time on our rewards at 6-12 weeks, which puts us at about February/March for fulfillment. \nWwe plan to have rewards shipped no later than March 31, 2018 and you will most likely receive yours no more than 8 business days later.  \nDigital items, aside from PDF books will be fulfilled just as soon as backer funding is cleared and delivery addresses are finalized.  PDF books will be delivered 2-4 weeks prior to printed materials, depending on whether stretch goals are unlocked, which would increase production time on ebooks.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\nAll rewards will be shipped using USPS as the carrier, sent Priority Mail, will arrive within 6-10 business days, no tracking number or insurance provided.\nThe books are already written and just in final editing phase.

This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. There is a possibility that international backers may receive their rewards at a later date depending on the customs, sorting, and shipping procedures of their destination country.\nREFUNDS, RETURNS, WARRANTY\nWe do not offer refunds or returns on any items that are received as a Kickstarter reward.  However, we will address concerns on a case by case basis, as your satisfaction is important to us.  We know you understand.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, in all honesty, we are novices at Kickstarter. But please don't let that worry you! We have conferred and consulted with the best of the best. Experienced crowd funders and people at the top of their fields. Because this has been a labour of love for the whole team and nobody's taken a salary, we've done the best we can with what we have. That said - we think we've planned it out pretty good along the way.\n\nPossible obstacles:\n\nGetting the book done. \n\nTo address this, we decided not to even start the Kickstarter campaign until we were on the last step before actual publishing/printing. We chose to wait until all the writing was done, and nearly all the editing. By the time the KS launches, the last editing process will be nearly complete (if not already complete) so the only thing left will be the logistics of printing set up and detail. Then, when the KS is finished, we will have numbers and can print pretty much immediately, which greatly shortens the process for you - our backers. Of course, there could be some unforeseables in there, but we've built some padding into our timeline.\n\nBacker reward fulfillment delays:\n\nLet's face it, sometimes things happen that are out of our control. We've done everything in our power to identify reliable vendors where we have to rely on outside vendors to produce items for us. We've mapped out lead times, and kept fulfillment to digital formats and within our control as much as possible. \n\nWe've finalized our designs, mocked up our rewards and completed every process aside from pulling the trigger on order amounts. \n\nOf course we'll keep you all apprised if anything beyond our control occurs, but we think we've darn near thought of everything and anticipate being right on track.\n\nWhat if you don't get funded?\n\nWe think we've set a pretty reasonable funding goal, so we don't think that this will happen. But, if it does, then we'll still publish the book - you just won't be able to get all these awesome extras. You'll be able to buy copies on the publisher's website, when it is published and available to the public. \n\nWe hope this does not happen, of course. We worked hard to bring you an awesome campaign and we hope you take advantage of it and encourage all your peeps to do the same thing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Go Team Crunch!", "descp": "This is a support level that allows you to just throw a bit of money at us to show your support.

People have done farm to table for years, as have chocolateers done bean to bar. We intend to follow this tradition with something new, taking sugar cane and making candy from it.\nLofty Pursuits has been making hard candy for some time. We had another Kickstarter several years back where we raised money to buy a collection of hard candy making equipment that was from a candy store in Cincinnati called Mullanes. We have used this equipment made between the 1860's and 1900 making candy using standard sugar.\nNow we want to make candy not just using equipment from the late 1800's. But starting with sugar grown on a farm from the 1800's. Tallahassee has a historical farm that is maintained and worked as if it was in the 1800's. They still make cane syrup here, and they still cook the syrup over a wood fire.\nWe've worked with them since last year, and we're about to go through a second harvest and cooking to make a video about it. That's where you come in. We need your support to make this video.\nThis is one of a series of videos we want to make that has little to do with the candy we make. In this case we are making a video about a candy that we don't think can become a regular product. What we make will be the rewards for here. Our stretch goals are for videos that are of other folks making candy. We call this series \"Travels with Greg\" and not only don't they generate sales to offset the videos, but they are expensive to make. They are also the videos I enjoy making the most because I get to get out and learn or discover things. You can see the three I made here.\nThis project will produce one long video (expected 1/2 hour) or possibly three to four shorter videos. We need to see the footage to decide what we will be doing with this video. This does not include the stretch videos that will be additional videos. \nPart one: Harvesting sugar cane, making cane syrup.\nPart two: Working with that sugar to make hard candy.\nI want to Include in this video a lot of history on the machines from the 1800's we use, this will include a trip to where the equipment was used in Cincinnati, a trip to the remains of a large plantation where they have what's left of a steam powered cane juicer.\nThere is a lot of experimentation here that we hope to get into the video, and of course we will make some unique candy using ingredients grown here in the Tallahassee area.\nIf you know of us, you know of our YouTube channel, if not check it out. http://www.Youtube.com/LoftyPursuits\nWe have a lot of candy experience, and a lot of candy making video experience. You can check our our candy store here: http://www.pd.net\nYou can of course buy our regular candy here even if you don't want to pledge this campaign.\nWe hope you will support this investigation into the past and future of candy making\nAmazing! It took about 2 hours to become fully funded, and we\u2019re still going.\nSince we have you here, and we\u2019d love to do more, here is what we will do with extra funding. Keep in mind this is a plan, some of these things might not work out, but I really want to try. (new rewards coming soon) These goals are divided into three things, things I can't normally afford to do. \nCool travels with greg videos, where I go around the country to find old or other cool candy makers and make candy with them\nWe already donate a bunch of candy every year to good causes, but I'd like to have myself and my staff make candy to donate around the country this holiday season. With this one we are looking for your suggestions where to donate the candy canes we will make, and when we have a list we approve, the backers will have a chance to vote to where we will send them.\nWe've traveled in 2015 to the Makers Fair in Orlando. There is no cost effective way for us to do go on the road, there events like this just can't buy enough candy to make it worth while for us to go.  Since we get regular requests to come and make candy where you are (that we can't do), we thought we'd add this as a reward. I want to ideally do four of these in the USA. Central south, Central north, North East, West coast. We are currently working out plans to be in the Austin makers fair (food permission always makes this tricky due to food contracts with the halls they have the event.) We are open to suggestions of other places to go as long as the public can come. \nNow on to the stretch goals\nWe will make another video in 2018, where we modify a whiskey still to become a steam distiller to distill flavors for candy making from plants. We will probably only be able to make a few ML\u2019s of the essential oils, but I want to try and make some. If we can make enough we will make some candy out of it, if not it should still be cool going from local plants to flavor oils (I hope to do grapefruit oil from a tree in my back yard.) This uses the same techniques I described as being used in the video where we make lavender candy. If we can make enough we will try and throw in a few pieces of candy with your pledge (1 or 2 small pieces, it won\u2019t make much oil) ave some water in it.)\nDONE! $8,000\nWe will travel sometime in 2018 to the Hercules Candy Company featured in the No Egg Craig videos to shoot a video with them at their shop. I hope to learn about gummies and corn starch molded candy, but I will shoot whatever they are making then.\nHercules Candy and Chocolate Shop\nDONE! $23,000  \n    We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\nDONE! $26,000\n  Uncle Wiggly Wings\nI will go and interview Uncle Wiggly Wings AKA the Berlin Candy Bomber at his home. I've gotten in touch with him through his daughter and arranged a shooting time early next year if we reach this goal. Colonel Gail Halvorsen was a C-54 pilot for the Berlin air lift during WWII, he was one of the first to land with supplies in Berlin after the Soviet Union started the siege on the city. He went to the fence of the air field and found kids watching the planes land, some of whom may never have tasted chocolate because they were born during the war. He passed out the candy bars he had, and the kids divided it up, but there was not nearly enough. When the chocolate ran out, they tore little pieces of the foil off and passed them around, so the kids who did not get any could just smell the candy. He agreed to drop more candy from his plane the next day. The kids asked what is plane number was, and as he did not have an assigned plane (he flew whatever they gave him for the day) he drew on his barn storming experience and would \u201cwiggle\u201d his wings. That night back in his barracks, he got candy bars, tied them to handkerchiefs to use as parachutes (to keep the candy from hitting the kids at 200mph), and for the next week he dropped candy daily to the kids. He was about to stop dropping the candy but his commander got wind of this, and insisted he continue because of the great moral boost it was. He dropped 23 tons of candy during project \u201clittle vittles\u201d with the other pilots that worked with him, much of the candy donated by members of the National Confectioner's Association. One of the candy companies that supplied candy was Mullanes, that originally owned much of the hard candy equipment we use. We will to visit him, interview him, and make some candy for him, inspired by his story. His story has been documented many times, but has never covered how he got candy companies to participate and how the candy was organized. This will be documenting something new. He is currently 97, so we want to do this soon as possible.\n$31,000\n   We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\n$34,000\nWe will travel to another event to make candy hopefully closer to you. We are open to suggestions for events, we just want them big enough so lots of people can come. We are currently working on the Austin Makers Fair in 2018, but we are open to other locations if you have suggestions. We hope to raise enough money to do three of these in 2018.\n$39,000\n  Robert Hillary King was wrongly convicted and spent 32 years in Angola prison in Louisiana, 29 of them in solitary confinement. He learned how to make pralines when it solitary confinement, by burning paper in soda cans to cook the candies and he gathered ingredients from other prisoners and guards. This is the ultimate candy hacking to figure out how to do this. Since the charges have been dropped he has been released and now makes candy that he sells on-line under the name Freelines. His autobiography is a must read (but sadly covers little in the way of candy making.) We hope to document his story, and how he discovered how to make candy in prison, and we'd like to make candy with Mr. King. \n$44,000\n   We are known for our candy canes, and every year we make candy canes for giveaways and charities. This year you can help us make and give away even more of them. We will make a four of our standard batches of candy canes (approximately 400 hand made candy canes) that we will distribute to a charity to bring some cheer this holiday season. We are researching charities that can effectively distribute these (if you know of some, let us know) we will get an \u201capproved\u201d list together and have our backers vote to select the one (or ones) to donate to.\n$47,000\nWe will travel to another event to make candy hopefully closer to you. We are open to suggestions for events, we just want them big enough so lots of people can come. We hope to raise enough money to do three of these in 2018. Charity events are a great start. We have some requirements.\n$52,000\nWe want to visit a candy factory in Salem MA, we are still trying to get up with them to arrange this, so this goal may change before we hit this level if we even come close. This shop makes the oldest commercially manufactured candy in the USA. We want to make candy with them. We will flesh this out if it comes together.\n$Unknown\n(more to come)\nI\u2019ve been outlining this, researching this and finding people to work with for about two years. We want to trace the sugar trade to the development of the candy trade, from Haiti and the slave trade to sugar, to the Indo-Guyanese indentured workers in guyana. I want to visit both countries and shoot footage starting there, and tracing the sugar\u2019s path up into the north east to Philadelphia, where it was processed not only into Rum to ship to England, but also to create Americas candy trade. This is why companies like Hershey\u2019s, Wilber\u2019s chocolates, Quaker City Chocolate, Jordon Almonds, Peeps, Mike and Ikes, Hot Tamales, Mallo Cups, and others were based there. This is also why Thomas Mills and Brothers, the company that made most of our equipment (they made it back in the late 1800\u2019s) was based there too. It will follow the sugar up and through the great lakes to Chicago, were candy making took off, and one company was founded to fund a religious cult (The cult is gone, but his candy is still around.) Then, if I can, I want to stretch project this project to see how sugar and more specifically candy making in the modern day has still shaped culture, race relations, and candy makers. This topic has been covered in many places, but it\u2019s role in the development of candy making has not. This will not be as cheery as most of my videos. This project should take about 2-3 years to make if funded. It is a big one folks and will require a crew, international travel, possibly another round of funding. I already have two candy historians on board to help beyond me. The final video will be released to all backers at any level free, but may be released commercially or free. I have been working on an outline for this project for two years, and I hope you find it as interesting as I do. If I don't get full funding for this, we get funding over time from other fundraising efforts.\n$150,000\nReward Photos\nWe have been asked to show some photos of our rewards. \nOld Glory Candy\n  A unicorn dropping. This is a particular nice tutti frutti one. Yours will be of a random flavor.\n  Candy Canes", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are some risks with this, but few with the video production. We have lots of experience making candy videos, and the video is the main product. The risks are with the outcome of the candy, and we hope you all want to be part of this experiment. Like many experiments we are not 100% sure of what the outcome will be.\n\nCane sugar by its nature has particles in it. It could crystallize, it could burn; this is fairly unexplored territory in candy making. This is science more than an art in many ways, so we don't expect any issues. But here are the ones we can foresee and what we will do if they happen.\n\nThere will be testing time needed with this candy. And by testing, I mean making a small batch and seeing what the candy will do in a week or two. We need to test of crystallization, that we want to avoid, as well as if the candy breaks down in other ways. This will be lots of hurry up and wait. We have budgeted for that time in the dates for the rewards, but it could take longer than those dates if this happens. If this problem occurs we will keep you informed, and we will just get you your candy a bit late.\n\nThe cane sugar may crystallize in tests because it won't invert with an acid. \nSolution: We will add some invert sugar to prevent crystallization (probably a small amount of corn syrup) so your candy will be great, but it will not be only made entirely from cane syrup. Just mostly from cane syrup.\n\nThe cane sugar might not harden completely since cane syrup is more of a hydrophile than granulated sugar. This would mean the candy will be sticky. Solution: You will get a bag of sticky but yummy candy.\n\nThere is always the possibility that everything could got wrong and we have no cane syrup candy to ship. Solution: The real goal of this kickstarter is to make the video, and a video of failure is an interesting video as well. To make it up to you we will make some cool hand made candy (possibly with the word \u201coops\u201d in the middle of it) so that you end up with some delicious candy. \n\nWe will get you candy, and we expect to get you the candy you want, but we will deliver something in any event.\n\nRisk for some of the stretch goal videos:\nWe want to interview a man who is 97 years old. Enough said.\n\nWe are still arranging to make sure these videos can be made.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Postcard", "descp": "A thank you post card with a photo of us making this candy.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Lofty Stickers", "descp": "Get a strip of three of our Lofty Pursuits candy stickers and a post card as a thank you for the level of sponsorship.\nINCLUDES:\nPost Card\nThree Lofty Pursuits Stickers\nDownloadable copy of the video", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Lost Flavors Taster Assortment", "descp": "A selection of rare candy drops from Lofty Pursuits.

Each one is different.\nThey\u2019re being launched exclusively on Kickstarter. If we meet our target we can put them into production - giving you beautiful one-of-a-kind tableware and us the opportunity to expand and continue investing in our neighbourhood.\nWho we are\nGranby Workshop is a Liverpool based manufacturer of architectural ceramics, founded by Turner Prize winning design collective Assemble. The Workshop was set up as part of an effort to rebuild Granby, a Liverpool neighbourhood that was nearly made derelict by decades of poorly-planned regeneration initiatives.\nA resourceful, creative group of residents started to bring the neighbourhood back to life by clearing, planting, painting, and campaigning. And in 2011 they entered into an innovative form of community land ownership to secure empty houses, and renovate them as affordable homes \u2013 bringing in Assemble to help. \nThe project won the Turner Prize in 2015. It received a lot of press attention and you can read more about it in The New York Times, The Guardian, The BBC, Creative Review and more\nThe first range of products by Granby Workshop were designed for the houses being renovated: bathroom tiles, door handles and fireplaces. They reflected the care, value and creativity invested in these homes, and are now even held in the permanent collections of the V&A and the Crafts Council.\nNow we want to introduce new products to help grow the workshop and expand the team. You\u2019ll get beautiful one-of-a-kind tableware, and we\u2019ll be able to keep producing exciting new products, and investing in Granby.  \nThe Products\nWe\u2019re beginning a foray into an exciting new manufacturing process with a pair of products: a plate and cup. This is our very first range of tableware and it\u2019s a nod to the social side of the community that we\u2019re in.\nIt\u2019s also part of an effort to scale up our approach \u2013 one that began by researching and tracking down RAMBO, our 60 tonne RAM Press. With this new tool, we want to combine our craft mentality with more industrial processes, in order to really push the limits of what we can create.\nThese are plates and cups for eating and drinking together, produced in sets, with each set showing the variety of patterns produced through the SPLATWARE process.\nThey are playful & celebratory, perfect for special occasions but durable enough for everyday use!\nSPLATWARE #1 : Cup\nSuitable for hot and cold drinks. This isn\u2019t a teacup, a mug, a goblet or a chalice. It is a cup, as simple as it comes. Just about the right size for most things you\u2019d like to drink. It comes in one size (8oz) but many different patterns and colours. Cheers !\nSPLATWARE #2 : Plate \nA circular, 25cm diameter glazed ceramic plate. Suitable for all kinds of tasty meals. \nThe Finish \nThe effect created by combining these multi-coloured clays is reminiscent of Agateware or Nerikomi ceramics. Like these traditional craft techniques, the patterning is not a glaze effect or transfer \u2013 the clay itself is coloured through the body, giving a unique depth of colour and finish.\nThe pieces are glazed and fired to vitrification temperature at 1250 celsius, meaning they are completely food, dishwasher & microwave safe. They are durable enough to be kept as family heirlooms for generations to come.\nThe first edition of splatware is exclusive to Kickstarter and all products will be stamped. As well as being functional objects, you could see them as affordable art pieces - perfect as a gift or a keepsake, and who knows, one day they might even be collectible.\nSplatware is made using a process that captures an element of chance in the act of making, so they\u2019re all unique. Exact colours and patterns will be something of a surprise. \n How they're made\nTo stoneware clay, we add varying amounts of ceramic pigments. Separate pieces of the colorful clays are placed together in a mould and compressed with 60 tonnes of pressure. This mixes and bonds the different colours together and forces the excess moisture out of the clay. \nThe pieces are stamped, de-moulded, dried, carefully trimmed and cleaned before their first kiln firing to 1000 degrees. They\u2019re then sanded, glazed and re-fired to 1250 to reach full hardness. It\u2019s a blend of precision craft and backyard science that has taken a great deal of trial and error to perfect.\nWhy do these products matter?\nCeramics has been integral to the development of our cultures. From tools for cooking and eating to the production of durable building materials, its history interweaves the functioning of our daily lives with the development of industry.\nThe potters wheel was one of the first man-made machines, and in the 18th & 19th Century, ceramics became one of the first highly industrialized processes. In Stoke on Trent, Wedgewood and others pioneered factory-line models of production, based around singular, highly repetitive tasks. Speed, repetition and consistency. Every product produced exactly the same. This is more or less how most mass-produced ceramics are still made, except that with the globalization of manufacturing it largely happens in other parts of the world.\nWe\u2019re interested in a different model of production, one in which chance and creativity are introduced to the production line, so that products remain enjoyable and challenging to make, and the outcomes are always different. We also believe that our business should be community-orientated - about developing and sharing skills and facilities in our neighbourhood.\nGranby Workshop Wares\nImportantly, this model is not just about how things work behind the scenes \u2013 it\u2019s about creating products which have a diversity and beauty which isn\u2019t possible using conventional manufacturing techniques. Every product is different.\nWhat have we done so far?\nSplatware began by researching and tracking down RAMBO, our 60 tonne RAM Press. It is no spring chicken - we bought it from a ceramics factory in Stoke-on-trent, where in a past life it was producing fine bone china sweet and biscuit trays. Weighing in at 5000kgs it\u2019s a beast, so much so that it broke the floor of the factory that it was removed from.\nMilan Mini Living - Test plates\nBefore arriving in Granby, Rambo went on a test run journey to Milan to be part of Milan Design Week where, with the support of A/D/O we first began developing the techniques that have evolved into Splatware.\nBack in Granby, we extended the workshop to make room for RAMBO, and have undertaken countless tests and experiments with different clays, stains and techniques to develop a method for making SPLATWARE that retains its coherance as a set of tableware but allows for variety and experimentation in each individual piece. With our first set of moulds made we\u2019ve produced a full batch of prototypes, allowing us to test our initial designs and run through the full production cycle. Having done this, we\u2019ve adjusted and improved the designs to work better with the physics of the ram-pressing process and now we\u2019re ready to get production moulds made. \nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nYour support will mean that we can make you beautiful products and we can continue to invest in our neighbourhood.\nWe\u2019ve already invested a lot in this new process, and we need a large order to be able to go into production and to be able to sell the products at a reasonable price. We\u2019ll be able to buy materials in bulk, commission high quality production moulds and continue to invest in the workshop to expand our capacity for the future. This will include allowing us to install a larger kiln, drying racks and most importantly, to train new staff.\nWe\u2019re a creative, community-orientated business. By supporting our campaign you are helping to launch an exclusive range of products that have been developed and made in Granby.\nEach set will be made to order, by us, for you and they\u2019ll all be different. We hope they serve you well for many meals to come !\nThank you !\nGranby Workshop & Assemble\nTimeline\nWe won\u2019t compromise on quality, and since we won\u2019t know the level of demand until the campaign ends, we\u2019ve set realistic dates to avoid disappointment. We know some of these dates seem long, but quality comes first and we would rather surprise you with early delivery then risk not meeting your expectations.\n9th September \u2013 5th October \u2013 Kickstarter Campaign\nOctober: Order materials, manufacture production moulds \nNovember: Fit production moulds, Batch-mix clay with pigments.

We have come to realize that setbacks can happen, but having produced a full prototype batch of products from start to finish, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ve ironed out the lions share of these issues. Anything that we encounter along the way, well that\u2019s always part of the journey but we have a great team and we\u2019re in no doubt that we\u2019ll be able to deal with it. It\u2019s a step up in our production methods but that\u2019s part of the challenge and why its worthwhile.\n\nIf the campaign really takes off, some of you may have to wait a little longer for your products since we have to make each of them individually and we have a limited production capacity. We\u2019ve tried to be conservative with our timeline and we\u2019ll keep you fully updated along the way and promise that your unique, one-of-a-kind splatware cups and plates will be well worth the wait.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Splatware Print", "descp": "A beautiful limited edition print by Granby Workshop's own Sumuyya Khader.

The cutlery cluster of Wazirabad is recognized all over the world for its traditional designs, unique products, high quality, hand-made products such as hunting knives, pocket knives, daggers, swords, axes, military knives, utensils, table cutlery, household and light industrial products.\nWairabad - The City Of Cutlery\n In Pakistan the cutlery industry has not experienced technological evolution and thus has not benefited from the economies of scale. The industry comprises of small and medium scale industries. This sector has been facing great challenges particularly from China, India and Taiwan which have grabbed a large chunk of Pakistan\u2019s export market. The declining trend in cutlery export has been due to a rise in petroleum and diesel prices. The rise in prices of oil has further increased the input cost of the industry and made it difficult for them to survive in the international market\n  Damascus\nTraditional Damascus steel, also known as Pattern Weld, Damascene, or Damast, was first produced over two thousand years ago. Damascus swords and knives dominated the weapon industry from the Iron Age to the Viking age. Alexander the Great was said to have had a Damascus sword, and even Aristotle commented on the high quality of the Damascus steel blade. Damascus steel was the name that the Crusaders gave to the steel that they had witnessed slicing through their own, lesser quality swords, cutting the sword in half in a single swipe without ever losing its edge. The next swipe would do the same to the body of that less fortunate Crusader.\nKHANJAR\nProject by :\n  YOUR CONTRIBUTION\nI am introducing finest piece of arts from our family business back in Pakistan (Wazirabad) DK-Cutlery.

You turn the inner dial to the set number and start deciphering his message letter by letter until it comes together! Once decoded, you can ponder Wilbur's mysterious words and interpret them on your own. These secret messages will be at the end of each blog post.\nThe Official Membership Card is signed and approved by Wilbur Wonder to signify that you are a part of the elite Futurist Co. Society. Attached to the membership card is the The Futurist Co. Lapel Pin. Wear your pin proud on a jacket, backpack, or bag and it will catch someone's eye.\nThe Official Golden Certificate. This certificate can be hung or displayed to show that you are a true Futurist! If you want to keep your membership a secret, then storing it away as a keepsake in a nice hiding spot will do as well.\nThe Futurist Co. introduces The Wilbur Wonder Almanac 2018-2023! Take a peak into the future with the Almanac that many would love to get their hands on! This Almanac will only be issued to members of The Futurist Co. Secret Society! DO NOT SHOW OR GIVE THIS TO ANYONE WHO IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE FUTURIST CO. That is all I can say about this book. Aren't you curious?\nWho Is Wilbur Wonder?  \nThe mystery which surrounds The Futurist Co. is stirred up by Wilbur Wonder. He is a time traveler who visits the future from time to time (yes they are out there). You think I'm joking, don't you? I assure you this isn't some kind of stunt, and to prove it, he will speak of his travels. This type of behavior, however, is quite dangerous. You see, a fundamental rule of a futurist is to keep the memories of your travels to yourself. If the future is altered due to pre-obtained knowledge, then there will be a price to pay. As a member of The Futurist Co. you will be able to learn all of Wilbur's secrets of the future through his blog and podcast which will broadcast on www.thefuturistco.com. It is your responsibility to stay loyal to Wilbur and to all the rest of the futurists out there and keep the secrets within the society. They will be watching!\n\"Curiosity of the future lies deep within all of us. What a wonderful gift it would be to discover it before anyone else. I welcome you into my world to do just that.\"\n The Official Futurist Co. Lapel Pin and Membership Card\nThe Only One Of Its Kind! The \"Silver\" Futurist Co. Secret Decoder used by Wilbur Wonder himself!\nThe Futurist Co. Secret Society Decoder uses an old Roman encryption method. All members will receive a copper decoder.\n Go to www.thefuturistco.com to follow Wilbur Wonder!\nYou have reached the end of this campaign, you think it's a cute idea and decide to leave without joining The Futurist Co. Secret Society, but wait...\nRead below:  \nTime Travel Is Possible But Only To The Future  \nWe may be able to book our ticket to the future someday \u2014 it\u2019ll just be a one-way trip.  \nIn a presentation at the British Science Festival, particle physicist Brian Cox said that time travel is possible but only in one direction.  \n\u201cThe central question is, can you build a time machine? The answer is yes, you can go into the future,\u201d the University of Manchester professor told the audience during his hour-long speech on Tuesday, according to The Telegraph. \u201cYou\u2019ve got almost total freedom of movement in the future.\u201d  \nCox detailed how time travel to the future is possible under Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Traveling hundreds, or even thousands of years into the future, could be accomplished if someone was traveling at an incredibly fast pace, close to the speed of light.  \nDiscovery News equated the theory to the so-called \u201cTwin Paradox:  \n\u201dImagine twins, one stays on Earth (Twin A) while the other (Twin B) boards a spaceship and flies off at relativistic speeds. Compared with Twin A\u2019s timeframe, Twin B\u2019s timeframe will slow. If time is running slower for Twin B, then he/she will return to Earth where a lot more time has passed and Twin A has aged significantly more than Twin B. The mechanism behind this is \u201ctime dilation\u201d and it has a stronger effect as you travel closer and closer to the speed of light. \"  \nComing back from the future or traveling to another point in the past is much less likely, according to Cox.  \nRelating his theory to the popular British science fiction show \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Cox explained that the time-traveling Doctor would need to find a wormhole in order to return to the past. The theoretical bridge, or shortcut through space-time, proposed under Einstein\u2019s general-relativity theory has never been proven to exist. And, even if a wormhole were discovered or created, there\u2019s no telling whether humans could actually use it to travel through time.  \nCox isn\u2019t the only one to theorize that a wormhole could allow time-travelers to travel backward in time. Earlier this year, astrophysicist Eric W. Davis of the EarthTech International Institute for Advanced Studies said that a wormhole would be the best option for back-in-time travel. But, Davis acknowledged, it would \u201ctake a Herculean effort to turn a wormhole into a time machine.\u201d  \n-Sara Gates, The Huffington Post", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have all prototypes approved and ready to run as soon as we hit our goal.

They're always very happy and curious, and should you find one, it will be your friend for life. However, Chaffies do have a tendency to get themselves lost, so the aim of this Kickstarter campaign is to make finding one that little bit easier.\n'FIND CHAFFY' began over ten years ago as a spoof 'lost pet' campaign. We handmade some Chaffies out of fabric and sent them across the world, asking anyone who found one to show us where they ended up. We received hundreds of sightings from countries as far and wide as:\nWe then collected all these sightings together on the Find Chaffy Website!\nOur campaign took a new direction with 'Find Chaffy - The Book', a highly-illustrated picture book published by Scholastic (UK) and translated into a number of different languages. Since then, our ongoing search for Chaffies has grown and grown, through a variety of different mediums. From real-life treasure hunts across London, to iOS Messenger stickers, to Find Chaffy cartoons and animations such as this one...\n(Animated by Birdbox Studios, Produced by Mind Candy)\nNow, with your help, we're hoping to relaunch Chaffies in vinyl, and take our worldwide search to the next level!\nThe aim of this Kickstarter is to raise enough money to produce at least 500 Chaffy vinyl figures. Vinyl is lightweight and durable, making this new series of Chaffy perfect for taking on adventures.\nOnce you find a Chaffy, we hope you'll share your Chaffy photos with us across Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, and we'll regularly gather together some of the best to show on our website. There you'll be able to see all the amazing places Chaffies have been found, along with loads of fun Chaffy artwork, animations, and updates.\nWe've planned our Kickstarter target so, as well as the Chaffy itself, we can also offer you a load of extra Find Chaffy goodies. Later tiers include reprints of the book, a print set of the best Find Chaffy cartoons, and original artwork. We've also been careful to make sure a Chaffy is the same price for everyone, wherever in the world you are, with no hidden shipping costs (although we can't be liable for any import duties which may apply in your country).\nWhen you find a Chaffy, this is what you get:\n(All the model Chaffies shown in this Kickstarter campaign originally made by Kerry Dyer. Final versions may vary slightly. PLEASE NOTE: Chaffies are sold as vinyl figures rather than toys, and as such may not be suitable for very young children)\nIf you'd like to find your own Chaffy, we've prepared a number of different options for you to choose from. EVERY Chaffy comes with the extras listed in the first tier, and all prices include worldwide delivery! \n** DIGITAL SPECIAL! All tiers come with a free PDF of 'Find Chaffy - The Book', but if you want the PDF on its own you can choose this option for only \u00a33!**\nINCLUDES:\n\u2022 One CHAFFY VINYL FIGURE (with sketch card, mini booklet, certificate and set of four art cards) \n\u2022 A PDF of 'Find Chaffy - The Book'.\n (Want to see which prints are in the set?

I\u2019ll create an exclusive A4 comic page just for you. It can be about whatever you want, and, if you like, feature any of my characters. Want me to draw an exclusive Chaffy comic for you? Want me to draw you IN a comic with Looshkin? Want me to draw your kids running around with Bunny Vs Monkey? Want me to just draw a comic about a sad banana? Hey, you\u2019re the boss!\nI\u2019ll discuss with you what you want me to do, if you have any ideas for a script, and any requests for what should appear. Then I\u2019ll go away and write a rough script for your approval. Once approved, I\u2019ll turn this script into a finished, colour, single-page comic (approx 9 \u2013 12 panels).\nOnce complete, I\u2019ll send you a digital version of the finished artwork, as well as an A4 colour print, and the original black and white inkwork! \nMy only restrictions are that the comic must be within the bounds of taste and decency, and if it features one of my original characters or a copyrighted character then it can\u2019t be reprinted in a publication \u2013 this is only for personal use.\nI very rarely do commissions, so this is a great chance to get an exclusive, unique comic! To see more examples of my comic work, check out my site at www.fumboo.com\n\u2022  Also includes 3 Chaffies (I\u2019ll most likely hide one in your comic too), and everything else from the TREATS tier.\n(Want to see a sample of the picture search? Click HERE!)\n\u2022 COMMISSION YOUR OWN FIND CHAFFY PICTURE SEARCH! I'll create an exclusive Find Chaffy picture search puzzle for you. You and I can discuss what animal/creature you want to be the theme, and also any other things you might want to hide in there - perhaps yourself, your children, your pets. Anything you like (within the bounds of taste and decency)! \n\u2022 Once complete, I'll send you a digital version of the finished full colour artwork, as well as an A3 colour print, and the A2 original black and white lineart.\n\u2022 Also includes ten Chaffies (real life versions of the Chaffies hidden in your picture!) and everything else from Tier 4.\nThis is a very rare chance to commission such a unique and personal piece of art!\nWhichever tier you choose, as long as your tier includes a physical item (such as the Chaffy figure, the paperback book, or the print set), then you can always order ADDITIONAL copies of those things. Want a load of Chaffies to hand out to your friends? Want extra books to pass onto your school? Well just add the following amounts to your total, and when our Kickstarter campaign is over we'll send out a survey asking you to confirm which extras you've ordered.\n(By the way, if you've already pledged and later decide you want to add extras, you can do this at any time during the campaign by clicking 'manage your pledge' and adding the extra amount!)\nNot only does every extra Chaffy you order come with its own sketch card, mini booklet, certificate and set of four art cards, we'll also include an exclusive set of FIND CHAFFY FRIENDSHIP STICKERS!\n(Any tiers involving multiple Chaffy vinyl figures will also receive these stickers)\nReaching the target would be utterly incredible, and really enable Find Chaffy to become something special. However, just in case the campaign goes even better than expected, we've prepared a few stretch goals. Once unlocked, these bonus items will ship to everyone who funds at certain tiers (to be announced).\nWhile it can be tricky with a Kickstarter campaign to work out the exact costings, we've done our best to estimate what we'll need to make this work. In fact we've slightly over-estimated, so there's enough of a buffer to cover any problems.\nThe \u00a38,500 target breaks down like this:\n(Please note: All amounts are estimates, and pie chart isn't to exact scale)\nWe'll be working with Madebycooper to produce the Chaffy vinyl figures, Comic Printing UK for the Find Chaffy books, and Awesome Merchandise for the extras - all of whom come very highly recommended in their respective industries!\nI have run two crowdfunding campaigns before: The first was to self-publish a comic book, the second to raise money and send comics to Readathon. Both beat their targets, and were successfully fulfilled.\nFor this campaign, we're hoping to have everything ready and shipped out by the end of November this year, just in time for Christmas. Unforeseen circumstances may of course arise, but we've checked and triple-checked our schedule, our accounting, everything we can. In short: I want Find Chaffy to be appreciated by as many people as possible, so I'll be working hard to try and make sure everything happens as planned.\nHello! My name is Jamie Smart, and I've been working full-time as an illustrator for nearly 20 years. For most of that time I have been lucky enough to write and draw my own comics, including titles such as Bear, Bunny Vs Monkey, Space Raoul, Whubble and Fish-Head Steve. I created and edited the children's anthology Moose Kid Comics, released a number of childrens books, created a number of long-running webcomics, and worked extensively in TV development.\nNot only that, but I've been allowed to work on other people's well-known properties too, including illustrating my own Doctor Who book (eek!), and writing and drawing such classic characters as Desperate Dan and Roger The Dodger for The Dandy and The Beano.\nMy full client list includes: The Phoenix, The Beano, The Dandy, Toxic, Scholastic, OUP, DFB, Random House, Cartoon Network and Disney.

(I'm sure the only cure is more pin badges...). My first Kickstarter campaign saw two of my illustrations successful brought to life in enamel pin badge form - and now I am hooked!!\nI was playing around with 'spooky' ideas and sketched a little potion bottle which instantly seemed right to be made into an enamel pin.  Starting this campaign now means that the pins will be (if funded!) produced and shipped in plenty of time to be this years most wanted Halloween accessory!! \nTHE PIN DESIGN\nGlow in the Dark Hard Enamel Pin Badge\nThe first pin will be something along the lines of the above image - with the special added feature that the skull and cross-bones GLOW IN THE DARK!!!\nGlow in the dark poison potion bottle - spookily good!\nThis will be the first time I have used a Glow in the Dark feature on a pin - have to say I am a tiny little bit excited to say the least!\nDetails of the pin:\nApprox. 30mm high \nHard Enamel \nGlow in the dark fill on the Skull and Cross-bones\nColoured Rubber Clutch \nWill come affixed to an illustrated backing card\nPLEDGES / EARLY BIRD REWARD LEVELS\nBy backing this project you will help me raise the funds to get these pins manufactured.  The majority of the goal amount covers the production of the pins, the amount that remains relates to postage and packaging costs in shipping the pins out to backers. \nFor those 'Early Birds' to the campaign - there are special pledge amounts for those who support this campaign early on.  Look for the 'Early Bird pledge amount - and grab yourself 1, 3 or 5 pins at a sweet, sweet deal!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nStretch Goal - Luck Potion - UNLOCKED!\n  I have other potion designs - that if the funding exceeds the stretch goal amounts listed above - will be 'unlocked'.  At the end of the campaign - backers will be able to choose which pins they would like from those 'unlocked' pins. The image above gives a hint as to what they will be - the design will be revealed as the campaign progresses / we get nearer to the goals!\nPoison - Goal - \u00a3250 **Met in 12 hours!**\nLove - Stretch Goal - \u00a3450 **UNLOCKED**\nFame - Stretch Goal - \u00a3650 **UNLOCKED**\nHappiness - Stretch Goal - \u00a3900  **UNLOCKED**\nLuck - Stretch Goal - \u00a31300 **UNLOCKED**\nThe original two stretch goals were reached within 7 days (THANK YOU!) - so a 4th pin has now been added to the line up.  UPDATE! - The 4th stretch goal has been reached - so the 'Happiness' pin design has now been unlocked! A 5th and final stretch goal of \u00a31300 has been set - which will unlock a 'Luck' pin.  Since this started with a 'Glow in the Dark' pin - it seemed fitting to end on one too!  **UPDATE** - this goal too has been reached - so all 5 pins designs will be availble to backers to choose from!\nOnce the campaign ends - backers will be able to chose from any of the unlocked pins (within the number they have pledged for).\nPOSTAGE\nOnce i have received the pins all post will be sent out UK standard class or standard international shipping for around the world. This means no tracking numbers will be available with standard shipping (although I always obtain proof of postage). \nIf you would like a tracked delivery service then please don't hesitate to get in touch and I can let you know how much extra this would cost.\nWant to know more about me and Bird House Press?\nI'm on Facebook, and Twitter - but being a visual person my home is on instagram!!

Secret Society, but wait... \nRead below:\nTime Travel Is Possible But Only To The Future\nWe may be able to book our ticket to the future someday \u2014 it\u2019ll just be a one-way trip.  \nIn a presentation at the British Science Festival, particle physicist Brian Cox said that time travel is possible but only in one direction.  \n\u201cThe central question is, can you build a time machine? The answer is yes, you can go into the future,\u201d the University of Manchester professor told the audience during his hour-long speech on Tuesday, according to The Telegraph. \u201cYou\u2019ve got almost total freedom of movement in the future.\u201d  \nCox detailed how time travel to the future is possible under Albert Einstein\u2019s general theory of relativity. Traveling hundreds, or even thousands of years into the future, could be accomplished if someone was traveling at an incredibly fast pace, close to the speed of light.  \nDiscovery News equated the theory to the so-called \u201cTwin Paradox:\n\u201d Imagine twins, one stays on Earth (Twin A) while the other (Twin B) boards a spaceship and flies off at relativistic speeds. Compared with Twin A\u2019s timeframe, Twin B\u2019s timeframe will slow. If time is running slower for Twin B, then he/she will return to Earth where a lot more time has passed and Twin A has aged significantly more than Twin B. The mechanism behind this is \u201ctime dilation\u201d and it has a stronger effect as you travel closer and closer to the speed of light. \"\nComing back from the future or traveling to another point in the past is much less likely, according to Cox.  \nRelating his theory to the popular British science fiction show \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d Cox explained that the time-traveling Doctor would need to find a wormhole in order to return to the past. The theoretical bridge, or shortcut through space-time, proposed under Einstein\u2019s general-relativity theory has never been proven to exist. And, even if a wormhole were discovered or created, there\u2019s no telling whether humans could actually use it to travel through time.  \nCox isn\u2019t the only one to theorize that a wormhole could allow time-travelers to travel backward in time. Earlier this year, astrophysicist Eric W. Davis of the EarthTech International Institute for Advanced Studies said that a wormhole would be the best option for back-in-time travel. But, Davis acknowledged, it would \u201ctake a Herculean effort to turn a wormhole into a time machine.\u201d\n-Sara Gates, The Huffington Post", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have all prototypes approved and ready to run as soon as we hit our goal.

The Selectively Social sticker will be approximately 7cm high and the Can't People Today sticker will be approximately 8cm wide.\nEnamel pins:\n- hard enamel\n- dark metal structure \n- rubber clutch\n- exclusively designed backing cards\n- Selectively Social pin: 35mm high\n- Can't People Today pin: 45mm wide\nMy name is Barbara and I am the owner and designer behind Box Monster.

This is my 6th Kickstarter Project, taking design ephemera and re-imagining them as blown-up fine art. My work has been shown across the UK as well as Berlin and Moscow.\nThe ProjectLike my previous five successful projects, Go Pop recognises the striking graphic narrative of the 20th Century and explores the often-overlooked relationship between art and graphic design. The Go Pop! series will bring to life my collection of vintage bottle caps, blown up in size and hand printed to produce a series of high-quality fine art.\n\nThe collection consists of 6 iconic soda brands; Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 7up, Cherry Coke, NEHI and Mello Yello.

That's why I want to change the context in which graphic design is viewed \u2013 by blowing them up into much bigger versions of themselves so that every tiny detail can be admired. From the use of typography to colour and form, design becomes art and begins to create an emotional reaction.\n__\nThe Collection of 500mm x 500mm Fine Art Screenprints\nDesign inspired pop art printsI want more people to value the role design has in our lives and I want more people to have access to affordable, quality art that can inspire and delight them. Refreshing homes into designer pads. To do this each detail of the original bottle cap is meticulously and painstakingly reproduced for print. \nThe result: a blown up bottle cap that captures the mood of an era and the beauty of graphic design. The bottle caps will be screenprinted at 500mm x 500mm, using 8 colours (including metallic inks) to form an exclusive limited edition. Each one printed on the highest quality archival paper, hand signed by the artist (Tom love) alongside the edition number, making sure each one is a collectable and covetable piece of affordable fine art. \n__\n  Styled by The Pink House\n  The Rewards: \n*sizes not to scale\n7 Posters; 1 Giclee, 6 Fine Art Screenprints\nEarlybird offer saves you over \u00a3100!\nThis project can't happen without a community of people who are as passionate about design as I am.

Stamps opened up a new world to me, with these tiny little pieces of paper telling stories from a world I hadn't yet explored. Through bright, colourful illustrations, photographs and typography in languages I'd never seen before, these stamps ignited my passion and love for graphic design, travel and popular culture.\nFrom the humble beginnings of a single stamp book, I've now amassed an eclectic collection of 20th century design from cigarettes packets, stamps and matchbox labels to luggage tags and bottle caps. The beauty and balance of design at such a small, functional scale fascinates me and has led me to my art projects today.\nJoin me on a screenprinting adventure as I bring these fantastic examples of 20th century branding to life and into homes across the world.\n__\nPress\nIf you'd like to feature this project on your blog or news page please click below for the full Press Kit.\nDownloadable Press Kit\nSupport Team\nLara Tuboku-Metzger \nLeo Zoghaib (Videography and photography)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince 2013 I have been designing and printing limited edition screenprints of my personal collection of 20th century branding and packaging design.

I love the hunt and finding cool vintage or nostalgic things, and I know plenty of other people do too.  I also collect enamel pins, and wanted to combine those passions.  \nMy idea is to make a series of enamel pins called Thrift Score!  A celebration of treasures found and collected by so many.  In the first set of hopefully many, I've focused on 3 things that are a staple of any good secondhand treasure hunt, Records, Artwork, and Toys!  \nThe idea of which is that the pin itself is a conversation starter, say you're at a flea market and you're wearing a pin of the Ghostbusters firehouse, and a someone sees it.  Next thing you know they're asking about the pin, and saying, \"You know, I collect and sell vintage toys too! Why don't I show you what I have for sale \"  OR you're wearing a pin with the cover of your \"holy grail\" record that you can't seem to find anywhere, and someone sees it and says, \" Great pin! I actually have that album!\"  Strike up a conversation, maybe make a new collector friend, or maybe even use it to pick up that elusive item you didn't even know they had!\n\nThe 3 pins in the initial series are as follows:\n\nA milkcrate full of records. 1.75 in. in size available in 4 different color crates (50 of each color for 200 pcs total )  Not only do you get this great looking pin, it comes with a free sticker sheet of 8 valuable / collectible albums for you to apply to it, so the world knows what kind of music you're into / looking for.  Plus if you back at the $20.00 level, I'll make you stickers of 5 custom album covers!\nHere's the 4 different colors and the 8 stickers to place on the record sleeve\n\nA thrift store painting with a surprise, in the style of Keane.  Also limited to 200 and 1.75\" tall.  These paintings are a staple of second hand and antique shops, usually of large eyed children holding pets.  But this pin contains a secret!  A paper back that can be cut open / removed to reveal a secret inside!  Maybe you get an original copy of the Declaration of Independance, an early animation cel, an antique comic book, or a stack of cash! Every pin's contents is random.  To my knowledge this is a first of it's kind, and I'm very excited to get these made!   \nHere's the dimensions for the painting, and how the hollow center will work.\nThe special items inside will be mostly paper items, printed and placed inside.  They will be random, but I'll include a sheet of possibilities so you know how rare the one you got is.  They include, a valuable animation cel, a copy of the Declaration of Independance, A valuable old comic book, and probably a few other surprises.  All items will be miniaturized to the scale of the painting and placed inside the hollow of the pin, covered by the brown paper on the back.  \n\n\nAnd the last pin is of The Real Ghostbusters Firehouse Playset, a staple of my childhood and a must have for any vintage toy collector!  This pin is also 1.75\" and limited to 200.\nFirehouse pin, the x's are the areas that will be punched out of the pin.\nThe pins will be manufactured by PinGameStrong.com, I've already priced out the production cost, and the turn around time is roughly 4 weeks from when the order is placed. After that 4 weeks, when I recieve the pins, it would probably take me about a week to get all of the surprises made and placed inside the paintings, and have all the stickers printed and custom ones designed and printed. Then another week to get them shipped out to everyone who pledged. There's always the chance for production delays, but I doubt it would be for more than a week or 2 tops, if any. This is my first kickstarter project, although I have had one pin / sticker manufactured in the past, so I am a little aware of all the steps involved. \nAny pins left over after all the preorders would be sold on my etsy store for varying prices, to be determined, but this is the only time to get all 3 for $25!  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly the only real risk here is the time it takes to be manufactured, There could be a slight delay if something goes wrong, or there's any issues with the production. Also, The hollow in the painting pin may not be up to spec the first time, the pin company says it may be a first of it's kind, so that means anything could happen, and it may add to the production time.

These exclusive badges will only be available from this Kickstarter and if in stock from our trade stand at conventions. We won't be making them available in our online store after this Kickstarter ends!\nNecronomicon Book Badge\nArguably the most damnable document ever penned in the history of humanity, the Necronomicon concerns matters and entities beyond the understanding of sane men. It speaks of elder gods and spaces between reality, of insidious words that can drive men to madness, of lost cities inhabited by creatures that defy the laws of nature, and of a time before time when terrible things walked upon the earth and swam in the sea. It is a book from which a magician might acquire great power, if he is prepared to pay the terrible price.\nUnaussprechlichen Kulten Book Badge\nWritten by Friedrich Wilhelm von Junzt (1795-1840) and published in 1839, the text (also known as the Black Book) details a number of vile cults. Some appear fictional, their existence being placed at a date before the accepted creation of the first civilizations. Others concern more recent, yet no less barbaric cults.\nKing in Yellow Book Badge\nThe King in Yellow is a forbidden play. Its name is well known to actors through hearsay and gossip, yet few have ever seen a copy. Even so, it is greatly feared among thespians. Written in two acts for three characters, Cassilda, Camilla, and the King in Yellow (a malevolent supernatural figure of mysterious origin), merely the act of reading the play can cause madness or despair.\nCultes des Goules Book Badge\nDenounced by the Church on its publication, this text graphically exposes the vile arts of necromancy, necrophagy, and necrophilia practiced by a cult in France.\nCthulhu Cultist Badge\nThe cult of dread Cthulhu has existed since the dawn of mankind and continues to plot the ascension of its master to this day. In order that cultists might recognize each other, they sport pins or tattoos of the abominable Great Old One.\nWe understand that you may wish to get 2,3 or even 4 sets of badges!

These pins combine a black soft enamel with a shining nickel finish to make stylish and subtle accessories to any ensemble. They will be shipped to you on a backing card bearing the Strix Publishing logo, appropriate for gift giving.\nDrawn from Strix Publishing's upcoming art book, APOCRYPHA: The Art of Jason Soles, this set of symbols is the work of talented designer Iphigenia, of Foie Gras. This Kickstarter campaign's graphic design is the work of longtime Strix Publishing contributor, Ed Bourelle, of SkeletonKey Games.\nAll 7 additional pin stretch goals have been unlocked. Thank you!\nIf you would like to back for multiples of a single pin design please send a PM and you'll be given your choice after the campaign ends. \nDifferent monitors may present these mockup pins in differing sizes. Actual production size is 1.5\" x 1.3\"\n  Called \u201cquicksilver\u201d by the ancients, mercury is one of the three primes of alchemy and one of the seven planetary metals. Associated with spirit, mercury represents the transcendence of states. Mercury is both solid and liquid, heaven and earth.\nSulfur is also one of the tria prima, the fundamental aspects of human identity as defined by the alchemist Paracelsus. Sulfur was believed to embody the emotions and desires of humanity, separate from the higher faculties of the spirit. This variant of the sulfur symbol is also known as the Leviathan Cross. \nWhether in terms of practical chymistry or as a metaphorical journey of personal transformation, the ultimate application of alchemy is the transmutation of base materials into gold. Gold represents the perfection of all matter, all states. Mind, spirit, and soul, when refined will become this superlative metal. The symbol for gold is also used in astrology to represent the sun.\nEarth is one of the four Hellenic elements of ancient Greek ghilosophy, one of the founding bodies of knowledge upon which classical alchemy was based. It is associated with concepts of solidity, immovability, and the physical world. Its associations with ancient mystery cults and cthonic deities has also lent it significance in matters of sensuality and death.\nInvert the symbol of earth to use it as the symbol of air. This symbol is linked with the atmosphere and its resultant weather, and is associated with intelligence as one of the Hellenic elements. More recent occult traditions have linked the element of air with elemental entities known as sylphs. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn associates air with the eastern cardinal point in ritual, guarded by the First Watchtower.\nAntimony is an unusual element known to mankind since the most distant times when pre-dynastic Egyptians used it to create kohl eyeliner. To the alchemist, antimony is a cooperative metal, best used in combination with another metal such as lead to produce complex reactions. In alchemical terms it is a protective metal\u2014though scientifically classified as a metalloid\u2014and associated with concepts of adaptability and cooperation. It represents the wisdom and strength gained by the sharing of strength and unique talent. Antimony further represents the balance of animal nature within the human spirit and when worn as a sigil is a potent reminder of inner strength.\nOne of the most abundant elements in the universe, and another of the seven metals of alchemy, iron is associated with concepts of aggression and power. This symbol is also used in astrology to signify the planet Mars. As a sigil, use it to manifest emotions of confidence, physicality, strength, and lust. Iron is the metal most closely associated with the \"human\" state and is therefore anathema to spirits and disincarnate entities.\nArsenic is a notorious metalloid that was utilized in many alchemical processes and today it is a common element used in the production of pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, and many industrial alloys. Traditionally, the alchemists treated arsenic with a wary respect. Despite its toxicity it was a necessary element in many medicinal and magickal cures. Indeed, it is said that a compound of arsenic and sulfur could induce enlightening trances...Wear the symbol of arsenic when you wish to wield the strength of poison and ward off unwanted advances.\nLead is the the prima matera, the primal matter. The basest element, it represents the putrefaction and decay necessary for new life. Alchemy is concerned with the transformation from base to pure and therefore lead is as important to the alchemist as gold. In astrology, the alchemical metal of lead is associated with the god Saturn and therefore concepts of generation, dissolution, plenty, wealth, periodic renewal and liberation. This symbol mimics the scythe of Saturn, and bears a shape in parts derived from the old Hebrew letter Taw, and the ancient Greek Tau.\nThe strix was a flesh eating bird of ill-omen, walking on four taloned legs, and bearing a razor-sharp beak, in the myths of the ancient Greeks. The earliest known tale of the strix is from Metamorphoses in which Polyphonte and her sons Agrios and Oreios were punished for acts of cannibalism. Polyphone was cursed to becom a creature \"that cries by night, without food or drink, with head below and tips of feet above, a harbinger of war and civil strife to men.\" References to the strix are found throughout the surviving works of antiquity through the days of the Roman Empire and survived into the middle ages, where its name became entangled with the Romanian word for vampire, strigoi, and creatures that scream in the night like the Strig\u0103t barn owl.\nAdd-ons\nIf you'd like to order more pins than alloted in the rewards simply click the \u201cmanage your pledge\u201d button on the project page.

These simple human forms have been the basis of much of my work for a few years now.\nI'm often asked what they are, and what they mean to me.\nTo me they are humanity broken down to its most basic form. Ego-less, Race-less, Gender-less, without bias or hatred and live to love each other and the earth.\nEvery aspect of these sculpts are hand made. They are created using a polymer clay, baked, then roto cast by my friend Ewan (Hollow Planet Designs). The finish is very much that of the original model, all bumps and dents included, they are by no means a perfect manufactured toy, on purpose!\nAnother aspect of this campaign is your chance to own one of the previously sold out sculpt No.1.

A limited edition photo book with only 100 printed copies.\nAs part of Kickstarters MAKE/100 project we are limiting our campaign to 100 backers. \nPie and Mash London is a documentary of London\u2019s historic pie and mash tradition. Pie and mash is a traditional London working-class food, originating in London. Pie, mash and eel shops have been in London since the 19th century, and are still common in East and South East London and in many parts of Kent and Essex.\nThe aim of this project is to fund the printing of 100 limited edition A5 landscape books. We will make 100 signed copies available to backers of this kickstarter campaign. When it has been successfully funded we will print an extra 30 unsigned and unnumbered editions and donate them to each of the pie and mash shops as reference copies.\nWhy this? Why now? \nIn 2015 Jake Green and Simon Poon Tip decided to collaborate to produce Pie and Mash a film as part of the 32LDN creative project. During that documentary project Jake took stills at each shop, documenting each exterior. The result is a limited edition collection of photography that serves as a directory of pie and mash shops in London and a printed accompaniment to the film they produced.\nAs life-long inhabitants of London, Simon Poon Tip and Jake Green have witnessed the continued development of the city over the years, something that inspired them to capture this freeze frame in pie and mash history. Since shooting the film between 2014 and 2015, four of the featured pie and mash shops have closed down. They have been included in this printed edition as a reference to the changing face of London\u2019s pie and mash culture. \nA mock-up of the letter pressed cover\nThis limited edition photobook designed by the Bread Collective will have an editorial contribution from John Rogers and hand printed letter press editions by Russell Frost of Hooksmith Press.\nThe book itself will be digitally printed and saddle stitched by Park Communications with a GF Smith cover in Lockwood Green Colourplan and a title hand letterpressed in black ink on the cover. \nA mock-up of the gold foiled cover\nThe book will consist of 40 pages including 30 B+W images of the exterior of every single remaining pie and mash shop in London.\nJohn Rogers is a writer, film-maker and author of This Other London - Adventures in the Overlooked City.\nBread Collective are an award-winning design collective based in East London.\nRussell Frost is a letterpress artist running Hooksmith Press, a small letter press shop based in East London.\nJake Green is freelance photographer based in London, author of The Bookmaker\u2019s Studio\nSimon Poon Tip is a D&AD and BRIT award winning creative producer.\n32LDN is a project directed by Simon Poon Tip that aims to collectively build a picture of today's London, through the participation of people from all walks of life.\nWe would also like to thank www.pie-n-mash.com a great resource for us while we were planning our documentary.\nTower Bridge pie and mash shop.

I can confirm that the pins are in and ready to go and they look great - I can't wait for you all to get your hands on them!\nMy apologies for the holdup with shipping. It has been the posters that have caused the delay. After a string of misunderstandings, miscommunication and less-than-perfect prints, we are now going ahead with our third printer - the superb Hato Press in London. Full disclosure: I had initially been very keen to use Work Horse Press here in Edinburgh, but we had difficulties with scheduling. We then went ahead with Risotto in Glasgow but unfortunately their prints were just not up to the standard I wanted and that you should all expect. Hato Press are arguably the best Risograph printers in the UK and I'm confident that these new posters will be awesome."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Production!", "update_content": "Hey backers!\nThere has been little in the way of updates as I've been patiently waiting for the Kickstarter funds to transfer over but today I can confirm that production will start imminently on the badges and we're still on track to ship them out in March!\nThanks again and watch this space!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "6 hours to go!", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nWith just 6 hours to go, I find myself overwhelmed by the success of the campaign!
